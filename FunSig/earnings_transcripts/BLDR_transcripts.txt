===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders Resource. Please go ahead.
Heather Kos: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2025 earnings call. With me on the call are Peter Jackson, our CEO; and Pete Beckmann, our CFO. The earnings press release and presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to the presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. Given the current environment, I'm proud of our resilient results for the first quarter, which reflect the strength of our differentiated product portfolio and our continued focus on driving operational excellence. While macro and industry dynamics continue to be unsettled, we remain confident in our ability to navigate any challenges. We are a cycle-tested team that has withstood economic uncertainty in the past. We will execute again by staying rooted in our strategy and focusing on the factors within our control. During these uncertain times, our role as a trusted partner is vital as we help our customers address affordability challenges and increase efficiency. We are focused on the near term while laying the groundwork for future growth. As the market recovers, I'm confident we will outperform. As shown on Slide 3, our strategy remains consistent. We are focused on organic growth, operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation. We are committed to advancing our strong foundation and driving value creation for our customers through investments in innovation. Our significant investments in value-added products, digital tools and internal systems are cementing our leading industry position. Let's turn now to our first quarter performance on Slide 4. Our team's ability to drive resilient results, despite external headwinds, reflects our focus on execution, operational rigor and customer success. Pete will expand on our results more later in the presentation. On Slide 5, we highlight key areas where we've been executing our strategy. In the first quarter, we invested $23 million in our value-added facilities to prepare for future demand in key markets. This included opening one new millwork location, expanding another millwork plant and upgrading a truss facility. Adoption rates for our industry-leading BFS digital tools are steadily climbing each week and we are garnering consistent positive feedback from our growing customer base. I'm pleased that we realized $19 million in incremental digital sales for the quarter, bringing our total to $153 million since launch despite the challenging environment that has persisted for our target customers. We achieved $17 million in productivity savings in Q1 and primarily through targeted supply chain initiatives, more efficient truss manufacturing and fleet management. We are focused on optimizing processes, leveraging technology and improving supplier relationships to enhance efficiency. We remain disciplined stewards of discretionary spending, and we are continuing to maximize operational flexibility. We increased our service levels to our customers with an on-time and in-full delivery rate of 92%. Single-family starts remain soft, as builders manage the pace of construction amid affordability challenges, inventory buildup and increased economic uncertainty. As we expected and communicated previously, multifamily also remains a headwind compared to 2024. In response to lower volumes over the last year, we have taken steps to align capacity across our facilities, manage headcount and control expenses. This continues to be an attractive and profitable business for us. Turning to single family, builders continue to employ specs, smaller and simpler homes and interest rate buydowns to help buyers find affordable options. Our comprehensive product portfolio enables builders to optimize their costs while maintaining quality. And we continue to supply more lower-cost offerings in products like engineered wood, windows and doors. We are standing alongside our customers to battle affordability challenges and grow with them through the investment in our people, technology and innovation. While critical for the long-term health of the industry, these actions mean less near-term sales and gross profit dollars for BFS. Ultimately, this positions our company to accelerate when starts increase and current headwinds begin to subside. Turning to M&A on Slide 6. We remain focused on pursuing high-return opportunities that expand our value-added product offerings and advance our leadership position in desirable geographies. Over the years, we have developed substantial and proven muscle memory to grow through M&A and have a track record of successful integration. In the first quarter, we completed two acquisitions with aggregate prior year sales of roughly $565 million. As a reminder, in early January, we acquired Alpine Lumber, the largest independently operated supplier of building materials and value-added products in Colorado and Northern New Mexico. In February, we acquired O.C. Cluss, a leading supplier of lumber, building materials and installation services with locations in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia. In addition, we acquired Truckee Tahoe Lumber in early April after quarter end. Truckee Tahoe has built a reputation of excellence as a leading supplier of lumber and building materials in the Northern California and Nevada markets. We are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. Our industry remains highly fragmented. And despite a slowing M&A environment, we are confident that our M&A capabilities will remain an important catalyst for our long-term growth. Turning to Slide 7. Our disciplined capital allocation strategy focuses on maximizing shareholder returns through organic growth, inorganic growth and share repurchases. In the first quarter, we deployed over $900 million towards investing in the business, acquisitions and share repurchases. Now let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss the latest updates on our digital strategy. With our BFS digital tools, we are focused on creating value for our homebuilder customers and in doing so, further extending our industry leadership position and driving substantial organic growth. Despite the challenging market, we have seen continued adoption and growth with our target audience of smaller builders. Our sales team continues to increase digital tool usage, which will further drive customer adoption. Since launch in early 2024, we have seen more than $1.5 billion of orders placed through our BFS digital tools, of which $153 million were incremental sales from existing and new customers. We're pleased with our progress to date and expect an additional $200 million of incremental sales in 2025, bringing our total to $334 million at the end of the year. I'm incredibly grateful to lead such a talented and hard-working team that makes a difference every day. One great example is Delmar Littleview in Oklahoma City, who has been with BFS for more than 20 years. Delmar excels as a trusted partner to our customers who have relied on him both as a driver and now as a dispatcher to ensure that deliveries are accurate and on time. As a dispatcher, he has helped keep his location ranked among the best in the company for dispatch and delivery management efficiency. Beyond his technical skills, Delmar is a mentor to our drivers. The experience in the field allows them to guide them not just on routes and best practices, including safety, but also on ways to provide value to our customers. His leadership and calm demeanor help keep our team running efficiently, even on the most challenging days. I'm proud of Delmar and our countless other dedicated team members who continually raise the bar and service to our customers and each other. I'll now turn the call over to Pete to discuss our financial results in greater detail.
Pete Beckmann: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results were driven by our durable business model and unwavering commitment to executing our strategy. We have a proven track record of generating strong free cash flow through the cycle and deploying capital in a disciplined manner, in line with our capital allocation priorities. Our scale, differentiated platform and talented team members give us confidence that we will continue to compound value now and into the future. Let's begin by reviewing our first quarter performance on Slides 9 through 11. Net sales decreased 6% to $3.7 billion, driven by lower organic sales, one fewer selling day and commodity deflation, partially offset by growth from acquisitions. Although we expect higher commodity prices for the full year, we experienced commodity deflation in Q1 given the prior year spike in OSC prices. The core organic sales decrease was driven by a 33% decline in multifamily with muted activity levels against stronger prior year comps. Additionally, single-family declined 6%, attributable to lower starts activity, value per start and weather, while repair and remodel increased 4%, driven by strength in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions. As we have shared on recent calls, there are a few main variables reconciling single-family starts to work for organic sales. First, the value of the average home has fallen as size and complexity have decreased. Second, we have seen ongoing margin pressure as starts remain below normal. Third, extreme weather in the Southeast and California impacted the quarter by approximately $80 million in long-term deferrals. Although macro headwinds persist and there are fewer sales dollars available per start today, we are the market leader in building products and continue to be a trusted partner to our customers that start to remain below normal levels. For the first quarter, gross profit was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 14% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 30.5%, down 290 basis points primarily driven by single and multifamily margin normalization as well as a below normal starts environment. Adjusted SG&A of $771 million decreased $9 million, primarily attributable to lower variable compensation due to lower core organic net sales, partially offset by acquired operations. On an annual basis, adjusted SG&A is approximately 30% fixed and 70% variable with volumes, enabling flexibility during challenging periods. As Peter mentioned, we are investing in technology with a look toward the future despite ongoing headwinds. One big component of this is moving to a single, modern, ERP platform. Our ERP investment is projected to incur approximately $140 million this year. This positions us to drive innovation, enhance efficiency and support our long-term growth objectives. We are focused on carefully managing our SG&A and are well positioned to leverage our fixed costs as the market grows. Adjusted EBITDA was $369 million, down 32%, primarily driven by lower gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.1%, down 380 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit margins and reduced operating leverage. Adjusted EPS was $1.51, a decrease of 43% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases, enabled by our strong free cash flow generation, added roughly $0.11 per share for the first quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12. Our first quarter operating cash flow was $132 million, a decrease of $185 million mainly attributable to lower net income. We generated free cash flow of $45 million. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow yield was 9%. Operating cash flow return on invested capital was 19%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 2 times. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was $1.1 billion consisting of $944 million in net borrowing availability under the ABL and $115 million in cash. Moving to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $87 million in the first quarter. We deployed $828 million on two acquisitions. In Q1, we repurchased roughly 100,000 shares for $13 million. Additionally, in April, we repurchased 3.3 million shares for $391 million. As we announced this morning, our Board has authorized a $500 million share repurchase program inclusive of the $100 million remaining on the prior $1 billion authorization. This reflects our commitment to returning capital to shareholders while maintaining flexibility for strategic investments. With our current leverage ratio at approximately 2 times, we remain mindful of maintaining a leverage ratio of roughly 1 to 2 times at year-end. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to maximize returns. On Slide 13, we show our 2025 outlook. For full year 2025, our forecast assumes a down mid-single-digit single-family market and continued weakness in multifamily. As a result, we are guiding net sales in the range of $16.05 billion to $17.05 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be in the range of 10.6% to 12.3%. In a lower starts environment, we expect our 2025 full year gross margin to be in a range of 29% to 31%. We expect free cash flow of $800 million to $1.2 billion. The change from the prior guidance is primarily due to a lower working capital assumption based on our lower sales outlook for the year. As we have stated previously, imports accounted for approximately 15% of our total raw material spend in 2024, comprised of roughly 11% commodities and 4% non-commodities. Given what we know today, we estimate a tariff cost impact of $175 million to $250 million annually. This impact reflects the products we import as well as potential U.S. supplier impacts. This range also assumes USMCA tariff exemptions on Canadian lumber. 2025 guidance assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $440 per thousand board foot, an increase of $15 at the midpoint. Note that this is our best current estimate and subject to change. Our guide does not reflect potential tariff and duty impacts. Please refer to our earnings release and presentation for a list of key 2025 assumptions. Additionally, we want to provide color for Q2 given ongoing macro volatility. We expect Q2 net sales to be between $4.1 billion and $4.4 billion. Q2 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $475 million and $525 million. In closing, I am confident in our ability to drive long-term growth by executing our strategy, leveraging our exceptional platform and maintaining financial flexibility. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Peter for some final thoughts.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Pete. Let me close by reiterating that we remain focused on controlling the controllables. Our resilient business model enables us to win in any environment, given our scale, breadth of product offerings and our disciplined investments in technology. I'm confident in the long-term strength of our industry due to the significant housing underbuild across our core markets. We are well positioned to capitalize on this, driving growth for years to come as we execute our strategy. We continue to deepen our value proposition as a key partner to our customers by helping them solve problems through our investments in value-added products, digital tools and install services. Our proven growth playbook, fortress balance sheet and robust free cash flow generation through the cycle will help us continue to compound long-term shareholder value. In the meantime, we are closely monitoring the current environment and remain agile to mitigate downside risks in the near term while also investing strategically for the future. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Matthew Bouley: Hi good morning everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. So the question is on market share. If I look at single-family housing starts in Q1, they were down 6%. Your single-family was down 6% even with presumably still being impacted by less dollar content per home. So -- however, you look at it, it is a really notable change in terms of your growth versus the market from 2024. And what I'm getting at, of course, your thoughts on share, how your views on share have evolved over the past year? And in this declining market, are you actually looking to increase your market share going forward or simply maintain your share in this type of market? Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Hey Matt, good morning. Thank you for the question. So I will consistently say we are always trying to increase our share, no matter what the market is. I think the dynamic over the past year, we talked about a little bit, this below normal starts environment has changed some patterns of behavior, and we have had to fight the fight. So being in the market each day, acting and reacting to competitive dynamics, partnering with customers and some of the strategic things they're trying to do, adapting to the affordability challenges in the marketplace, it's all part of what we do every day. I think the team is doing a fantastic job. Ebbs and flows every quarter. And I think what you're seeing here is the hard work, the kind of the culmination of the hard work over the last year, the team to lean back in and drive behaviors at the local market level that allow us to continue to be consistent and competitive. We've done the right things to invest. Our cost positions are very good. We continue to run the operations very efficiently and focused on our customers. And I think that's why you're seeing the performance. We're going to continue to strive for it over time.
Matthew Bouley: Okay. Got it. And then -- so that, of course, then leads to the gross margin question. If we're in this kind of market that requires a balance between share versus margin and your gross margin guide now does have 29% at the low end for this year. It begs the question of sort of where you are willing to go on the gross margin? Is there a level on that margin at which you would prioritize the margin again? Or should we be looking for share to kind of be the dominant strategy? So kind of where would you be willing to go on that gross margin in this type of market? Thank you.
Pete Beckmann: Matt, this is Pete. What I would say is our margins are still very strong. We're pleased with the performance. We are anticipating margins to drift lower through the year. Some of that is due to the margin normalization that we're experiencing with the multifamily as well as the single-family side. But as this market continues to present additional challenges, being below normal levels, now gone down about 5%, I think you're going to see continued competitive pressure, and we have to make that call every day on how to balance share versus margin. And as Peter mentioned, that's just part of running the business every day. And we know that we need to be in the game in order to continue to win and position ourselves to bundle the products where we're going to be more competitive.
Peter Jackson: And I think we are overall very pleased with the performance of margins. It's been a bit of a discovery process post the whole COVID push as to where normal is. We tried to talk about that with everybody. Hopefully, that's come through is an attempt to be transparent. What I think we're seeing now is a lot of that normalization is done. Now it's just hand-to-hand combat in given markets with specific competitors. So that dynamic is where our advantaged position from a cost perspective, from a coverage perspective, allows us to have superior margins than the competition. Our pricing discipline and knowing exactly where we stand and what we're doing in each individual decision is a powerful advantage to some of our competitors. So we'll continue to balance it. It has to be a balance. You can't walk away from the table. But the reality is our continued success has led to that bundling ability. Our customers do see the value of the combined offering that we have in our product portfolio. The benefits of value-add have been very sticky even when there's some uncertainty and challenges in the market. And we still continue to sell to a wide variety of customers, both ups and downs in various markets. So we feel good, but no question, it's a time pressure, and we're happy to be smart about it.
Matthew Bouley: Got it. Well I appreciate the thoughts. Good luck guys. Thanks again.
Peter Jackson: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Michael Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just, I guess, to pick up on the gross margin dynamic. Can you just put a finer point on what drift lower through the year means you're starting at 30.5%, presumably, there's still some near-term pressure doing where you've guided 2Q. Just how -- just help us ballpark, what the 2Q gross margin is and then drift lower through the year? I guess, are you expecting sequential declines each quarter from here?
Pete Beckmann: Yes, thanks, Mike. So when we look at our results, excluding the multifamily, we really see margins flattening out for and slightly down if we continue to see a below normal source environment. So that's kind of what we've baked in. From a multifamily standpoint, we continue to have a little bit of that normalization. I think we're in our last leg of that. But when we look year-over-year, it's a much bigger step down. So it has an impact as we look at the overall year-to-year. So I would say we're getting pretty close to flat. Our competitive advantages with what we've invested in our manufacturing continues to support our margins with our value-added products and we're very confident in our ability to deliver higher margins.
Michael Dahl: Okay, thanks. That's helpful, Pete. The -- I guess the second question is capital allocation. Look, this has been a hallmark of the company for a number of years in terms of the ability to aggressively deploy capital both on M&A and buybacks. We're reaching a point here where given the compression we're seeing in the EBITDA and cash flow and some of what you've already deployed on the acquisitions and now this big buyback in 2Q, your pro forma leverage does look to be a couple of ticks higher than your 2x range in an uncertain environment. So how are you thinking about balancing that? I mean, as much as we like to see the buybacks, that's a pretty big number to lean into and in the quarter given what's transpiring. Just maybe a little more elaboration on how you plan to balance all of this in the coming quarters.
Pete Beckmann: Yes. Great question, Mike. So our capital allocation priorities remain the same. We are going to focus on protecting our balance sheet, making sure that we're investing in the core. The next priorities of M&A and stock buyback, we will have to continue to evaluate as we move forward, so that we're committed -- staying to our commitment of managing to a 1 to 2x leverage by year-end.
Peter Jackson: Yes, the other thing I would add. We have been very disciplined and thoughtful about building out our balance sheet, making sure our tenures, our rates, our liquidity position, all remains very strong. So none of that has really changed. All that's really evolved here is that we've seen a pullback in the EBITDA number for the basis of the math. And what I would say is we're targeting a year-end 1 to 2 times. It's always been the sort of the theme because of our seasonal borrowing fluctuations. It's pretty normal for us to have some changes across the year. And I think we're still in a position to be able to deploy capital in a very intelligent way to position the business for growth over time at the current level. And as each year passes, we'll have more opportunities. As we return to growth, we'll have more opportunities. So I think fair. I think your observations are on point, but it's a point in time.
Michael Dahl: Got it. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Charles Perron-Piche with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Charles Perron-Piche: Thank you, good morning everyone. First, I want to talk a bit about the commodity backdrop. Lumber prices have been trading higher through the spring and you obviously revise your guidance higher to reflect that. But can you talk about how you expect this to flow through your commodity inflation expectations for 2025? And how are those higher lumber prices impacting the mix of value-add? Are you seeing specifically increased elasticity of demand as builders are facing growing margin pressures?
Pete Beckmann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Charles. So with commodities, we are seeing the impact of the year-to-date higher prices on lumber. But as a reminder, and I don't know if we've shared this with you specifically, both when we look at our commodity prices, it's 70% weighted to the lumber composite and 30% weighted to the OSB composite. So that's kind of the blend of what we see going into a normal home size. So with that, with OSB being super depressed, especially to where it was a year ago, we're seeing that pull the number overall down, but we are seeing the lumber composite year-over-year higher. So what we see for the balance of the year is kind of holding at this level, if not even drifting down a little bit as people digest some of the initial reaction to tariff concerns. And that's going to continue to benefit modestly in our results through the balance of the year as we pass that through. With respect to the value-added products, it is a portion of the truss and the wall panels that we produce and that will change the cost basis as we continue to design and engineer optimize those truss plants.
Peter Jackson: I think your point is right on, though, anything that grows commodities as a percentage will, by mathematical equation, reduce value-add as a percentage of total mix, but it's fairly modest overall. And to clarify a point, so lumber out of Canada is covered under USMCA for tariff reasons, meaning no tariff impact on what we've been up to lately, but the traditional duty regime is still in place. So there is expected to be an update to that duty regime later on this year that for the time being, looks to be fairly substantial. The reality is, by the time it gets implemented, it will be kind of into the fourth quarter really before we start to see it hit. And as you know, fourth quarter is a fairly small quarter for us overall. So some development, we think will play out although I'll be quite candid and tell you that given the amount of uncertainty around tariffs and duties in general, I wouldn't necessarily deposit that check on anything yet.
Charles Perron-Piche: Got it. That's a very helpful color. And second, you talked about the progress of digital initiatives in your prepared remarks. I think that adding $90 million this quarter when you consider software housing backdrop, what factors lead your confidence to reaching that $200 million target in 2025? I think you mentioned last quarter you were adjusting your go-to-market strategy for those. How are you progressing against that?
Peter Jackson: Yes. No, that's a great question. So the reality is the tools are being really well received. The customers that are engaging with them and using them like them a lot. They find it valuable in terms of their pace of build, their ability to understand the components, the ability to adapt to what they want to do on the ground more quickly, the interfaces, I think, are more seamless, more modern than anything that the industry has seen before. So the adoption has been good. I think our internal rollout is a lot more about training, dialing in some of the features and functions of the tool internally and getting things re-platformed to be able to, I would say, accelerate the adoption by the customer. Now the one thing I will point out that came through, hopefully, in the materials is that our initial target audience for this tool is the smaller builders. So production build is between 50 and 2,000 homes a year, until we get the tool really dialed in the way we want it. And that is a customer category that has been under a lot of pressure. I would say comparative to last year, they're pretty stable, pretty good, maybe even up a little. Some other customer categories or maybe down a bit versus last year, but that gives us confidence that we're on the right track, both the momentum we've seen in the initial reset internally as well as customer adoption and overall customer health. I think those are the sort of the three reasons we remain confident that digital is on the right track and going in the right direction.
Charles Perron-Piche: Okay, thanks for the color guys. And good luck.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with UBS. Please go ahead.
John Lovallo: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions as well. The first one is kind of working off of Matt's question at the onset here in terms of the competition. I mean, really, what does the competition look like today? And what I'm getting at is if you're expecting gross margins, call it, 29% to 31%, and your competitors, some of the smaller ones have higher cost, new capacity, I have to imagine that they're running closer to breakeven. I mean how sustainable is some of this newer competition that's come into the market?
Peter Jackson: That is a fantastic question. It's an ongoing debate. I would tell you, based on some of the behaviors that we've seen, the lowest of the low is not sustainable, and they're regretting some of the decisions they've made rightfully so. I think builders to their credit are trying to get the lowest cost possible, which I respect, right, it is business. The counterpoint to that is they need actual partners to do what they do. This is our role in the industry. We need to be able to provide products to the job site. In order to do that, we need to have a sustainable business. There are certain players in this space that I think are trying to play the short game, right? This is a space that's been known to try and grow quick and flip the business so that they could make a few bucks. If you're a builder, particularly a big builder, that has got to be tempting, but also long term, I think, very detrimental. Because they're reliant on a stable industry, an industry that's focused on the future, becoming more efficient, leveraging technology, being able to provide the best quality, most efficient tools for builders to be able to build homes, and that's us. And there's a cost associated with it. That's the trick, right? They -- like any good customer, they want everything and they want it nearly free. There's a balance that needs to play out in the market. There are some players that have historically made lower single-digit margins and have been comfortable there, but they're unwilling and frankly, unable to invest in the type of future for this industry that I think we all deserve as Americans. And so my challenge to them, to my competitors is get better, do better for this industry because we deserve it. And we're going to walk the talk. We're going to continue to invest. We're going to make this a business that's able to support the biggest, the best, the fastest, the most innovative homebuilders in this country. We're going to help solve problems. So is there a balance there on margins? Is there a fight that needs to be had, yes, there is, right? And we're going to stay in the fight. But I think in the long run, we're going to win this, and we're going to make our business, our industry, our country better because of it.
John Lovallo: Yes. That makes a lot of sense to me. Okay. And then next question is on the productivity savings, $17 million in the quarter, targeting $70 million to $90 million for the full year. Curious how you kind of view the cadence of the remainder of those savings? And what sort of actions are you taking to drive those savings through the year?
Peter Jackson: So I'll let Pete talk to the cadence, but productivity for us is very core to who we are and what we do. Our expectation is every quarter, every day; really, our employees are looking for ways to get a little bit better. One-step better, one-step in the right direction, and that incremental progress as a team has had tremendous cumulative value for us as an organization. We're better, we're more profitable. We're faster. Candidly, the jobs are more fun because we take some of the garbage work out. So I think that's something that we have gotten comfortable with in this organization, and we're very good at as an organization. That's what you're seeing in terms of our performance. We do a little bit of pullback because of the diversion that some of our ERP work is requiring. We've got to be able to put hours in some of our best people to make sure that ramp-up goes well but the numbers in general continue to be a core part of what we do and are delivering that is critical to our long-term success. Pete?
Pete Beckmann: Yes, and as Peter said, from a -- the way that it's going to roll in, we've been delivering productivity for several years now, and it's not something that just starts and stops. It's a constant, and we're seeing that productivity that will roll in throughout the course of the year. I would say ratably, and it's kind of generally in that kind of linear line. However, with the ERP rollout that we're expecting toward the back half of the year, we may see some of that impact that Peter mentioned in the back half, but right now, we're expecting more of a ratable realization of it.
John Lovallo: Great. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Rafe Jadrosich: Hi, good morning. It's Rafe. Thanks for taking the questions. First, when you look at the full year guidance, it implies second half growth over the first half, which is a little bit stronger than what you've done sort of historically. Can you just talk about some of the assumptions, specifically around like content per house, market share or multifamily mix in terms of what's driving the stronger second half sequentially versus the first half?
Pete Beckmann: Rafe, I'll take the first pass at this. What we're seeing in the full year is more of a seasonal -- a normal seasonal year, where the first quarter is really the lowest quarter of the year, fourth quarter is kind of the second lowest, but the peak in the build through Q2 and really in Q3. The other factors that we're looking at with multifamily, multifamily is really stabilizing that we're seeing in 2025. So we don't have the same downward headwind or trajectory in the back part. So it may look like it's stronger but it's actually holding the line more, and we're just realizing that seasonal benefit. We're also generating growth from our acquisitions that we've completed. So all the ones we completed last year and early this year that we're going to benefit in the back half of the year that we didn't have a year ago.
Rafe Jadrosich: That's helpful. And then just following up on some of the changing patterns and behavior in the market. Can you -- is that more on the commodity side or manufactured products? And is that -- are you seeing that broad-based across the country? Or are there specific markets where you're seeing more pressure than others?
Peter Jackson: Well, there's no question there's pressure across the board, right? I mean this is an affordability focused environment. You're getting a deep dive on everything. What I would say though is and I think maybe we've talked about this in prior quarters is, we've seen an evolution in a progression of how builders have looked at the various categories. Commodity is easiest, commodity is first, so commodity got attacked, I would say, the first. As you look at other categories, it's more complex. There are more pieces to be considered. The consequences are potentially more impactful. So it's been a little slower in terms of the review and the focused work. There's no question that there's some regional differentiation between profitability and the pressure. Some areas of the country, very high utilization, lots of competition, lots of capacity, reacts very different than a smaller environment where maybe you're the only game in town. So all of them seeing pressure, but different levels of pressure depending on where you are and what the competitive environment looks like.
Rafe Jadrosich: Thank you, it’s helpful.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Keith Hughes: Thank you. Question's on your value-added products. Could you talk about in terms of the reported numbers, how much of that is units and how much is price pressure in the work?
Pete Beckmann: Good morning, Keith. I don't think we provide that level of information. But what I can tell you in the decline in the manufactured products. Just a reminder, in the multifamily space, we're much more heavily weighted toward the value-added products. So I think previously, we're about 75% to the value-add. What we're seeing in the declines, as we've indicated year-over-year, was a big headwind as we lapped that multifamily normalization. And our truss decline within the multifamily was down about 46%. So more than the 32 multifamily down that we communicated, so that's given you a disproportionate decline in that manufactured products. And there will be price and units included in the, price and units in there.
Keith Hughes: And do you -- and just based on your multifamily comments, you in this guide, you're anticipating that number to start flattening out that third quarter?
Pete Beckmann: Really, we're starting to see it flatten out now. What we're -- year-over-year, we'll start to get to parity by probably around closer to the fourth quarter because there's still a headwind that we're lapping from the prior year.
Keith Hughes: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms: Hi, good morning, Peter and Pete. So I know you guys -- first off, you mentioned your capital allocation priorities haven't changed. But I guess kind of going back to that question, where does the appetite stand for additional acquisitions at this point? Or maybe asked another way, at what point do you start to take the foot off the accelerator as far as with M&A and buybacks, things of that nature?
Peter Jackson: Well, I mean, it's interesting because a piece of this is completely outside of our control and is dependent on the sort of the personality and the mood of the market. I will start by saying that the mood to the market has cooled significantly. I would say a year ago, there were a lot of deals out there, a lot of folks talking. As I see it today, I think uncertainty more broadly has contributed to a lot of uncertainty in the M&A space. So I'll start with that. The other is to say there's been a theme, and I think we've been pretty clear about it to say for the right deal in the right market for the right product categories, we would do something special but those are pretty rare. They're pretty few and far between. So I don't want to come out and say never, but at this stage of the game, I would say it seems pretty unlikely that there's anything big going to happen anytime soon. But we continue to look. Our M&A team is, I would argue, a finely tuned weapon, and we are not shy about using it when it makes sense for shareholders in that long-term strategic lens.
Trey Grooms: Okay. And then maybe kind of sticking with the same theme of -- if things continue to kind of hang around here or maybe even slow a little more than expected, when you think about your footprint, your branch network, are there -- how do you see the opportunity? Or is there any opportunity if the time comes when it's needed to streamline any of those -- the footprints in any certain markets or do you feel like you're kind of at a critical place right now with your branches and the footprint you have, where you're happy with that over kind of any situation really that is feasible in the near term?
Peter Jackson: Yes, that's a great question. The short answer is we're already doing it. We are a very disciplined organization when it comes to the variable cost and the way that we manage capacity into the market that we play in. Every market across the country has their operating metrics that they use to govern how they run their business. We look at every location and every market from a profitability perspective. So we're very disciplined about continuing to, I would say, maintain the right operating hygiene, managing capacity. Over the last year, we've closed 17, 20 locations. That dynamic is something that we will continue to manage to ensure that we've got the right footprint, putting our best people in the best locations. That's all part of what we do. We just don't really talk about it externally very much. The other piece that I would mention and I know you've seen this, Trey, is the downturn playbook is certainly available for us if we need it, and we use it on a market level in terms of responding to the dynamics at play.
Trey Grooms: Yes, got it. Okay, thank you very much for that. And its helpful. I’ll pass on.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Philip Ng: Hey guys, thanks for all the great color. I guess, implicit in your guide, you're calling for a second half earnings ramp and Peter, it sounds like it's more seasonal in recent deals? Or does your guide actually assume some second half pickup in activity, perhaps maybe the production builders are kind of easing some of that destock as we kind of look out to the back half? Kind of give us a little more context what you're kind of assuming for the back half.
Pete Beckmann: Got it. I was just going to say it's definitely not an assumed ramp and trying to use the word seasonality, is we definitely have footprint across certain geographies that the spring summer selling season are the peaks when you're looking across Alaska and the Northern Hemisphere, the Lower 48. So it's disproportionate in that way for those markets, and we're seeing healthy activity currently, and we're expecting that to continue on a normal seasonal basis.
Peter Jackson: Yes, just to confirm that, right? It's mostly what you said. It's mostly M&A and the comps from a percentage perspective, the daily sales number in the core business is a gentle seasonal curve like you'd expect, but not expecting a recovery in the broader market or from key customers or any of that.
Philip Ng: Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate that. And then your larger -- some of the larger public builders have talked about, one, they haven't seen inflation from tariffs yet and perhaps not even anticipate much over the course of the year, and you called out, call it, $175 million to $200 million potential impact from tariffs. Just want to get your thoughts and your ability to kind of pass it through because implicit your gross margin guidance, I think you're assuming it to kind of hold relatively steady from 1Q levels? Maybe it dipped down a little bit, but still pretty healthy. So just kind of give us some context there.
Pete Beckmann: Yes. It's going to be an interesting environment as those tariffs continue to make their way into the inventories and as we need to supply to our customers. Our intent is to pass it through, but we will work with our customer partners. We were going to continue to figure out the right approach and dealing with affordability challenges as the tariffs are coming through, but the expectation is that, that's a cost that's increased and it will need to go through.
Peter Jackson: A lot of this is going to be passed through and focused in key categories, right? I mean China is the big player. We don't actually import, virtually anything from China ourselves. A lot of this is stuff that we buy and then we have to sell. So there's a limited opportunity for us to participate for the most part. The real question is how does the market respond. Are there substitutions? Is it a logical progression in terms of movement over time? Does it happen all at once? How much is done on the ground at a time? Where does the tariff get negotiated to? So everybody wants to know the answer to the questions. We've tried to take a pass at it. I'll put my hand up and tell you this is our best guess and the actual fall-through impact of this is an even bigger yet.
Philip Ng: And when does that actually hit your P&L because there's an inventory balance dynamic?
Peter Jackson: Yes, exactly. It's -- this number is a full year estimated impact so whenever it starts hitting, you'll get to pro rata share of it. Even based on today, you're talking about a delay based on what is already on the ground. I don't think any of us actually understand. There have been a few announcements from certain players but I mean, you saw the GDP numbers. There was a ton of inventory that came in or the people are trying to prepare for this. So when it actually hits the ground, I don't think any of us really know.
Philip Ng: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Collin Verron with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Collin Verron: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a point of clarity on the tariffs there. Does the guide or the debt tariff impacts assume any tariff mitigation in it? Or is that just the cost number flowing through 100%?
Pete Beckmann: So in our guide, we did not bake in any impact from the tariffs. We put that estimate together to kind of give an indication of size or impact that it would have and that, as Peter was mentioning, includes the stuff we're importing directly, which is very little, and some of the impact from our suppliers that they're going to ultimately be impacted by tariffs based on how they're sourcing products. So it is a big estimate at this time, and we just -- we don't know what the true impact, so it is not built into the guidance.
Peter Jackson: So I'm going to call them over the top and say two things on that. One, we don't lose money on stuff that we sell. And two, there is absolutely going to be an impact of some degree but if you look at the band of our guidance, the dollar amount of the tariff impact, we are not talking about a change outside of our guidance. The question is how do you dial it in. Man, if I had a crystal ball, I would promise to tell you the right number, but this is our attempt to provide guidance in the face of what we consider to be massive uncertain. So I don't know if that helps you or not.
Collin Verron: That's very helpful color. All right. And then I guess just on the windows, doors & millwork pricing headwind that you guys called out. I know you guys don't usually break it out, but any sense of just sort of what the magnitude is that you guys are dealing with from price -- from vendor price cuts? And just how you're thinking about sort of that as a top line headwind through the rest of 2025?
Peter Jackson: Yes. If we said under price cuts, it was unintentional. I think that the environment is stable to inflationary, but in particular, based on the tariffs, yes.
Collin Verron: [Indiscernible] thank you for the color.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ketan Mamtora: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I'm curious, as you think about your 2025 guidance, can you sort of just at a high level, maybe two or three key buckets where you are sort of seeing incrementally more challenges than kind of what you had when you put out your prior guidance. Clearly, it looks like single-family housing starts, you've taken that down, but two or three sort of key big buckets would be helpful.
Peter Jackson: All right. So I'll just give you the high level. Starts are down. Single-family starts are down. Monties are up a little to offset it, and the margin pressure on single-family is a little tighter than we thought, not a lot, but a little. And part of it is because single-family starts are down. So there's a correlation. Puts and takes on other things, but those are the big drivers.
Ketan Mamtora: Got it. No, that's helpful. So fair to say that the multifamily piece that you had previously talked about, like, call it, $175 million, $200 million EBITDA impact, that's sort of still in line with how you guys were expecting?
Pete Beckmann: It is.
Peter Jackson: Yes, directionally. And we're lapping most of it, 80% of what we're going to see in terms of the downturn is going to happen in the first half. There will be a tail on some little stuff still fading, but it's largely stable and largely what we anticipated coming into the year.
Ketan Mamtora: Understood. That’s helpful. I’ll jump back in the queue. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Adam Baumgarten: Hey good morning guys. Can you talk about the trends you're seeing in the installation business? Has that been kind of trending in line with overall results or maybe outperforming a bit? Just curious what you're seeing there.
Peter Jackson: Yes, it's been good. The multifamily is a headwind against us. So that's broader macro. But install itself, I think it's something that builders continue to be attracted to ease of doing business, efficiency, being able to manage labor the labor market has eased up a little bit. I think you really can see that in the headlines. Still some question marks around what's going to happen with immigration, I don't think we're quite through that yet. But in general, the way we manage it, that we feel really good about our ability to be successful in that environment, and we think customers are continuing to adopt it and like it as an alternative.
Adam Baumgarten: Okay. Got it, thanks. And then just on digital. Just curious when you think you'll be moving to roll out the platform to some of the larger homebuilders. And is that a piece of getting to that $1 billion sales target that you guys have put out there?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I mean, there are some aspects of the tool that we're thinking about working with some of the larger builders on. They certainly have -- there've been a lot of questions from the large builders and our answer to them is, yes, just give us a little bit of time to make sure that it's exactly where we want to be able to do it. We feel really good about our ability to execute with smaller, but a lot of scale changes everything, as you know. So that's been the pause. But we're playing around with certain features and functionality. And I think that's something that we will absolutely deliver on. We don't need it to get to the $1 billion number in our estimation. But it certainly, I think, is a vote of confidence in what we've been focused on and why it's important to the future of the industry.
Adam Baumgarten: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Brian Biros with Thompson Research Group.
Brian Biros: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The R&R segment was, I believe, up in the quarter. I know you cited some regional strengths there. Can you just expand on what drove that performance? It seems like that's maybe a more onetime phenomenon just given the reduced outlook there for R&R in your guidance from -- I think it was up low single digits to now flat. So can you just talk about the expectations there for the rest of the year?
Pete Beckmann: Well, expectations, as you just said. So we're calling flat for the full year, had a little bit of bump in the first quarter, really coming from some of the lumber and sheet categories where we're seeing strength in lumber and sheet.
Peter Jackson: That's a part of our business, while fairly modest in size that's more stable. You do see the regional impact. One of the nice things about our size and scale is because we're in 43 states and magnitude of the top 100 MSAs, you do get a blend in a smoothing at the corporate level, less of that with R&R. So you do see a little bit of movement based on the mix of regions, but generally speaking it's a more stable part of what we do. And a little bit of pops here and there can have an impact. But generally, we feel pretty good about estimating much on it.
Brian Biros: Understood. And then maybe how are your, I guess, customers is managing activity in orders here with this weaker demand, but prices may be rising? Are you seeing anything of pre-buy or forward activity in response to any of that? Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Not really. It's a good question. I think they just continue to stay focused on, I want to call it, trade downs, but compromises that are necessary to stay within the price points that they're targeting because builders are doing different things, right? Some are starter homes, some are move-up homes, similar customs. And depending on what you're doing, it's going to require you to adapt in a certain way. And one of the common areas of focus is whether or not there's just a substitute that beats the job but does it in a more efficient way or take it out entirely. So that's -- those are the areas we've been partnering with our customers on. Where can the design help, take cost out, work in individual product categories be adapted to the dynamics of what they're trying to meet in order to be the most efficient possible. But in terms of buying ahead, it's a pretty tough thing to do in our space for the customer.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Stevenson with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Stevenson: Hi, thanks for taking my questions, today. I just wanted to follow up on install services. And I wondered if they were positive in the first quarter? And then Peter, you talked about some of the labor disruptions we've seen due to the administration's immigration policy and just wondered if you're continuing to lean into your third-party assembly and install capabilities and a competitive advantage with builder customers?
Peter Jackson: So on install, as I was alluding to before, the core business is still doing well. Multifamily, it's a headwind. I mean that's in context of everything we said, I think, consistent. We still like install, yes and I think the third-party model is functional. I think time will tell how much on the ground impact is going to come out of some of the conversations around immigration. To date, if they are going to stay focused on MS13, I don't think we're going to do anything. If there is a more -- a broader impact on -- some of the more traditional non-newsworthy the legal immigration that could be impactful in our industry, but I think only time will tell. And ultimately, given what we do and how we do it, there is a place for third-party contracting, subcontractors, if you will, in the industry more broadly. We think it's the right model so we're going to continue to use it where it makes sense.
Jeffrey Stevenson: Okay. That makes sense. And then I wanted to shift to the M&A pipeline and wondered if during this period of market uncertainty, you're seeing any benefit from improved seller expectations or whether potential sellers are pulling back right now to manage through this period of market uncertainty?
Peter Jackson: Yes, I think it's the latter. Yes, what I was listening is we have certainly seen sellers pull back rumor deals that have been pulled off the table and then just a generally quiet space right now. It's a little, but it's pretty small and pretty wide. We're glad we're able to get Alpine into the family before things got too uncertain because we're excited about bringing them into the team and our team in Colorado and northern New Mexico is really ramped up to deliver incredible value to our customers. We're excited about it.
Jeffrey Stevenson: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And it appears that there are no further questions at this time. This does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Alright. Please standby. Good day, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Fourth Quarter 2024 and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by management. I would now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead.
Heather Kos: Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. With me on the call are Peter Jackson, our CEO, and Pete Beckmann, our CFO. The earnings press release and presentation are available on our website at investors.cldr.com. We will refer to the presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures, where applicable, and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings, and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation, and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into my prepared remarks, on behalf of Builders FirstSource, I want to send our thoughts to all of those who have been impacted by the California wildfires. I'm proud of how we have come together as a company to support disaster relief efforts. We will work together with our partners to help communities rebuild in the years ahead. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate our resilience and ability to drive results in the face of a complex operating environment while maintaining our focus on building the future. This begins with our strategic pillars, as we show on slide three. By continuing to invest in our value-added products and services, along with leveraging cutting-edge technology, we are addressing customer challenges and serving as a supplier of choice. We have a fortress balance sheet and consistently generate strong cash flow over the cycle, enabling us to remain disciplined and opportunistic as it pertains to capital allocation. Our investments today in organic growth opportunities and value-enhancing acquisitions position us to perform well in any environment. Let's turn now to our full year 2024 performance on Slide four. The strength of our differentiated platform and our operational excellence initiatives drove a mid-teens adjusted EBITDA margin and a nearly 33% gross margin in 2024. Results this year are further proof that our success is driven by the dedication of our hardworking team members and the support of our customers. Turning to slide five, I'd like to share more detail on the execution of our strategy. Our strong organic growth engine is fueled by our investments in value-added solutions and digital tools. In 2024, we invested more than $75 million in our value-added facilities to address demand in our growing markets. This included opening two new truss manufacturing facilities, upgrading nineteen truss facilities, and enhancing thirteen millwork locations. Our install sales increased by 8% year-over-year, and we leveraged our product expertise to help our customers progress along the value-added continuum. While we've always done install in some capacity, we have emphasized it in recent years by utilizing playbooks to expand into new markets and improve execution in existing ones. By growing install in a down market, I'm optimistic about this substantial opportunity for business going forward. In line with this optimism, adoption rates for our industry-leading digital platform are steadily climbing on the heels of consistent positive feedback from our customers. I'm pleased that we were able to achieve $134 million in incremental digital sales in 2024 despite the challenging environment that has persisted for our target customers. Our focus on operational excellence resulted in $117 million in productivity savings in 2024. We accomplished this mainly through supply chain initiatives and more efficient manufacturing. For instance, we were able to improve board foot per labor hour by 10% in truss and panel manufacturing. Not only do our productivity initiatives increase our efficiency, but they also drive additional revenue by enhancing available capacity and shortening lead times. We remain disciplined stewards of discretionary spending and are continuing to maximize operational flexibility. We consolidated roughly thirty facilities in 2024 while maintaining our service levels to our customers with an on-time and in-full delivery rate of over 90%. Single-family starts pulled back as builders manage the pace of building in the face of affordability challenges and uncertainty around potential policy changes. As expected and communicated, multifamily remains a headwind amid muted activity. In response to lower volumes over the last year, we have taken steps to align capacity across our facilities, reduce headcount, and manage expenses. On a normalized basis, multifamily represents about 9% to 10% of net sales and remains an attractive and profitable business for us. As we have signaled, multifamily will be a headwind again in 2025. To address the current environment and affordability challenges, builders continue to employ specs, smaller and simpler homes, and interest rate buy-downs to help buyers find affordable options. Builders of all sizes are working to navigate complex market conditions, including regulatory, land development, and infrastructure challenges. Smaller builders have been especially impacted by the availability of land and limited options to buy down rates. We are strengthening our partnerships with customers by offering innovative solutions to address affordability challenges. Our comprehensive product portfolio allows us to provide flexible options enabling builders to optimize their costs while maintaining quality. We continue to supply more lower-cost offerings and products like EWP, windows, and doors to help alleviate affordability challenges. Although these actions to support our customers mean less sales and gross profit dollars for BFS, our margin profile remains strong, and we are very well positioned for growth when starts increase and structural headwinds begin to subside. Turning to M&A on slide six, we continue to pursue high-return opportunities that augment our value-added product offerings and advance our leadership. Over the years, we have developed substantial improvement muscle memory to grow through M&A and have a proven track record of successful integration. In 2024, we completed thirteen acquisitions with aggregate prior year sales of roughly $420 million. In October, we acquired Douglas Lumber, which supplies building materials in New England. In November, we acquired Cleat Lumber, a leading provider of building materials on Long Island. In addition to the acquisitions we completed in 2024, in early January, we acquired Alpine Lumber, the largest independently operated supplier of building materials in Colorado and Northern New Mexico with twenty-one locations. Alpine's broad product portfolio includes prefabricated trusses and wall panels. And in February, we acquired OC Plus Lumber and Building Supplies, a leading supplier of lumber, building materials, and installation services in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia. These acquisitions reinforce our commitment to invest in our strong value-added business through M&A, and we are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. Turn to slide seven. Our disciplined capital allocation strategy focuses on maximizing shareholder returns through organic growth, inorganic growth, and share repurchases. In 2024, we deployed a total of $2.2 billion. We allocated $367 million to sustaining the business as well as ROI-generating growth investments in value-added capacity and digital. We spent $352 million on thirteen acquisitions to expand our footprint into high-growth geographies and enhance our value-added offerings. And we executed opportunistic share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion, removing roughly 7% of shares outstanding. Now let's turn to slide eight and discuss the latest updates on our digital strategy. With our BFS digital tools, we are focused on creating value for our home builder customers and, in doing so, further extending our industry leadership position and driving substantial organic growth. Despite the challenging market, we have seen continued adoption and growth with our target audience of smaller production builders, in addition to interest from multiple top two hundred builders. We continue to release enhancements that are improving the user experience and helping to drive adoption. Since launching about a year ago, we have seen nearly $1 billion of orders placed through our digital platform, of which $134 million were incremental sales from existing and new customers. We're pleased with our progress to date, and we expect additional incremental sales of approximately $200 million in 2025 as we grow wallet share and win new customers. I'm incredibly grateful to lead such a talented and hardworking team that makes a difference every day. One shining example of our values is Bob Whitney in Issaquah, Washington, who recently celebrated forty-five years with BFS. Bob began his journey with us as an administrative assistant managing invoices on the location's first computer, a massive machine that filled a twenty by twenty-foot room. Fast forward to today, Bob, a senior designer, is frequently cited by home builders and framers in the area as the key reason they choose our engineered wood products. With detailed designs, expertise, and an innovative approach to finding more efficient ways to accomplish tasks, he has set a high standard. I'm proud of Bob and our countless other dedicated team members who continually raise the bar on service to our customers and each other. I'll now turn the call over to Pete to discuss our financial results in greater detail.
Pete Beckmann: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter and full year results reflect our ability to execute by leveraging our exceptional operating platform and financial flexibility. Our fortress balance sheet, consistently strong cash flow generation over the cycle, and ability to prudently deploy capital to the highest return opportunities are positioning us for further success. Our scale and investments in innovation enable us to serve as a key partner to homebuilders, and we have a clear line of sight to compound value creation over the long term. We believe we are well positioned for meaningful operating leverage into the recovery. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter performance on Slide nine and ten. Net sales decreased 8% to $3.8 billion driven by lower core organic sales as well as commodity deflation, partially offset by growth from acquisitions and one additional selling day. The core organic sales decrease was driven by a 29% decline in multifamily amid muted activity levels against strong prior year comps. Additionally, single-family declined 7% amid lower value, while repair and remodel was roughly flat versus the prior year. Valuated products represented 50% of our net sales during the fourth quarter and were roughly balanced between manufactured products and window doors in the work. As we have shared on recent calls, there are three main variables reconciling single-family starts to our core organic sales. The first variable is the lag between permits and starts. Like Q3, this was less of a factor, with construction times mostly back to normal for our larger customers. On average, we expect a roughly two-month lag between a single-family start and our first sale. Second, the value of the average home has fallen as size and complexity have decreased. Finally, we saw slight normalization in selling margins of non-commodity products and the lapping of manufacturer price reductions. To summarize, although macro headwinds persist and there are fewer sales dollars available for start today, we remain the market leader in building products and are a trusted partner to our customers as they grapple with affordability challenges. For the fourth quarter, gross profit was $1.2 billion, a decrease of approximately 16% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 32.3%, down 300 basis points, primarily driven by single-family and multifamily margin normalization. As discussed previously, our exit velocity at the end of 2024 was approximately 31.5% given normalization and competitive dynamics. Adjusted SG&A decreased approximately $35 million to $764 million, primarily attributable to lower variable compensation due to lower core organic net sales and intangible amortization expense, partially offset by acquired operations. On an annual basis, adjusted SG&A is approximately 30% fixed and 70% variable with volumes, enabling flexibility during challenging periods. We are focused on carefully managing our SG&A and are well positioned to leverage our fixed costs as the market grows. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $494 million, down 28%, primarily driven by lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses after adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.9%, down 360 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit margins and reduced operating leverage. Adjusted EPS was $2.31, a decrease of 35% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases enabled by our strong free cash flow generation added roughly $0.15 per share for the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet, and liquidity on slide eleven. Our 2024 operating cash flow was $1.9 billion, a decrease of approximately $400 million, mainly attributable to lower net income. For 2024, we delivered higher than expected free cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion. Our trailing twelve months free cash flow yield was approximately 9%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 22%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.5 times. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2023. At year-end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.8 billion, consisting of $1.6 billion in net borrowing availability under the ABL and approximately $200 million in cash. Moving to capital deployment, capital expenditures were $96 million in Q4 and $367 million for the year. We deployed approximately $90 million during Q4 on two acquisitions and $352 million on thirteen acquisitions in 2024. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased roughly two million shares for approximately $345 million. For the year, we repurchased 8.9 million shares or $1.5 billion. Since the inception of our buyback program in August 2021, we have repurchased 46.5% of total shares outstanding at an average price of $79.56 per share for $7.6 billion. We have approximately $500 million remaining on our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to maximize returns. On slide twelve, we show our 2025 outlook. For full year 2025, our forecast assumes a flat single-family market and continued weakness in multifamily. As a result, we are guiding net sales in the range of $16.5 to $17.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.9 to $2.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be in the range of 11.5% to 13%. In line with our long-term target, we expect our 2025 full year gross margin to be in a range of 30% to 32%. We expect full year 2025 free cash flow of $600 million to $1 billion. The change from 2024 to 2025 is primarily due to a $500 million swing in working capital as we move from shrinking to growing sales, as well as higher capital expenditures and interest expense. Our cash flow guidance also includes our ongoing ERP investment. As we have said, we will start our ERP pilots later this year and have a plan to complete a phased implementation by 2027. Our 2025 outlook is based on several assumptions, including average commodity prices in the range of $380 to $430 per thousand board foot. This does not assume significant changes to existing duties and tariffs. Imports account for approximately 13% to 15% of our total purchases. The price of 8% to 10% commodities and 3% to 5% non-commodity. Please refer to our earnings release and presentation for a list of key 2025 assumptions. As you all know, we do not typically give quarterly guidance, but we wanted to provide color for Q1 given extreme weather and macro volatility. We expect Q1 net sales to be between $3.5 and $3.8 billion. Year-to-date, we have lost sales of approximately $80 million due to extreme weather and the California wildfire at the start of the year. Q1 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $350 million and $400 million. While we expect our sales to rebound quickly as severe weather conditions subside, the areas impacted by the California wildfires will likely take much longer to recover. Turning to slides fourteen and fifteen, as a reminder, our base business approach normalizes sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps us to clearly assess the core strength of the business where we have focused our attention on driving sustainable outperformance. Given expected 2025 commodity prices near the historical twenty-five-year average of $400 per thousand board foot, the base business guide is approximately the same as our total guide. As I wrap up, I am confident in our ability to drive long-term growth by executing our strategy, leveraging our exceptional platform, and maintaining financial flexibility. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Peter for some final thoughts.
Peter Jackson: Let me close by reiterating that we remain focused on controlling the controllables. Our resilient business model enables us to win in any environment. Given our scale, breadth of product offerings, and investments in technology, I'm confident in the long-term strength of our industry due to significant housing underbuild across our core markets. We are well positioned to capitalize on this, driving growth for years to come as we execute our strategy. We continue to deepen our value proposition as a key partner to our customers by helping them solve problems through our investment in value-added products, digital tools, and install services. Our proven growth playbook, fortress balance sheet, and robust free cash flow generation through the cycle will help us continue to compound long-term shareholder value. We are making strategic investments today to enhance efficiency and drive sustainable growth for the future. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions.
Operator: Certainly. At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We will take our first question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Matthew Bouley: Morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. A couple of questions on the outlook. So organic revenues, core organic in 2025, I think you're speaking to sort of a very low single-digit decline if I back out the M&A. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I wanted to get a sense for what you're thinking on some of those variables that you mentioned earlier that impacted the business in 2024. You know, the declining home sizes and the value of homes, some of the vendor price reductions, I think you called out. Those seem like a bit of a headwind in Q4. So I wanted to get a sense if you're seeing any signs of stabilization across those variables and how those are contemplated in the guide. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Matt. Maybe I'll frame it and let Pete fill in any details that I missed. But what I would tell you is that, broadly, the market is pretty stable at a level below where we would like. I think that as you listen to the builders, we're hearing a lot of the same things. Obviously, the challenges that they're seeing in the broader market or in the broader public discussions that they're having. There is a battle that's going on with affordability. We're all engaged in it and trying to make sure that we find ways to deliver homes that people can actually acquire. And it's been a bit of a rocky road. Interest rates haven't helped. Builders have been sort of modulating their build pace in order to maintain inventories at a reasonable level. Seems, by all accounts, they've done a pretty good job of it. But that's put us in this rather stagnant sort of stable but lower than we would like level. I think that continues. Some puts and takes around starts, some puts and takes around completions, but that's been sort of the storyline, and we continue to see that on the single-family side. Multifamily, it's down. I would say it's been leveling out. Stable, kind of like we've talked about. Unfortunately, again, at a fairly low level, haven't quite seen the recovery and the run that I think we're all hoping for. Maybe that's just dependent on rates, as people say. We'll see. Pete, I'm not sure what I missed.
Pete Beckmann: Yeah. So regarding the average home size, we're seeing that start to level out. It's still downward pressure consistent with what the public builders have communicated. They're seeing some, I would say, mixed toward a smaller home, but it's very more modest than it has been over the past year. As Peter mentioned with the multifamily, that's included in our core business. And we indicated last quarter that we were gonna see about $400 million to $500 million headwind in sales really in the first half of this year as we continue to lap the prior year comps. So that's included in the core organic as we look forward through the year.
Matthew Bouley: Okay. Perfect. Thank you for all that detail. Very helpful. And then I guess jumping down to the gross margin, obviously, the fourth quarter came in above the guide and you're calling for that 30% to 32% this year, in a year where starts are still fairly well below that normalized range. So is that, you know, you talked about that kind of mix of higher margin products, maybe it's lower value, but, you know, like EWP, solving challenges for builders. Is that piece primarily what's surprising you to the upside on the gross margin? Or, you know, as we kind of look out to this year, is maintaining that margin really where the priority is, or does it make sense in some cases to be more aggressive with share? Thank you.
Pete Beckmann: That's a great question. It's a fine line and a balancing act that we deal with every day. Our exit velocity, just as a reminder, was around 31.5% even though our Q4 margins were a bit higher. Our exit velocity was still around that 31.5%. We see continued competitive pressures from the single-family side as we continue through 2025. Right now, given our current assumptions, we believe the 30% to 32% range is a reasonable range. Now if something changes from the assumptions, we'll have to evaluate it. But right now, we're seeing the strength in our value-added mix continue to help our margin profile. And as we come out of the seasonal lows of Q4 and Q1, seeing that mix strength from value add continues for our margin profile.
Peter Jackson: Yeah. We're, I mean, we're seeing the pressure you would expect of an industry below normal in terms of total starts. And I think what we've baked in here is our desire, our intent, and I think our proven ability to protect share and manage margins in a thoughtful way. Gotta stay in the market. But we think what we've laid out is a plan that allows us to do that. Effect our share, to be aggressive, and make sure we're competitive but to still demonstrate, I would say, a very healthy margin profile.
Matthew Bouley: Got it. Well, thank you both, and good luck, guys.
Peter Jackson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.
Mike Dahl: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just follow-up on the gross margins and, you know, with the exit rate comment on 31.5% from, you know, back of the envelope, it seems like maybe the Q1 guide implies something closer to, yes, 30% to 31.5%, maybe a little bit lower than that exit rate. But can you just talk a little bit more about what's really embedded in Q1 and how you see the progression through the year in gross margins?
Pete Beckmann: So, Mike, what I can tell you is we're seeing that continued normalization from the multifamily as we're exiting the year, and the competitive pressure on the single-family side, especially in the seasonal lows, having further pressure on the margins in Q1, not to a significant degree, but some degree from that exit velocity. We see that really being the entry point to the year and have some of that mix built in from the rest of the year to help keep that margin in the midpoint of what we guided.
Peter Jackson: I guess the only thing I'd add to that is if you think about it at a higher level, we have been focused on the 2025 bids. Right? So at the beginning of the year, you frequently see a lot of builders coming out saying, okay, here we're gonna set up for the year. Let's put out our big bids. Let's work hard to set things up for the year. We've been engaged very heavily in that, as you might imagine. It's given us a sense of where the year is starting out and trying to give you that with our quote exit velocity. That's our sense of it. So I think it gives us a good flow into the beginning of the year for the core business. Layered on top of that is all of that sort of lapping of the final throws of multifamily in the first half of this year that Pete referred to. So those are kind of the two aspects of what we're looking at as we build out the forecast and give it back.
Mike Dahl: Okay. That's helpful. And that segues into my other follow-up, which is about the comments on protecting share, competitive dynamics. You know, you've obviously been very selective in terms of the type of business and margin that you pursue over the last couple of years. You know, it sounds like maybe a little bit more focus on share, which maybe means participating in some of the commodity dynamics. So maybe can you just help us understand when you make that comment? Are you looking to hold share kind of in commodities and still grow share in your value add? How would you characterize the goals in terms of share for this year and where you need to be most competitive?
Peter Jackson: Sure. I guess for context, I do want to describe how I see the trend over the past couple of years. You know, when we came out of the big COVID build push, there were across-the-board elevated margins, elevated volumes, elevated prices. We've been talking about normalization forever, to the point where all of us are a little tired of using the word. Unfortunately, I don't think we're done. I think what we saw were waves of normalization that have flowed through this industry via the individual categories. So right out of the gate, you saw a large amount of normalization in the lumber and lumber sheet goods category. You saw normalization in price. And then you saw a normalization in margins as sort of the competition returned to what we would consider to be normal levels. We talked a little bit about what we saw in that and the share battle and what we were doing. We thought we lost a little. I would tell you right now, I feel pretty good about where we are. I think the team has done a nice job of responding and finding equilibrium and where margins needed to be. We have seen that flow through the other categories. And, you know, we've talked a little bit. Mike, you and I have talked about why has it been so difficult to forecast margins. What I would tell you is because the timing of how those normalizations have occurred has been a bit different than we anticipated. So I think what we're seeing now and have over the last year is the completion of that. Right? The normalization of those individual categories and the price versus share battle that ensues in each one in order to find equilibrium. I think we're closer to the end than the beginning, but that's where we're talking now in the other categories, even more so than I would say lumber and lumber sheet. Finding that balance and protecting that share in a way that we feel like we're able to have good value for our customers but still protect where we are so that as the growth returns, we're able to take advantage of our frankly superior capacity and capabilities to really show outsized returns for investors.
Mike Dahl: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you, Peter.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Mulaloe with UBS. Please go ahead.
John Mulaloe: Hey. Good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my questions as well. Maybe starting off again with the first quarter outlook. I mean, it seems to be a number of, I guess, unusual items. There's the fires, weather, I think there's one less selling day as well. And you framed the quarter-to-date impact, I believe, from weather and the fires, but can you help us think about how you're thinking about that for the full quarter for each of those buckets? And maybe can you help us bridge from that 10.3% implied EBITDA margin in the first quarter to the full year range of, you know, 11.5% to 13%?
Pete Beckmann: Yeah. So the first quarter is definitely feeling the effects of the severe weather. We had a foot of snow down in the Gulfport through Emerald Coast, and it's unusual. We're not used to seeing that. So we lost multiple days of business from that extreme weather in the east and south. We expect that to come back. It's a matter of time as the builders are able to pick up momentum and work through it in the seasonal low. So that $80 million impact that we had outlined in the prepared remarks, it's something that we do expect to get back, but it may take longer than Q1 to get it all back. As far as the California wildfires, it's not a huge immediate impact in Q1, but for the full year, it's gonna have a lingering effect. So it'll be something we continue to monitor as we work through the year. And then the one last selling day, that's just a simple math equation. I think you understand that one. And we are looking through the full year on what we believe the year is gonna deliver as we go through it. And we start to see the churn a bit in Q2 where we start passing those negative comps and seeing continued, I would say, organic growth through the back part of the year in conjunction with the contributions from the acquisitions we've completed. So as we indicated in our press release regarding Alpine, their trailing twelve-month sales is roughly $500 million. But we also have the benefit of the thirteen acquisitions we completed in 2024, where we have stub periods that we haven't lapped yet that are gonna contribute to overall sales growth. As Peter mentioned, we are targeting $200 million of additional incremental sales from our digital platform in 2025. So all those things added up is where we're seeing some of the growth in sales. And I already mentioned the multifamily headwind that we're gonna continue to have to lap and compare to on the comps, as well as some of the margin normalization, which is price. That'll have a different pressure on.
Peter Jackson: And, John, just to, I know you know, but to reinforce for the others on the call, you know, Q1 is easily by far our weakest quarter from a sales perspective. Distortions related to weather and fires have a sort of an outsized impact on our leverage and on our fall through. So just to keep that in mind as you're doing the analysis.
John Mulaloe: Okay. I mean, that's helpful. And then just in terms of the expected $500 million working capital swing in 2025, can you just help us think about the high end and the low end of the sales range? I mean, at the low end of the sales range, it seems like sales could actually be pretty flat year over year. I mean, how would you kind of think about that working capital swing as you got the high and low end?
Pete Beckmann: It'll moderate, respectively. Really, the cash flow is a function of how you exit the year. So it'll be more skewed toward the exit rate from a sales velocity at that point compared to the prior year. It's just a point-to-point measurement. And as we mentioned, we were able to outperform our free cash flow guidance in 2024. So we did have a little bit of pull forward into the 2024 results. Roughly, $200 million that was recognized in 2024 that we had originally thought was gonna be in 2025. So some of that's washing between the years. Is the impact of the outsized change year over year.
John Mulaloe: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Charles Perron-Piche with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Charles Perron-Piche: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess, first, I want to talk about the product mix shift within your multifamily business. As you look for multifamily starts to contract this year, do you see risks of more degradation in your value-added content in there? And how is this factoring into your current guide expectations for your future business?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. You know, multifamily is a great product category for us. Right? It's a market segment. The majority of it is value add. So when we see declines in sales, it is disproportionately an impact on those value-added product categories, primarily truss and millwork. Those are both integrated into our guides and our forecast for the full year. So we have considered it. Got a fairly high degree of confidence in our forecast just given the amount of forward visibility we have in those categories given the backlog because of the types of projects and how far we can see.
Charles Perron-Piche: Got it. No. That's good color. And then the new administration has been vocal about their stance on potential tariffs and labor and immigration policy. I guess, against that, how are you positioning the business against potential tariffs across your portfolio? Are you making any changes for inventory management, for example, if we were to get labor pressures in the construction industry, what do you think could be the repercussions for BFS and, you know, builders' willingness to use value-added content and your services?
Peter Jackson: And the new administration? I hadn't heard now. Just kidding. Just kidding. Yeah. So there's a lot going on. Right? The tariff world, as we described, about 15% of our total sales are exposed to potential tariffs given that it's not US. Of that, you know, in the high singles to 10% range is in that commodity product category. So for us, what we're doing differently, not much. Right? The dynamic around managing the flow of product is something that we are disciplined about, and given our lack of visibility into what the actual outcome is going to be, we've been pretty cautious about taking a position or changing our inventory levels in response. You know, I think that there's some optimism that there will be thoughtfulness around the potential impact on housing, but we'll see. We've always had a tariff regime on that Canadian softwood. That's not new. That was already expected to reset a bit higher this year based on the normal process there. But if there are significantly higher tariffs, if 25% were to be layered on top, that's pretty dramatic. That could be a 65% tariff. While a modest percentage of what we do, we have seen in the past that be a broader impact. Meaning, just because the Canadian wood goes up, the US wood will go up a bit as well. In short, we don't like it. You know? Any barrier or additional problem for housing right now we think is a net negative. It'll certainly be a tailwind to our sales per unit in the commodity space. But we think it will likely win it starts, and that's bad overall. On a net basis. The similar answer around immigration. You know, I think one of the things that Builders FirstSource has done better than anybody else is leaning into this idea of offering value-added products, which is essentially just finding ways to take skilled labor off the job site. We have a great portfolio of products that do that. We think we'll be advantaged if immigration were to tighten an already tight labor market in that skilled area. We think we'll be more advantaged than anyone else. The downside is we still think net net, any severe impact or radical impact on the labor force would be bad for the industry. It's bad for affordability, which is bad for starts, and we don't like it. So, you know, we think the trend is there. We think we're ready. We think we're gonna win. But we sure hope that there's some thoughtfulness around how it's executed in the market, both in tariffs and in immigration.
Charles Perron-Piche: Got it. Got it. That's helpful color. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Rafe Jadrosich: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just thinking about some of the assumptions sort of embedded in the 2025 guidance, at the 2023 Investor Day, some of the long-term targets you laid out, you were assuming 4% market outgrowth from share gains. Just how are you thinking about that for 2025?
Peter Jackson: Well, I would say that the 2026 targets based on what the market has done and the way things have played out, they're not unachievable, but it sure is a long putt from here. You know, I think the dynamics around that, around the share gain that would go along with that, are influenced by that weak market. I think it changes the competitive dynamics. It changes a lot of things. For 2025, our share gain expectations are pretty modest. You know, I think they really center around what we think we can do in the digital space. And I think the rest of what we're trying to accomplish is really defending our share with a manageable margin impact.
Rafe Jadrosich: And that's really helpful. Then the other question I have is just you mentioned install earlier. Can you just talk about how big that is today as a percentage of either EBITDA or revenue? What is the margin profile of install? And then, like, what are the categories or services where you see the most opportunity? Where is it growing?
Pete Beckmann: So our install is around 16% to 17% of our overall sales as of the end of 2024. It's about $1.7 billion of $2.7 billion of sales. Sorry. The margin profile, it's in line with what we see from the product categories that we're installing. And the opportunities, I think there's a lot there, right, that we can lean into. I mean, currently, it's framing, it's doors, it's windows, it's millwork more broadly. Those are the, I would say, main categories, but what we see are many opportunities to partner with customers depending on the local market need.
Rafe Jadrosich: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead.
David Manthey: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, guys. When you issued 2024 guidance in February last year, the EBITDA range top to bottom was about a hundred basis points, and today's range is 150 on what appear to be smaller absolute numbers. I hope I'm not slicing this too thin, but maybe if you could just address the risk factors that you see as more volatile in today's environment versus what you might have seen last year.
Peter Jackson: Yeah. No. That's fair. I would tell you that coming into last year, there was kind of an expectation that the year was building momentum. That we were gonna see rate cuts, that, you know, the tone out of the builders was just very consistently optimistic amongst the larger players. And the smaller players were saying, oh, yeah. We're gonna be right behind them. It's gonna be good. That's not how it played out. That is not the tone this year. That is not the messaging we're hearing. If you're looking at the dynamics of what the core market looks like today, I think we feel okay. You know? It's not fantastic. But we're doing well. I think what is more intimidating and the reason for the wider band around it is what will the unknowns generate in terms of volatility in the competitive environment? Builders are pretty vocal about, hey, we have an affordability problem. We're gonna push everybody down. You know, everybody needs to take a cut, and that's not really new. But if you start to overlay some of these questions about tariffs and, you know, policy changes around immigration, policy changes around housing, I think that's where our hesitancy to keep such a narrow band this year comes from.
David Manthey: That's very clear. Thank you. And second on digital, the uptake has been a little slower than you expected so far. You got $134 million this year. I think you're expecting $200 million, which was, I guess, coincidentally, the fourth quarter exit rate. But if you're looking for $200 million in 2025, that implies that the exit run rate of the fourth quarter doesn't improve at all through 2025. So maybe you could address that. And then I see you still have the $1 billion target, but it doesn't say 2026 here anymore. Should we assume a slower ramp given the more complex environment today?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. No. Thanks for the question. So digital is a tremendous learning opportunity for us. I remain very confident that the technology and the solution is the right answer. As we go through the learning process, I think what we've identified is that, and you hit the nail on the head, our pace this year isn't quite what we wanted. And we spent a lot of time at the end of the year to reassess why is that. Why is the pace not picking up where we thought it would be? And I think the answer has a lot to do with the way we've approached adoption. We were more generalized than I think we would like to be. I think there's a more specific, more focused way to approach the adoption process. And that's where we're leaning in this year. We've really focused on a reset coming out of December into January with regard to that with new metrics, with the alignment around the teams. It's a little bit of go slow to go fast, which I think is what you're identifying in terms of our pace for 2025 and where we think we can get. I think what we're executing now is gonna ultimately get us to where we wanna be. In terms of the 2026 finish line, it's a great question. I don't think it's out of the question yet. Where I would tell you is we're gonna find out in 2025 whether this reset and new approach to adoption is delivering like we think. And we'll have a much better sense as we get through the end of the year. We've got another investor day coming up, so we'll be able to give you a much clearer sense of where we're gonna be when. I am still 100% confident in the billion. I think it's only a question of when.
David Manthey: Alright. Thanks, Peter. Good luck.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Keith Hughes with Truist. Please go ahead.
Keith Hughes: Thank you. My question is on multifamily. You've given us our view for the year, that mid-teens decline. Do you expect that to hit ratably during the year, or is there a chance this business could bottom out sometime in, you know, mid-second half 2025?
Pete Beckmann: Yeah. What we're seeing right now is the lapping effect of the $400 million to $500 million headwind year over year is really gonna be in the first half of this year. We're seeing our current volume levels right now are pretty consistent month over month sequentially. But we're lapping tough comps from the prior year. So it's certainly front half weighted on that headwind.
Keith Hughes: Okay. Would that change? Would that within the it's in the midpoint of the guidance range? Does that allow EBITDA to show some level of growth in the second half of 2025?
Pete Beckmann: When you say growth, is it growth sequentially or on a year-over-year basis?
Keith Hughes: Year over year.
Pete Beckmann: Yeah. I would say overall, it's not enough.
Keith Hughes: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Philip Ng: Hey, guys. Appreciate all the great color. Peter, you gave some color on how perhaps your customers are progressing. But any early read on spring selling season? And you did mention in your prepared remarks, maybe some of the builders are testing out how they want to modulate build pace. My question is, have you seen them kind of really ratchet back spec homes? Are they working down inventory? Are you seeing any noticeable change in behavior in terms of buying out mortgages and stuff of that nature?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. No. Thanks for the question. So in general, I would say builders are behaving consistently. Continue to buy down pretty aggressively as their key lever for keeping the production moving. The larger production builders have really moved to sort of this land-light on one side, on the other side, very stable production mentality around how they want to put homes out. And what we've seen is modulation by market. So they're not doing it nationally. That's not how we see them thinking. It's very dependent on, you know, if you're in Florida or Denver or, you know, these individual markets. They'll behave in a way that, well, you'd expect them to behave. Right? So we have a little more inventory than we'd like. We're gonna goose up the buyback a little. We're gonna pull back on the new starts pace a little bit to ensure that we have this in a range that we like, but we're gonna move these houses. So I think consistent, but the pullback on starts is something that is probably the last maybe four to six months, certainly a much bigger part of the conversation than it had been in the prior period.
Philip Ng: Okay. That's helpful. And then from an M&A standpoint, certainly, 2024 was an active year, and you guys have kicked off the year pretty busy. How is the pipeline looking in terms of seller expectations, evaluation you're seeing out there? Where are some of the big opportunities? How do you kind of balance that and buyback? You still have a lot of availability here.
Peter Jackson: Yeah. You know, we've consistently talked about M&A as being a priority for us. To the extent that we can effectively execute acquisitions, it has been a tremendous creator of shareholder value. We think it's good for the overall business in terms of our competitive space, our footprint, our efficiency. You know, our ability to serve customers in an effective way is advantaged by these new teams that we brought on into the BFS family. There are a lot of assets out there. You know, as you saw with 2024 and coming into 2025, you sort of have a large population, a large potential target list within the smaller world, with a much fewer more opportunistic materialization of a larger target. So I'd say that's kind of consistent. We continue to see a number of smaller opportunities, you know, some a little bit bigger, and then every once in a while, a big one will pop, and we'll have an opportunity to do something more meaningful. But regardless of sort of the periodic nature of all that, we believe in M&A. We're good at it. We will continue to capture value through it. We'll continue to deploy cash that way. And, certainly, we have had, I think, a lot of success with share buybacks. But it continues to be the, you know, number five on our list of capital allocation priorities.
Philip Ng: Okay. Super appreciate the color. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Trey Grooms: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Just circling back on the market share just real quick, and I don't want to beat a dead horse because I know we have spent some time on it. But I was just asking if this was, you know, you mentioned that you lost a little bit. Was this specific to any, you know, geographic market or maybe specific to production builders, or was it more widespread? Then, Peter, you know, you said you were thinking kind of, excuse me, modest share gains this year I think is what's kind of embedded. I guess, what's kind of changed there in the market where, you know, working multifamily is gonna be down a little bit and single-family is expected to be kind of flat. Is it just more discipline in the market kind of coming back, or what's going on?
Peter Jackson: Well, going back to the initial conversation or the initial statement around having lost some share in the past, I think we were pretty open and transparent that as we look at the analysis, it's not, you know, decimal level precision. But based on what we can tell, there were certain builders, and I think production is fair. Some of the folks that had a sharp pencil with regard to how they were doing their bids and attacking their cost position were trying to find ways to drive down cost, and commodities is one of those areas where there are times when certain players will get progressive. They just will. They want to buy share. They think that that's a strategy for them. So they'll lean in and do something we would consider irresponsible. And sometimes we'll walk away, and we walked away a fair amount. And I think at some point said, okay. That's enough. We're gonna take the business that belongs to us, and we're gonna stay competitive to do it. So again, that goes back to the normalization thing and what we saw on that balance between share and margins. But I think that's largely the review here. I haven't seen anything lately in the past quarter or two that would indicate that's still in play. But it's a dynamic market. Right? In terms of what's going on this year and our ability to gain share, I think what you will see are ebbs and flows. There'll be aspects of it that we're gonna win at. I think we will continue to win in install. I think we're gonna continue to be the preferred supplier for trusses and for pre-owned doors. I think those are areas where we have a demonstrated advantage. We have a cost advantage. It's merely a matter of deciding how much are we willing to lean in in those categories? How much do we have to lean in in those categories to protect our share position? And then as we think about the last sort of leg of the stool, the digital is an area where we continue to capture new customers, where we get a stickier and deeper relationship with customers because of the solution set that that digital tool set provides.
Trey Grooms: Got it. That makes sense, and good to hear. So one follow-up for me, and, you know, you touched on tariffs and things like that. But we got a lot of questions around this, you know, earlier in the year, maybe a few weeks ago. And questions around more how, you know, if we were to see these additional tariffs come through and it meant, you know, $600 lumber as opposed to $400 lumber, whatever, pick the number. Can you remind us how, you know, this would flow through on the manufactured side, the prefab side, how margins would behave there in this kind of environment if we were to see this higher lumber? I know the old algorithm of years past seems to, I don't know if that's still kind of the best way to think about it. Seems like margins had been stickier both with lumber going up and down for you guys. So any help with that just so we can kind of put this into our scenario analysis as we think about tariffs, lumber, etcetera.
Peter Jackson: Well, I mean, I'm happy to repeat a little bit about the rules of thumb that we've kind of given in the past, but I think it's important to give you a lot of caution and caveat around that. I'll let you know what's gonna happen. I mean, the dynamics here are a little bit different in terms of how aggressive these changes are being proposed. How aggressive the changes being proposed are and whether or not there's a time that is manageable or not. You know, we've talked in the past about commodities. You know, plus or minus 5% on the commodities. Be worth around $300 million in sales over the course of a year. At the fall through, you know, relatively normal fall through in that sort of $60 to $70 million range. So it's not an exact science. These are all kind of high-level numbers, but I would say the most important thing is the velocity of the change and how the market responds.
Trey Grooms: Yep. Lot of still a lot of unknowns out there for sure, but that's still helpful. Peter, thank you so much, and best of luck.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, sir.
Operator: Okay. We'll take our next question from Adam Baumgarten with Stellman Associates. Please go ahead.
Adam Baumgarten: Hey, guys. Good morning. Could you give us some color on what you're seeing from a pricing perspective in the value-added products arena?
Pete Beckmann: Yeah. We're still seeing, and we've provided in the past with respect to value-added products relative to the lumber commodity margins. It still goes at a premium of about a thousand to twelve hundred basis points higher because of what we're able to provide with improved cycle times or lead times for getting the product to the job site, the reduced waste, and the requirement on skilled labor being reduced by having that completed in a dedicated manufacturing facility. We're still seeing that premium or benefit from the value add in our results.
Adam Baumgarten: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then just, you know, in a scenario maybe where we start to see more pronounced labor constraints across the single-family construction space due to the Adam, you still there? We lost you.
Adam Baumgarten: Yeah. Can you hear me?
Peter Jackson: Yep. Oh, you're back now.
Adam Baumgarten: Okay. Sorry about that. So just in a scenario where, you know, we start to see more labor constraints in construction due to some of the immigration policies, you know, you have an install business. Do you see that as a risk to your business or actually maybe an opportunity as maybe some of your customers are looking for incremental labor?
Peter Jackson: Well, I mean, it's both. Right? It's certainly an opportunity for us in order to be able to win in the marketplace. We've got the build capacity. We've got the best skill set. We've got the most locations. We are ready to go with this. The problem with it in my mind is it's disruptive. And more broadly speaking, if it was just us being impacted, I'd say win-win. We got this. But you're not just gonna get rid of framers, you're gonna get rid of gypsum wall, you know, wallboard hangers. You're gonna get rid of roofers. You're gonna get rid of siding folks. And there are parts of this industry that are gonna be impacted that don't have the same outlet that we offer. Right? You need the people. And if you don't have the people, it's gonna cause inflation. Inflation is bad for affordability, and affordability is bad for starts.
Adam Baumgarten: Got it. Thanks, guys. Best of luck.
Peter Jackson: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brian Deerez with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.
Brian Deerez: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions today. Just a little bit more on the install base, you know, impressive, I think, growth this year in a down market. Any expectations for install for 2025 or how that kind of factors into the guide?
Peter Jackson: So we haven't laid a guide specifically around that category, but we're believers in it. We certainly talk a lot about it. So, hopefully, that's an indication of which way we think it'll go.
Brian Deerez: Makes sense. And then for single-family start guidance for the year, is there any way to think about variance by region in that guide for you guys? Or kind of where you're better or worse positioned across your footprint? Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Yeah. I'd love to be able to provide a deeper guide on that, but I don't think it's in any of our best interest at this point. Forecasting is difficult, especially about the future. He loves a good yogi, isn't it? Come on.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jay McCanless with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Jay McCanless: Guys. Thanks for taking my question. So the first one, just to clarify, Peter. Are you guys having to lean in on price now on value-add sales, or are you just saying if you need to to protect share, you will lean on price? Just kind of clarify where things are right now.
Peter Jackson: Oh, yeah. No. That's already been going on. We've been managing through that for the last year. Eight months, I'd say more intently. It's implied. No question.
Jay McCanless: Okay. And then the second question, and not to read too much into it, but I think your tone around multifamily last quarter may have been a little more positive than what you talked about this quarter. But it is nice to hear that we're finally lapping that. I guess any material change in bid processes or bid volumes on the multifamily side to maybe change your tone around that.
Peter Jackson: Yeah. I would say any change in tone is unintentional. You know, I'd come back from a conference last quarter where there were some folks talking about some green shoots. I would say things have been pretty stable. Just sort of clicking along.
Jay McCanless: Okay. Alright. Sounds great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our final question from Jeffrey Stevenson with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Stevenson: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions today. I wanted to go back to single-family mix headwinds this year from a decrease in value size and complexity of an average single-family start. So on a year-over-year basis, are you expecting single-family mix headwinds to moderate as we move through fiscal '25? Or does your guidance imply relatively stable single-family mix throughout the year?
Pete Beckmann: I would say our guidance reflects a pretty stable single-family mix from where we ended Q4 as we move through the year. The headwinds that we outlined throughout 2024, some of them are still there, and we'll have to lap that in the first half of this year. Some of that's related to the size of home and some of the complexity as well as some of that margin normalization on the single-family side with non-commodity products. So there's a little bit there, but we don't expect from a mix standpoint that it's gonna have a greater impact than kind of where we are exiting Q4.
Jeffrey Stevenson: No. That makes sense, Pete. Thanks for that. And then appreciate the first quarter guidance and update on the first weather to start out the year. But historically, what percentage of first-quarter sales are from March? And could you experience some pent-up demand if weather cooperates as we move through the largest month of the quarter?
Peter Jackson: You're right. March is important. From your lips to God's ears, let's have a hell of a March, I guess, is where I'm headed. We'll see.
Jeffrey Stevenson: Got it. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. With that, this will conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-05 10:08:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead.
Heather Kos: Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our CEO; Peter Jackson, our CEO designate and CFO; and Pete Beckmann, our CFO designate. As a reminder, on September 19, we announced a planned CEO and CFO succession. The earnings press release and presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to the presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to our investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review these forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Rush: Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into my prepared remarks, on behalf of Builders FirstSource, I want to send our thoughts to all of those who have been impacted by Hurricane Helene and Milton. I am proud of how we have come together as an industry to help with disaster relief efforts in North Carolina and the Southeast. From the first morning after Helene's landfall, we had team members and suppliers reaching out from all over the region and even across the nation asking how they can help. Our Charlotte and Blairsville locations filled trucks with supplies and delivered them to the hard hit Western North Carolina region. Suppliers like Great Southern, BlueLinx, Weyerhaeuser, Orgle [ph] and many others immediately stepped up and joined our efforts. We are grateful to our partners for their help. And with BFS Cares initiative, we're providing grants to our team members -- to help get our team members back on their feet as soon as possible. I want to especially thank Tim McCall, an install manager in Nashville, who also serves as a volunteer firefighter in the region. Tim was involved in 20 calls in the first hours after Helene hit. One involved climbing over 250 yards of very unstable terrain to help rescue an 11-year-old boy who had been buried in the basement of his home by a massive land slide. Tim, we are so proud of your efforts, and thank you for your selfless service to the community. I'm sure you have all seen the news that I'm retiring as CEO. I never anticipated that 25 years ago, I would have this wonderful career with this great company. We have the best people in the industry and the opportunity to be CEO of BFS these last couple of years has truly been the joy and highlight of my career. I am so proud of how far we have come and I'm grateful to our leadership team and team members for their support. I have full confidence in Peter and Pete and their ability to drive our strategy forward. One of my first priorities when I became CEO was to develop a succession plan to ensure the consistency of our leadership and the execution of our long-term strategy. With many years of experience as our CFO, Peter is exceptional at navigating the public company landscape and has spent extra time with each of our regions to get a first-hand understanding of what it takes to support our leaders in the field. He has served as a close advisor to me and was essential in helping craft our current strategy. I'm working closely with him to ensure a thoughtful and seamless transition. Pete Beckmann is a brilliant financial leader and someone who is widely respected within the organization. I am grateful for our deep bench of talent and to lead BFS in such good hands. I want to wrap up by saying that I'm not going far away. I'll enjoy continuing to serve BFS as a member of our Board, and I am taking an active role to ensure a smooth transition in the near term. I'm excited to continue supporting our growth and success. Thank you, again. I'll now hand the call over to Peter.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by saying that we are indebted to Dave for his decades of service at BFS as a leader, steward and champion of the company and our people. Dave has truly done it all, and his legacy of excellence will continue to inspire us as we move forward. I'm truly honored and grateful to be named the next CEO of Builders FirstSource. I'm humbled to represent our talented, hard-working team and the fantastic business that we have built. BFS has had tremendous success and become a world-class organization because of the commitment and contributions made by this team. Let's get started with Slide 3 and our strategic pillars, which remain unchanged. As we continue to execute our strategy, I believe there are three areas that we can emphasize so we can continue to outperform today and transform tomorrow. The first opportunity is with our people. I want us to advance the industry standard in this area so that we are recognized as a premier destination for talent. I believe we can enhance how we invest in, develop and support our team members from our frontline operators to our leadership. The second opportunity is to further build and catalyze our growth prospects, from our products to our processes. I see potential to improve our consistency capabilities and ways of working, so we can extend our lead and grow a bigger, better BFS of tomorrow. And the third opportunity is to improve how we collaborate and learn from each other within the company. We have a wealth of expertise, knowledge and innovative technologies. I believe we have a real opportunity to enhance how we work together. So that what we are discovering in Charlotte is shared with Phoenix and what we are developing in Florida can be scaled in Texas. Let's turn now to our third quarter highlights on Slide 4. I'm proud of our resilient performance, which reflects our execution and operational rigor, even as we continue to see soft sales, amid rate uncertainty and extreme weather. Despite these challenges, we delivered strong gross margins of nearly 33%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin has remained in the mid-teens or better for 14 consecutive quarters, which highlights our transformed business model and our differentiated product portfolio and scale. Let's move to Slide 5, where we touch on some of the specific ways we are executing our strategy. Our portfolio of value-added products and services remains a competitive advantage for BFS and continues to bolster our partnerships with customers. We've seen steady progress with digital, as we continue to hear great feedback from customers and see increasing levels of adoption each week. We demonstrated operational excellence by delivering $27 million in productivity savings in Q3 and have driven $104 million year-to-date, primarily through more efficient manufacturing and procurement initiatives. Installed services continues to be a great opportunity for us as we leverage playbooks from successful markets. I'm pleased that our install sales increased by 11% year-over-year, as we focus on helping customers address labor challenges. We remain disciplined stewards of discretionary spending and are continuing to maximize operational flexibility. We have consolidated 11 facilities year-to-date, while maintaining our service levels to our customers with an on-time and in-full delivery rate of over 90%. Single-family softness continued in Q3, amid on-going affordability challenges and below normal starts. The initial reaction to the Fed's first interest rate cut in September has been mixed, with some homebuyers remaining on the sidelines and waiting for additional rate cuts as mortgage rates fluctuate in the near term. As a reminder, the value of a new start has fallen as the housing market has adapted to affordability challenges. Multifamily continues to be a headwind, amid muted activity is expected. Comparisons should get less negative as we lap record performance from last year. On a normalized basis, multifamily represents about 9% to 10% of net sales and is an attractive and profitable business for us. As we detailed on our Q2 call, our Q4 exit velocity indicates about a percentage point of margin erosion from '24 on a full year basis, roughly half of which is from multifamily. To address the current environment and affordability challenges, builders have employed specs, smaller and simpler homes and interest rate buydowns to help buyers find affordable options. Builders of all sizes are having to navigate this market in addition to regulatory, land development and infrastructure challenges. Smaller builders have been especially impacted by the availability of land and limited options to buy down rates. We are leaning in by partnering with our customers to help them lower the cost of homes for consumers as well as maintain their margins. This includes offering a balanced product mix that addresses builder needs while passing through lower material costs. For instance, we have continued to supply more engineered wood and have sold fewer floor trusses to help alleviate affordability challenges. We have also supplied more lower-cost offerings in products like windows and doors to help reduce costs. Although these actions in support of our customers need less sales and gross profit dollars, our margin profile remains strong, and we are well positioned for growth as starts to increase and structural headwinds begin to subside. Turning to M&A on Slide 6, we continue to pursue attractive opportunities, while remaining financially disciplined. Over the years, we have developed a substantial and proven muscle memory to grow through M&A and have an impressive track record of successfully integrating these transactions. In the third quarter, we completed six deals with an aggregate 2023 sales of roughly $190 million. In July, we acquired Western Truss & Components, having trust capacity in the Flagstaff, Arizona area and CRi SoCal, a dealer and installer of high-end windows and doors in Orange County, California. In August, we acquired Wyoming Millwork, the leading independent building products distributor in Delaware. September, we acquired Sunrise Wood Designs, a top custom cabinet manufacturer and installer in North Texas. And in the Reno area, Reno Trust, a leading trust manufacturer to the single and multifamily markets and High Mountain Door & Trim, a distributor and installer of windows doors and in Millwork. Additionally, in October, we acquired Douglas Lumber, which provides a range of building materials to contractors, remodelers and homeowners in the Rhode Island area. These acquisitions reinforce our commitment to growing value-added products. We are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. On Slide 7, we provide an update on capital allocation. In addition to the six tuck-in acquisitions during the third quarter, we executed share repurchases of roughly $160 million. It's driven by our track record, we'll continue to allocate capital to high-return opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We deployed approximately $1.7 billion through the first three quarters of this year and remain on track strategically to $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion of capital from 2024 to 2026 and we outlined at Investor Day last December. Now let's turn to Slide 8, and discuss the latest updates on our digital strategy. With our BFS digital tools, we are focused on creating value for our homebuilder customers and in doing so, further extending our industry leadership position and driving substantial organic growth. We have seen strong adoption and growth with our target audience of smaller builders despite the challenging market. We have had broad acceptance of the platform so far, including interest from multiple top 200 builders. Since launching in late February, we have seen nearly $600 million of orders placed through our digital platform, of which $83 million were incremental sales from existing and new customers. While we're very pleased with the incremental sales to date, given market headwinds from our targeted segment of builders, we now expect total incremental sales of approximately $110 million in 2024 versus our initial goal of $200 million. Despite the slow start, we remain confident in our ability to meet our target of $1 billion in incremental sales in 2026, as we grow wallet share and win new customers. Before I turn the call over, I want to say that we are very fortunate to have Pete Beckmann step into the role of CFO. He has a long proven track record as a finance leader which I've witnessed first-hand. I look forward to partnering with him to deliver exceptional results and compound shareholder value. Pete, take it away.
Pete Beckmann: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the introduction, and I am grateful for the opportunity to serve as CFO. For background, I have spent the last 25 years at BFS and legacy companies in roles of increasing responsibility, including being an integral part of the ProBuild and BMC mergers. Most recently, I served as SVP of Financial Planning and Analysis, where we have partnered with all levels of the enterprise and was responsible for our financial forecasting, strategic capital and annual planning. I look forward to helping enable profitable growth while maintaining our track record of prudent financial management through the cycle and disciplined capital allocation. Despite continued housing market choppiness we delivered resilient results during the third quarter as we continue to execute our strategy and operating model. We are leveraging our fortress balance sheet and free cash flow generation to drive disciplined capital deployment, as witnessed by our share repurchases and acquisitions during the quarter. Our scale and financial flexibility enable us to act as key partners to homebuilders, and we have a clear line of sight to compound value creation over the long term. We are well positioned for meaningful operating leverage when the market turns. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our third quarter results; second, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment; and finally, I'll discuss our 2024 guidance, 2025 scenarios and related assumptions. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter performance on Slides 9 and 10. Net sales were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 6.7%, driven by a 7.2% decline in core organic sales as multifamily continues to trend downward, and 2.9% of commodity deflation. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by growth from acquisitions of 2% and one additional selling day that contributed 1.4%. The organic sales decrease was driven by a 31% decline in multifamily as we lap the prior year's strong comps and a 4.6% decline in single-family amid lower value per start. This was partially offset by a small increase in repair and remodel of almost 1%, given strength in the central region. As we have shared on recent calls, there have been three main variables reconciled single-family starts for organic sales. The first variable is the lag between permits and starts. This quarter, unlike last quarter, we have seen the impact of early permit polls stay where we continue to see a generally extended permit completion cycle time. As a rule of thumb, we expect a roughly two-month lag between the start and our first setting. Second, the value of the average home has fallen as size and complexity have decreased. Finally, we have seen slight normalization in selling margins of non-commodity products and manufacture price cuts in some products. Summarized, although there are sales dollars built for start today, we remain the market leader and will begin to deliver strong operating performance. Value-added products represented 49% of our net sales during the third quarter. As a rule of thumb, our multifamily sales are made up of roughly 70% value-added products. Gross profit was $1.4 billion, a decrease of approximately 12% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 32.8%, down 210 basis points, primarily driven by multifamily and core organic normalization. SG&A increased $19 million to $958 million, primarily attributable to acquired operations and asset write-offs, partially offset by lower variable compensation due to lower net sales. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased 190 basis points to 22.6%. Adjusted SG&A decreased approximately $1 million to $783 million, primarily attributable to lower variable compensation due to lower net sales, partially offset by acquired operations. On an annual basis, adjusted SG&A is approximately 30% fixed and 70% variable with volumes. For reference, we have an adjusted SG&A reconciliation schedule in the earnings release. We are focused on carefully managing our SG&A expenses and are well positioned to leverage our fixed costs as the market grows. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $627 million, down 23%, primarily driven by lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses after adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.8%, down 310 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses after adjustments. Adjusted net income of $360 million was down $174 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses after adjustments and lower income tax expense. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.07, a decrease of 28% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.22 per share for the third quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 11. Q3 operating cash flow was $730 million, an increase of $81 million, mainly attributable to a decrease in net working capital. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $95 million, and free cash flow was approximately $635 million. For the last 12 months ended September 30th, our free cash flow yield was approximately 8% while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 25%. Our trailing 12 months net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.4x, while base business leverage was 1.5x. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $2 billion, consistent of $1.7 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $300 million in cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment. During the third quarter, we repurchased roughly 900,000 shares for approximately $160 million at an average stock price of $176.73 per share. Since the inception of our buyback program in August 2021, we have repurchased 45.5% of total shares outstanding at an average price of $77.62 per share for $7.3 billion. We have approximately $840 million remaining on our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to maximize returns. On Slide 12, we show our 2024 outlook. We anticipate a regional financial impact from Hurricane Helene and Milton, around $40 million in sales, a relatively modest amount given our geographic diversification. For full year 2024, we have narrowed our range of expected total company net sales to be $16.25 billion to $16.55 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.2%. We expect our 2024 full year gross margin guide to be in the range of 32% to 33%. This also remains in line with our long-term expectation of 30% to 33% and normalized single-family starts of $1 million to $1.1 million. We expect full year 2024 full year gross margin guide to be in the range of 32% to 33%. This also remains in line with our long-term expectation of 30% to 33% and normalized single-family starts of $1 million to $1.1 million. We expect full year 2024 free cash flow of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, assuming average commodity prices in the range of $380 to $400 per 1,000 board feet. 2024 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and presentation for a list of these key assumptions. Moving to Slide 14. We recognize that 2025 is coming into focus as we approach year-end. Like we did last year, we have laid out a scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance across a range of potential housing market and commodity conditions. I want to emphasize that this is not guidance, but these scenarios should help clarify our range of performance expectations for 2025 and demonstrate the strength of our best-in-class operating platform. Turning to slides 15 and 16. As a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and resiliency of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales for 2024 is approximately $15.4 billion. Our base business adjusted EBITDA guide is approximately $2.3 billion at a margin of 14%, which reflects a minimal impact from commodities. For context, Slide 16 shows that our 2020 base business adjusted EBITDA was roughly $1.1 billion and 991,000 single-family starts, and we are expecting better adjusted EBITDA at lower single-family starts this year. On Slide 17, we provide a bridge from our 2019 gross margin to the long-term normalized midpoint of 31.5%. Our improved margin profile has a greater mix of value-added products, productivity savings and commercial benefits. As I wrap up, I am confident in our ability to execute our strategy and drive long-term growth by leveraging our exceptional platform and financial flexibility. The Investor Day goals we laid out last December remain achievable, assuming a return to normalized single-family starts of $1.1 million in 2026. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Peter for some final thoughts.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Pete. Let me close by reiterating that we continue to execute. Our resilient business model allows us to win in any environment, and this is evidenced by our strong gross profit margins and cash flow generation in the third quarter. I'm confident in the long-term strength of our industry due to the significant housing underbuilt and favorable demographic trends. We are well positioned to take advantage of these tailwinds, which will help drive growth for years to come as we execute our strategy. We are a key partner to our customers and continue to deepen our value proposition by helping them solve problems through our investments in value-added products, digital tools and install services. Our proven playbook for growth, fortress balance sheet and robust free cash flow generation will help us continue to compound long-term shareholder value. Even in an uncertain and challenging environment, we are doing the hard work now and building for the future. By continuing to grow in value add and install along with leveraging IT and technological development, we are arming our team members with cutting-edge tools to continue to be the supplier of choice for our customers. By investing today, we are exceptionally well positioned to win in the future as the market continues to recover. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, please open the call now for questions. As a reminder, with a lot of questions this morning, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Matthew Bouley: Good morning, everyone. I want to offer my congratulations and best wishes to Dave and best of luck to Peter and Pete. So, for my first question, I wanted to touch on your growth versus the market into these 2025 scenarios. So kind of looking into the second half here, I think the way you guys outlined the guide is, you obviously reduced the revenue guide by a bit while holding the end market guide. So, I'm curious around your balance of share and kind of how you're thinking about that in the near term. But then as you draw it into those '25 scenarios, it looks like you're talking about your growth relatively similar to the start number. So, I'm curious how you're thinking about your growth relative to market as we get into 2025 as well. And if some of these headwinds are starting to abate any visibility to that. I'll stop there, but thank you guys.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Matt. Yes, there's a lot in that question. So, a couple of factors. I would say where we are today, we have certainly seen the choppiness in the market. There wasn't a big relief rally when interest rates were cut, mortgage rates didn't necessarily behave as everyone was hoping in terms of a quick fall. And I think buyers have been appropriately or inappropriately nervous about both rates and the election. So, it's been a little choppy. I think we've seen that. We've been watching it all year. Still performing well. I think the business is still competing well, taking advantage of opportunities, we're investing. Those things have led to, I think, some solid performance on our part, but we have certainly faced headwinds. We've been hopefully pretty open about that. The value of these homes has fallen. That's really the biggest disconnect. when we look at what starts have done and what our sales have done, particularly in that single-family core organic category. That doesn't mean we're not happy and competitive. But certainly, it's been challenging out there, and we've talked about that. As we think about what that means into the fourth quarter and into next year, I think, broadly speaking, it's mixed out there. You've got markets that are doing quite well. They're sort of bouncing up and seeing some green shoots starting to perform. We've got other markets that have struggled and seen headwinds and seen a little bit of excess inventory and builders are reacting in a thoughtful way, we believe, to managing that. So, our guide for the fourth quarter is certainly focused on the visibility that we have into the market, the conversations we're having with customers, it's not a bad market by any stretch, but it's one that has certainly seen some challenges, not at all helped by the weather disruptions that we've seen. As we get into '25, it's early days. We’ve been looking at the commentary from the economists. We've been talking with our customers. It's a bit of a mixed bag, some doing better than others. We think there will be a bit of a differentiated reaction as rates are cut. We expect there will likely be at least a couple of more. We think mortgage rates will continue to settle that will have different advantages to different builders out in the market. So, this is what we're seeing today. There's certainly new news, some of the performance announcements over the past few weeks have saved our opinions as we go forward. But we thought like last year, this is a helpful starting point for helping people understand what we're thinking based on what we see today.
Matthew Bouley: Got it. Thank you for that Peter and for addressing my long question there. Second one, the gross margin guide. I just wanted to confirm that given where the guide is that you're still looking at roughly 31% as the exit rate for 2024. And again, obviously, we can see the margin numbers in your 2025 scenarios. But between some of the pluses and minuses, productivity, value add, install, versus some of the competitive dynamics out there. How are you guys thinking that 31% could drift one way or the other as you go through 2025?
Pete Beckmann: Matt, thank you for the question. We're seeing a headwind as we exit 2024, of about another 100 basis points from the year-to-date average margin, 100 basis points, pretty consistent with what we said last quarter is half of it is made up from the multifamily normalization and the other half from the core business normalization. It is a competitive environment. We're going to continue to compete, especially on the commodity products with the install. Install has been a favorable result for us in 2024, and it continues to be a good arrow in the quiver, and we'll continue to compete every day and we expect to exit right around 31.5. Overall, we're certainly very pleased with the margin performance despite the challenging market, we've seen customers really continuing to benefit from the value-added products and services. That part of our business has certainly stayed strong, stay resilient, and it supported our margins in an environment where volumes are and values are down a little bit.
Matthew Bouley: Got it. Okay, so you said 31.5 is the exit rate. So, I'll leave it there. Thank you, guys.
Pete Beckmann: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: We'll hear next from Charles Perron-Piche with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Charles Perron-Piche: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. First of all, congrats, Dave, Peter and Pete on the promotion and retirement. Well, deserved. Maybe if I can go first to -- going back to Matt's question on the 2025 scenario. I just want to make sure that we understand this correctly, looking at the base case scenarios. It implies approximately 20% incremental EBITDA margin in 2025 once we moved it to $100 million of multifamily headwind. First of all, is that right? And as you see things flowing through next year, how do you see the ability to drive the gross margin versus the SG&A leverage across those scenarios? And just to follow up as well, do you see the deceleration in the sales that you've seen through 2024 in terms of the content per home as stabilizing and expecting through 2025 to be roughly consistent with what you see today in those scenarios?
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Charles. Appreciate the comments and the questions. So, I would say the numbers and the performance of the business around margins in particular, there's a lot going on there, right? With the early look at what we have on the table, I think what it reveals is continuing performance in the areas that you'd expect us to deliver. We expect to see improved performance as a result of productivity initiatives. We continue to see the strength around the value-add. We continue to look for opportunities within that productivity category to drive both gross margins and EBITDA margins. That is, I would say, a core part of our operating model as a business and something you feel good about as time progresses. The dynamics around how the market will perform next year in light of the sales volumes in the various categories. I think broadly speaking, we continue to see weakness in multifamily. I would say our sense of it is it's stabilized, but it's been a big step down from the peak, but gotten to a level where we believe we can hold here and hopefully, start to see some recovery timing will depend on the dynamics of the market. Single family is a dynamic that's different between the types of builders, as I mentioned earlier, but certainly 1 that we think is directionally headed in a positive way. We continue to believe in the strength of the market, the desirability of new homes and the industry's ability to deliver those. We think there's a lot of pent-up demand and we are well positioned to help builders deliver and do it in a very efficient way. This -- again, early days on this guide, but for '25, but we think those scenarios can help add some color in that regard.
Charles Perron-Piche: Okay. That's helpful, Peter. And maybe following up, where product prices in lumber in particular, have been trending higher over the last couple of months with the improving housing outlook for 2025, suggesting potentially more upside. I guess against this, how are you positioning your inventories in the business? And how do you see this recovery in commodity prices affecting demand and competitive dynamics across the different value-add products that you have in your portfolio if this ongoing upswing persist in 2025?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So commodities continue to be an important part of what we do, although we are much smaller than it has in the past. It's nice to see the prices bouncing off the bottom. I'd say that below 400 window that we were in for a while was a bit, I would say, unpleasant more so for the mills and the delivery on the commodity side than for us. But certainly, we like to have a healthy sector in the commodity space and that lumber -- the dimensional lumber in OSB space in particular. We have seen a little bit of a boost I think it's early days. And I would highlight the fact that while new construction is an important driver of demand in that product category, R&R, the Repair and Remodel market is a far bigger influence. So, I think that's where, if I'm looking for support and tailwind in that category, that's an important factor to keep an eye on. You hit the nail in the head, it will certainly be a tailwind for sales and for margins as we see better absorption of our overhead costs. If that continues to increase in costs. Although, as always, we keep a close eye on affordability. We want to balance there. We not think any of us want to return to the $1,300 to $1,600 lumber days. That was pretty dysfunctional. So, a modest increase is, I think, healthy and good to stabilize the market.
Charles Perron-Piche: Okay. Thanks for your time, guys.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: We'll hear next from Mike Dahl with RBC. Please go ahead.
Mike Dahl: Morning, thanks for taking my questions. Congrats again to Dave, Peter and Pete. I want to start with gross margins and maybe a two-parter on both the contributors to the quarter and then thinking about that fourth quarter comment. I mean when you look at the outperformance in gross margin in the quarter, how would you bucket it out in terms of what -- whether or not there was some benefit from the rising wood-based product costs in the quarter versus maybe give us a sense of kind of on the recent M&A, whether the margin accretion from that or install, like if you could quantify any of any of that or kind of digital, really just what the drivers are? And similarly, looking into 4Q, it seems like your outlook slightly better than it than it was before. So, if you can talk to those contributing factors or any quantification there, that would be great.
Pete Beckmann: Morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. With respect to fee performance and margin, we continue to see a normalization in the multifamily space. We continue to have positive uplift from productivity that we continue to deliver. And the rest of it is mix and mix within the core business, and it continues to deliver resilient margins better than what we had expected originally when we gave guidance last quarter. As we look forward to Q4, we continue to see margin normalization in the multifamily, which is a broken record, and we continue to share that each quarter and some continued pressure and normalization in the core business due to the competitive environment that we're still in. And part of it is going to be some of the seasonal build, and we'll see some of that volume kind of shoulder off as we exit the year.
Peter Jackson: Yes. I think Pete's right on in terms of the key drivers. We continue to be under a bit of pressure on the competitive dynamic. You'll see some seasonality but I think, in general, what you're seeing is the continued strength of the core product offerings and the value add in terms of something that we have made a core part of what we do and has continued to be strong.
Mike Dahl: Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then my second question, look, it's on the '25 scenarios, and I understand it is early days, as you say. But when I look across your range of start outcomes. I think some of the builders more recently have been a little more subdued in their outlooks than what some of these ranges would imply certainly the middle or upper ranges. And then taking into account the some of the mix factors that have played out this year, it seems like your revenue guide, it might be suggesting that you actually go back to outpacing the starts environment. So, two kinds of big assumptions in there in terms of some improvement in the overall market and then some improvement relative to that. I was hoping you could talk to that more how you built that and whether or not there are some bigger moving pieces in terms of like, okay, well, you're assuming x for digital and like some carryover M&A. Or maybe just help us kind of bridge when you both -- how you thought about starts, but also then framing your revenue versus starts, what some of those other big moving pieces are?
Peter Jackson: Sure. I can provide a little bit of color. I won't go into too much detail, but you're right. There's a lot that goes into it. No question. I would say the starting point is maybe where we're most maybe disconnected based on your comments and your concern about the overall starts we, at this stage of the game aren't folding in a lot of commentary, we're folding in mainly the economist forecasts and the averages of the leading forecasters around the start numbers. While an individual builder is certainly important and an important partner for us. There's no one builder that's going to move the entire market. So we generally will stay at the economist level forecasting for starts, especially at the point we're at in early November. We do have assumptions in there for commodity prices, for the M&A carryover for productivity. We've got certainly an expectation that we'll be able to gain share with some of the initiatives we've leaned hard into things like digital and install. And I think it's fair to say that our thinking around the average cost per start is aligning around it flattening out for the most part. We haven't seen continued decline. It's been more stable. I would say, since mid-summer on a year-over-year basis, we've certainly seen the comparisons, and we've tried to call those out, but it hasn't been something that's aggressively moved down after the reset earlier this year. So that's another variable that's included. But like I said, early days some high-level analytics, we tried to be inclusive of the variables that we think are important. But as you know, this is a challenging game given how volatile things are lately.
Mike Dahl: Okay, I appreciate that Peter. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead.
David Manthey: Thank you. Good morning and congratulations to everyone. My first question is clarification on Slide 17. When you talk about productivity, does that capture both process improvements as well as scale? And then could you also define other commercial benefits just definitionally for us?
Peter Jackson: Dave, thank you. I'm going to let Pete handle that one.
Pete Beckmann: Yes. So within the productivity savings, that's process improvements. The scale that we get from the company really helps us leverage our knowledge and our expertise across the platform. But the productivity savings is process improvement on how we do things and how well we're buying, how well we're manufacturing and how well we're operating on a daily basis. Within the other commercial benefits of saying that there's customer supplier terms. We've talked about in the past where we used to have longer fixed-price contracts. We've worked to eliminate those, shorten the duration. So we don't get pinched or absorbing all the commodity risk. Our CRM tools that we put in place and how well we're managing our relationships with our customers and falling through, and that's where some of the scale is going to come into play. So you'll see that in the bullets on the side of that chart.
David Manthey: Thank you and Peter Jackson, you might have just described this, but I want to be clear. You talked about the trends in single-family housing sizes. And I'm just wondering, in those scenarios, are you assuming any improvement or deterioration for that matter in any of those scenarios. It sounds like you're seeing that trend basically flatten out. Is that my understanding?
Peter Jackson: That's right. Yes. There are a bunch of pieces in there, certainly square footage of the home being one, but mix of products in the home value of those same products that are appearing in the home, all part of that. But yes, we're expecting it to flatten out based on what we're seeing right now. Little bit of a lapping impact but pretty modest.
David Manthey: That's great. Okay. Thank you very much.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go now to Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Rafe Jadrosich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And best of luck to Dave, and congrats to Peter and Pete. Just on the manufactured product segment, the year-over-year decline -- would it be possible if you could talk a little bit about the impact of the multifamily, specifically multifamily trusses relative to everything else? Like obviously, multi-families sort of going through that normalization. But excluding that, what are you seeing in terms of the manufactured product like revenue trends? And any commentary on margins there would be helpful.
Pete Beckmann: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Peter. What you're seeing in the manufacturing products, specifically on the multifamily side. We've been talking about the normalization, but also the volume declines that we've seen in that multifamily space. As a reminder, I mentioned in our prepared remarks that multifamily may value-added products was 70% of the multifamily overall. That used to be a much higher percent and that's also come down. And in the quarter or what we're seeing within multifamily, manufactured products is down almost 45% to 50% within that multifamily mix. We're anticipating that, that's going to continue to decline as what we're seeing from the starts and the volume normalize as we'd lap the higher year. The tough comps that we had last year was the peak, and Q3 being the highest point of that. It's just a big headwind, but we're seeing more stable volume and it's normalizing at a bottom as we exit the year.
Peter Jackson: Yes. And I think just broadly speaking, the multifamily trust has been hardest hit. The multifamily work part of the business has performed a bit better, been a bit more stable. The team has competed well and found other opportunities to protect the business. I think that the side, the single-family side has certainly seen pressure, particularly in that category that we highlighted in the spoken remarks about floor trusses and the shift back to EWP. I think that's probably the only other color that I would add there. In general, we're still pleased with manufactured products in general. I think it's performing well from a support to customer perspective, from an affordability perspective, from a competitive dynamic, we feel good about and it's a productivity source for us. But it certainly on a comp basis has been challenging.
Rafe Jadrosich: That's helpful. And then just on the gross margin bridge that you provided from 2019 to today, which is super helpful. The value-add portion that can you talk about how much of that is the margins changing within value-add relative to just value-add mix moving higher? And then like is there any changes we anticipate from the value-add margins today going forward?
Peter Jackson: There's a lot in there, right? I mean we've done a ton of acquisitions. We've added a ton of capacity. We've made tremendous investment. A lot of that had to do with productivity savings within the category itself that sort of generated through the size and scale of those operations. So there's certainly a lot in there. The performance generally speaking, I would say, is sustainable from the perspective that we have a lot more to offer. We have a wider portfolio and geography coverage than we did in the past. So I think that's the exciting part about where we can continue to grow this business into the future. That expansion of install, the investments we've made in that business over the years being harvested as we return to growth. I think that's an exciting history for us, but even more exciting is what the future holds in that category.
Rafe Jadrosich: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Philip Ng with Jefferies.
Philip Ng: Hi, guys. Congrats on a solid quarter now, choppy environment. I guess to kind of kick things off. When you look at your scenarios for 2025, is there any assumption that mortgage rates actually pull back from here? And what are you assuming for non-commodity products from a pricing standpoint. And certainly, very great to see an upbeat view on the market in your various scenarios. Peter, it would be helpful to kind of give us some perspective. As you kind of pointed out, the market is still pretty choppy, what that earnings power or margin profile could look like if single-family starts are actually flat to down low single digits?
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Philip, for your four questions. Let me try and jump at a couple of them and you can correct me in point me back in the direction you want me to go. We -- what I would say about the 2025 scenarios, we didn't do a downside. We could do a downside. I think generally speaking, like I said, the economists aren't signalling a downside. So it if that develops over time where we need to put something out there, we certainly can. We've done it in the past. We're not going to be shy about it. That hasn't been the predominant thinking in the recent past. I think that the ability of this business to perform in the downside is pretty positive. We have demonstrated the ability to size ourselves to be competitive to get after it, ability to protect and hold margins to do it by partnering with customers with products that they want. So I think that's probably the theme that I want to go with. You point me in a couple of other points you want me to highlight.
Philip Ng: Your various scenarios, Peter, are you assuming any pullback in mortgage rates and how are you thinking about pricing of your products, not commodity?
Peter Jackson: So we don't have an explicit mortgage rate assumption in any of our stuff. I think what happens is it's basically embedded or implicit in what the economists are doing. My sense is most of them are taking the middle of the road dot plot and trying to step off of that, but we don't have an explicit assumption for it. In terms of pricing, I will say our sense from what we've seen from some vendors is that the era of cuts is ended. What we're seeing right now is stability in pricing in some modest, maybe low single-digit price increases. We'll see where that pans out. It's a little early to be calling that yet, but that's the tone right now.
Philip Ng: Okay. That's super helpful. And then my next question is around M&A. How is the pipeline looking? Have you seen sellers come back to the market with some level of stabilization? And how do you kind of size the opportunities in front of you, smaller or larger deals in general?
Peter Jackson: Well, yes, I mean, there's no question the market is looking strong. I mean with six this quarter, I'd say the pipeline is strong. Smaller deals, by and large it make up this number, no question, but there are a number of really nice looking businesses out there. I would say that sellers have come to the market with an intent to sell. They're not exploring. They're looking to move, but a pretty wide portfolio of items that we're looking at and continue to look at it. It's a good time to be buying stuff.
Philip Ng: Okay. Appreciate all the great color, guys. Thank you.
Operator: We'll hear next from Jay McCanless with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Jay McCanless: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations to everyone and thank you to you guys and your suppliers for helping out with the hurricane relief, really important work. So the first question I had going back to Slide 17, I guess could you talk about what you saw improved from last quarter to this quarter that gave you the confidence to go ahead and move the gross margin number up and the EBITDA margin up?
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Jay. Talking about 17, that's the long range view. So one of the things we had done during Investor Day was to give people a rough estimate around what we think normalized gross margins were going to be between 30% and 33%. A frequent question that we received was wait a minute, help me get my head around this. What are the big pieces that I should understand if I bridge you from pre-BMC merger to what you're telling me is the future of this business. And we were a little hesitant to lay that out there until we have a little better understanding of what normalization was going to look like. And as things have kind of calmed down and we feel like there's a clearer line of sight to what this business is and how it will continue to perform. We decided to put this out for everybody to understand the buckets of what has driven it, where we have gotten our sort of inputs to defend that midpoint of 30% to 33%, which is about 31.5%. So this isn't a Q4 or a '25 thing. This correlates back to the 2026 target for us for Investor Day.
Jay McCanless: Okay. Great. And then I guess the other question I had, Peter, you talked earlier about R&R being a much larger consumer of lumber than single-family starts. I guess could you talk to again what you guys are expecting for R&R this coming year and maybe what the industry kind of outlook is just so we know where things might go?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I mean -- if you look at the overall, I want to -- just to clarify based on what we've seen from a couple of different sources, R&R is probably in DIY is about half of the demand for lumber and sort of the commodity product. We're closer to quarter or third with the rest of it being industrial and commercial. So certainly, that DIY R&R space is more important the tone has been pretty good. I think the sense is that there is a lot of pent-up demand for renovations as the housing stock in this country ages. There are certain commentators will, for example, who's pretty -- I won't say excited, but positive about what R&R can do if we start to see a little bit of pullback in the mortgage rates and it starts to release a little bit of that lock-in effect that people have experienced since mortgage rates went up. So that would certainly be a tailwind a balancing out in the market, I think a revival of what that represents for demand on the construction industry. I think all of that is pretty favorable for Builders FirstSource on balance. So that's certainly a positive we look forward to. Pretty modest and from what we see so far in the forecast for '25 itself, but over sort of '25, '26-ish we think there's good momentum there.
Jay McCanless: Okay. That’s great. Thanks for taking my question.
Peter Jackson: Thanks Jay.
Operator: We'll go now to Jeffrey Stevenson with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Stevenson: Hi, thanks for taking my questions today and congrats, Dave, Peter and Pete. So productivity savings are coming in better than expected this year through efficient manufacturing and procurement initiatives. I just wondered how long a runway do you have on the strong product it savings benefits you've seen over the last few years, and should we expect this trend to continue in 2025?
Peter Jackson: Thanks. Yes. Productivity is something this organization is really engaged in very effectively sharing of best practices, working together on feed ideas, ways of doing business that just takes out waste and inefficiencies at a real fundamental level has been super successful. We think there's more opportunity for that, but I won't overstate the impact of the transition that we'll see over the next couple of years towards our ERP conversion. So there has to be a balance there, both take a lot of time and energy from the organization. So we'll continue to balance it out from a timing perspective. But there's zero question, I would say, in my mind and in the minds of the operating leaders that we can continue to get better, that we can continue to drive productivity savings well into the future. I think we're just in the early innings of what we can do with just a fantastic business and a wonderful platform, particularly as we take advantage of technology and better tools for our teams.
Jeffrey Stevenson: Okay. That's great to hear, Peter. And then I was wondering if you could talk more about the trade-off you're seeing, the lower value products such as an example in your prepared remarks of builders using EWP instead of floor trusses from the focus on lower value in complex home. I just wondered, how widespread is this across regions and do you expect it to continue well into 2025?
Peter Jackson: Well, we're certainly seeing it everywhere. I would say every homebuilder in their own way is trying to adapt to the affordability challenges. It's tough for home buyers just given the world that we live in to afford these new prices. And so we're all looking for ways to do what we do more efficiently. So whether it's size of the home, whether it's value of the products that are going in being a little more sharper with the pencil in terms of pricing or -- and this is, I think, more direct to your comment what's the mix of products that are going to show up in the actual, the home itself. I think you've seen even today announcements from manufacturers of building materials that have pointed to negative mix people have moved to the simpler, cheaper option in order to make sure the price point for these homes match up to the monthly payment capability of the current homebuilder. I think it has been a bit of a two years step down. We're not seeing the continued pace of those declines. They seem to have stabilized to a large degree. That's not to say we won't see some shifts in individual product categories. But I think what we have seen throughout the back half of this year so far, has been a more stable output in terms of what is going into homes, size of the homes, value of the products, that sort of thing.
Jeffrey Stevenson: Very helpful. Thanks, Peter.
Operator: We'll go next to Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.
Steven Ramsey: Good morning. Wanted to ask on the R&R and other category, another quarter of solid organic growth versus the backdrop. I'm curious if you could share a bit more on the central region strength versus other regions? What is allowing you to outperform? And then maybe lastly, just to make my second question wrapped up into this, how much is value-added products a factor in this category? Thanks
Peter Jackson: So maybe second question first. Certainly, a smaller component of the R&R business. That is more varied from a product perspective, a lot more categories go through that. Just given the nature of what we sell and where we sell it. Certainly, a bit of variance between the individual divisions between those markets. I would say we've had some pretty nice success in some of our smaller markets, particularly in the North Central around the R&R space. They performed well. But in general, I think it's a strength for us just as we continue to have available capacity and open our doors to the smaller remodeler. We have a lot of value that we can provide them with subject matter expertise and product knowledge. And generally, we do have success in that category when we focus on it. But just to repeat it, it's a fairly small percentage of our overall business.
Steven Ramsey: Great, thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Steven.
Operator: And we'll hear next from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.
Ketan Mamtora: Thank you. Coming back to multifamily. In -- when you talk about 2025, you've got 400 million to 500 million revenue sort of decline. Is that more of just lapping sort of year-over-year sort of deterioration as you move through 2024? Or are you sort of factoring in sort of further declines in 2025 because it's still a pretty meaningful sort of year-over-year drop?
Peter Jackson: It's primarily lapping. Yes. It's -- I would say we stabilized, but the lapping effect will still be there.
Ketan Mamtora: Understood. And on the margin normalization side, both for multi-family and for single-family. Are you seeing signs that we are sort of closer to the end there in terms of sort of the competitive price pressures? Or is it sort of still continuing as we move into Q4 and next year?
Pete Beckmann: With the multifamily margin normalization, it's continuing to wane and fade. As we said on prior calls, we think it's going to kind of normalize out by Q1 of next year, but we're really hitting that exit rate. And most of the normalization you see in the results is a year-over-year comp to the prior year's strength that we had.
Peter Jackson: I'd say overall, we're in late innings. We're much closer to the end in terms of the margin normalization. We certainly have teed up that 100 basis point sort of based on the exit velocity that we're seeing I don't want to miss the opportunity to highlight we're still well below normal starts. So that certainly creates pressure. But based on where we came from, we believe we're much closer than the beginning.
Ketan Mamtora: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Alex Rygiel with B. Riley. Please go ahead.
Alex Rygiel: Thank you, gentlemen. A very nice quarter. As it relates to the installed sales, which increased about 11% in the quarter, what percentage of your overall net sales is that today? And how does that impact your gross margin?
Peter Jackson: So the 11% is a year-to-date improvement over the prior year. The margin profile on install is kind of at our normal mix across because we're installing products Windows, Doors, Millwork, as well as some framing and trusses and siting and other products. So it's very complementary to the overall margins that we have across all the product categories. Size of install, I think you want to know. So install was about -- I think it was 2.5 billion, 2.6 billion last year. It's increased. So it's going to be a relative increase from that.
Alex Rygiel: And then as it relates to digital tools, given where we are in the housing cycle, how should we think about that as it relates to sort of your marketing of the product and its receptivity to the product?
Peter Jackson: Yes, I'm glad you asked that question. So digital is -- it's still very exciting. The product works -- it is absolutely cutting edge and unique in the industry in terms of what we can do versus any competition that exists out there. But it's new, right? It's technology in an industry that hasn't historically adopted it quickly. And it's a different way of thinking about how to be more efficient. We've got a lot of really good momentum it's certainly hard. I will confess, it's maybe even harder than we gave it credit for, but it's worked. And so we're continuing to lean in, continuing to partner with homebuilders continuing to leverage our team internally to utilize the tools and to help customers get comfortable with the tools. But given our focus on the sort of 50 to 250 starts a year builder, and how much pressure they've been under over the past couple of years because of rates, it's been challenging. I do believe this is one way they can compete, that they can be more efficient that they can be more professionalized and make their business better and more competitive against the big guys. So we think, ultimately, it will be a positive. But certainly, in the near term, it's serving a market that's been under pressure. No question.
Alex Rygiel: Thank you very much.
Operator: As there are no further questions at this time, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session and the Builders FirstSource third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful rest of your day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Please standby. We are about to begin. Good day and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead.
Heather Kos: Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. The earnings press release and investor presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to the presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable, and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings, and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation, and on this call contains forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Rush: Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. As we continue to operate in a complex environment, I'm proud of our resilient second quarter results, highlighted by our mid-teens EBITDA margin, which demonstrates the strength of our differentiated business model, and the hard work of our extraordinary team members. While we continue to see the expected affordability challenges and normalization in multi-family, we are executing our strategy by controlling what we can control, investing in value-added solutions, and driving adoption of our industry-leading digital platform, our ability to solve industry pain points with our best-in-class product portfolio and exceptional customer service makes us a trusted partner as our customers navigate this complex macro landscape. While near-term market dynamics are challenging as starts have lost momentum, we remain focused on executing our strategy in the weeks and months ahead, and we are well-positioned for growth as long-term housing tailwinds remain intact. Moving to our strategic pillars, on slide three, we continue to invest in value-added products, installed services, and digital solutions [technical difficulty] -- we are providing our customers with a more efficient and cost-effective way to manage home construction. This leads to increased customer stickiness, new business, and improved operational efficiency for BFS. We have a robust set of continuous improvement initiatives focused on leveraging our scale while delivering the highest quality products and services to our customers. Our highly experienced team members are delivering these critical initiatives while serving our customers with excellence and integrity every day. Finally, we continue to allocate capital in a disciplined manner with a proven M&A strategy and a track record of buying back shares at attractive prices over the long-term. Turning to our second quarter highlights on slide four, while navigating a market challenged by crosscurrents, we have seen softer than expected sales. However, we delivered strong gross margins of nearly 33% in Q2, and our adjusted EBITDA margin has remained in the mid-teens or better for 13 consecutive quarters. Our durable margin profile is a key proof point of our transformed business model and our differentiated product portfolio and scale. Given the strength of our base gross margin, we see opportunities to more aggressively go after profitable share. We have grown our mix of value-added products over the past five years, improved our manufacturing processes and efficiency, and positioned ourselves at the forefront of homebuilding innovation. Let's move to slide five where we show how we're executing our strategy. Our full suite of value-added products and services remains a competitive advantage for BFS, and continues to bolster our partnerships with customers. We're pleased with our progress on digital as we continue to hear great feedback from customers and see increasing levels of adoption each week. We demonstrated operational rigor by delivering $37 million in productivity savings in Q2, and had driven $77 million year-to-date primarily through more efficient manufacturing and procurement initiatives. As I've spoken about in the past, we continue to use playbooks to drive growth in our Installed Services business. I'm pleased that our installed sales increased by 15% year-over-year as we focus on helping customers address labor challenges. Our managers have best-in-class information to help them navigate this dynamic environment and make effective real-time decisions. We are also maximizing operational flexibility, and have consolidated seven facilities, while maintaining our service levels to our customers with on-time and in-full delivery rate of over 90%. We will remain disciplined managers of discretionary spending no matter the operating environment. We are continuing to take actions into the second-half of the year to flex the business where appropriate. The single-family growth momentum, occurring earlier in 2024, has stalled as the interest rate cuts have not materialized and starts have come in lower than expected. In addition, the value of a new start has fallen as the market has adapted to affordability challenges. Multi-family continues to be a headwind amid muted activity and relative to our record performance last year, which is creating an increasingly tough comparison. This was expected and detailed on prior [calls] (ph) as multi-family continues to normalize. Even at today's levels, multi-family continues to be a very profitable business for us. In the current environment, builders have employed specs, smaller and simpler homes, and interest rate buy-downs to help buyers find affordable options. Builders of all sizes are having to navigate affordability issues along with regulatory, land development and infrastructure challenges. Smaller builders have been especially impacted by the availability of land and limited options to buy down rates. We are partnering with our customers to help them lower the cost of homes for consumers, as well as maintain their margins. This includes balancing our product mix to address their needs while passing through lower material costs. For example, when engineered wood products or EWP was constrained, we supplied a larger number of higher-value floor trusses. As EWP supply normalized and prices came down, we have been able to provide customers with more EWP, and have sold fewer floor trusses, helping to specifically address the builders' biggest challenge, affordability. We have what the builders want and do what's right by them. Although this trend means less sales in gross profit dollars, our margin profile remains strong. We have the operational and financial flexibility needed to partner with our customers to meet their needs and capture growth opportunities. Coming to M&A, on slide six, we continue to pursue attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. In the second quarter, we completed three deals with aggregate 2023 sales of roughly $72 million. In May, we acquired Schoeneman's Building Materials, which we detailed on our Q1 call, and TRS Components which establishes truss manufacturing within Metro Detroit. In June, we acquired RPM Wood Products, which enhances our ability to serve high-end custom builders in Northeast Florida. Finally, in July, we acquired Western Truss & Components, adding truss capacity in Flagstaff, Arizona area, and CRi SoCal, a dealer and installer of high-end windows and doors in Orange County. We are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. Our disciplined approach to M&A includes increasing our market position in desirable geographies, extending our lead in value-added and specialty solutions, and enhancing customer retention. Our M&A pipeline remains healthy, and we believe we can continue to acquire in a fragmented market. On slide seven, we provide an update on capital allocation. In addition to the three tuck-in acquisitions during the second quarter, we repurchased nearly $1 billion of shares. I'm happy to announce that our Board has authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase plan. As proven by our track record, we'll continue to buy back shares while allocating capital to high-return opportunities. We remain on track to strategically deploy $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion of capital from 2024 to 2026, as outlined at Investor Day, last December. Now, let's turn to slide eight and nine for an update on our digital strategy. As the only provider of an end-to-end digital platform in our space, we believe BFS digital tools will be transformative for the industry and a substantial driver of organic growth. We have seen strong adoption and growth with our target audience of smaller builders even as they endure a challenging operating backdrop. We've had broad acceptance of the platform so far, including interest from multiple top 200 builders. Since launching in late February, we have seen the value of orders placed through the digital platform go from nearly 0 to over $250 million. Year-to-date through Q2, incremental sales have totaled $45 million. While we still have a long way to go, we remain confident in our ability to meet our target of $1 billion in incremental sales by 2026, as we grow wallet share and win new customers. I am thrilled to share a significant achievement that underscores our team members' commitment to making a positive impact in our communities. At our recent annual charity event, we successfully raised over $1 million on behalf of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. This brings total contributions to nearly $12 million since first partnering with LLS in 2006. These funds are crucial to advance in research, patient support, and advocacy programs aimed at finding treatments and cures for blood cancers. I want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our industry partners and sponsors whose overwhelming support made this successful event impossible. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results in greater detail.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We were able to effectively navigate a softer than expected housing environment during the second quarter by leaning into the pillars of our strategy and operating model. Leveraging our fortress balance sheet and exceptional financial flexibility, we executed nearly $1 billion of share repurchases into stock price weakness. And, made three tuck-in acquisitions to enhance and expand our footprint. We believe the sustainable competitive advantages and our extensive geographic coverage, value-added solutions, and strong financial position are enabling us to successfully manage market dynamics and deliver long-term value creation. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our second quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our revised 2024 guidance and related assumptions. Let's begin by reviewing our second quarter performance on slides 10 and 11. Net sales were $4.5 billion. A decrease of 1.6% as core organic sales declined 3.8% with the expected multi-family downward trend. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by growth from acquisitions of 1.9% and commodity inflation of 0.3%. The core organic sales decline was driven by a multi-family decline of 31%. Partially offset by increases in single-family of 1% amid higher starts and repair & remodel of 1.5%. I want to take a moment to discuss the variables impacting the disconnect between single-family start and core organic sales. As a reminder, historically there is a roughly two-month lag between a start and our first sale. In the current environment, we are seeing that lag extend as the relative timing of permit starts and completions has shifted in response to the changing market. Second, we have seen a meaningful decline in the sales opportunity of a start in 2024 as the size, complexity, and value of the average home has fallen. These changes are logical given the affordability challenges in the market. But, it means that we are seeing less dollars per start despite our strong operating performance. As an example, looking at the Phoenix market we are supplying material to roughly 45% more homes. But, our dollar sales are only about 15%. To summarize, despite a market where starts are smaller, less complex, and cheaper, we remain the market leader and will continue to deliver superior results. During the second quarter as we signaled and expected, multi-family declined more than 31% as we lacked the prior-year's strong comps. R&R and Other improved by over 1% given our retail strength in the faster growing West. Value-added products still represented approximately 49% of our net sales during the second quarter, despite the headwinds from multi-family. Gross profit was $1.5 billion. A decrease of approximately 8% compared to the prior-year period. Gross margins were 32.8%, decreasing 240 basis points, primarily driven by ongoing normalization, particularly in multi-family. SG&A decreased $45 million to $973 million, primarily attributable to lower variable compensation, partially offset by acquired operations. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased 70 basis points to 21.8%. The team has done an excellent job of managing SG&A, and we are well positioned to leverage our fixed costs as the market grows. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $670 million, down approximately 13%, primarily driven by lower gross profit, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 15% down 200 basis points from the prior year. On a sequential basis, adjusted EBITDA margin was up 110 basis points, primarily driven by operating leverage, partially offset by lower gross margin. Adjusted net income of $420 million was down $78 million from the prior year primarily due to lower gross profit partially offset by lower operating expenses. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.50, a decrease of 10% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.22 per share for the second quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow balance sheet and liquidity on slide 12. Our Q2 operating cash flow was approximately $452 million, an increase of $61 million, mainly attributable to a decrease in net working capital and more than offsetting almost a $100 million decline in adjusted EBITDA. This is a proof point of how our business generates a robust amount of cash in any environment. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $85 million, and free cash flow was approximately $367 million. For the last 12 months ended June 30th, our free cash flow yield was approximately 10%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 24%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.4 times, while base business leverage was 1.7 times. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.7 billion, consisting of $1.6 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility, and approximately $100 million in cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment, during the second quarter, we repurchased roughly 5.8 million shares for approximately $990 million at an average stock price of $170.01 per share. Since the inception of our buyback program in August of 2021, we have repurchased 45% of total shares outstanding at an average price of $76.65 per share for $7.1 billion. As Dave mentioned, the board approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up to $1 billion of common stock. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to maximize returns. Now let's turn to our outlook on slide 13, which we are lowering, given a softer than anticipated housing market and weaker commodities. For full-year 2024, we expect total company net sales to be $16.4 billion to $17.2 billion versus our previous range of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion versus the previous range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be in the range of 13.4% to 14% versus the previous range of 14% to 15%. And we are updating our 2024 full-year gross margin guidance to the range of 31.5% to 32.5% from 30% to 33%. This also remains in line with our long-term expectations of 30% to 33% at normalized single-family starts of 1 million to 1.1 million. Our long-term margin profile reflects a greater mix of value-added products, recent acquisition and disciplined pricing management. We expect full-year 2024 pre-cash low of $1 to $1.2, assuming an average commodity price in the range of $380 to $400 per thousand board feet. Our 2024 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and slide 14 of the investor presentation for a list of these key assumptions. While we do not typically give quarterly guidance, we wanted to provide color for Q3, given ongoing housing uncertainty and multi-family normalization. We expect Q3 net sales to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $575 million and $625 million in Q3. Turning to slides 15 and 16, as a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and resiliency of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business, where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales for 2024 is approximately $16.8 billion. Our base business adjusted EBITDA guide is approximately $2.3 billion at a margin of 13.7%, which reflects a roughly net zero impact from commodities. For context, slide 16 shows that our 2020 base business adjusted EBITDA was roughly $1.1 billion at 991,000 single-family starts. And we're expecting better adjusted EBITDA at lower single-family starts this year. As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that our exceptional positioning and financial flexibility gives us the confidence in our ability to execute our strategy and drive long-term growth. The Investor Day goals we laid out in December remain achievable, assuming a return to normalized single-family starts of $1.1 million in 2026. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts.
Dave Rush: Thanks, Peter. Let me close by reiterating that we continue to execute as evidenced by our strong profit margins and cash flow generation. Our resilient business model allows us to win in any environment. In 2020, we had an 8.7% base business adjusted EBITDA margin at 991,000 single-family starts. This year, we expect the mid-teens adjusted EBITDA margin at a lower level of housing starts. This demonstrates the resiliency of our transformed business and is a strong base to build from as the housing market grows to meet demand. I am confident in the long-term strength of the industry due to the significant housing underbill and favorable demographic trends. We are well positioned to take advantage of those tailwinds, which will help drive growth for years to come as we execute our strategy. We believe we are the unquestioned leader in addressing our customers' pain points through our investments in value-added products, digital tools, and installed services. Our proven playbook for growth and robust free cash flow generation will help us continue to compound long-term shareholder value. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Matthew Bouley: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe we will start on the gross margin side, looking at the new margin guide and the cadence that you are implying for the second-half, I am curious as we zoom into the fourth quarter, what that would imply for the exit rate around gross margins? And certainly what I'm getting at is, as we think about 2025, where your starting point on gross margins would be as you continue to highlight that the overall 30 to 33 guide, the long-term guide is kind of at normalized housing starts, and certainly it begs the question, if we're not quite at normalized housing starts yet in 2025, where the gross margin could land if there's an air pocket, given the starts outlook? Thanks, guys.
Peter Jackson: Morning, Matt. Thank you for the question. Yes, so margins has been an important factor for us. It's changed a lot over the years. We certainly get a lot of questions on it. We're pleased with how margins have performed so far, right? We knew normalization was going to happen. We saw it coming particularly on the multi-family side, but we're certainly pleased with how it's progressed. If you look into the future, into the second-half of this year and into next year, more normalization is what we've outlined. And I think that we've been pretty clear about that. Hopefully no change in what expectations are. When it comes to '25 and the exit rate, so I want to be real clear, right, we don't have a crystal ball, we don't know. This is not intended to be guide for '25. We haven't done that work yet. But based on what we're seeing right now, we're coming out of this year at roughly 975 on starts, give or take. Based on that, we're kind of at that level of performance that we're guiding to, right in that 32% range. As you think about 2025 based on what we're seeing right now, we think it's probably another 100 basis points at this level, like if you just extend the line out you'd see another 100 basis points of headwind into 2025 made up of the two pieces you'd expect, right? About half of that is multi-family, and about half of that is core operations based on what we're seeing. So, we're definitely closer to the end than the beginning in terms of the normalization based on what we see. The multi-family is a story, no question. We think that if you look back to last year, we called out a little over 100 basis points of tailwind from multi-family. We'll give back 60, maybe a little -- right in that range basis points in '24, with the other 50 basis points coming in '25. That's probably about a couple hundred million dollars worth of EBITDA headwind from multi-family. And we feel like the rest of the business is performing really well, and we'll be in a strong position to overcome that as we get into '25.
Dave Rush: Matt, the only thing I'd add is our focus and continuing focus on doing more for the customer with installed, doing more for the customer with value-add, those are higher margin profile products that we held, all said, any start variation.
Matthew Bouley: Got it. Okay, that's very helpful quantification and color. And that dovetails into my next question. So, if I look at the total EBITDA guide for the year, I guess it's down about $300 million at the midpoint. But the base business EBITDA guide is only down by $100 million. So, I guess, presumably, the change in commodity prices is actually the largest change in the guide. I just want to clarify if that's the case. And if so, when we're talking about the kind of stability on the value-add side, can you speak to what has specifically changed in just the value-add outlook in terms of the growth side, starts, and specifically value-add margins, just what's really driven that piece of the guidance change there? Thank you.
Peter Jackson: All right, so one question in 26 parts; let's see if I get them all.
Matthew Bouley: Of course.
Peter Jackson: So, overall, you're right, we have seen a shift in commodities, right? So the market's been weaker, the -- both lumber and OSB, OSB kind of ran up for a little bit, had absolutely reset and pulled back. That is largest component of the dollar value change in sales that we've called out. So, of the $1.2 billion, more than half of that is just the commodity valuation change. What that means to the business in terms of the rest of the output called down on EBITDA, the bulk of EBITDA call-down is deleveraging, it's the vast majority of it, right? It's the smaller business absorbs less of the fixed overhead costs. You can see this quarter; we had some pretty substantial improvement just because we are busiest in the summer months. We thought we'd be busier in the back-half than we're going to be, so we're giving some of that back. Value-add, more specifically, we continue to see strength. We continue to see the volumes moving very well, the demand is very strong; customers have consistently stayed with the product. We haven't seen a shift away from value-add broadly. What we are seeing and what we pointed out here -- what Dave pointed out in his remarks was really this mix dynamic, right? It goes to the customers focusing on affordability, how do they get cost out? One of the ways they're doing that is a shift within value-add, shifting from open-web truss to EWP, that's just -- it's a lower sales dollar value product, right? It's combined with a lot of other things. They're shrinking the square footage of the house, they're taking out basements, they're reducing the number of garages and bonus rooms. All things that are not a surprise, if you think about the affordability challenge. But that has had a broad pressure, that's not unique to value-add or not value-add. I think where value-add has seen pressure is really around the price pass-through in that type of mix. Volumes are still strong. Margins are still strong on the core product categories.
Dave Rush: One thing I would add on the value-add components specifically, Matt, is even as truss volumes declined our ability to more efficiently manufacture increases. As we go from two shifts to one shift, our second shift is the least profitable, for obvious reasons, but you put up with that because you leverage 100% of the fixed costs. When we go to one shift, that's our most profitable shift, so even as the top line may be less because of the demand being less, the ability to maintain margins is actually easier because we're most efficient in that one shift.
Matthew Bouley: Great. Well, appreciate the color. Thanks, Dave, Peter. Good luck, guys.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: We'll hear next from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.
Mike Dahl: Hi, and thanks for taking my questions. Probably going to just follow-up on a couple things there, look, Peter, I know that it's not a practice of yours to give pinpoint estimate on margins or certainly not to give formal guidance a year out at this point in the year. But I just want to be crystal clear on your last comment about exit rate in '25 gross margin just because there's been so much handwriting over this. When you're talking about -- it seems like you're saying, "Hey, if my midpoint is 32% for this year, maybe my midpoint or my starting point in '25 is 31%." Or said another way, maybe my exit rate in 4Q of '24 is around 31% gross margin. Was that the intended message or could you clarify that a little bit more specifically on the 4Q gross margin here?
Peter Jackson: Morning, Mike. In short, yes, you got it right. You heard it right. We think we're around 32% this year. We think our exit rate is around 31% based on everything we're seeing today. This is not guide. It's not intended to be a crystal ball; it's just trying to give directionality. The short answer to that, and I think you've alluded to it, and so did Matt, our long-range normalized margins we're seeing are 30% to 33% at 1.1 million starts. This would indicate that we're going to be at 31% at 975,000 starts. What does that mean? Well, that means, right now, margins are strong. Ours are good. Ours are better than we expected, which is great. But it also means we're under pressure in a market that's got extra capacity versus what we're all dialed in for, which is 1.1 million-plus, right? So, that's the tug of war going on right now, and why we're not able to put our stake in the ground and claim it. We've got to see how this plays out. Pretty optimistic, like Dave said, about the overall market, the demos, the under build, it's good. That we think tone is playing out maybe belatedly but positively in terms of the interest rate environment right now. So, we'll see. But it's a strong business. It's really well-positioned, and margins look good.
Mike Dahl: Okay, yes, that's helpful. And look, I agree and appreciate the zooming out and the perspective about the, hey, even if we're talking about 31%, it's 31% at these depressed levels of volume, which is longer-term actually quite constructive. Just shifting gears, all this stuff around the mix, the complexity, I -- this is, I think, another part that's hard for all of us and investors to appreciate when we're building out a model that tends to be volume focused. And so, I guess when you're -- all the moving pieces there, is there a way for you to articulate, hey, it's all equal, what we're seeing on the mix changes and complexity changes to date or to hold, here's how much of a delta we think it would drive relative to, if I think my single-family starts are low single, is that a -- is it a low single-digit headwind against that? Is it a mid-single digit headwind against that, any, any help you could provide on just kind of ballparking that and would be great?
Peter Jackson: Yes, so that's -- it's a great question. We spent a lot of time on this. As we spend a lot of energy, we're trying to understand our business at a granular level. We have a lot of data. Unfortunately, it's a lot of data, right? So, the ability to really understand the mix impact of hundreds of thousands of SKUs at 570 locations in 80 markets, it's sometimes an adventure to really get through the noise to get the signal. I think earlier this year, you saw us reacting to what we were seeing, trying to understand it. I think the storyline around this whole value conversation is that the order of magnitude is bigger than we expected. I think the storyline around the timing of starts versus permits is again, order of magnitude, a little bigger than we expected. So, Q2, if you use our roughly two month lag, we've got about a 20 point gap that we're tracking down that we're saying, why aren't we up a lot more? And it's broken down into a few pieces, right? Probably the single biggest piece is we think that the lag between permits and starts is a bit longer. The cycle time is a little longer. You saw large builders pulling large quantity of permits and doing it to beat code changes, doing it to beat the rush. Everybody thought the market was going up. And they haven't put those starts in the ground as quickly as the traditional custom builders would have. And I think we all know the large nationals, the big guys are winning, right? They've got a bigger share of the pie. We think that's causing a little bit of distortion in the starts number, that, that will settle out as the year progresses. But at least early on, it overstated starts a bit. The other pieces are pieces we've talked about, right? Maybe another third of it is probably related to the pricing changes. A lot of that is vendor. Vendors have cut. We talked about EVP, Doors, Millwork. There are a bunch of categories that have had to readjust to the current demand and they have adjusted prices in response. So, that's an important piece. And another roughly third is in that category of mix, right? It's what we're seeing in terms of, if you think about the traditional good, better, best, you're talking about best to better, better to good, good to let's not do it. It's that things we were talking about before with regard to going from basement construction to slab may not sound like a big deal, but that percent is changing in the statistics and that has a meaningful decline in the value of product that goes into the house. So, rough categories, that's kind of how we think about it, but I'd be lying if I told you we had those numbers with precision. I think we've got good directionality, but we're going to have to see how that plays out. The interesting part of all of it, though, Mike, is it's so volatile, right? It moved quickly one way. There's no reason it can't move quickly the other. We're just going to stay close to it and make sure we're serving our customers the best we can.
Dave Rush: The only thing I would add, Mike, is it's primarily a top-line scenario for us that we have to manage through. Our margins, regardless, have stayed very consistent and very strong, and we're appreciative of that. But the best example is the one that Peter gave in Arizona. Forty-five percent number of houses that we've started, 15% is the increase in revenue. You can do that math and say in Arizona it's 30% impact. But at the end of the day, it varies depending on the market. What we're seeing, though, is we have the levers that we can pull to get the sale, depending on what the customer chooses to use to solve their problem. And at the same time, we're able to hold our margins because of having that ability to provide an alternative solution that works for both.
Mike Dahl: Got it. That's all really helpful. Thank you both.
Dave Rush: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: We'll go next Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America.
Rafe Jadrosich: Hi, good morning. It's Rafe. Thanks for taking my question. Peter, I appreciate all the color so far and how we should think about the margin progression here. Just following up on the earlier comments about 60 basis points of headwinds from multi-family in '24 and another 50 basis points roughly in '25, how much of that is normalization of the multi-family margins off of excess levels versus multi-family mix. And how do you think about the multi-family margins today? Like how much have we seen a normalization off of the elevated margins you've had in the past? How much more is there to go?
Peter Jackson: Good morning, Rafe. Thanks for the question. Yes, so the dynamic around the multi-family is a tricky one. We've tried to be really open and honest about what we're seeing, but it's not convenient in terms of how it's playing out. In other words, it didn't just stop on January 1st and we didn't have a nice clean turn. So, I don't have nice clean numbers last year or this year. So, there's a little bit of this you're probably going to poke at, but I can give you sort of my best sense of the directionality. We continue to see strong business in multi-family throughout all of last year that really began to turn in that Q1 window. We are seeing meaningful declines in our margins in what we're seeing starting in Q1 and stronger in Q2, kind of that 50 to a 100 basis points in those periods headwind driven by multi-family, right? That's sort of the combination of the mixed shift because it's all value-added and that downward shift within the category. So, with that in mind, we do expect it to continue this year. I think I mentioned from a dollar perspective, Q2 is going to be a chunky one, right? That was going to hurt a lot and obviously it did, but we will continue to see headwinds throughout the year. Again, with that kind of rough average of around 60 basis points, 50 to 70, give me a band around it based on timing, but overall impact on the company from the full multi-family segment of our business.
Rafe Jadrosich: Thank you. That's helpful. And then, you had an -- in the prepared remarks, there's a comment that I thought was interesting. They're talking about how given the strength of the base gross margin, you sort of see more opportunity to go after profitable shares going forward. How do you think about how your market share trended is kind of in the first-half of this year? And do you expect any changes going forward? And does any of that have to do with some of the mixed impacts that you're thinking about? Have you seen Builders multi-source more? Has that been a headwind? And then going forward, do you expect to try to take market share? Like, what are your expectations there?
Dave Rush: Rafe, this is Dave. I would tell you what we're looking at is a disciplined approach, right? We want to identify opportunities where it's a volume where we have an opportunity to have a win-win with our customer, where we can leverage that incremental volume against our fixed costs, whether it be manufactured product or even distributed product, and offset the volume incentive that we may use to go after that business. So, it will be a targeted approach. It'll be a disciplined approach. It will be only where the volume makes sense. And there has to be a win-win solution there. Thankfully, we had all the guys in the first part of July, and that was the focus of the meeting. And they all had a plethora of opportunities. They felt that description, and we're going to execute that strategy in the back half.
Rafe Jadrosich: Thank you. I appreciate it.
Dave Rush: Thanks, Rafe.
Operator: We'll go next to Trey Grooms with Stephens, Inc.
Trey Grooms: Hey, good morning, everyone. I appreciate all the color you've given thus far. And this one's I guess so on just the -- on lumber, kind of the competitive pricing that we've seen on the commodity lumber side. Nothing new, but wondering if you're seeing this become more widespread or intense, given the kind of weaker environment. But also, on the trusses and value-add, with multi-family pulling back, which was clearly taking up a lot of that supply, are you seeing any more competitive behavior on the truss side or value-add side now that multi-family has started to normalize?
Dave Rush: Hey, Trey. Thanks for the question. On the commodity part of the question, we always see the players in the marketplace that take commodities too low because it's all they have to offer. And we're not choosing to play in that game. What we will do, though, is partner with our customers that commodity becomes part of a package, and we value the overall packaging and create incentives to buy all products from us, whereby through the value-add piece of that package, we can earn back a level of whatever volume incentive we provide. So, our focus on building share has still got to be a win-win. It's not going to be only a win for the customer or only a win for BFS. It won't be sustainable if that's the way you approach it. With specifically the value-add, where we still and will maintain an advantage is over our efficiencies. We have continued to drive efficiencies, and I said in the earlier comment, if we're in one shift, we're as efficient as we can possibly be when we're one shift. So, we have the ability to leverage incremental volume in that idle capacity and, again, create a more profitable net-net number for us, even as we provide an incentive to customers for the incremental volume. So, that's kind of how, even as we've managed and tried to pick opportunities to drive the top line, we've been able to hold on to the market.
Trey Grooms: Yes. That's helpful. I heard Peter mention something about price pass-through, and I think it was when you were talking about the value-add side, just trying to make sure I understand what that comment meant.
Dave Rush: I'll answer it, then I'll let you follow up. That's actually when we get a cost reduction from our vendors on products, and we immediately pass that through. It is, again, impactful on the top line because now we're selling a lower-cost product, but our margin profile is not impacted, and we're kind of operating under the same model from a profitability standpoint. Is that right?
Peter Jackson: Yes. Just to echo that same thought, we do stay very focused on making sure we're acting in a disciplined manner with our customers in key categories. As commodities, we pass it all through. A little color on that, I guess. I'm a bit disappointed. I would have hoped to have seen a lumber industry be a little more intentional about making money. Not everyone is a bad actor in that category, but I remain -- I continue to be surprised at how many players are willing to sustain loss or losing bills, business units, whatever you want to call it, longer than I would have expected. There's an awful lot of weeping and gnashing of the teeth out there, but not a lot of behavior that would indicate that we're moving in the right direction. Hopefully, we will, but that's disappointing. I think what you see are weaker lumber numbers that we absolutely pass through to our customers. What I was referring to before are certain price cuts that we've seen, specific actions taken by EWP players, Doors players, Millwork players, and some others where we've seen low to mid-single-digit reductions in overall sales attributable to nothing else than customer -- the prices we give our customers are adjusted because of the prices we're charged by our vendors.
Trey Grooms: Yes, got it. Just a quick one for my follow-up, there's very I guess, differing views on kind of the multi-family outlook and maybe how quickly that could take to normalize. I'd love to maybe get your thoughts on that. I think you mentioned there may be a little bit more headwind to come in 2025, but any color on maybe the timing of when we might see that stabilization and multi-family? And then, I know it's hard to say, but directionally, do you think we could see maybe a pretty quick rebound there after it does find some stabilization, or do you feel like we could tread water there at that much lower level there for a while?
Dave Rush: Yes, Trey. I'll tell you the dynamic we've seen in 2024 is, in addition to people hesitant to start new projects, we've actually seen existing projects get delayed and pushed pretty consistently throughout the year. The project's still on the board. The project's still going to get done, but it's getting pushed, which, quite frankly, was part of the top-line headwind in the first-half, even though multi-family's a small piece of the overall. New projects take so long to get underway that I think the order that has to happen is we have to have the cost of capital come down. Then there's going to be new projects that come out of the ground, but they're going to take a while to get going. The one thing we are seeing, though, is a gap currently that is in favor of multi-family, where rental rates are now less than mortgage rates for essentially the same type of living arrangement. So, a lot of the excess capacity that we feel like we came into the year with, with multi-family, we do believe will burn off during the rest of this year, which will encourage a quicker rebound in multi-family in 2025. The problem is it just takes so long.
Trey Grooms: Yes. Okay. Thanks for the color, Dave. I really appreciate it.
Dave Rush: Truss wood is still a very profitable business for us at these levels and will continue to be at the levels we expect to have through 2024 and into 2025.
Trey Grooms: Great. Thank you very much.
Dave Rush: Thanks, Trey.
Operator: We'll go now to Adam Baumgarten with Zelman.
Adam Baumgarten: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just on the value of new starts declining, I guess, could you give us a sense for -- I know you gave the Phoenix example, but maybe overall what it's down and how much of that's from smaller square footage and how much of it is that lower mix of value at?
Peter Jackson: Good morning, Adam. Honestly, to know that answer with precision, I'd probably call you guys. We know there are data points that prove our point. What we don't have is confidence in the individual buckets. It's way too volatile and way too customer specific, regionally influenced for us. But again, if we're missing 20 points in terms of where is that sale, I think directionally, the biggest third is on the extended time, it's taking between permit and sale. We know another chunk of it is on the value, just the price is charged and the rest of it is that mix component. It's square footage. It's smaller. It's cheaper. Five to seven, I don't know. I'm guessing, to be honest.
Dave Rush: We've done enough proof points to know that it's a thing, right? It's harder to decide what part of what aspect is -- for example, we took a bid for a national builder from last year and compared the exact same house, the exact same model this year. And it was down mid-teens in overall sale opportunity in the exact same house. So, we don't have that in every market and every builder, but at the end of the day, again, it was another proof point that what we suspected was happening is actually happening. And directionally, we know what we're dealing with. And again, as that changes, the encouraging thing is the margin profile is not also changing. And that's -- I'd love to have all the volume that we could possibly get, but at the end of the day, I at least want to keep the balance between what we're selling and what we're making and what we're selling and check along the way.
Adam Baumgarten: Okay, got it. Thanks. And then, just a couple more, just on the digital sales, the incremental sales, you expect in '24, I think you've talked about $200 million in the past. Is that still expected for the year? And then, just on M&A, any changes in the strategy there given the increase in the share repurchase activity and authorization?
Dave Rush: Yes. Let me talk a little about digital. As we started to roll out the digital and the adoption, I think it probably isn't a surprise that we have gone first to our employees. And we've gotten them up to speed on the benefits of digital. So, they can more fully explain to their customers; the customers that we've gone to initially have been existing customers. So, it's while we give you that stat of orders through the system of $250 million, now we expect fully that existing customers push in orders through the system. That business we probably -- we have already had, we would have still gotten had we not had digital. But we still want to track it. It's an indication of acceptance. And so, the incremental business we get is going to come more from new customers, and as we continue to get existing customers more comfortable, incremental wallet from those guys. But, that obviously is going to be more in the form of a hockey stick. So, no, we are not giving up on the $200 million for this year. At this point in time, it is admittedly a tougher point to get a little bit to the hockey stick. But we still know that hockey stick is going be there. And, the acceptance for getting even as it is from existing customers is really encouraging. I'll let Peter talk to the M&A piece.
Peter Jackson: Yes, I 100% agree on digital. It is encouraging. The momentum is good. On M&A, the momentum is good there too. I think you've seen the increasing number of acquisition targets that we are closing on. Still little bit smaller, but we really like to pace. The pipeline still looks very good. We are still pleased with the potential targets out there. And, the way that negotiations are going. Certainly, very optimistic about our ability to continue to grow the business in a healthy way with really, really nice assets like the ones we added this quarter.
Adam Baumgarten: Great. Thanks. Best of luck.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: We'll hear next from David Manthey with Baird.
David Manthey: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Peter, in your non-guidance, that 31% gross margin exiting the year, when you talk about the 2025, you said 100 basis points of headwinds. Fifty from multi-family makes sense. But then the other 50, is that corporations? And, just wondering if could explain that a little bit more. Is that just lower operating leverage because it will lower levels of starts and raw demand, or is that something else?
Peter Jackson:
,:
David Manthey: Got it, okay. Then on the EBITDA margin, in the base business which you raise by 20 basis points to 13.7%, could you share with us the source of your increased confidence despite the kind of lackluster macros here? And also, I assume that your 2026 ranges in that 14 for midpoint is intact as well? Is that right?
Peter Jackson: So, the second-half of the question, yes, our '26 is still intact. We would need volumes to rebound, but we feel good about the core business. And I think that informs where we are dialing in on the EBITDA number for that base business comp. We are getting better and better clarity around what our margin profile looks like in a healthy market, what our profile looks like in the current market, and being able to dial in the breakout from commodities kind of seeing the full-year really leveling out right around that 400 level without a ton of volatility, a bit, but not a ton is giving us the ability to dial it in a little bit more to what we think is a real sort of neutral commodity level or performance. Core business is still very healthy. As much as we wanted to be bigger, I think, what you're seeing here and what their base business chart lays out is a business that's really been transformed based on what we sell and how we service our customers, and the stability of that core business, even though you've seen kind of some ups and downs in the starts performance at the overall market.
David Manthey: Sounds good. Thank you very much.
Dave Rush: Thank you, Dave.
Operator: We will go now to Reuben Garner with The Benchmark Company.
Reuben Garner: Hi. Good morning, everybody. I'd like to harp on the multi-family, but I do have a quick follow-up about the top line for next year. I think your business is where multi-family starts are little over 40% off the peak level, but I think your business is limited to 25% to 30% range. Does that imply that at this current run rate for starts we have another 10 to 15 points of top line pressure within your multi-family business in '25?
Dave Rush: So, that's a tough question. It's very specific. Greetings, Reuben. Thank you for the question. Appreciate it. The question is very specific, and I'm not sure I can go all the way down, what I say is we do expect there to be lapping of the rest of the decline in multi-family. So, certainly we expect there to be continued headwinds on the sales line, kind of in that maybe 400-ish range, based on what we are seeing now, and around 200 of headwinds on the EBITDA line for multi-family, but remember, multi-family is all in. You got the full portfolio of multi-family products when we are talking about multi-family. I know in the past I've thrown out some color around truss. I'm going to try not to do that anymore, because I think I just muddy the waters, but when we are talking about the total, based on what we are seeing today, I would say that's the trend now. Certainly some headwind, but multi-family is only a 11% of our business this year. It's going to climb a little bit further next year in maybe smaller percentage, it's just a declining impact on the overall, as it strings back and kind of normalizes. Does that answer your question?
Reuben Garner: Yes, it does. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, can you update us pre-2020, the way it would work is the builders would set up a contract that you guys I think, at the time it averaged somewhere between 60 and 120 days for the framing package, and during the last few years that strung significantly. Are we still -- the length of this contract is still in the 30-day range and lined up with inventory. Are we seeing that move that all with kind of the reset of the commodity market?
Peter Jackson: It's still in the range with how we buy our inventory, which is what we have always tried to do. As long as we have the ability to cover what we soiled, we are willing to work with our builders however we need to match that up, also, with how they priced their homes. And it hasn't gotten to the point where it was 90-plus or whatever. But we are generally in a 45-day exposure rate, but that's exactly how much inventory we hold and how we carry it.
Dave Rush: Yes. There has only been some pressure back. There are certain players that have been less disciplined. We've definitely tried to hold the ground on what we think is good, smart way of coding in the market, but today's point, we've tried to increase those 30 days numbers we talked about, back during sort of the busyness of the supply chain issues, where you really had to move it quick. Now that we are back into more of a normal cadence, where we got that 45-day-ish line of sight, if you will, between what's on the ground, what's on the order, it's a lot easier to work with customers and tie it together and use some 60-day terms, that sort of thing. We are still absolutely opposed to 90 and 120-day terms, because we think that's the wrong discipline and the wrong way of approaching the market.
Peter Jackson: Well, and at that point, we actually do take market risk. I mean, what we are trying to do is mitigate their risk and mitigate our risk; we work with them to try to find that middle ground and make sure that they're covered and we are covered. And we'll adjust off of that, and touch markets specific if that solve the problem for our customer. But in general, we are in that 45-day range.
Reuben Garner: Exactly where I was getting at; thanks, guys. Appreciate it, and good luck going forward.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Reuben.
Operator: We will go now to Jay McCanless with Wedbush.
Jay McCanless: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one I had, when you think about lumber prices in the way you guys look at it, talking about $400 kind of being the base assumption, could you talk about what deflation you're seeing in 2Q '24 versus where it was 2Q '23?
Peter Jackson: We called it out in terms of what went through COGS. It was just basically zero, right, at 23 or whatever, small 3% headwind. That is something that does move a little out of sequence with what you see in random blanks. It is going to be a headwind in the second-half versus first-half, which is how you get to that sort of full-year number that's a little below the 400 level.
Jay McCanless: Okay, thank you. And then, the other question I had, if you look at -- I came with slide a ton, but commodity number was up I think, 13% in sales for the second quarter, that's almost double the rate of single-family starts growth that the census numbers had for the national readings as well the south readings, I guess, with these in general serving down a little bit, are you trying to outgrow and take even more market share on the commodity side until value-add maybe comes back a little bit, because those were pretty impressive numbers, where of the rest of the market was?
Peter Jackson: Well, Jay, we always wanted to take all the shares about that comment. Now, in all honest and all sincerity, we always see a couple month lag, and if you think about the Q1 starts number, that was up in the 20s. So, you are just that swash over a little bit into Q2. We are seeing a comparable performance in the business. We will certainly see a graphic, like Dave said. We think when there're opportunities to lean in and take share, we are going to keep doing it. But that's not really the explanation, if you will.
Jay McCanless: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: We will go now to Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.
Steven Ramsey: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just wrap my two questions into one here, the product mix at 49%, pretty impressive even with the complexity headwinds that you have, certainly love the dynamic here, but do you think that housing market normalizes complexity going up from current levels over the next couple of years to reach your plan, or do you needed that complexity level to move up, or can the current complexity level allow for that to allow you to reach your long-term targets? Thanks.
Dave Rush: Yes. Thanks for the question. Keep in mind, the value-added products, the movement is within the category. The engineered wood products are still value-adds. So, as you go from truss engineered wood, we are not leaving the value-add product category, we are moving within it. The sale opportunity is less, but again, our margin profiles have held in there. And we are doing what we can to keep our customers addressing affordability, and at the same time, maintaining their margins as well. So, I don't see the shift in the incremental value-add products will come as the market returns to normal [technical difficulty] for those products in general. And right now we offer the full spectrum. We will send you sticks if you don't want value-add. But this we go from READY-FRAME to panel, to panel and truss. So, fully installed framing packages, all which you have would tunnel into the value-added product category in total. And we would expect it to maintain, for sure, and incrementally grow as housing starts return to normal levels.
Steven Ramsey: Excellent, thank you.
Dave Rush: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session, and the Builders FirstSource second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time, and everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-07 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead. 
Heather Kos: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. The earnings press release and presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to the presentation during our call. 
 The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they could be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation.  
 Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. 
David Rush: Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Our resilient first quarter results reflect our differentiated product portfolio and scale, our team members consistent focus on executing our strategic priorities and our operational efficiency initiatives. As we expected, a weakening multifamily market and higher mortgage rates, driving affordability challenges were headwinds to start the year. Despite these micro challenges, we built on our successes and drove growth through our value-added products portfolio in our industry-leading digital platform. . 
 We are committed to advancing innovation and delivering exceptional customer service as a trusted and preferred partner to our customers. We are focused on executing our clear strategic pillars, as shown on Slide 3. Our investments in value-added products, install services and digital solutions are driving organic growth, delivering greater efficiency and empowering the next generation of homebuilding. For those who are new to the BFS story, value-added products include manufactured components such as trusses, Ready-Frame and wall panels as well as windows, doors and millwork.  
 Through our value-added products and install services we help meet our customer needs, such as reducing cycle times, addressing labor constraints and improving home construction quality. With our digital tools, we are providing our customers with a more efficient and cost-effective way to manage the construction of their homes that will increase existing customer stickiness, win new business and improve our operational efficiency. We remain committed to innovation and continuously seeking to do things better.  
 We have a robust set of operational and productivity initiatives and are focused on leveraging our scale and fixed cost while delivering the highest quality products and services to our customers. We are deploying capital in a disciplined manner with a proven M&A strategy and a track record of buying back shares at competitive prices. Working alongside the best team in the industry, I am confident that we will continue to compound long-term shareholder value and achieve our strategic priorities.  
 Let's turn to our first quarter highlights on Slide 4. We continued to deliver strong margins in Q1, reflecting our end-segment diversification, focused execution and differentiated product portfolio and scale. Our gross margins of more than 33% reflect a higher mix of value-added products, including multifamily truss and our ability to manufacture more efficiently. We expect the multifamily end segment to progressively normalize over the course of this year, and we continue to see some normalization in core margins.  
 Moving to Slide 5.  We're off to a strong start on our strategic initiatives. Our full digital product launch at the International Builders' Show in February was an exciting milestone. At a high level, our digital tools do 3 things: one, solve customer pain points; two, make it even easier to partner with us and our suppliers; and three, help us gain incremental business from new and existing customers. It's a win-win, and we're excited about how everything is going so far after the launch.  
 We're focused on operational excellence and innovation and using playbooks of proven best practices to increase our safety, efficiency and wallet share with customers. One area where we're using playbooks is with our installed services business. Our install sales increased by 17% year-over-year as we leverage our capabilities to help customers address labor constraints. Additionally, we drove $40 million in productivity savings in Q1, primarily through procurement and SG&A initiatives. We believe prudent expense management leads to maximum operational flexibility. This includes optimizing our footprint and balancing cost reductions against future capacity demands.  
 We will remain disciplined managers of this discretionary spending no matter the operating environment. Early momentum in single-family has slowed as persistent inflation has cooled short-term expectations for interest rate reductions. However, low existing home inventories and pent-up demand provide an environment where growth has continued to build. Builders across the board are having to navigate affordability issues and challenges with the regulatory environment, land development and infrastructure.  
 It's evident that the large national builders have done a good job of utilizing specs, reducing home sizes and providing interest rate buydowns to assist buyers with affordable options. Smaller builders are more likely to benefit from rate cuts. We are staying in close contact with our customers of all sizes to maximize our business in the current environment. As we have detailed on prior calls, multifamily became a headwind in Q1 as our activity levels and record backlogs have declined versus the prior year.  
 It is important to note, however, that multifamily remains a strong contributor to gross margins and EBITDA even at current levels.  
 Turning to M&A on Slide 6. We continue to target attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. In the first quarter, we completed 2 deals with aggregate 2023 sales of roughly $36 million. In early February, we acquired Quality Door and Millwork, a leading distributor of millwork, doors and windows in Southern Idaho.  
 In March, we acquired Hanson Truss, which further strengthens our value-added position in Northern California and Nevada. And last week, we acquired [ Schoeneman's Building Materials ]. [ Schoeneman's ] manufactures trusses and distributes building materials in the Sioux Falls, South Dakota area. We are excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. M&A and organic investments have increased value-added products as a percent of our overall mix by 700 basis points over the past 2 years and by 1,000 basis points if you go back to 2019.  
 Our success with this strategy has been a core component of our improved margin profile through the cycle. We believe there is a long runway of M&A targets in our fragmented market, and we are pleased with recent improvements in the pipeline. Our disciplined approach to M&A includes increasing our market position in desirable geographies, extending our lead in value-added and specialty solutions and enhancing customer retention.  
 On Slide 7, we provide an update on capital allocation. During the first quarter, we completed a $1 billion note offering which brought us additional financial flexibility to grow organically and remain acquisitive while maintaining a strong balance sheet. In addition to the 2 tuck-in acquisitions, we repurchased $20 million of shares as proven by our track record, we'll continue to buy back shares while allocating capital to high-return opportunities. We remain on track to strategically deploy $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion of capital from 2024 to 2026 as outlined at Investor Day last December.  
 Now let's turn to Slides 8 and 9 for an update on our digital strategy. As the only provider of an end-to-end digital platform in our space, we believe BFS digital tools will be transformative for the industry and a substantial driver of organic growth. Our easy-to-use portal myBLDR.com seamlessly delivers our full digital capabilities to our customers. It is designed to create efficiencies for our team members and improved service for our customers by offering increased transparency and engagement in the homebuilding process. Combined with our proprietary estimating and configuration tools, our customers will have more control over the entire building process. This will save time and money for both our customers and their clients while making the homebuilding process more personalized.  
 We were proud to highlight the full digital product capabilities at IBS in February. Our customers told us the new tools address an unmet need, and they were excited to use them in their businesses. Since launch in late February, we have seen orders on the digital platform go from nearly 0 to over $60 million. In Q1, we had incremental sales of over $10 million. We remain confident in our ability to meet our targets of $200 million of incremental digital revenue by the end of this year and $1 billion by 2026, as we grow wallet share and win new customers.  
 One of our digital tools, Build Optimize uses advanced 3D modeling to identify construction clashes and resolve mechanical design conflicts before breaking ground. It ensures architects, builders and trades are coordinated and building to the same plan. As a proof point of the advantages of using this transformative tool, we've seen interest from 4 large builders. One of these customers has used it in 3 markets and 13 communities across 34 plants. On average, we have identified 150 conflicts per plant, resolving those conflicts before construction leads to job site time and cost savings.  
 One of my favorite initiatives at BFS is acknowledging team members who go above and beyond. Ira Banks in Atlanta, Georgia personifies this quality. Ira began with BFS in 1996 as a driver helper and rose through the ranks to operations manager and now oversees our new Atlanta Millwork facility in Dacula. Ira has the respect of his team members because he's willing to do whatever it takes to solve problems and add value for our customers. Recently, when there was no available drivers for an urgent customer delivery that had to arrive that day, Ira drove the box truck himself to take care of the customer.  
 I'm grateful for Ira's drive to lead by example, a quality we find consistently in leaders across BFS. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results in greater detail. 
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy and operating model. We are maintaining our fortress balance sheet and prudently deploying capital to the highest return opportunities. We've included acquisitions and share repurchases during the quarter. We are leveraging our sustainable competitive advantages and strong financial position to drive future growth and value creation for our customers and shareholders.  
 I will cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our first quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on our capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our 2024 guidance and related assumptions.  
 Let's begin by reviewing our first quarter performance on Slides 10 and 11. We delivered $3.9 billion in net sales, driven by growth from acquisitions of 1.9% partially offset by commodity deflation of 1.7%. Core organic sales in line with the prior year were driven by a single-family increase of more than 4% amid higher sales of early-stage homebuilding products. From a geographic perspective, E sales were down mid-single digits, Central was flat and the West was up mid-teens. As we signaled and expected, multifamily declined more than 13% as we lapped the prior year's strong comps. R&R and other also declined by almost 5% due to weakness predominantly in the Northeast from inclement weather.  
 As we mentioned last quarter, inclement weather negatively impacted our operations in Q1 by roughly 3% to 4% of our overall sales. Value-added products represented approximately 52% of our net sales during the first quarter, reflecting our strength and customer stickiness for these higher-margin products. During the first quarter, gross profit was $1.3 billion, a decrease of approximately 5% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 33.4%, decreasing 190 basis points, mainly due to a timing shift in product mix towards lower-margin, early-stage homebuilding products, as well as margin normalization, particularly in multifamily.  
 SG&A increased $22 million to $926 million, primarily attributable to acquired operations. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased 50 basis points to 23.8%. The team has done an excellent job managing SG&A, and we stand ready to leverage our fixed costs into the growing market. 
 Adjusted EBITDA was $541 million, down approximately 14%, primarily driven by lower gross profit and higher operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.9%, down 240 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted net income of $327 million was down $83 million from the prior year due to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses, primarily due to acquisitions. 
 Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.65, a decrease of 11% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.29 per share for the first quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12.  Our Q1 operating cash flow was approximately $317 million, down $337 million compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to lower net income and an increase in net working capital.  
 Capital expenditures for the quarter were $90 million, and free cash flow was approximately $228 million. For the last 12 months ended March 31, our free cash flow yield was approximately 6%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 22%.  Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1x, while base business leverage was 1.2x. In February, we completed a $1 billion private offer of 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2034, which enables a maximum financial flexibility to grow organically and remain acquisitive.  
 Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $2.4 billion, consisting of $1.7 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $700 million of cash on hand. 
 Moving to capital deployment. During the first quarter, we repurchased roughly 100,000 shares for $20 million at an average stock price of $202.67 per share. Since the inception of our buyback program in August of '21, we have repurchased 42.2% of total shares outstanding at an average price of $70.42 per share for $6.1 billion.  
 We have $980 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to maximize returns.  
 Now let's turn to our outlook, which we are reaffirming on Slide 13. For full year 2024, we expect total company net sales to be $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 14% to 15%, and we are guiding gross margins to a range of 30% to 33%, which is in line with our long-term normalized expectation. Our recent margins reflect above normal multifamily performance on top of our greater mix of value-added products along with the disciplined pricing required to offset increased operating costs.  
 We expect full year 2024 free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. The free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $440 per thousand board feet. Our 2024 outlook is based on several assumptions and includes an expectation for improving single-family growth. Please refer to our earnings release in Slide 14 of the investor presentation for a list of these key assumptions.  
 As you all know, we do not typically give quarterly guidance, but we wanted to provide directional color for Q2 given the ongoing interest rate uncertainty and the geopolitical situation.  On a year-over-year basis, we expect Q2 net sales to be down low single digits to flat as single-family growth is offset by expected multifamily headwinds. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be down high teens in Q2, primarily given the impact of continued multifamily normalization.  
 Turning to Slides 15 and 16. As a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales for 2024 is approximately $17.6 billion. Our base business adjusted EBITDA guide is approximately $2.4 billion at a margin of 13.5%.  
 As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are confident in the near-term outlook, our exceptional positioning to execute our strategic goals and our ability to create shareholder value in any environment. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts. 
David Rush: Thanks, Peter. Let me close by summarizing how we're set up to drive long-term profitable growth by executing our strategic pillars. We believe we are the unquestioned leader in addressing our customers' pain points through our focus on customer service, value-added products and install services. Our industry-leading digital innovations are bringing greater efficiency to homebuilding and will win us new customers and grow wallet share along the way.  
 Our robust free cash flow generation is funding disciplined capital deployment that will maximize returns and compound long-term shareholder value. We have a proven playbook for growth during complex operating environments, and we'll keep working to be the best and deliver excellence every day. Thank you again for joining us today. 
 Operator, let's please open the call now for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And it does appear we have our first question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. 
Matthew Bouley: I'll start out on the second quarter. I'm wondering what's implied in the second quarter gross margin. It seems that you're kind of moving into that full year range of 30% to 33% in the second quarter, but correct me if I'm wrong. I know we're talking about normalization in both multifamily and the core, so within that second quarter gross margin, can we say that the over earn in both multifamily and the core is entirely rolled off or not yet entirely rolled off. So would there be sort of more to come beyond the second quarter? 
Peter Jackson: Matt, thanks for the question. So the margins that we're seeing are really in line with what we were expecting. The multifamily business specifically, I think, outlined it a couple of times, but for everybody just to restate it, will continue to normalize, will continue to go down over the course of the year. We think that sales will continue to decline back towards normal, and we'll continue to see margins as a percentage return back to normal as the year progresses. So not over, but very much in line with what we were expecting. 
 Margins -- there's a couple of things going on. We've talked about margin normalization being between 30% and 33%. We think that's an accurate forecast. Just keep in mind that normalization in this instance, would assume normal starts which we're not quite back to yet. But that said, our guide for the year is still within that range. We've seen some good things hold on longer, and we think that's going to sustain us to be able to get to our guide for the year on margins. But it's performing about like we expected. It's not a surprise in terms of where the rates -- where the margin levels are. 
Matthew Bouley: Okay. Secondly, the multifamily revenue impact, clearly, it's quite concentrated in the manufacturing products. I see multifamily was down 13% in Q1. It looks like you have one more, I think, tough year-over-year comparison in multifamily here in the second quarter. So I guess within the second quarter guide, is the assumption that multifamily is down sort of more than it was in the first quarter. Would that imply that Q2 is sort of the low point for multifamily year-over-year with lesser declines in the second half? Or should we assume that we should look for kind of a consistent headwind for multifamily declines through the balance of the year? 
Peter Jackson: Yes, it's the latter. You should expect a consistent decline from multifamily throughout the year. It's a long lead time product category. We've got pretty good visibility to what we're expecting to see. There's certainly a bit of slippage from one month to the next in any given period. But I think what we're seeing and expecting in multifamily is another big decline in Q2 and sort of a consistent year-over-year decline throughout the end of the year.  We'll, of course, update you as we learn more. 
Operator: And we have our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. 
Michael Dahl: I want to ask, I guess, is effectively a follow-up there. When we think about what's implied for the second half, if we look at the 1Q results and 2Q, directional color, at the midpoint, it requires double-digit top line growth and kind of 15% EBITDA margins. And the high end would be kind of like mid-teens top line growth and 16% EBITDA margin, both of those, just given the multifamily decline, your comments just now about further normalization in gross margin. It kind of seems difficult. So maybe you can help us there. I guess it's a roundabout way of asking more directly. When you look at the full year guide, is there a point in the range that you think you're leaning more towards at this point, like midpoint or lower or midpoint or higher. Maybe just help us understand how that's evolved. 
Peter Jackson: Mike, thanks for the question. In short, we're really confident in the forecast, the way it's laid out. That guide is something that you put out there and feel good about reaffirming. The growth that you're talking about is already happening. So I think it came through in some of our materials. I think there's maybe this expectation that our whole business moves in the same way in the same quarter. And that's really not what we're seeing here, right? You're seeing the early parts of the building process, the lumber, the truss, the stuff that hits the job site early after the start, doing great. we're growing. The momentum is building. 
 There are certainly some headwinds we're dealing with. I mean we talked a little bit about that. I'm sure we'll talk more. But the business is performing very well in that category. We've not yet started to see the tailwind, the uplift from some of the later building process products, right, the doors, the millwork, they are also good for us. But we have every confidence that that's coming, that that's going to continue to be a good tailwind for us. There are, of course, a lot of questions about what the overall market in single family is going to do, a lot of questions about interest rates. 
 But again, let's not forget, there's a lot of demand out there. There are a lot of confident homebuilders. There are a lot of good units and good production momentum going on, and we're participating. So we're not concerned about delivering based on everything we're seeing today, but we do have to digest multifamily. I think we've been very transparent about that. It's working like we expected, and things are playing out. So yes, the back half of the year needs to be growing. But again, we're seeing good momentum that we think will pass through on the early-stage products. We're seeing good growth in categories that we've leaned into, value-add, install, and we continue to be active in M&A. 
 So certainly, a lot to be confident in. We're happy with the business and not shy about what we're seeing for the rest of the year. 
David Rush: Yes. The only thing I'd add is -- echo  the overarching demand profile continues to be strong. I think the timing of when they actually execute the buy is kind of what is a little more volatile than the expectation that they will execute the buy. And that's part of it but our builder customers are still indicating that they are seeing that demand, and they're expecting the similar trajectory that we've forecasted for ourselves for the back half. 
Michael Dahl: Okay. Got it. And then shifting gears just to capital deployment and maybe specifically the buyback. I mean you've got plenty of liquidity. Your leverage is low. The buyback was really just nominal this quarter for the first time in a while. What can we take away from that? And maybe anything more specific about how you envision deploying capital through the year? 
Peter Jackson: Yes. We're -- you're right, we're sitting on about $700 million in cash plus all of the capacity in the ABL, lots of cool M&A popping, right? I mean we've done a couple of small deals so far, but we're sitting on a bunch of dry powder and excited about what the opportunities look like. We'll have to see how they play out. But at this moment in time, we're ready to take advantage of the opportunities that are going to present themselves. That's kind of how you should read that. A little bit of a slow start to the year, but we're feeling good. 
Operator: And we have our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens. 
Trey Grooms: I also want to touch on the guidance, believe it or not. You guys mentioned -- well, first off, you reiterated the full year, you mentioned that multifamily is going about as you expected. And clearly, you guys have been very vocal about your expectations and kind of the pullback there in multifamily and the impact it could have. But clearly, the 2Q guide is lower than what I think most were kind of modeling or expecting, but with you reiterating the full year guide, is it fair to say that kind of overall, the 2Q is kind of tracking as you would have thought? Any surprises there?  Or maybe even any areas where it's coming in better or worse than you would have expected as we've moved so far through the year? 
David Rush: Yes. Thanks, Trey. What I would tell you is multifamily in specific, some of that backlog is getting extended. So where at one point in time in the year, I may have thought more of those jobs would finish quicker. They're spread now. It's actually a good thing. It kind of smoothed that transition for us in one way. The other thing I'd tell you about multifamily, our team has done a great job going after pseudo multifamily. 
 Smaller multifamily projects, customers, they [ haven't ] typically gone after that are helping also transition that hasn't started yet, but we're seeing a lot of good momentum in that space, things like assisted living versus a 4-level apartment complex. So smaller jobs as you take them by themselves, but add it up, it will help the transition.
 But single family is kind of operating the way we expected it to. There's been --  it's never retracted below a level. It's a build, and it's a continual build, but at the end of the day, is it as steep of a build as we would like? Of course, not, it's not as robust as we would like ever, but it's steady and it's there, and it doesn't retract. That's an important factor. It is a build even as it's a slower build than we'd love to see. And we're adjusting that as we need to, to those market conditions. 
Peter Jackson: The only thing I might add is there's nothing in what's happened that is a surprise to us in terms of the variables. All the variables I think. We've accounted for. There are a couple of variables that were, I would say, bigger headwinds than we anticipated. I think that weather thing has certainly thrown us a curve ball. It will bounce back, but that's been a tricky one to navigate, particularly regionally. 
 I think what builders have done to build homes more affordably, whether it be size of the home or complexity of the home there's some variability on that as well that we've been challenged with. But again, I think we're in line. We're doing what we said we were going to do despite those variables. 
David Rush: Yes. And I would add, a good indicator for me is always our truss backlog. Our truss backlog is at healthy levels. It's continuing to build. That's an indicator for us of what's to come. And that -- if that was starting to slack off, I might give a little more worried, but it's where it needs to be for us to be in a healthy situation. 
Trey Grooms: Got it. All right. Well, I appreciate it. And hearing that you're very confident in the guide and being able to reiterate it is encouraging. So -- we appreciate it, and thanks. Good luck for the rest of the quarter. 
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Trey. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America. 
Rafe Jadrosich: I wanted to ask on the commodity pricing. In the first quarter, it was deflationary, but when you look at -- I think OSB prices were up, lumber prices seemed kind of flattish sequentially. So can you just talk about what you're seeing there either is it from a mix standpoint? Or how does the competitive environment evolve? And like how do you expect that to go going forward? 
Peter Jackson: Yes. So I would tell you right up front that commodities are where the war is happening. That's where the fight is. It's where historically, you've got the most aggressive players. You've got the most dynamic pricing, the volatility of it. I think what you're seeing in the numbers is really just around timing. A little bit of shift in terms of when we saw the OSB run versus when we were feeling it. That will come through at different points during the year. But I would expect sort of us to be pretty much done with the bad news around the prices of commodities. 
 What I will say, though, is while we saw the run in OSB that's starting to walk back. We saw a much smaller run on lumber and that's walking back as well. So I think you're seeing that mood of the market recognizing [ higher ] for longer and trying to triangulate on what that means to commodity prices. But again, that's not our game. We don't play the commodities up, commodity down bet. We're continuing to on product just in time, move it quickly, price appropriately, get paid for what we do, that our strategy hasn't changed at all in that category. 
Rafe Jadrosich: Got it. Very helpful. And then just on SG&A, there was some deleverage in the first quarter. How should we think about that going forward here, especially if sales turn in the second half of the year? And then just remind us of the base in terms of incentive comp from last year, do you have an easier comparison there and how we just about leverage versus what you have done historically? 
Peter Jackson: Yes. So SG&A, we saw a couple of one-timers come through in Q1 that hurt us a little bit. Some of it was -- we had some credits last year that we didn't repeat this year. I wouldn't -- from my perspective and take it what it's worth, I wouldn't read too much into it.
 I think our consistent discipline around expenses will keep us in the ranges that you'd expect.  Summer months are always our best leverage months, right, Q2, Q3, so you'll see that come through. In terms of the base business, I guess I would say there isn't much of an adjustment, maybe minor on the bonus side.
 I think really the storyline around the year-over-year bonuses is that we gave ourselves as you've seen a more challenging target and plan for this year. Our performance is more in line versus vastly outperforming that target. So you will see a pullback in the total amount of bonus dollars just by nature of that performance, which you'd expect. I think that shareholders, management and the Board is all an alignment on that one. So that will be a bit of a tailwind versus the prior year just from a dollar amount perspective. 
David Rush: The only thing I'd add is our highest variable cost obviously is our labor. And the field and the team have done an exceptional job keeping labor as a percent of gross profit, which is our key metric, right in line with our operating -- within the parameters of what we set for ourselves in this level of sales and activity and our tools for managing that cost are as good as they've ever been in my 25 years with the company. So the key factor for us in managing SG&A is how well we manage our labor down at the field level, and they've done exceptional at that since the beginning of the year. 
Operator: And we have our next question from Keith Hughes with Truist. 
Keith Hughes: The question on the windows and doors segment. It was down 2%. You talked about some product costs declining. Can you talk about that a little bit more, which product and is that selling prices declining or inputs, any kind of details would be great. 
David Rush: Well, good morning, Keith, if you recall, Keith, this time last year or in the first quarter last year, we were just coming out of normalization of the supply chain, windows and doors were getting delivered timely again, and the national builders focus on completions in that first quarter was at a higher level just to catch up. That kind of was the [ PIG in the pipeline ] for us last year in higher millwork and [ window and ] the door sales in the first quarter than normal. I would tell you this first quarter was normal. So we had to roll over those numbers from last year where it was a bit more tilted towards completions where this year was more normal with respect to completions. 
 There has been some deflation in the category, and specifically, I think, with millwork -- on the millwork side. And that's affected it modestly. I think we saw pretty close. Our volumes did exactly what we expected our volumes to do and it was more along the lines of some of the deflationary impact along with rolling over that higher degree of completions last first quarter, that really explained the difference. 
Operator: And we have our next question from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. 
Adam Baumgarten: Can you talk about what you're seeing from a non-commodity pricing perspective? And maybe specifically on the manufactured product side? 
David Rush: So you're talking about customer pricing or vendor pricing. 
Adam Baumgarten: Your pricing to customers. 
David Rush: So it's -- as you would expect and why we play in those categories, that is less price sensitive on the manufacturing side because once you get locked in with the designer and you get locked in with somebody who's going to meet delivery schedules and whatnot. That becomes more important factor. Now as commodities have fluctuated and the fact that they are a component of manufacturing that affects the price as commodities go up or down, and they've been going down for lumber slightly. 
 But you know what we've been able to do is offset some of that with our efficiencies that we've been able to gain throughout since the merger with our automation investments and our continual improvement in actual board foot per labor hour produced has been a nice offset to some of those challenges. But as a whole, value add continues to hold in there better than commodities, which, of course, is in line with our strategy. 
Adam Baumgarten: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the 3% to 4% impact from weather you saw in 1Q, how should we expect that to be recouped? Is it mostly in 2Q? Or is it going to span over a few quarters? 
Peter Jackson: Well, I was happy to say Q2 up until Houston got buried or flooded out. Generally, it takes about quarter to a quarter and a half to catch back up. It doesn't unfortunately just whipsaw back the other direction, but that's probably a reasonable way to think about it, 3 to 4 months. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. 
Stanley Elliott: can you all talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the services piece, some very strong numbers, up 17%. Is this kind of reflection of your efforts to take it into new markets. Is this existing your -- more services with some of your existing customers. And then I guess secondly, how should we eventually take it up -- this as either attach rate or pull through on some of the other things you're doing on the manufactured side? 
David Rush: Yes. I would say all of the above. We had a strong install business. We did $2.5 billion in labor and materials installed in 2023. So we had a nice base to work from. And our initial focus, as you would expect, was on the products that we are already good at in one market and leveraging that platform to other markets. And it's the products that we're most familiar with and the products that we distribute every day. So we've got off to a great start. A lot of that increase is from existing markets that are already doing install because those are the ones that had the base to work from. 
 But we developed really nice playbooks, and we've had really good interest, which has been pull interest. So as people reaching out, I want to get into this business, how do I do it the right way versus us saying, "Hey, you need to get into this business." Which is in my role, in my seat, that's what you want to see. And we've got really good people, really good plans, and we just think it's the next evolution for us as a company in solving our customer pain points and doing it methodically and in a way that we don't make mistakes. That's key for me, to do it the right way and make sure that what we are generating is customer value added solutions. 
Stanley Elliott: And curious kind of tagging on that, if you're willing to share. Are you seeing more of this uptake with some of the smaller builders, some of the more national builders? Just trying to kind of get a sense for the flavor there? 
David Rush: It's a little, it depends on the product category first of all. But the national builders certainly like the install solution wherever they can apply it. 
 The custom guys like it, but they're a little more specific to millwork or a little more specific to install windows probably not so much installed framing, right? So it's a really good play for the national builders. They seem to like that the best, but there are applications for both segments. 
Peter Jackson: And to Dave's point, we do see a higher level of adoption of our value-added products to the larger players just generally. 
David Rush: Yes. And install is a natural evolution to the value add. It's the next part of value add, not only do you get the components delivered to the job site, but you actually install the components that are delivered to the job site, that's just a natural evolution of doing more for our customers. 
Operator: And we have our next question from Collin Verron with Jefferies. 
Collin Verron: I just want to start on the gross margin side of things. You talked about the shift in timing towards early-stage homebuilding products being a gross margin mix headwind. Can you maybe quantify that headwind either sequentially or year-over-year? And how it compares to the headwind you're seeing from multifamily normalization? And just following up on that, how you're thinking about that mix through the rest of the year, just given what you're seeing in starts, backlogs and conversations with your customers? 
Peter Jackson: Yes. So I don't think I can give you the detail -- thank you for the question. I'm not sure I can give you the breakdown necessarily exactly what you're looking for. What I can tell you is on the mix side, it's an expectation that we're going to see a trend back to normal mix. I don't think that's much of a stretch, right? So what we're seeing right now is more of our growth being in the pure commodities and the truss and the relationship between just those 2 categories, biases it towards the commodities. And commodities like I was saying before, is where we've had the most aggressive normalization. 
 We've seen it across the board on the gross margins, right? We've seen gross margin normalization. We've talked about it a lot. It's not just multifamily, it's single-family, too. Matter of fact, this quarter, the bulk of it was single-family normalization. Much of that is the mix, but a good chunk of that is also just what we've been messaging over the last year, and that's -- we have seen this normalization play out. We've seen it across the business. And this year's margins are when you peel back that multifamily stuff, a step down from where they were. That was why we were so adamant last year that our mid-30s gross margin numbers weren't going to hold on because we were seeing it play out. 
 But that mix will certainly be a tailwind as we regain the later-stage building products, but we have, again, the lapping from the prior year. So that's why our guide is in that 30% to 33% range because we think that those 3 variables will play against each other, and we want to try and give you the best insight possible to where we'll end up. 
Collin Verron: Okay. That's helpful color. I guess I want to pivot towards the M&A pipeline. It sounds like it's pretty robust. Any color to the size of potential deals out there in the market and what those potential targets look like from a product offering perspective. 
Peter Jackson: We won't get that precise, but I think our strategy has not changed, right? The way we look at the market, where we're successful, where we can add the most value are all variables in the discussion. But I think that there's -- there are always a million rumors about what may or may not trade. I think for us, it's imperative that we stay disciplined and we stay focused. What's exciting is, as it stands today, we see a lot of assets out there that fit that screen, and now we just got to see if we can get them across finish line. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Tyler Batory with Oppenheimer. 
Tyler Batory: A question on the competitive environment. Are you seeing some of the smaller players out there may be trying to get more aggressive to take market shares. Is that having an impact on your performance and on your business? 
David Rush: What I would tell you, Tyler, is not any more than usual. Again, where we differentiate ourselves is in the value-added solution in the value-added space, and that's for a reason. Anybody can do commodities, anybody can deliver lumber. It's hard to differentiate yourself in a straight distribution model. So we do see competition in that arena for sure. We try to leverage our relationships with those customers where we do other stuff for them very well and use that as a way to continue to maintain share on the commodity side versus just getting into a price war. 
 So we do see competition in that regard. We choose to compete where we want to compete in that regard. But we'll always do a high percentage of lumber. We're good at doing lumber. We're good at meeting schedules and making sure the lumber is there when the customer wants it. And we get recognized for that and where we get that recognition is where we play. But in short, a lot more competition on the commodity side than the noncommodity side and our reputation on the value-added space carries us a long way. 
Peter Jackson: The only thing I'll add, I think it might be embedded in your question is share. I think one of the variables that we struggle with is what's the real share number. Generally, we would use single-family starts as a proxy for the market and then we would compare our sales against that. In general, that's a really tricky thing right now because I think there are some meaningful differences between a start unit and a sales dollar. 
 Homes are smaller. The cost of those homes and what's being put into them and simpler and cheaper. And we have seen some not insignificant cost reductions or pricing reductions in terms of what we are getting from our vendors and what is selling into the market. Whether it be commodities which is the obvious one, but also EWP or millwork or any of the other ones we've talked about, those all represent sort of gaps or deltas between those 2 units of measure. 
 And then you layer on a little bit of the timing related stuff, whether it be how complete these homes are and what we're selling or the weather or whatever, it certainly has made that whole discussion and that analysis really challenging. But back to Dave's point, I think the only place we think we've maybe struggled or battled is in that commodity, the low end where smaller competitors are more willing to get down and dirty. 
Tyler Batory: Okay. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on the R&R side of things, down 5% in the quarter. I think weather probably impacting that. What are you seeing here in the second quarter, and there are a lot of differing views on the R&R end market out there? Just share your confidence in terms of your growth outlook this year in that end market. 
Peter Jackson: So as it relates specifically to the first quarter, we're higher concentrated in R&R in the Northeast. And the Northeast was that set area of the country for us. That was a great -- more greatly impacted by weather. I think 20 to 23 days had serious weather in the quarter. That's where we felt it. In general, I think R&R will be -- is kind of a two-edged sword, right? The bigger projects are facing some of the same kind of cost of money pressures that the small custom builder is facing. But the regular smaller projects, I think, are going to be along the same line as what you would expect. 
Operator: And we have our next question from David Manthey with Baird. 
David Manthey: My first question is on the digital. So the revenue uptick is good to see. Could you share with us any data on the number of net users today versus a year ago or the end of last year? Just to give us an idea of how that's ramping? And then is there any prototypical customer type that's implementing the system? Or is it just based on personality and choice? 
Peter Jackson: Dave, yes, we're excited about digital. I don't unfortunately have user numbers. I might be able to get them for you, but I don't have them off the top of my head. It's going up. We're seeing that. They were -- gosh, I don't know what it was 500 or 700 leads that we took out of IBS. We've got a lot of customers as we do our adoption and our rollout around the country that are coming on board. While most of them are mid to smaller-sized builders. The profile, I think, that you're talking about are those that are leaning into digital and technology to be able to make themselves more efficient and more professional and better with their customers. 
 I think you've got -- sometimes it's generational. Candidly, sometimes it's not. It's just the mentality around leveraging tools to take waste out of the job, make the job go quicker, connect with the home buyer a little bit more easily, more visually. But it's such a -- in our opinion, it's such a compelling tool. 
 It's got so much that can help to build or just get a little bit better every day. That game we're all trying to play, creating efficiency, making it more transparent to the builder, to the trades and to the home buyer. So that -- those are the types of customers, the ones that really take advantage of technology to do that, that we're seeing early. But in general, I think our digital tool has become -- is increasingly becoming the new way of doing business just because it's so easy. It's very modern, it's very smooth. And so far, so good. We're excited about the ramp-up trend and how it's been progressing, so far early days. 
David Rush: What I would tell you juices me the most was the traffic we had at our booth at IBS. I have never in my 25 years of going to IBS seen the kind of excitement and the kind of traffic that went through our booth, primarily because of our digital platform and showing what capabilities that it was going to present. The other  thing I would say is, think about it, if you're a smaller builder, 50 to 200 homes a year, you don't have the ability to invest in technology for yourself to get this to the level of platform that we're developing. 
 What we're doing is leveraging our ability to make those investments develop that platform for our customers of that size so that they can play in that space and be efficient without having to make a huge upfront investment themselves. So that's the rationale behind why we developed it and why we think it will be appealing to our customer base and if IBS is any indication, we hit it right on the head. 
David Manthey: Okay. In the interest of time, I'll just pass it on. Thank you. 
Operator: And we have our next question from Jay McCanless from Wedbush. 
James McCanless: So my first question, Peter, I think you called out some pretty positive sales trends for the Western U.S. Could you talk about how that's trended in April and May, similar pattern to what you saw in 1Q? 
Peter Jackson: Yes, pretty similar. I think that the West got hammered out of the gate, and they bounced back really nicely, a little more stable through the other 2 regions. But yes, I think that's been pretty consistent. We have to see how this whole weather thing in Houston plays out. But for the time being, it's pretty good. 
James McCanless: Okay. And then taking the lumber question, especially some of the more commodity goods a step further. Is this a function of not only higher mortgage rates, but was there an oversupply of commodity lumber in the system to start the year? Just wondering if this is all rate-driven, if there's some other mitigating factors we need to be monitoring? 
Peter Jackson: We didn't see a lot of unusual behavior in the market, no. Tough for us to see that from others perspective, but it's a strong I would think generally a strong and a stable market. So I don't know how people made bets with regard to where stuff was moving. 
Operator: And we have our next question from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. 
Ketan Mamtora: Peter, just one question. You've talked quite a bit about margin normalization and multifamily. On the core organic, the single-family piece, do you think at this point, we are sort of towards the end of that normalization, midway through? How would you characterize that? And are the competitive dynamics in that side of the business changing at all, given sort of pressure on EWP prices, given where lumber is today. Just curious to get your thoughts. 
Peter Jackson: Ketan, yes, I would tell you that we're closer to the end in terms of how we expect margins to normalize. We're still below normal in terms of volume. So that's a pressure-filled environment. It's always very competitive. It always has been. We expect it always will be on the commodity side. But that now needs to be a battle cry that we rise to, right? And it's something that we've done for years and we feel good about. 
 There's a -- there's an expectation that the little player will always be more competitive, and we think that will continue to play out. But by and large, I think margins have performed well. There's certainly been some aggressiveness from certain vendors, but in most cases, it's in response to past moves. So more of a normalization, more of a rebound back -- a mean reversion, if you will, rather than a, oh, we're in trouble, we need to do something dramatic. Does that make sense? 
Ketan Mamtora: It does. Thank you very much. 
Operator: And it appears we have reached our allotted time for the question-and-answer session today. That will conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-22 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Builders FirstSource Fourth Quarter 2023 and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I’d now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead.
Heather Kos: Good morning. And welcome to our third quarter earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. The earnings press release and investor presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to the investor presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes and they should be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today’s press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Dave.
David Rush: Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'm proud of our full-year results. I'm proud of our full-year results, which demonstrate the strength of our broad product portfolio and continued execution by our team members. Despite a challenging operating environment in 2023, which saw significant reduction in single-family starts, we delivered resilient results. As promised, we delivered a double-digit EBITDA margin in the high teens along with robust free cash flow. We accomplished this through operational rigor and by closely partnering with our customers to help address their pain points through the use of our value-added solutions. Our results in 2023 further validate our strategy to be the easiest to do business with across the industry. I also want to thank everyone who participated both in person and virtually at our Investor Day in December, where we laid out the next leg of our growth journey. We're grateful for your ongoing support. As we begin 2024, we are excited about the opportunities in front of us. We remain focused on profitable growth by leading with our value-added solutions, deploying our digital platform, and expanding in desirable markets through our proven M&A strategy. These initiatives, along with our commitment to efficient operations and disciplined capital deployment, will continue to compound long-term shareholder value. Our investments in value-added and digital solutions are driving clear market differentiation, delivering greater efficiency, and empowering the next generation of home building. By leveraging our scale in value-added products, we are able to help meet our customers' needs, such as reducing cycle times, addressing labor constraints, and improving home construction quality. As a proof point of our execution, I'm pleased that our service levels for on-time and in-full have continued to improve year-over-year. Our on-time delivery was 90% in 2023, while our in-full performance was 96%. With our investments in technology and automation, we'll keep working to drive these metrics higher. We remain committed to operational excellence and innovation to increase efficiency and create value. We have a robust set of operational and productivity initiatives and are focused on leveraging our scale and fixed costs while delivering the highest quality products to our customers. Our continuous improvement mindset employs technology, including our digital solutions and automation, to improve the construction process and drive greater discipline in our operations. As an important pillar of our strategy, we are focused on maintaining a fortress balance sheet. Our strong free cash flow provides financial flexibility and multiple high returning paths for capital deployment, enabling our clear set of priorities. We continued our robust buyback program in 2023, repurchasing nearly $1.8 billion of shares. I'm happy to announce that yesterday our board increased our share repurchase authorization to a total of $1 billion. We remain disciplined in our approach to tuck-in acquisitions and still have a long runway of targets in a fragmented market. Our focus areas for M&A include increasing our market position in desirable geographies, extending our lead in value-added and specialty solutions, and enhancing customer stickiness. Let's turn to our full year highlights on slide 4. We delivered strong margins in 2023, including a robust 17% adjusted EBITDA margin that underscores our differentiated product portfolio and scale. Our resilient gross margin of more than 35% reflects stronger mix in value-added products, notably in our multifamily business, and improved manufacturing efficiencies. As we have communicated, we continue to see some normalization in core margins. We are also seeing multifamily normalized and expected to continue over the course of this year. Looking at slide 5, I want to highlight the over 30% improvement in our recordable incident rate in 2023, which is a remarkable achievement. At BFS, the safety of our team members is always our highest priority, and I am proud of the culture we have created to be a safer company every day. I am also excited to see the structural improvements we are making to remove excess costs and operate more efficiently. Our strong productivity savings of $175 million for 2023 reflect the hard work we are doing on targeted initiatives, and we expect another $100 million of productivity savings in 2024. Prudent SG&A expense management also remains a key focus area. This includes the ongoing optimization of our footprint and balancing the need for cost reductions against future capacity demands. We remain disciplined stewards of discretionary spending, and our team has responsibly managed cost in the short term while executing our strategy for the long term. As expected, we had a strong year in multifamily as prior year acquisitions were supercharged by a strong market. Multifamily remained a tailwind in Q4 as we worked through record backlogs. For single family, lower mortgage rates and low existing home inventories have helped us steady activity levels. National builder customers have done a good job of utilizing specs in conjunction with interest rate buy-downs to provide homebuyers with affordable options to purchase new homes. Our focus this year is on being the best partner to our customers by providing the highest quality customer service, driving our robust value-added solutions, and launching our BFS digital tools to make the building process faster, more efficient, and more affordable. Turning to M&A on slide 6, we continue to target attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. In 2023, we completed seven deals with aggregate 2022 sales of roughly $540 million. Early in the fourth quarter, we acquired Standale Lumber, which gives us a strong presence in the growing Grand Rapids, Michigan market. Then in December, we acquired Encore Building Products, a leading building materials distributor that represents our entry into the Arkansas market and will serve as our platform for future growth in the state. And in early February, we acquired Quality Door and Millwork, a leading distributor of millwork doors and windows in Southern Idaho. We're excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. We also show how our M&A and organic investments increased value-added products as a percent of overall mix by 700 basis points over the past two years. Our success with this strategy has been a core component of our improved margin profile through the cycle. On slide 7, we provide an update on capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we made two tuck-in acquisitions and repurchased over $200 million of shares while maintaining a strong balance sheet. And for all 2023, we prudently deployed approximately $2.5 billion in-line with our stated priorities. We have cumulatively deployed approximately $6.1 billion from 2022 through 2023, and we communicated a new goal at our investor day this past December to deploy $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion of capital from 2024 to 2026. Now let's turn to slides eight and nine for an update on our digital strategy. We are establishing a differentiated position as the only provider of an end-to-end digital platform in our space. Combined with our leading operating model and strong relationships, we believe BFS Digital Tools will be a substantial driver of growth for us and transformative for the industry. Our easy-to-use mybldr.com portal will seamlessly deliver our full digital capabilities to our customers. It is designed to create efficiencies for our team members and improve service for our customers by offering increased transparency and engagement in the home building process. Combined with our proprietary estimating and configuration tools, our customers will have more control over the entire building process. This will save both time and money for both our customers and their clients while making the home building process more personalized. We are excited to showcase the full digital product capabilities at the International Builders Show next week. To drive the adoption of these innovative solutions, we have focused on training our sales and operations teams to help our customers leverage these powerful new tools. We are confident in our ability to deliver value from our digital solutions and meet our target of $200 million of incremental digital revenue by the end of this year and $1 billion by 2026 as we grow wallet share and new customers. Throughout the year, we acknowledge team members that go above and beyond. Rich Rapuzi, market manager in our Alaska market embodies these values like no other. I had the pleasure of spending time with Rich recently and witnessed the positive impact he has made on his team during his remarkable 50-year career at BFS and Legacy companies. Rich's journey started as a customer service rep in 1974 and is rooted in hands-on experience and continuous learning. Through his career, Rich established vital departments and assumed multiple leadership roles. What truly sets Rich apart is his passion for his community and mentoring others. His colleagues will tell you that he deeply cares about helping people reach their potential. As Rich prepares for retirement later this year, his impact will endure through the lives he has touched. While he'll be greatly missed, his legacy will resonate within our organization for years to come. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results in greater detail.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our results throughout the year demonstrate the effectiveness of our operating model regardless of the macro environment. Our fortress balance sheet, strong cash flow generation and ability to prudently deploy capital to the highest return opportunities, including acquisitions and share repurchases, continues to deliver value and positions us for long-term success. We are leveraging our sustainable competitive advantages and strong financial position to drive future growth and create value for our shareholders. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our fourth quarter and full year results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our full year 2024 guidance and related assumptions. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter performance on Slides 10 and 11. We delivered $4.2 billion in net sales, driven by a 1% decline in core organic sales and commodity deflation of 5%, partially offset by growth from acquisitions of roughly 2%. The core organic sales were driven by a single-family decline of 4% amid a weak housing market and share in supply chain normalization. That said, there are signs that the single-family market is starting to pick up. Our early cycle products are beginning to show growth, including high single digits growth in lumber and mid-single digits growth in truss. Multifamily grew by more than 4% driven by our prior year acquisitions as well as favorable margins. R&R and other also grew by over 4% due to increased sales focus and capacity versus 2022. Importantly, value-added products represented 52% of our net sales during the fourth quarter, reflecting our position as the supplier of choice for these higher-margin products. During the fourth quarter, gross profit was $1.5 billion, a decrease of approximately 1% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 35.3%, increasing 120 basis points mainly due to productivity and a tailwind from multifamily, partially offset by core organic margin normalization. SG&A increased by $60 million to $974 million, mainly due to higher variable compensation, acquired operations and inflation, partially offset by lower customer reserve expenses. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased 150 basis points to 23.5%, primarily attributable to decreased fixed cost leverage from lower sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $686 million, down approximately 2%, primarily driven by lower net sales due to a weak housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior year as we continue to execute and drive improved productivity across the business. Adjusted net income of $439 million was down $32 million from the prior year due to lower net sales. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.55, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12. Our 2023 operating cash flow was approximately $2.3 billion, down $1.3 billion compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to commodity deflation and a shrinking housing market. Capital expenditures for the year were $430 million, all in, we delivered healthy free cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion. For the year, our free cash flow yield was approximately 13% while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 28%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1x, while base business leverage was 1.4x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.3 billion consisting of $1.27 billion and net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $70 million of cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for $209 million at an average stock price of $131.74 per share. For the full year of 2023, we repurchased nearly $1.8 billion of shares at an average price of $100.49 per share. As Dave mentioned, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $1 billion of common stock, inclusive of the approximately $200 million remaining on the prior share repurchase plan authorized in April of 2023. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation to approve an ability to deploy capital and deliver high returns. Now let's turn to our outlook on Slide 13. For full year 2024, we expect total company net sales to be $17.5 million to $18.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 14% to 15%, and we are guiding gross margins to a range of 30% to 33%. Our recent above normal margins reflect a greater mix of value-added products, along with the disciplined pricing required to offset increased operating costs. As we move through the year, we expect both our gross margins and the multifamily business to continue to normalize. We expect full year 2024 free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. The change from 2023 is primarily due to an expected $500 million year-over-year decrease due to working capital as we move from shrinking to growing sales. The free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $440 per 1,000 [indiscernible] our 2024 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and Slide 14 of the investor presentation for a list of these key assumptions. As you all know, we do not typically give quarterly guidance, but we wanted to provide directional color for Q1. On a year-over-year basis, we expect Q1 net sales to be flat to down low single digits as we have lost roughly two days of sales due to inclement weather conditions at the start of the year. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be down high teens to low 20s in Q1 given the impact of extreme weather and continued margin and share normalization. We expect our sales to rebound as the severe weather conditions subside. Regardless, we remain optimistic for a healthy housing market in 2024. Turning to Slides 15 and 16. As a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales for 2024 is approximately $17.6 billion. Our base business adjusted EBITDA guide is approximately $2.4 billion at a margin of 13.5%. As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are confident in the near-term outlook, our exceptional positioning to execute our strategic goals and our ability to create shareholder value in any environment to support profitable growth. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts.
David Rush: Thanks, Peter. Let me close by saying that we are focused on executing our strategic pillars. This focus, along with our close partnership with our customers to address their pain points is a competitive differentiator in our industry. We are the unquestioned leader in value-added solutions, which we believe are the most effective way to address labor and cycle time challenges. Our industry-leading digital innovations are bringing greater efficiency to homebuilding and will win us new customers and grow wallet share along the way. Our robust free cash flow generation is funding a disciplined capital deployment strategy that will compound long-term shareholder value. While 2023 was an exciting year, we are just getting started. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Matthew Bouley with Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: Morning Dave Peter thanks for taking the questions. So to start off with on the gross margin, of course, exiting '23 over 35%. I hear you. There is still some multifamily normalizing to come. But it looks like you're guiding to volume growth, of course, in your single-family business this year, and I assume there's some operating leverage there in your manufacturing. I think I heard Dave say that there's another $100 million in productivity this year. And I don't know if you're assuming value-add mix would continue to rise, and that's on top of everything you've done around automation and consolidating the industry and so forth in recent years. So my point is it seems like you've got a lot of tailwinds this year. I guess, where am I being too optimistic? And what's kind of the cadence, timing of gross margins normalizing back to below 33%? Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Matt. Your points are all accurate. I think that we've done a really nice job in the value-add sector. I think we've managed pricing in a disciplined way. We certainly have done a good job on productivity and continuing to execute in that category. And certainly, a portion of that hits gross margins, not all of it. What I think is continuing to happen, and I know this is a consistent theme from us, but we want to continue to be candid with investors. There is a normalization that we're seeing in the core and there's a normalization or maybe a recognition of a cycle in multifamily. Those are the two really big components driving the ongoing normalization that we expect in 2024. So multifamily, as we look at it, certainly a dynamic market, but there's been a pullback, right? A lot of multifamily units were put in the ground. Over the last few years, the backlog has been very full, very healthy, and we've done very, very well. There are clear signals both in the broader market and in our numbers that multifamily is normalizing. It's pulling back, and it's going to pull back pretty aggressively. We expect we'll start seeing that in sort of Q1 based on the latest information, and it will hit us all year. So certainly, multifamily is a good business, but there's a headwind there associated with that business shrinking. And we continue to see in pockets around the country, the normalization of margins in a competitive environment, right? We're well below what we would consider to be normal starts, normal single-family starts in this industry. So it's competitive out there. And there are certain markets where we've had to get aggressive, and we'll continue to do that to protect our position and to win in the market and to be the customer of choice. We don't think it's putting us outside of that communicated range for gross margin, but certainly expect that to continue to erode as the year progresses.
Matthew Bouley: Second one, I guess, sticking with the guidance, I think your end market growth kind of blends to maybe very low single digits and you're speaking to base business growth of, I think, 7% this year, and I know there's a couple of extra selling days in the second half. But my question is on your growth compared to the market. Sounds like you should start to get some of the digital sales to kick in later this year. But just could you kind of bridge us from where the market is expected this year to your sort of several hundred basis points of market outgrowth? And obviously, of course, how does the value-add growth kind of play into that? Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Matt. You're right. We are anticipating a fairly modest market tailwind this year, which obviously is appreciated, and we'll put to good use. But we are challenging ourselves as an organization in a couple of key areas. A big one that we talked a lot about is digital. We're really excited about what this product is going to do for us in terms of attracting and enhancing our relationships with customers, we think there's real value there. So we're putting that in our number. We also are continuing to invest as you see in value add. So we've got new capacity in the ground. We've got new equipment. We've got a new ability this year that we didn't have last year to provide those types of high-value impactful products to our customers. So we expect growth from that. And we're certainly confident in our team. We've got -- we need to be the best team in the industry, and we think we can win in the market. So those three things really kind of combined to give us the confidence to put out a number there that really represents share growth ultimately.
David Rush: I would just add, Matt, that conversations with customers are almost uniformly optimistic for the year. There are differences in when they believe that timing of that rebound will start, and that's all obviously driven by the macro environment to a degree. And the digital ad that we'll experience during the year will be more like a hockey stick. It will be weighted to the back half of the year as we continue to drive adoption and training throughout the organization and with our customers. But we're excited about the year as a whole. It's a little more difficult to pinpoint the exact point in time when we start seeing it in real time. But the long-term demand still is very, very encouraging.
Operator: We'll turn now to Mike Dahl with RBC Capital.
Michael Dahl: Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on free cash flow. I appreciate your articulation of kind of some of those timing differences and the swings in working cap. And so I think as we move beyond 2024 because this represents kind of a lower-than-normal conversion for you. So can you just talk to -- is it kind of timing through the year that -- of how working cap has the ramp -- has growth ramps? And then once we get to '25, you still expect to get back to a higher, more normal conversion rate or any other moving pieces there? I think, would be helpful.
Peter Jackson: Absolutely. So you're right, Mike. This is a light year for us. The way that the numbers show, the comp looked obviously pretty dramatic on a year-over-year basis. We're down a little bit on the EBITDA number due to that multifamily step down. But the change going from a business that's shrinking. And as you know, we spent off a tremendous amount of cash as the business shrinks to turn to an increasing sales environment. And we use working capital when we grow. That sort of turn for us showed large in the numbers. But that headwind that we would expect to see related to growth is generally going to be a little bit smaller in a normal growth year than in a turn year. The turn year is always a big number when it goes from one to the other. So we do anticipate it to be a little bit higher in a normal year. And as we laid out in our Investor Day, there's a cumulative benefit that we expect to deliver on, and that commitment hasn't changed.
Operator: We'll turn now to Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank.
Joseph Ahlersmeyer: Hey, good morning guys. Congrats on the results. So is it right to think that if we've got the headwind from weather in 1Q, we're going to be probably pushing those sales more into 2Q. I'm just trying to think about the phasing of sales for the remainder of the year.
Peter Jackson: I think that's a fair assessment, Joe. Typically, what we see is it's not an immediate snapback but a gradual snapback in the future quarters as they catch up. They don't catch up all at once. But at the end of the day, we actually do feel like what we lost in the first quarter due to weather will ultimately pick up in the back three quarters of the year.
Joseph Ahlersmeyer: And then looking at your guidance for the all-in business and the base business, is it right to think about the commodity element of this as a full normalization of the multifamily? Are we getting sort of all of both the commodity normalization and market normalization in these '24 numbers? And then maybe if you could just talk about going forward, the opportunity within multifamily kind of between the five and below units versus the much larger projects?
Peter Jackson: That's right, Joe. These business reconciliation of those two components you mentioned is the last of the multifamily and the last of a little bit of the core not much left, which is nice, but that's certainly a piece of it.
David Rush: And I would tell you, you're exactly right; our sales teams that have focused on the larger projects partly because their customers are also looking for opportunities in the smaller projects that still qualified technically as multifamily or light commercial. We're all focused on those opportunities and those will help us bridge that headwind a little easier for the rest of the year. But it still takes a little bit of time for those projects to get out of the ground. And the timing of that makes it a little difficult, but only focused on that opportunity.
Operator: We'll turn now to Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms: Hey, good morning, Dave and Peter. Peter, you mentioned that there's -- you're seeing some evidence of residential starting to turn around. And I think you noted seeing high single-digit growth in lumber and low single-digit growth in truss. I guess what's the timing you're referring to there? Is that since January? Just some color on the time frame there? And then secondly, is there any reason why truss would be trending slower than lumber? I mean I didn't know if there would be anything going there from a mix standpoint or something? I would just assume value add would at least stay in pace with lumber or maybe outpace, just any color there?
Peter Jackson: Thanks for the question, Trey. So the time frame we're talking about was 4Q. So it was a fourth quarter dynamic. I think the storyline here, and we talked about it a bit in the past, but for those maybe who haven't heard it, what we sell goes into a start at a wide range of time lines, right? So lumber is generally very, very early. It's not unusual to frame the first floor and then have maybe the trusses delivered. There is a very close correlation between framing and trust. No argument there. I think that in general, it's indicative of the beginning of the turn. What's also true is some of the later products, you go through windows and you got out to doors and trim, that's later in the build process. And those are the products that you notice we didn't talk about as being turned and in good position. It's very reflective of last year. At the end of '22, you saw lumber and truss go down really hard. Lumber down a lot more than truss. So on a comparison basis, that's part of the answer as well that lumber was down aggressively if you go back to the numbers for the fourth quarter of last year. So on a comp basis, it's up a little bit more, but really because it was down a little bit.
David Rush: I mean, lumber and truss go hand-in-hand together, but value-added is more than truss. I think that's the thing you get from the mind. So value added is later in the process.
Operator: We'll turn now to Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America.
Rafe Jadrosich: Hey, good morning, very thanks for taking my question. The last quarter, you provided a scenario framework for 2024 on different macro assumptions and then what that would mean for your earnings? Are you -- should we still sort of be comfortable with that. So it starts tracking that 8% to 14% range on the single-family side and lumber is at $4.25 to $4.75. Would you still be looking for $2.7 million to $3.1 in EBITDA? Or has something else changed in the market where we should be thinking about upside or downside to those scenarios?
Peter Jackson: I think it's fair to say that directionally, those scenarios are still indicative of how we think of the business. There haven't been any real structural changes in any of the variables. It's always subjective to a degree because the ending point for 2023 was a bit different. But generally, yes. No, I think that's a fair way to look at it.
Rafe Jadrosich: That's really helpful. And then just as you look at the gross margin guidance for this year, is it 30% to 33%. And it's really in line with your long-term target despite single-family starts that are tracking below. I think the long-term assumption is $1.1 million. As we look forward here, if you have years where the starts are below that target, do you think you'll be able to do gross margin kind of above 30%? Or is there something unique to '24 that's keeping it higher? Is that just because you still have some multifamily that's flowing through?
Peter Jackson: It's a really good question. I think confidence, our confidence this year comes from that normalization component. We still have some above what we consider to be normal margins in multifamily and in a couple of product categories in a few pockets around the country. We're continuing to see that normalization. We're continuing to see some of that compete back to what we consider to be a likely normal. That said, we're obviously very good. It's very strong, and we're feeling very confident about our ability to manage it in the long term. At this stage, I think it's hard to say that it's an exact point of starts that correlates to an exact point in gross margins. I think we're most comfortable talking about it in sort of ranges around normal. It feels like a range around margins. But right now, a lot of confidence that we can hold in that normal range based on everything we're seeing.
David Rush: And what I would add is our belief in the resilience of that range and the fact that we can hold within that range is our belief in our value-added product portfolio and solutions. Those are the products that are more valuable to our customers and as a result, more have a better margin opportunity for us. And as we continue to grow that as a percentage of our overall sales is always going to help that gross margin number be more resilient.
Operator: We will now turn to Keith Hughes with Truist.
Keith Hughes: I don't think your projection here is aligned with what's thought in the market, just specific to Builders First Source. When do you think this is going to really start impacting your business? And if you talk about the unit loss versus margin loss that's been such a positive for '23, that would be helpful.
Peter Jackson: I mean, timing is a tough thing to predict, as you know, Keith. I think based on what we're seeing in and hearing, in the market is healthy. We've certainly seen some positive signs early in the year. It would be nice if the Fed helped, can't lie based on everything that's kind of out there in the public markets, it feels like a second half dynamic. When we call out the numbers around core organic, there's certainly a big component of it. It's primarily price volume mix driven, like we give you the days, we give you the commodities in the price/volume mix space that normalization talking about in margins is certainly an important part, a driver in terms of the normalization of gross margins, it's less of an impact on sales. So the driver this year really has to be unit volumes turning and starting to accelerate again. And that's our expectation, and that's what we're starting to see. So there's certainly a lot of optimism, I would say, at this point, it really becomes a question of timing.
Operator: We'll turn now to Collin Verron with Jefferies.
Collin Verron: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just want to dive into the multifamily, a little bit more in your assumption around that 20% to 30% decline in multifamily starts. I guess, any help in thinking about your sales performance versus that start to decline for the full year, just given the backlog of projects that's still under construction according to the Census Bureau data, and maybe the lag that you would normally see from a start to your sales? And then I guess, second on that, can you just help us think about the cadence of the multifamily stores maybe on a quarterly basis throughout the year to kind of get to that sales performance?
Peter Jackson: I mean I would say, if you're thinking about our multifamily business, you do have to go back in the rearview mirror a bit, right, in the turn-around what we build, and this is the problem in terms of everybody being able to use the sort of publicly available information. It's a little bit more specific both to markets and what we're building. However, I think what we're seeing right now is that the expected downturn throughout 2024, kind of thought it might hit late in 2023, didn't. I think people were pretty aggressive at trying to get the multifamily projects completed. So we actually saw a nice pull through a little better than we thought of that business in the fourth quarter, but definitely seeing it turn down starting in Q1 in every quarter during the year, you'll see for the multifamily business. Meaningful declines in both sales and margins as the year progresses. Still a really good business. It's just not sort of performing at those two standard deviations above normal levels anymore.
David Rush: I would just add, remember, it's only 13% of our overall business. The other thing I would add is we were at the Harvard Housing Conference, and there were multifamily players there. And it's a cost of capital challenge in addition to all of the multifamily that had been constructed over the last 12 to 18 months is coming to market all at the same time. So there's a little bit of a digestion of that in addition to solving the capital cost equation. But again, just like in single-family, the long-term outlook for multifamily is very positive when you look at the demand curve and what people need housing and what multifamily satisfies for that population. So long term, we're still very positive on the business. And we do know we'll have to manage some of the cost -- the capital challenges at or there today. But again, 13% of our business.
Collin Verron: And then I just wanted to touch on productivity, which continues to be a pretty meaningful tailwind for you guys. Can you just talk about the projects you're looking to benefit from in 2024 and maybe the size of the project pipeline beyond 2024?
Peter Jackson: Yes. The productivity initiatives are in two kind of camps. One is how can we improve our productivity through automation and technology and then how can we do it through best practices. The benefit of our scale, our 550-plus locations, is the ability to take a best practice across the enterprise and get little chunks of productivity in every single location. So it falls in those two camps. A lot of the automation and technology is around improving customer service, improving truck turnaround times also in the manufacturing environment using automation to get more throughput per labor hour. But that would outline the things we're working on for 2020.
Operator: We'll go next to Adam Baumgarten with Zelman.
Adam Baumgarten: Hey, good morning. If we look at the market for manufactured products like truss, are you seeing your competitors ramp up capacity as well?
Peter Jackson: Sure, a little. But I mean scale-wise, we're 5x, 10x, 20x their size. So if they're adding one or two plants in certain markets, we know how to deal with it.
David Rush: I would tell you the other differentiation we have is not just adding locations, it's actually improving the throughput of the locations we already own. We've invested over $100 million in existing plants. Over 65% of our tables have some level of automation. Every plant has some level of automation. So there's a lot of different ways we can extend our lead without building physical plant to do so, and we're focused on that as well.
Adam Baumgarten: And then just thinking about the M&A environment, are you seeing more willingness by acquisition targets to sell at this point given the improved outlook?
Peter Jackson: Yes, it's gotten a little better. I think one of the things that was holding back the M&A environment was just uncertainty around the direction of the market and people not knowing where the bottom was and not having sort of kind of a valuation to step off of. And that created disagreements between buyers and sellers. I think that's calmed down a bit. So we're a little bit more optimistic for this year, but deals are unique. Each one is a unicorn. I would say the one thing that's also improved the farther away we've gotten to the unusual commodity impact on numbers. People are now more easily or readily accepting of a base business kind of valuation for the -- for what they have going forward, and that makes the conversations easier.
Operator: We'll go now to Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.
Ketan Mamtora: Thanks for taking my question. I was curious if you can talk a little bit about sort of what you're seeing in Q1. I mean you talked about weather being a challenge. But sales, you're pointing to kind of flat to down, but EBITDA is down quite a bit more. Peter, is there any way to sort of think about how much of it is weather-driven versus margin normalization?
Peter Jackson: Yes. The weather is modest. I think it's two to three days in terms of what we are anticipating in terms of a headwind. So that's not a huge deal. In general with the exception of that component, you've got pretty healthy business, both on a year-over-year basis and on a trending basis. So I think that's a positive. What you are seeing, though, and I think it's fair to point it out is the year-over-year lapping of what we've been talking about. I think you've heard me talk about that normalization of margins. And I've been pretty adamant that behind the scenes, regardless of this multifamily curing it, we have seen business getting back to normal in terms of the supply chain normalizing and are negotiating in the competitive environment, things just settling back down to a more normal level. And you're seeing a little bit of that in terms of the year-over-year again, still a very good number, still a very strong performance for the business, but more in line with what we would expect going forward.
David Rush: I would just add from a customer sentiment perspective, the national biller, customers are seeing increased foot traffic. And more importantly, the foot traffic that they are seeing are more apt to actually buy a home. So the percentage of closings to people looking, I feel like is gaining traction and their ability to match up available inventory and monthly mortgage payment to demand is -- they've done a great job with that. Now where we need a little help from the Fed mortgage rates would be to get the non-national builder customer in an arena where the cost of the mortgage is helping to drive that demand to them. So that less so, but we expect that to be what is the first off the sidelines when we get that movement, but the national builders have done a good job in the existing environment.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Dave Manthey with Baird.
David Manthey: Hi, good morning everyone. I'm thinking broadly on a product basis. Is the margin differential between commodity and value-added product different than it was five to seven years ago? I assume both categories have moved up. But as we normalize out here and go forward the next three to five, can you just discuss the delta between those two?
Peter Jackson: Yes, that's fair to say. You're right. We've seen improvements across the Board in terms of margins. Some of that very simply to cover the inflation and the incremental cost, but we have certainly seen an increase and I would also point to our productivity as a driver for why value add has extended its differentiation from commodity. Those Dave referred to $100-plus million worth of investment and the efforts we've put around our team to improve our internal board [indiscernible] hour, our doors per man hour type of productivity metrics has contributed to a bigger differential between value add on average and commodity.
Operator: We'll go next to Jay McCanless with Wedbush.
James McCanless: Hey, good morning everyone. So my question is on the outlook for R&R. I think, up low single digits probably a little bit better, I'd say, than what some of the other national forecasters are expecting. Is that acquisitions driving that? Or do you feel like in those specific markets, you can actually see growth above what people are expecting? .
Peter Jackson: Jay, thanks for the question. For us, R&R kind of falls into two camps. There's R&R DIY and Retail. And then there's kind of pro-remodel R&R. And I think with us, too, it's market specific. We don't do it everywhere. So that's why there's a little difference in what we believe is going to happen for us, possibly versus some of the national guys and a lot of what I think is a headwind for them are big ticket items that we have never sold and don't sell like appliances, et cetera. So the fact that we have kind of a different product offering to that group a different kind of customer focus and in different parts of the country is why we -- why I believe we might have a little different expectation.
David Rush: Also, I think, taken advantage of capacity availability to lean into it as well, and that's a different component than others might have.
Peter Jackson: I mean we're such a small player in that overall market segment, it's a little easier for us to kind of grow that if we just focus on it a little bit. And we have the ability to do that in this current environment.
James McCanless: And just one other quick question. I think the $200 million you called out, Dave, in terms of incremental digital sales this year. Maybe talk a little bit more about that, what that's going to look like and why you all feel like -- I think this is new guidance for you guys, just kind of why you wanted to talk about that now and what those incremental sales would look like, please?
Peter Jackson: Perfect. Thank you for teeing that up for me, Jay. Next week, at IBS, we're doing a [indiscernible] product launch. Then we'll be rolling our digital tools out market by market. There's a lot of preparation in training our sales team to then know how to intelligently explain it to our customers and show the benefits to our customers. And that just takes time. And we're doing it market by market. We're making sure we do it right the first time. And as we get momentum, it will -- you'll see the efforts paying off in the later part of the year. And that's why I said more like a hockey stick probably in 2024. But we're really excited about it, and it all starts next week with the IBS product launch.
Operator: We'll go next to Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.
Kurt Yinger: I just wanted to stick with the digital tools and the rollout there. I was hoping you could talk about maybe the cost impact in 2024 and recognizing that the sales are back half weighted, and it's kind of the first year that you're fully rolling these. How should we think about kind of the incremental margins attached to those sales?
Peter Jackson: Yes Kurt, thanks for the question. So the short answer is we expect the sales pull-through to be pretty consistent with what we're already selling. The costs associated with the digital tools and the development, the rollout and even largely the support is included in the numbers. It's really been spent over the past few years. So there's no -- there's no other material that you're going to see in terms of deltas. The thing we're going to keep a close eye on is what is the support infrastructure necessary to make sure we have the right level of customer experience. We think we have an eye on it, but that's probably the only one that could potentially increase if this really picks up quickly. Again, I don't think it will be big enough to really hit the radar for anybody, even if that were to happen, just based on the service model that we've built out. It's really all about that incremental sales being pulled through from incremental share of wallet and new customers that really like being able to utilize these modern digital tools.
Operator: We'll move now to Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.
Steven Ramsey: Wanted to hold in on the installation sales, which at the Investor Day, you estimated at 15% of 2023 sales. I guess, first, is that about where it landed last year? and then thinking for 2024, is there an expectation that installation sales can grow on an absolute basis and where that lands as a percent of the total base business?
Peter Jackson: Thanks for the question. Installation is definitely a focus point for our strategy for 2024 as it fits very nicely into solving our customers' pain points. We do it successfully in a lot of markets today. We did $2.5 billion of material labor sales in related insulation last year. So our focus is to grow both organically and inorganically. The low-hanging fruit is the markets that we are already doing some level of installation expanding the products that we install in those markets. But we're also looking at new markets that have not done installation in the past. To do that effectively, we put our best people together and we developed an installation playbook that people can access and utilize to grow that business in their markets. And we're always looking for people who are already doing it well today that could fit into our profile through M&A. So we're going to pull all of those levers during the year, but it will be starting in Q2 and then going from there for the most part. And it will be focused on the things we're already good at today.
Operator: We'll go next to Jeffrey Stevenson with Loop Capital.
Jeffrey Stevenson: Are you expecting any price deflation this year in categories such as EWP and millwork, which benefited from supply-driven pricing gains the last several years?
Peter Jackson: Well, we already saw that in the last part of the year for EWP. I don't know that we'd see too much more of that going forward. And I would call it more supply chain normalization than I would significant deflation. I think they're still challenged with a lot of inflationary operating costs that we all are. So I don't expect that they're going to be able to significantly reduce price. I think it's more holding than where it is right now that we're expecting and hoping for. But quite frankly, it wouldn't surprise me if inflation cause is even price increases going into the year.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session as well as today's event. We want to thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Builders FirstSource Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I’d now like to turn the call over to Heather Kos, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead.
Heather Kos: Good morning. And welcome to our third quarter earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. The earnings press release and investor presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes and they should be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today’s press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Rush: Thank you, Heather. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Before we begin, I want to formally welcome Heather to the Builders FirstSource team. We are excited to have someone with her deep knowledge and decades of experience leading Investor Relations, which is a critical function here. Heather, welcome. Now on to our Q3 performance. Despite industry volatility caused by macroeconomic headwinds, our resilient third quarter results reflect the strength of our value-added portfolio, broad footprint and operational initiatives we have put in place over the past several years. While challenges remain due to inflation and increasing mortgage rates, we continue to generate healthy margins. This is proof of our attractive product mix and the benefits of our investments in multifamily. We remain confident in our 2023 outlook, as we focus on being the best partner for our customers and executing our strategy to drive long-term growth. We continue to create robust free cash flow and invest in the business to operate more efficiently, increase customer loyalty and expand our footprint. We are committed to operational excellence, including capturing efficiencies in our supply chain, as well as investing in automation and process improvements. These efforts are driving productivity savings and helping address our customers’ labor challenges now and into the future. We are helping our customers reduce cycle times, which is highlighted by improving our in-full deliveries from 94% last year to 96% during the third quarter. On-time and in-full deliveries ensure our customers have the right material at the right time, building their loyalty and trust in us. We are continuing our investments in value-added solutions organically and through M&A to help our customers build more efficiently. These accretive acquisitions have enhanced our value-added product coverage and helped us achieve a leading position in desirable markets. As we grow share in these higher margin products, we are driving mixed improvement across the business. Our strong free cash flow provides multiple paths for capital deployment, all towards creating shareholder value. Given the long runway of potential tuck-ins, we will remain acquisitive to bolster our growth potential, while maintaining a disciplined focus on the highest return opportunities. Looking at our third quarter highlights on slide four, gross margin was approximately 35% and only down slightly on a sequential basis. Despite normalization in core margins, our overall margins have remained resilient, primarily due to stronger mix in value-added products, including our multifamily business and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Our adjusted EBITDA margin also remains strong, highlighting our ability to manage our operations effectively in a challenging and dynamic environment. This execution is a reflection of our talented and focused field leadership team. Turning to slide five, we generated strong productivity savings of $54 million during the quarter. This reflects the effectiveness of our BFS One Team Operating System, which delivers value across the business by building people, excellence and growth. Our recent acquisitions in multifamily contributed an increase of 2% in sales and 4% in EBITDA compared to the prior year quarter. Multifamily remained a tailwind this quarter and we expect this strength to continue for the remainder of 2023 before declining around the second quarter of next year. Disciplined SG&A expense management remains a key focus area. This includes the ongoing optimization of our footprint and balancing the need for cost reductions against future capacity needs. We are focused on our discretionary spending and our team has responsibly managed cost in the short-term, while executing our strategy for the long-term. Regarding our industry, the national builders have reported resilient results by providing incentives such as interest rate buydowns to ease affordability challenges and attract prospective buyers. The limited inventory of existing homes for sale is also steering traffic to new construction. As we look forward to 2024, we will maintain our best-in-class customer service, continue our emphasis on expanding our value-added product mix and launch our BFS digital tool to make building process faster, more efficient and more affordable. Turning to M&A on slide six, we continue to target attractive opportunities while remaining financially disciplined. Through the third quarter, we have completed five deals with aggregate prior year sales of roughly $350 million. In September, we acquired Frank’s Cash & Carry, a leading building material distributor with trust manufacturing in the Florida Panhandle. We are pleased that this acquisition will help us grow with builders in the area. And earlier in the third quarter, we acquired Church’s Lumber, which expanded our presence in the Detroit market. We’re excited to welcome these talented new team members to the BFS family. As shown on slide six, our M&A and organic investments have substantially increased our value-added product mix and diversified our end markets. We have seen the fruit of this growth in recent quarters through higher gross margins, even in a down housing market. Moving to slide seven, I would like to provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter, we prudently deployed capital in line with our stated priorities. We made two tuck-in acquisitions and repurchased over $200 million of shares, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have cumulatively deployed approximately $5.7 billion since the end of 2021 and remain on track to achieve our 2025 goal of deploying $7 billion to $10 billion of capital, as communicated our Investor Day in December 2021. Now let’s turn to slide eight and nine for an update on our digital strategy. We are steadfast in our commitment to leading the digital evolution in our industry and generating new innovations to drive greater efficiency across home building and enhance our product and service offerings. As we look forward to our full product launch in Q1, we have made it a priority to drive digital adoption across our operations. myBLDR.com is designed to create efficiencies for both our team members and customers by offering improved transparency and engagement in the homebuilding process. Taking with our proprietary estimating and configuration tools, this gives our customers more control over the entire building process, saving both time and money for our customers and their clients, while making the homebuilding process more personalized. In the third quarter, we continued our product development and adoption efforts as we prepare for the upcoming full product launch. These are important milestones in our journey to reshape the industry and extend our lead as the partner of choice in the market and attain our goal of $1 billion in incremental sales by 2026. We look forward to sharing more information with you at our Investor Day next month. At BFS, we pride ourselves on helping our people achieve their career goals. A team member who has taken full advantage of every growth opportunity presented to her is Sue Dean, the General Manager of our Florence, South Carolina location. Through the various roles she’s held over her more than 40 years with BFS, she’s earned the nickname Sue Deany for her ability to solve problems and make magic happen. Since being promoted as General Manager, Sue has led her location to achieve exceptional results by recognizing her team members’ potential and empowering them. It’s stories like Sue’s that made me excited to see all the different ways our team members can grow here at BFS. I’ll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our third quarter financial result in greater detail.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate the effectiveness of our operating model in the face of macro volatility. We are maintaining a healthy balance sheet and prudently deploying capital to the highest return opportunities, which included share repurchases during the quarter. We are leveraging our sustainable competitive advantages and strong financial position to drive future growth and value creation for our shareholders. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I’ll recap our third quarter results. Second, I’ll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I’ll discuss our full year 2023 guidance and 2024 scenarios. Let’s begin by reviewing our third quarter performance on slides 10 and 11. We delivered $4.5 billion in net sales. For organic sales decreased by 14%, driven by a 19% decline in single-family due to slower demand over the prior year, supply chain normalization and commodity deflation of approximately 9%. Multifamily grew by over 6%, driven by our recent acquisitions, as well as favorable margins, largely attributable to the longer lead time for this end market. R&R and other grew by over 1% amid increased sales focus and capacity versus the prior year. The cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth to net sales. Importantly, value-added products represented 51% of our net sales this quarter, increasing 6 percentage points since Investor Day in Q4 2021. This reflects our position as the supplier of choice for these higher margin products. During the third quarter, gross profit was $1.6 billion, a decrease of approximately 22% compared to the prior year period. Gross margins were 34.9%, decreasing 10 basis points due to normalization in core organic gross margins, offset by roughly 125 basis points of our previously discussed multifamily over earning. SG&A decreased $61 million to $940 million, mainly due to lower variable compensation, partially offset by additional expenses from operations acquired in the last year and inflation. Acquisitions increased SG&A by $34 million in the quarter. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 330 basis points to 20.7%, primarily attributable to decreased fixed cost leverage from lower sales. We remain focused on operating efficiently, containing costs and effectively integrating acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $813 million, down 31%, primarily driven by lower net sales due to a weaker housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin remained a robust 17.9%, up 90 basis points sequentially as we continue to execute and drive improved productivity across the business. Adjusted net income of $534 million was down $280 million from the prior year quarter. The 34% decrease was largely due to lower net sales. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $4.24, down 19%, compared to $5.20 in the prior year period. On a year-over-year basis, share repurchases added roughly $0.83 per share. Now let’s turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on slide 12. Our third quarter operating cash flow was approximately $665 million, down $835 million, compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to commodity deflation and a weaker housing market. Capital expenditures were $128 million. All in, we delivered healthy free cash flow of approximately $538 million. For the trailing 12 months ended September 30th, our free cash flow yield was 14.1%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 32%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1 times, while base business leverage was 1.5 times. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.1 billion, consisting of $1 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $100 million of cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment, during the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares for $224 million at an average stock price of $136.22 per share. Year-to-date, we have repurchased nearly $1.6 billion of shares at an average price of $97.43 per share. We have approximately $400 million remaining on our most recent $1 billion share repurchase program, approved in April of 2023. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and have multiple paths for value creation through a proven ability to deploy capital and deliver high returns. Now let’s turn to our outlook on slide 13. Given affordability headwinds, our Q3 sales were a little softer than expected. However, the October sales trend was seasonally healthy, and our focus -- our continued focus and execution gives us confidence that we will achieve our full year base business and total company EBITDA guidance for 2023 that we outlined in our second quarter earnings call. For full year 2023, we expect total company net sales to be $16.8 billion to $17.1 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 15.8% to 16.7%. We are guiding gross margins to a range of 34% to 35%. Our recent above-normal margins reflect a greater mix of value-added products, along with disciplined pricing required to offset increased operating costs. As we move through the end of the year, we expect both our gross margins and the multifamily business to continue to normalize. We expect full year 2023 free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. The free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $425. Our 2023 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and slide 14 of the investor presentation for a full list of these assumptions. Turning to slides 15 and 16, as a reminder, our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing sales and margins for commodity volatility. This helps to clear -- to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance. Our base business guide on net sales is $16.4 billion. Our base business EBITDA guide is $2.2 billion at a margin of 13.5%. Moving to slide 17, we recognize that 2024 is coming into focus as we approach year end. Like we did earlier this year, we have laid out a scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance across a range of potential housing market and commodity conditions. I want to emphasize that this is not full year guidance for 2024, but these scenarios should help clarify our range of performance expectations for 2024 and demonstrate the strength of our best-in-class operating platform. As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are confident in the near-term outlook, our exceptional positioning to execute our strategic goals and our ability to create value in any environment to support profitable growth. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts.
Dave Rush: Thanks, Peter. Let me close by saying that we’re executing on our strategic pillars to deliver long-term value creation. Our tireless team effort has resulted in a differentiated platform, setting us up for above market growth and exceptional profitability for years to come. I continue to be proud of our operational excellence, which is driving increased safety, productivity and profitability despite market headwinds. We are in a great position today and as end markets further stabilize, we are positioned for an even stronger future. We’ll remain at the forefront of technology with our BFS digital tool, which I’m confident will be a game-changer for the industry. We are exceptionally well-positioned in the marketplace to navigate complex operating environments due to our value-added solutions, fortress balance sheet and strong free cash flow generation. We’re excited to share more details about our longer term vision at our upcoming Investor Day on December 5th in Atlanta and look forward to seeing you there. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let’s please open the call now for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. I think it’s very helpful that you outlined those 2024 framework assumptions here, especially as you look ahead to the Investor Day, perhaps, precluding some of that line of questioning so you can focus a bit more the longer term. So my questions will focus on that. I think I see in the footnote that you are making assumptions about multifamily and R&R into 2024. I think, Dave, earlier you made a very specific comment that multifamily could turn in the second quarter of next year. So my question is, how is multifamily contemplated from both a growth and margin perspective in that 2024 framework? Thanks, guys.
Dave Rush: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Appreciate the question. As you know, the multifamily projects have a longer life cycle, tend to be 19 months to 18 months. So what we’re seeing in the backlog right now is healthy and will carry us through the first quarter of next year. What’s changing, the dynamic that’s changing a bit is the projects, the new projects are slower to come to market. We believe there’s going to be a pause in some of the multifamily as the market digests what’s coming, what’s completing throughout this year and as they figure out the right balance between cost of capital and rents and what return they can get on the rents, we just think there’s going to be a temporary pause and then things will start up again at the tail end of 2024. But again, because there’s such a long cycle for those projects to get into the ground, we won’t necessarily see that effect in 2024. So we’re forecasting for multifamily to be off in 2024 as a result.
Peter Jackson: Yeah. Just to add to it. I think it’s the theme of normalization. We’ve seen such displacement in the industry over the last couple of years, multifamily included. You’re going to see that theme, I think, in a lot of what we’re talking about. Things are going well, but certainly normalizing back from some of that displacement.
Matthew Bouley: Got it. Okay. Thanks for that, guys. Very helpful. And then second one, the -- I’m sticking on the framework here. On the single-family side, I guess, it’s two parter. Number one, the low end of a down 4%, just given where interest rates are and a lot of the questions out there, the question is effectively why not outline a lower end? And in that scenario of a lower end, would you be able to kind of push any harder on cost out? So that’s kind of part one of the question. And then part two is just, given the sort of mid-teens EBITDA margin you’re guiding to, I guess, what is the sort of implied gross margin in that? I know there’s a lot in there, but thanks, guys.
Peter Jackson: Yeah. So, I think, a couple of factors. The first is that we harvested the feedback from the economists. That’s generally what we lean on, just like everybody else when it comes to the expectations for next year. We certainly try and temper it a little bit by, let’s say, eliminating as statisticians do the high and the low end or the ones that look ridiculous in terms of trying to come up with a real number. Up until very recently, I would tell you that the sense was that we would see some nice growth next year. Admittedly, some of the more recent revisions from the economists have pulled it back, but I still think it’s fairly favorable. So, what will play out?
Matthew Bouley: Sure.
Peter Jackson: That’s a fair -- it’s a fair comment. Really, the reason why we gave the range that we did is we think there are a number of scenarios that could play out. If you want to go below the low end of this, I love the question because I think what you didn’t ask is as informative as anything and that’s nobody’s challenging our double-digit margins, even when the market’s down. And that’s because we’ve demonstrated an ability to maintain those margins, to see healthy profitability, to benefit from the mix of our business and we expect to continue to be able to do that. Now, we’ll certainly retain our discipline around costs. We’ll continue to resize facilities and markets, depending on what the starts number is and what the business looks like. But I think our theme around here is really about consistent performance and operational excellence and not really seeing a huge need to do something unwise for the business, but just keep doing what we’re doing because we’re seeing great results.
Dave Rush: And just to add, Matt, it’s continued to drive costs out of the business that don’t add value, the benefit of our platform and the fact that we’ve done the hard work in the last two years to integrate these companies. We have a 30-year average experience with our field leadership group. They know what to do, when to do it and how to manage those costs effectively to maximize whatever is presented to us. And we’ve identified a lot of opportunities to continue to focus on productivity and where we are now is we don’t have to keep reinventing those opportunities because our scale allows us to push that across the platform and we have plenty of runway to take existing ideas in the markets that we haven’t been able to push those ideas yet just because of our scale and find -- keep finding dollars to save.
Matthew Bouley: Got it. That’s super helpful. And on my question, did you have anything around the gross margin expectation within that mid-teens EBITDA guide?
Peter Jackson: We won’t give anything specific, but I think it’s fair to say we do expect to see normalization into 2024, that pullback, the reversal of the multifamily in particular. But overall, that normalization theme, I think, applies to margins as well.
Matthew Bouley: Got it. Appreciate the very comprehensive answers, guys. See you in Atlanta in a month. Thank you.
Dave Rush: Thanks, Matt.
Peter Jackson: Thanks.
Operator: And we have our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Dave Rush: Hi.
Trey Grooms: So first question, Peter, you mentioned that October trends were, I think, you used the word healthy. Can you go through maybe some more detail on 4Q, kind of what you’re seeing thus far and maybe what kind of looking into your single-family assumption that you’re baking in here for the 4Q guide?
Peter Jackson: Sure. I can get started. I’m sure Dave will have a commentary as well. But the year has been a good year, right? We had that big reset at the beginning when the builders decided where their new rates would be, and it’s been very stable. I think we did expect there to be a little bit more volume in the third quarter. We thought there’d be a little bit of a push. Certainly the commentary from the large nationals was very strong and for a variety of reasons, whether it be tone or weather or whatever the factors were, it just wasn’t as good as we expected. Our performance was still quite good. We’re certainly pleased with our profitability. But as we look at the way the year has played out into the fourth quarter, it’s still healthy. The strength of the business continues and we’re pleased with that ability to continue to see good flow through on the sales side, despite some of the headlines that sort of have gotten everybody so concerned.
Dave Rush: Yeah. The only thing I’d add is the national builders continue to be stable, right? I’m not saying that they’re expecting substantial robust growth, but they’re definitely still going forward with the plans that they’ve communicated to us. Their ability to use interest rate buy downs and get a prospective buyer into a monthly payment they can afford is working. They’re basically using that methodology to get a payment and then go from the payment to a selection of house based on that payment and that’s working. So that’s encouraging for the fourth quarter at least to stay at a stable rate and really only be affected by seasonality.
Trey Grooms: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then, the full digital rollout coming up soon, any color on how that plays into your scenario analysis for next year that you rolled out?
Peter Jackson: It’s pretty modest in the first year. It’s in the hundreds of millions of sales, but we’ve certainly got a lot of focus in the organization on the initial adoption, the communication and getting it into the hands of both our side of our sales people and leadership, as well as our customers. But so far, the feedback’s been great. We’re really pleased with the tools and the development successes. We’re meeting milestones and feeling really good about the product that we’re going to have to show the market and we’re excited that the market’s going to be able to benefit from the tools to improve efficiency and take costs out.
Dave Rush: The development is right on track. We had a preview this week, in fact, of some of the features and that continued to be wowed by our development team. But it’s changed, it’s not only changed for the customers we’re going to introduce it to, but it’s changed for our people. And we want to make sure we do this the right way, the prudent way, methodically, making sure the adoption goes the way we want, because we really only get one bite at this apple. And we want to make sure that what we do is the best way for us to ensure success. But what we’re showing people, you’re going to be impressed by. I can’t wait for you guys to see it when you get to it live.
Trey Grooms: Okay. Looking forward to it. Thanks for taking my questions and keep up the good work. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Trey.
Operator: And we have our next question from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank.
Joe Ahlersmeyer: Thanks, everybody. Quickly on the 2024 scenarios, I’m just wondering if you could add some context on the revenue assumptions here, because if you take the single-family starts numbers and kind of take that on your base business revenue, your output on sales would be much higher than that and I get there’s other things in there. You’re giving the commodity assumptions, though, and I don’t think M&A is that significant carryover into next year and you’re talking about multifamily down. So what I guess I’m getting to is there seems to be sort of like a mid-single-digit type outperformance to the starts volume. Wondering if you could just touch on whether you think that’s actual price or if you’re baking in some outperformance versus that volume?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. Yeah. I guess the short answer is we are expecting some outperformance. But if I just could re-baseline on the key components. Single-family up, multifamily down on the normalization. The two big drivers there, obviously, continued normalization in both the sales and the margins in those displaced areas. Multifamily, those categories where we saw some out-earning, that’s certainly happening. But we are confident in our ability to take share and see growth based on what we’ve been able to deliver and the investments we’ve made.
Joe Ahlersmeyer: That’s great. Very encouraging. And then you mentioned sort of getting these ranges from economists’ discussions. What about your discussions for 2024 with the large builders and even small and regional builders? And then just wondering if you could touch on any differences in outlook between those two groups into next year?
Dave Rush: Well, the smaller builders don’t have the access to rate buydowns that the larger builders have had and that’s really the main differentiating factor. Interestingly enough, it’s a small percentage of the total market, but there’s a marked increase in cash buyers, which is a big part of what’s going to keep the smaller guys going as well. I think it’s still, the word is, I would use it stable. Again, I don’t think it’ll be robust from a standpoint of every -- all the macroeconomic uncertainty getting resolved. But the demand is clearly there. I mean, I think that’s what’s carried us through with all the headwinds that we’ve faced as an industry in the last six months. The -- I think it’s been a ultimate proof point that the long-term demand is there. So as far -- as long as we can keep that affordability equation in check, I think that it’ll be a stable environment and that’s what we’re hearing from our larger customers.
Joe Ahlersmeyer: Very good. Thanks a lot, everyone.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: And we have our next question from Keith Hughes with Truist.
Keith Hughes: Thank you for the question on the actual quarter. The value-added products saw pressure with the rest of the market, didn’t really outperform the company average as much as normal. I’m just wondering about specifically in the quarter, what was going on there and what the next couple of quarters you think looks like in those products?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. No. That’s a good question, Keith. One of the things that obviously drew my attention was that number this quarter and making sure that we understood exactly what was going on in the business. I’ll start by saying, we feel very good about the number. It has performed better than expected versus the starts over the last year and it’s given us confidence that both the volume and the margins are real and sustainable. What you’re seeing in the comps, though, is that last year when the thing -- when the market, when single-family starts really started to turn down, we saw a massive and meaningful impact on the lumber and lumber sheet goods, right, the core commodity component of our business. That turned down quick, but at the same time, we were still seeing growth in our value-added categories. The manufacturer product, window stores and millwork, all still growing as we were working through all that backlog, right? The extended cycle times by the builders, the lack of product by the vendors, that was clearing. So that was a dynamic last year. This year, we’re lapping that. And so what we’ve seen is that, well, statistically or on a percentage basis a bit weaker than some of the other categories and looking worse on average. It’s actually in line. It’s just a little bit of timing in terms of the year-over-year. So, still feel good about it, still investing, still seeing the benefits, both on the profitability and the revenue line, but a little bit of comp issue.
Dave Rush: I would just add that, the thing I pay attention to is what’s the average backlog in our plants today? Very healthy, three-week to four-week backlog. That’s where we want to be because we want to be at that level of customer service as well. We’re seeing that still stay steady and healthy.
Keith Hughes: Okay. Thank you. One other question on the price deflation in the quarter. Is that all lumber or are there any other products where you’re seeing prices deflating year-to-year?
Peter Jackson: I’d say in general, it’s across the Board. We’ve talked a lot about inflation and some of the impacts there. Some of that has pulled back. We’ve seen certain categories pull back. We’ve seen the competition increase and some of those margins erode. Clearly, the bulk of it, the vast majority of it is on the commodity components, but we’ve seen a little bit elsewhere, probably value add, no, not probably, value add the least in terms of margin normalization, but across the Board, I think it’s fair to say.
Keith Hughes: Okay.
Dave Rush: Yeah. Were you asking about price or our costs from vendors?
Keith Hughes: I was -- well, really both. I mean, just in general, between both coming in and out of the warehouse, besides lumber, are there any specific products that you would call out that’s seeing more deflation than others?
Peter Jackson: I think we’ve talked about it in prior quarters, there are a couple of categories that we’ve seen make some moves, probably, the better, the most obvious example is after commodities is engineered lumber. They had some pretty substantial price increases and have given a portion of that back. I would say in general, though, it’s been fairly modest.
Keith Hughes: Okay.
Peter Jackson: Good news is there have been cost increases for the most part that’s leveled out. We’re back to a regular, normal increase for cost of inflation and that’s it.
Keith Hughes: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Dave Rush: Thanks, Keith.
Operator: And we have our next question from Collin Verron with Jefferies.
Collin Verron: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I appreciate the color in single-family and multifamily. I was just hoping you can walk us through how you’re thinking about the R&R end market in the potential 2024 scenarios, kind of what informs your assumptions around those markets and maybe how the R&R business stacks up from a margin or product mix perspective?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. I mean, R&R is fairly small for us, as you know. In that 20% of the business range, it’s inclusive of our retail and commercial categories. So that’s -- there’s a lot in there. In general, what we’ve seen is that we’ve had a bit more capacity available as the overall market has slowed and that’s allowed us to focus in and we’ve had some success. So while there have been, we see it as well, some headlines out of the economists that the investment side on the R&R might be pressured, we’re feeling pretty good about what we’ve seen so far and our ability to fill available capacity by just offering our better services and product portfolio and expertise to categories of customers who want it but haven’t been able to get access to it.
Collin Verron: Great. That’s a helpful color. And then on the gross margin side, I think in the quarter it held up better than I think your previous guide would have implied. Can you just walk us through why margins were more resilient this quarter than you anticipated and maybe help us think about the step down in margins and how quickly you think that that could happen to get to that longer term guide that you’ve put out there?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. No. That’s the million-dollar question, Collin. You’re absolutely right. We continue to wrestle with this. We continue to see the trends of that normalization, right? The share that we took, that we took a lot of and given back a little bit of it. The price that we took and we took a lot of and given back a little bit of it. It has played out, but I think it’s been slower than we’ve anticipated. This quarter we did see a fair amount of what we expected. I think where the beat came, at least in my mind, was some of the timing around some of the rebates, some of the productivity, some of the favorable tailwinds and some of the product mix, which is a little better than expected. Not massive, but it accumulated into a number that was a healthy beat on the margin line, to your point, expected.
Dave Rush: The only thing I’d add is, we have a focus on using our scale to leverage our supply chain opportunities better, get a lower landed cost, more direct sourcing. Those come in little bits. We get a bite here on a product, a bite there on a product, but over time they start adding up. That along with the investments we’ve made in the manufacturing, automation and the efficiencies gained there, again, a little bit at a time, but then you look back at six months of doing it and it’s actually a meaningful number. Those things we’re starting to be able to track and see actually help.
Collin Verron: Great. I appreciate the call and good luck going forward.
Dave Rush: Thank you.
Operator: And we have our next question from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman.
Adam Baumgarten: Hey guys. You mentioned the multifamily declines that you’re expecting in the second quarter of next year. Do you expect that business to normalize from a margin perspective in 2024 at this point? I know it’s been a bit of a tailwind.
Peter Jackson: We do. Yeah. We think those things are kind of hand in glove, both the volumes and then the resulting margins as competition levels a little bit.
Adam Baumgarten: Okay. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.
Dave Rush: Hi, Kurt.
Kurt Yinger: Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Hey. I just wanted to stick on the gross margin line and I guess if you were to kind of peel back some of the multifamily benefits, I mean, how would you kind of characterize where that core gross margin stands versus where you would expect normalized to be and what stage of that normalization process are we in, because we’ve talked about it in a long time. It seems like over the last several quarters, it started to materialize, but the tail of how that stretches into next year also seems pretty long. So just love to hear your thoughts there?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. So there’s a couple of different pieces, right? If you stipulate, which I think you have, that we’ve set multifamily aside for all the reasons we’ve already talked about, I think the storyline on single-family is that we’ve seen the bulk of the margin normalization in the core products. There’s more to go, but I think we’ve seen the bulk of it. If you look at subcategories quarter-over-quarter, so Q3 2023 to Q3 2022, you’re talking mid-single digits percentages of margin that we’ve given back in the commodity space. We’ve given back price and margin in every one of the categories. So that normalization that we’ve been talking about, we’ve been digesting it and we’ve been processing it. I don’t think we’re done. I think when we look at the numbers, we see the trends in certain categories and markets, there’s probably another leg there, but it’s far smaller than the first leg. So we’re in the sixth, seventh inning here. We’re not in the second inning. That said, there’s certainly every quarter timing and things that come through in terms of, like Dave said, when we see benefits, when we see the timing on certain rebates, that sort of thing and multifamily is not to be minimized, right? It’s been a big deal for us this year and we do think it will normalize into next year.
Kurt Yinger: Okay. That’s super helpful. And then just on the technology front, I’m curious with some of the pilots that you’ve had, what are some of the most promising offerings within that where you’ve seen particular traction and maybe some of the big learnings that you’ve taken away from these programs that you’ll look to implement or change on the full scale launch early next year?
Dave Rush: Yeah. That’s a great question. I would tell you, understand the pilots are not for learning how to implement. It’s for learning how to develop. So what we’ve used the pilots for is get the product where we want it to get. Having said that, one of the favorite modules of the folks that are engaged is the one that you can take and put all the plans for HVAC, framing, plumbing, all into a module and it shows where those trades potentially would collide with each other and resolve that collision before it goes live into the field and that is the one that particularly builders think gives them the biggest and quickest return from savings, because it minimizes the mistakes that you would have to learn on the fly in the field and you get ahead of them. So that’s probably the one that we get the most positive feedback on. But what we’re really trying to do is get everything resolved from a customer perspective on the front end so when we go to a full product launch, they’ll already have solved the problems that they’re counting on us solving.
Peter Jackson: Maybe the best example of that that Dave was just referring to is the shoppable digital twin. So that has been a core aspect of this, right? You’re taking the plan, you’re putting it into that three-dimensional environment and the real bang for the buck is the shopability. They want to be able to pick up a siding or a roofing or whatever and see it on the rendering, have it be impacted with the real design, be able to quote it and shop it and buy it. And that entire experience, as you might imagine, is quite complex, right? It’s challenging both technically and from a UI/UX user interface, user experience type of dynamic. So what we’ve been really focused on this summer is putting our product in front of them, right, as it stands, getting the feedback of how it works, how they’re actually going to transact and interact with that tool and making the tweaks behind the scenes to really drive the technology and the functionality to meet that need state head-on. And so when Dave talks about development and using the feedback from customers on development, that’s a really big one for us and super excited about what the teams are coming up with. We got to see some pilot stuff recently or some demo stuff recently. I agree with Dave. You all are going to like it.
Kurt Yinger: All right. Good to hear. Well, appreciate the color and good luck here in Q4, guys.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Kurt.
Operator: And our next question comes from Quinn Fredrickson with Baird.
Quinn Fredrickson: Hey. Good morning. Just curious on the fiscal 2024 scenarios in terms of the high end versus the low end. Is the swing factor there just really rates or anything else we should be thinking about there?
Peter Jackson: No question, affordability rates in particular are in focus for us in terms of trying to predict that starts number. It’s an interesting balance, though. We’ve continued to see very healthy, very stable, as Dave referred to sales and production through the industry. But that question of is there a magic number of mortgage rates that really puts a step down type of impact on this industry is in everybody’s minds. So far, no. But we’re certainly keeping a close eye on it and really what you’re seeing here, and I was trying to highlight it a little bit before, these are different ranges that we’ve seen from economists. We think this encompasses what we saw from all the economists that we were gathering in the last month or two. So, certainly, we’ll continue to dial this in. We’ll continue to update it based on what we’re seeing. But that’s kind of the context in which we came up with it.
Dave Rush: Yeah. The only thing I’d add is, keep in mind we’re talking the full year, right? We’re not sure if we might have some more macro headwinds in the beginning of the year and at ease as the year goes on. But who knows? And what we hear more often than not, though, is the back half would probably be slightly better than the front half in that scenario.
Peter Jackson: We’re ready regardless and I think that’s kind of our outline here with the scenarios is we’ve got a high performing business. We’re going to deliver really favorable positive numbers regardless of which way this goes. So, we didn’t want to hesitate to put this out there for people to contemplate because sometimes the skepticism or the fear in the marketplace can become a little more than what’s appropriate.
Quinn Fredrickson: Okay. Thank you. And then on the productivity side, is there a certain target baked into these scenarios or is it kind of the typical 3% to 5% kind of productivity savings that you talked about at the Investor Day? Thanks.
Peter Jackson: Yeah. So I’m glad you asked that question, because I do want to differentiate between a couple of things. First of all, the 3% to 5% is our goal internally. So please do not ever load that into your numbers, because I don’t want to steer you the wrong direction. In terms of what we’ve been able to do, it certainly gets harder, right? I mean, you talk about it being the first couple of years of being harvesting the low-hanging fruit. We have a tremendous opportunity to continue to deliver productivity savings, but I think those savings become a bit more challenging, a bit more programmatic over time. So I think a moderating of the annual number is appropriate, but we intend to continue to deliver on that over time and that will be an important part of our discussion in December as well.
Dave Rush: Well, what I can say definitively, it’s embedded in our culture now. I mean, we have everybody in the field at all points. We offer incentives for any employee to come up with an idea and submit it and if it’s an idea that we can use to cultivate savings from, we reward that employee for that idea. So, it is embedded in our culture. We have leaders from the field come together every year to set targets, set goals and try to identify initiatives that will be the primary focus. And what I’m proud about is our ability to consistently deliver savings each year.
Quinn Fredrickson: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: And we have our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.
Mike Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Dave, Peter, I want to stick with multifamily and I guess kind of challenge the phrasing and framing of a pause that then is resolved by the end of next year. I think the industry participants we talked to are starting to talk about numbers that are significantly greater, declines of 30%, 40% and starts next year and no rebound and potentially even further declines in 2025. So what specifically are you embedding for multifamily and who are you talking to? Is this kind of high level economist like you’ve alluded to or industry participants in multifamily informing that view? That’s kind of part one. And part two has been maybe as a follow-up. Just remind us, how much of your business in multifamily is more tied to starts versus maybe mid to later in the construction cycle there?
Dave Rush: Well, the only thing, I guess, I want to clarify, Paul is, Paul’s being from a standpoint of even planning for, embedding out and trying to get a project underway, it doesn’t necessarily translate to when we would see sales from a new project because of the 19 months to 18 months of duration. But, so we’re definitely anticipating a slowdown in multifamily. Peter?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. Yeah. So, I guess, the comments I’d make when we talked about a bounce back in a couple of different scenarios, Dave did refer to it a multifamily, we talked a little bit about on single-family. So, I want to make sure we separate those two for starters. Multifamily, we don’t know when the pause is. There’s no question in our minds, downside is coming, right? We can see that because we’re selling into the middle of next year already and we’re seeing the declines in quotes and bids and so on. Now, the one thing I also want to be real careful of is, we don’t sell into high rises or some of the other urban environment. That’s not really our play for the most part, right? Where five-story and below would frame multifamily structures, which we do think is going to be a more responsive to the housing needs that we see in the U.S. market in this day and age, and some of the other dynamics that we think are favorable to that. But your comments are accurate in terms of what we’re seeing. There is certainly pessimism, the higher rates have made deals and projects more difficult to pencil out and we have seen a downturn. I would say at this stage, we’re not seeing the numbers you’ve been teeing up there. Is it possible? Sure. Wouldn’t out -- wouldn’t rule out it going anywhere. For us, though, I think our ability to do a couple of things. One is to, to scale our facilities, change shifts. But also the second thing is to rebalance where we put our load from a value-added products perspective. We can certainly move single-family to multifamily and vice versa, which we’ve been doing recently. So we’ll continue to do that and ensure that we’re protecting this franchise because we absolutely believe in multifamily in the long run, even if there’s some cyclicality in the near-term. To your second question, which is the ratio of that multifamily business and what it is weighted towards. I would say that it’s probably 80% weighted towards the start and more 20% weighted towards the completion, just directionally and that’s because the bulk of it is trust and upfront product with a bit of it being related to millwork, which is a little closer to the completion, not at the completion, but a bit closer with that.
Dave Rush: Yeah. The only thing I’d add is and why I use the term pause versus halt, is just the underlying housing demand need. I mean, if they can’t get into single-family because of affordability concerns, multifamily is the next best option. And I think it will be relatively quick for the rent factor to be figured out to where we get to a rental number that’s cheaper than a mortgage, maybe more than we wanted to pay, but at the end of the day, it’s the best chance I’ve got to get my own place. So maybe pause is too optimistic, but it’s something that I hold because of the overall demand that we see out there.
Mike Dahl: Okay. Yeah. I mean, now that last point, we certainly agree with. I think it’s just a question of kind of the financing mechanics and other things in terms of what’s going to dictate kind of depth and duration there. And then the five-story and below is probably an important distinction too. My second question or follow-up, which is also related on the margin side. So setting aside the over-earning that you’ve covered kind of ad nauseum on multifamily and just thinking about kind of the core multifamily margin and mix. If we were to see your multifamily business, which is currently about 13% of sales go to say, 8%, 9%, 10% of sales. Can you help us understand or quantify the margin impact to the total company from that type of a change? It mix, again, setting aside the current over-earning dynamics and just focusing on kind of that being a better than average core margin?
Peter Jackson: So I want to be careful here. I totally understand your question. It’s a good question. I don’t want to start getting into guidance for 2024. So I’ll comment directionally based on some of the things we’ve said throughout this year. I hope it’s helpful to you. I think if you go through and look at the margins that we’ve talked about over-earning, it’s been different by quarter. You kind of average them together and you’re kind of in that 150-ish range-ish. So I think that’s a starting point for what we described as over-earning. Now, if you see some of the numbers you’re describing and a big downturn, that adds another layer of challenge to the market and capacity and competition. So that kind of  I won’t say all bets are off, but that’s a different model than what I’m referring to. I’m talking about this year and what we think has been unusual in terms of the over-earning. But both of those will play together.
Mike Dahl: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.
Peter Jackson: Good morning.
Ketan Mamtora: Thanks for squeezing me in. Hey. I’m just curious, can you talk a little bit about how some of the regions are doing as far in October? We talked about some of the product categories, but in terms of your key regions, are you seeing sort of any noticeable change in terms of one being either stronger or weaker versus the other?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. In the beginning of the year, definitely. As we came into this, we saw a lot sort of west to east, the markets got stronger, right? West was the worst. That changed a little bit as the year progressed. I’d say west bottomed out and bounced a little bit. Central struggled a little longer. We’ve seen certain parts of the, especially the south central sort of drag longer than we expected. Again, not horrible, but if I’m comparing the year-over-year sales trends, they’ve probably trailed the other markets. I don’t know that there’s anything meaningful in terms of differences at this point. I think they’re all pretty comparable.
Dave Rush: Yeah. I would say the west relatively has shown a little bit more of a bounce. That’s for sure. I’d say parts of Texas flattened for sure. I think we’re seeing a nice uptick, relative uptick in the north central and in some of those markets. But we’re at the beginning of the year, the discrepancy between great and not so great was wider, it’s -- that gap’s closed. It’s more stable across all markets at this point from a perspective of year-over-year comparison.
Ketan Mamtora: Got it. That’s very helpful. Good luck.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Ketan.
Operator: And our final question comes from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.
Dave Rush: Good morning, Steven.
Steven Ramsey: Hi. Good morning. On the 2024 market outperformance perspective, have you thinking about how to get that outperformance if it’s new accounts or bigger penetration of existing accounts, just any color on the outperformance?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. I mean, there’s a couple of key categories that we continue to run the same play, like in football, if they can’t stop the run, we’re going to keep running. We’re going to keep investing in and taking advantage of the need for value-added products and services in this industry. Builders continue to wrestle with the labor availability problems. They continue to wrestle with on-site efficiency and effectiveness. They continue to wrestle with the cost of capital for the cycle times of building a home. That’s what we’re good at. So we’re going to continue to invest. We’ve got multiple plants coming online. We’ve got more capacity coming online in markets where we think it’s really going to be taken up quickly. So that’s an important piece. The other big important piece for us is digital. We think that we already have a lead, we think we’re already the easiest to do business with, we’re the most efficient, we’ve got the best technology and we’re about to take a big leap in that space that we think is going to be both hugely beneficial to our customers, but also make us even more the supplier of choice and the partner of choice in this industry.
Dave Rush: The only thing I’d emphasize is what Peter said at the very beginning. We’re looking at the industry. We’re seeing where our customers’ pain points are and we identify those as opportunities for us. So we’re trying and we’re focusing on how we can help solve labor challenges for our customers and create opportunity for ourselves. We’ve got core base operations in our major markets that do that today. We’re looking to expand that into additional products. There’s ways we can do what we’re already good at and expand that and that’ll grow share. The other thing I would add is, we have the last couple years been in somewhat of a maintenance mode because we have had to. We’ve had sales guys that were covered up and just handling the business they already had. We’re going to also make a concerted effort to invest in the sales board to go out and be more hunters than we are gatherers. So those two things we think are realistic initiatives that will help us grab share.
Steven Ramsey: Okay. Helpful. And then on the 2024 scenarios, looks like the free cash flow midpoint is down about $500 million from the midpoint of the 2023 guide. What are the factors that drive the midpoint difference there between EBITDA, working capital and CapEx?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. You’re right. The midpoint is down. Really straightforward answer on that and hopefully it’s consistent with everything you guys know about us and that’s that when we shrink this business, we release a tremendous amount of working capital. And when the business is stable, it’s sort of flat. And when it’s growing, we’re going to use some working capital. We generally use a rule of thumb of about 10% incrementals and decrementals to sales as a good proxy for what happens in our working capital. Obviously, you got some puts and takes there. We’ve done some good work on managing through some issues that we’ve been talking about over the past couple of years. But the primary answer is just the working capital flex with the size of the topline.
Steven Ramsey: All right. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: All right. Appreciate it.
Operator: And it looks like we have reached our allotted time for our Q&A session. This does conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I’d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Neese: Thank you, Angela. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our results for the second quarter of 2023. The earnings press release and investor presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation, and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today’s press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Rush: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Entering 2023, we prepared for a challenging and dynamic year. During the first half, we had better than anticipated performance, driven by the strength of our value-added product portfolio, continued outperformance in Multi-Family, and a more stable housing environment than originally projected. Multi-Family is an area we identified as providing strong growth potential and in market diversification over the long term. We are truly seeing the differentiated platform we have put together over the past few years generate results. We continue to exceed our near-term targets through contributions from operational initiatives instill over the last few years, and by executing our strategic priorities, which is a testament to the unwavering commitment and dedication of our amazing team members. We are focused on delivering exceptional customer service and always strive to be the easiest company in the industry to do business with. We’re driving mixed improvement through value added share growth, while continuing to expand through tuck-in acquisitions. Our acquisitions in recent years have allowed us to enhance our value-added offerings and also extend our reach to a more diverse customer base in attractive markets. Moreover, these acquisitions have proven to be immediately accretive to our earnings. We continue to consistently generate robust free cash flow and prudently deploy capital, making two tuck-in acquisitions and repurchasing over $700 million of shares in the second quarter alone. Despite the headwinds posed by elevated mortgage rates and affordability challenges, our resilient results in the first half of 2023 give us confidence that we have the right strategies in place with a customer-centric approach and an incredible team that is executing at the highest level to successfully navigate this dynamic economic environment. Many single-family builders are showing stabilizing demand partially due to widespread shortages of existing homes for sale, driving healthy new construction. Public builders have been reporting a stream of stronger-than-expected results and taking proactive steps, such as interest rate buy-downs to help get prospective buyers off the sidelines. With home prices normalizing in many places, our focus on value-added solutions, digital innovations and customer service is helping builders improve their construction efficiencies. We are helping our customers lower cycle time, which is highlighted by our continued improvement on in full deliveries from 93% last year to 96%, during the second quarter. On time and in full deliveries ensure our customers have the right material at the right time. Looking at our second quarter highlights on slide 4. Our gross margin percentage increased 40 basis points to 35.2% due to stronger mix in value-added products overall, largely driven by our Multi-Family segment and the related positive impact from commodity cost timing. We maintained a healthy double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin, showcasing our ability to execute effectively from an operations perspective in a challenging environment. This execution is a reflection of our talented field leadership team, which averages 30-plus years of industry experience. Turning to slide 5. We drove strong productivity across the business by delivering $50 million in savings during the quarter. Our BFS One Team Operating System continues to generate robust efficiencies, focused on manufacturing and delivery improvement. Our recent acquisitions in Multi-Family contributed an increase of 4% on the top-line and 9% to EBITDA compared to the prior year quarter. Multi-Family was an exceptionally strong tailwind this quarter, and we expect this streak to continue for the remainder of 2023. While we expect Multi-Family to normalize around the first or second quarter of next year, we remain optimistic that, Single-Family starts will be on stronger footing in the same period, compared to the first half of 2023. As it relates to our cost structure, controlling SG&A and other expenses remains a vital focus for us. This includes the ongoing optimization of our footprint and balancing the need for variable cost reductions against future capacity needs. We are focused on our discretionary spending, and our team has done a great job on managing costs in the short-term, while executing our strategy over the long-term. Turning to M&A on slide 6. We continue to target attractive opportunities with a disciplined approach. Thus far in 2023, we have completed four deals and are still committed to our goal of investing an average of $500 million in M&A per year for the next several years. During the second quarter, we added millwork capabilities through the acquisitions of JB Millworks and Builders Millwork Supply. And earlier this week, we acquired Church’s Lumber, which expands our presence and scale in the Detroit market. We’re excited to welcome our talented new team members to the BFS family. Our M&A and organic investments have substantially increased our value-added product mix and diversified our end markets since Q4 2021, as shown on slide 6. We have seen the fruit of this growth in recent quarters, and we have driven our gross margins higher even in a down housing starts environment. Moving to slide 7. I would like to provide an update on capital allocation. In the second quarter, we deployed over $850 million of capital towards organic growth investments, tuck-in M&A and share repurchases. We have cumulatively deployed approximately $5.3 billion since the end of 2021 and remain on track to achieve our 2025 goal of $7 billion to $10 billion communicated at our Investor Day in 2021. Now let’s turn to slide 8 for an update on our digital strategy. We firmly believe our long-term commitment to new digital innovations and technologies will deliver greater efficiency across homebuilding and enhance our product and service offerings. We continue to play a pioneering role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry and have made a significant investment in growing our digital platform. We have made it a priority to ensure digital adoption is integrated across our operations as we seek to create a platform that will lead to building better, more affordable homes. myBLDR.com serves as the entry point to our collaborative project management platform. It is designed to create efficiency for both BFS and our customers by offering improved transparency and engagement in the homebuilding process. It combines Paradigm’s next-generation estimating technology with our 3D Home Configuration model. Together, these tools allow our customers more control over their design, cost estimating and building process ultimately saving both our customers and their clients, time and money. We are still in early innings and have more to come as we continue to roll out these digital solutions to our end users but we remain confident in our ability to gain an incremental $1 billion in product sales by 2026. We believe our sustained commitment to investing in digital innovations and technologies will extend BFS’ lead as the partner of choice in the market, and we look forward to providing more detail on our long-term strategy at our Investor Day in December. Before I turn the call over to Peter, I want to say how grateful I am to our team members for continuing to execute in a challenging environment and providing excellent service to our customers on a daily basis. At BFS, we keep our high-performing, people-first culture at the heart of all we do. That’s why we like to recognize team members in our organization that embody the true spirit of our, Be More, Do More, Build More together philosophy. Perla Jover is an Inventory Control Supervisor in Houston, Texas, who has made a huge impression on her managers and colleagues. In May, she was honored as one of our first team MVPs for exemplifying our core values. Perla’s attitude -- positive attitude for willingness to jump in and help in her pursuit of excellence really makes a difference on the team. The supervisors appreciate how she embraces learning new skills and mentoring others, especially young women new to our industry. Employees like Pearl make me proud to lead this great organization. Without the full effort of our team, we would not have had the outperformance that we achieved during the first half of this year. I’ll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our performance during the quarter further highlighted the resilience of our business in the face of macro pressures. I’m particularly proud of our gross margin results driven by our increased mix of value-added products and services. We are well positioned in the marketplace with differentiated solutions and a healthy balance sheet. We continue to generate robust free cash flow and prudently deploy capital. I’m confident that the combination of our industry-leading scale, ongoing investments in value-added and digital products, and strong financial position will lead to a double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin this year, and sustained growth in the years to come. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I’ll recap our second quarter results. Second, I’ll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I’ll discuss our full year 2023 guidance. Let’s begin by reviewing our second quarter performance on slide 10. We delivered $4.5 billion in net sales. Core organic sales decreased by 22%, which was better than expected, despite a 31% decline in Single-Family due to slower demand over the prior year. Multi-Family continues to be a bright spot, growing by nearly 30%. As Dave mentioned, the strength in Multi-Family was driven by our recent acquisitions as well as favorable margins, largely attributable to the longer lead time for this end market. R&R and other grew by nearly 5%, mainly due to increased sales focus and capacity versus the prior year. The cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately 4 percentage points of growth to net sales. Importantly, value-added products represented 53% of our net sales this quarter versus 45% in the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting our improving position as a supplier of choice for these higher-margin products. During the second quarter, gross profit was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 33.9% compared to the prior year period. Gross margin increased 40 basis points to 35.2%, driven primarily by a stronger mix in value-added products overall and with particular strength in Multi-Family value-add. SG&A decreased $28 million to $1.02 billion, mainly due to lower variable compensation, partially offset by additional expenses from operations acquired in the last year. Acquisitions increased SG&A by $52 million in the quarter. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 740 basis points to 22.5%, primarily attributable to decreased leverage on net sales. We remain focused on operating efficiently, containing costs and effectively integrating operations and acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $769 million, a decline of 49%, primarily driven by lower net sales, including a decline in core organic products attributable to a slower housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin remained a robust 17%, up 70 basis points sequentially as we continue to execute and drive improved productivity across the business. Adjusted net income was $498 million, down from an adjusted net income of $1.07 billion in the prior year quarter. The 54% decrease in adjusted net income was primarily driven by a decrease in sales volumes and commodity deflation. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $3.89 compared to $6.26 in the prior year period. The decrease in adjusted EPS was partially offset by our repurchase of nearly 7 million shares, which added roughly $0.20 per share during quarter. Our second quarter results exceeded the guidance we provided in May, supported by our core business mix and gross margin strength amid outperformance in value-added products. We continue to gain confidence in the strength and durability of our margin performance, and we believe our long-term normalized gross margin percentage is now at 29%-plus versus our previous expectation of 28%-plus. Now, let’s turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on slide 12. Our second quarter operating cash flow was approximately $391 million, down $556 million compared to the prior year period, mainly attributable to commodity deflation and a reduction in Single-Family starts. Capital expenditures were $121 million. All in, we delivered healthy free cash flow of approximately $270 million. For the trailing 12 months ended June 30, our free cash flow yield was 17.7%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 41.4%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1 times, while base business leverage was 1.6 times. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was approximately $900 million, consisting of $800 million in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $100 million of cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares for $723 million at an average stock price of $103.68 per share. In total, we have repurchased approximately 41% of our outstanding shares since August of 2021. We have approximately $s600 million remaining on our most recent $1 million share repurchase authorization from April 2023. We remain disciplined stewards of capital, and we’ll continue to look for organic and inorganic growth opportunities while maintaining our fortress balance sheet. Let’s turn to our outlook on slide 14. Our July sales trends are encouraging and fuel our confidence in the resilience of our industry. Several of our national customers have begun to provide full year guidance, providing us with better visibility and greater confidence in the strength of the market. As a result, we are establishing our full year base business and total company guidance as we enter the back half of 2023. Our base business approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing for commodity volatility. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes normalized margins and static commodity prices at $400 per 1,000 board feet. This is helpful to clearly assess the core aspects of the business where we have focused our attention to drive sustainable outperformance in our industry. Our base business guide on net sales is $16.6 billion. Our base business EBITDA guide is $2.2 billion at a margin of roughly 13.3%. At this time, we are also providing total company guidance for full year 2023, including total net sales, gross margins, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. For full year 2023, we expect total company net sales to be $16.8 billion to $17.8 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be 15% to 17%. And we are guiding gross margins to a range of 33% to 35%. Our recent above normal margins reflected greater mix in value-added products along with disciplined pricing required to offset our increases in operating costs from inflation. As we move through the second half of the year, we expect both our gross margins and Multi-Family business to continue to normalize. We expect full year 2023 free cash flow of $1.6 billion to $2 billion. Our free cash flow forecast assumes average commodity prices in the range of $400 to $450. Our 2023 outlook is based on several assumptions. Please refer to our earnings release and slide 15 of the investor presentation for a full list of these assumptions. As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are exceptionally well positioned to drive our strategic goals. Our guidance illustrates our belief that we will deliver a double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin this year and sustain that momentum in the years to come. As we continue to reap the benefits of our transformed business, we are positioned to achieve an upwardly revised long-term normalized gross margin of 29% or higher. I’m confident that our best-in-class operating platform will continue to generate substantial free cash flow, providing further financial flexibility on top of our already healthy balance sheet. Importantly, we will continue to diligently deploy capital and maximize long-term shareholder value. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for some final thoughts.
Dave Rush: Thanks, Peter. Let me close by saying that we feel better about the current building environment today than we did at the beginning of the year. We’re executing our strategy and continuing to invest to drive future growth. Our results in the first half reflect our hard work over the past few years to build a differentiated platform that has BFS set up to win in any environment. I am proud of our operational excellence, which is driving increased safety, productivity and profitability despite market headwinds. We are in a great position today and as end markets further stabilize, we are positioned for an even stronger future. We’ll continue to be at the forefront of technology with our digital strategy, which I’m confident will be a game changer for the industry. We are exceptionally well positioned to drive shareholder value this year and in years to come. I’m excited to share more details at our upcoming Investor Day on December 5th in Atlanta and look forward to seeing you there. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let’s please open the call now for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. And congrats on the results. I’ll start with the question on the long-term gross margin guide, which you’ve now raised twice consecutively. So, my question is, what’s changed in the past 90 days that’s kind of given you that incremental confidence? And then, of course, to take another step forward, given your gross margin of 33% to 35% this year, what are the signs you’d be looking for to kind of give you step in -- or confidence in yet another step higher from that 29%. So, I’ll pause there. That’s the first question.
Peter Jackson: Well, first of all, thanks, Matt. We appreciate it. We’re excited about the business and certainly pleased with the way gross margins have been continuing to evolve. We’ve talked about it for -- well, a couple of years now, actually. The strength of the core business, particularly post merger and what we’ve been able to do to grow value-add as a mix of our business has been very impactful. And what we’ve continued to look for, particularly this year, is the normalization, right, with the supply chain getting back to normal, the reset and the level of starts, we were really concerned about what that would mean in terms of the overall market’s ability to sustain margins. I don’t think we were alone in that. What we’ve looked for this year is the performance being at a stable level. And while we’re not quite there yet, we’ve certainly seen stability be established in a lot of parts of the market, a lot of regions, a lot of product categories where we’ve seen things sort of get to normal and level out. When we talk about gross margins, it can be a little bit misleading. Again, this quarter, we saw a substantial tailwind due to Multi-Family, what I would describe as sort of transitory tailwinds. At least a couple of hundred basis points this quarter was really just due to the way the commodity timing, the cost of commodities played out versus some of our contracts. So, we’re pleased with it. Obviously, we’ll take it. But we don’t want to signal to anybody that that’s permanent. And we still have certain areas of the market where things continue to normalize, and we’re not quite sure where things will end up, but we know the pressure is down. We’ve certainly seen that. We’re up 40 bps overall on gross margins. But certainly, that indicates if you take out Multi-Family, some pretty decent step-down in the core, that’s what we thought was going to happen, and that’s pretty much how it’s played out, and we’ll continue to look for that. But even with all of that said, it’s better than we expected. We certainly have gained a lot of confidence in the strength of our business, the strength of value-add, which continues to be really, really desirable for our builder customers, and we’re continuing to invest in it and feel good about what that means for normal margins going forward. We’ll continue to monitor it. I mean, we’ve left the plus at the end because we think -- obviously, we’re performing better than that now, and we’re just going to wait and see where things normalize over time.
Dave Rush: Hey Matt, thanks again. This is Dave. I would just add, since the merger with BMC, we’ve invested over $100 million in upgrading and automating our manufacturing capabilities, and we’re starting to see the fruits of that. And we’re getting a better feel of how that’s going to contribute to margins over the longer period as well.
Matthew Bouley: Got it. Thanks, guys, for that comprehensive answer, very helpful. So, I guess, some of what you mentioned, Peter, on the Multi-Family side is going to address this next question. Kind of zooming into the base business, it looks like you’re saying there’s, I don’t know, maybe some rounding, but roughly $600 million of earnings above the base this year. How much of that is -- that Multi-Family commodity cost timing, other commodity, maybe OSB? And could you break down if there’s anything else in there besides commodity that’s kind of above the base business? Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Yes. No, good question, Matt. So just a basic reminder, the base business is really just trying to take out any commodity fluctuation in two ways, right? Anything that’s not $400 lumber we normalize for, and we also normalize for margins attributable to those same commodities. So we don’t normalize for margins anywhere else, but it does have the impact within that $600 million that you mentioned that yes, there’s some rounding. Within that $600 million that you mentioned, that’s attributable to margins. And this particular year, it’s mostly margins. So, the vast majority of what has flowed through is the normalization of those outperforming margins over the course of the year. There is certainly a component of that that is from the Multi-Family, right? So it’s because a piece of the commodities flows into our manufactured products, including roofing, floor, trusses as well as wall panels, which obviously have a significant component of commodity in them. So, we take an adjustment for that. So, that is the primary driver is the margins attributable to the commodity change this year.
Operator: The next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms: Yes, I’d echo the congrats on the outstanding work in the quarter.
Dave Rush: Thanks, Trey. I appreciate it.
Trey Grooms: Sure. So, on Multi-Family, I think you mentioned that you expect that to remain strong through this year. So, are you seeing anything in your backlog or hearing anything from your customers about their backlogs and Multi-Family that would suggest that this slowdown is kind of coming around that time or anything on the timing there, or is that more just kind of a -- kind of high-level expectation at this point?
Dave Rush: Yes. We are seeing evidence from our customers that at the tail end of this year, there’s going to be a lot of supply that comes online all at around the same time. And that in a typical year would have to be digested before a lot of these other new projects come online. That’s one factor. The other factor is the cost of capital. And being able to make sure that the rents that they’re going to generate versus the cost of capital, that equation has to work out exactly right as well. And until some of that -- or some of that glut of openings that comes online at the end of the year, it gets digested. Those kind of dynamics have a little bit of time to work themselves out. So, what we’re hearing is there might be a little bit of a delay in the first and second quarter and then things start picking back up again. The problem, as you know, is these projects are so long in time from plan to execution that we feel like there’s going to be a lag in the first half of next year. But overall, we believe the Multi-Family will be a great segment for us to be in, and it will be a temporary scenario, not necessarily something long term that we got to worry about.
Trey Grooms: Right. Got it. Okay. And then, Peter, you mentioned you’re expecting gross margins to moderate through the year. Sorry if I missed this, but you’re calling out 33% to 35% for the year. You’ve been running at the 35% range. So, are you seeing any change or any more normalization in the margin thus far in the third quarter, or is it still kind of holding in at that high end of the range for now?
Peter Jackson: Yes. No, good question. So, we continue to see -- again, it goes to the countervailing trends. We continue to see some erosion in the core market gross margin, less than we expected, but it has continued, and I think we’ll continue to see that through the back half of this year. And then we know pretty -- with pretty reasonable accuracy how Multi-Family will play out just because of the timing of the contracts that were related to the current purchase price of commodities and kind of where we’re at. So, we’ve got a pretty decent look. Certainly, there’s been good performance in gross margins throughout the year, and I don’t think July is significantly different, but the trends remain the same with the overlay of Multi-Family’s normalization being pretty significant over the next year.
Trey Grooms: Great. Thank you. If I could sneak one more in, a little bit more higher level. $100 billion or so invested in automation over the last few years, which you said is bearing fruit, which is pretty clear. Where are you in that process, or maybe how should we think about the amount of plants that you have that you would classify as automated? And where would you like that to be kind of over time?
Dave Rush: Yes. I would tell you, we feel really good about the level of automation we have where every plant has some level of automation. Obviously, there’s more opportunity, and we have a pretty long runway there to continue to improve, and we’re excited about that prioritizing those projects. And as you know, as we do acquisitions, typically, there’s a level of automation that we go back in and upgrade those acquisitions with and we’ll have that plan ongoing. We’re a good customer for our automation vendor. And as much as we’re always excited about talking about digital, we’re also on our front foot when it comes to technology in this manufacturing space as well. So yes, we’re excited about where this can continue to go.
Operator: The next question comes from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.
Ketan Mamtora: Thank you. And congrats on a strong quarter. A couple of things. I’m just curious, one, how do you -- what is the M&A pipeline looking at this point? And given sort of housing has held in better than what people expected at the start of the year, has there been any sort of change in your approach to M&A or seller expectations?
Dave Rush: Thanks for the question. Yes, the M&A pipeline actually has improved. I think just the fact that things were changing at the beginning of the year and people weren’t sure exactly how the year was going to play out, kept people on the sideline for the first half. We’re seeing more opportunities now in the second half and a couple that we feel like are really good to look at. And we’re excited about how we’ll continue to invest in M&A in the future.
Ketan Mamtora: Got it. And is it possible at all -- Peter, you talked about sort of July started off quite well. Is there any way to sort of quantify what the July trend has been like even relative to sort of Q2 or maybe year-over-year?
Peter Jackson: Yes. It’s been a -- I don’t know how to describe it other than refreshing year. For all of the concerns that we came into the year with due to interest rates, due to affordability, it has been a surprisingly and refreshingly normal year. We see good progression throughout the year, the normal seasonality that we would expect to see with busier months in the summer. We’ve seen good utilization of our capacity. Nothing’s been overwhelmed. We’ve gotten quite busy in certain areas, but nothing has been catastrophic like during the big run around COVID. Same on behalf of our vendors, they’ve performed very well. Few spots here and there where it’s gotten a little tight, but by and large, the market has adjusted to the new volumes and really sold through quite well. And as we alluded to with our customer base, there’s confidence in a lot of areas with regard to how consistently they’ve been able to sell through what they’ve been building. It seems pretty obvious that the demand is still out there. And with the reluctance to move out of an existing home, new construction has really been a bright spot, and we’re excited to be leaning into that quite well.
Operator: The next question comes from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates.
Adam Baumgarten: Just a question on the environment. With the ramping starts you’ve seen year-to-date, are you hearing about any supply chain strains? Maybe not for you guys specifically, but for the industry or maybe an extension in construction cycle times for the builders?
Dave Rush: Yes. I think the supply chain has normalized to a great extent. I think -- versus when you saw the COVID-related issues, we’re not seeing anything of that magnitude out there. There’s a couple of product categories where lead times are or slightly extended, premium windows is an example, but still, things are normalizing. Now, with the uptick in demand, there is some adjustments by a lot of our vendor partners on staffing and getting staff back up to the new normal of demand, but those look to be very temporary and very slight. So, I would say, all in all, from a supply chain perspective, we’re in pretty good shape.
Adam Baumgarten: Okay, got it. Good to hear. And then just switching gears to the R&R business, I think you had mentioned increased capacity being a tail and maybe just some more color around that. And then also were there any product categories that really stood out as particularly strong in the R&R channel in the quarter?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So R&R, the way we service R&R, there are a few markets where we’re very focused on it with specific cases. But for the most part, we serve both the Pro new construction and the Pro R&R markets through the same chance. So, you end up with certain time lines where you’ve got pretty heavy demand from one or the other. And obviously, over the past couple of years, the bulk of it has come from the new construction side. So with that pullback a bit, they just opened up more capacity, that Pro R&R business. And as I said in the past, the Pro R&R contractor would generally prefer to use us if we’re available because of all the incremental services and expertise we provide versus a traditional big box or a small player. The categories, the product categories, I would say we performed well across the outline of products or the family of products within Pro R&R. I would say, just stepping back for the whole business, we’ve continued to see really nice performance in the windows, doors and millwork category. That’s been an outperformer for us all year, and we’re pretty excited about that.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.
Mike Dahl: First question is kind of back on the Multi-Family side. Obviously, there’s been a few big moving pieces. You’ve made some investments both organically and inorganically in that space. And then, Multi-Family as a mix of percentage -- mix of the overall market has increased. You look at permit activity that’s now dropping off, and you alluded to some normalization. And in Multi-Family, I think, sales, not just margins looking out to next year. Maybe can you help kind of quantify what you think has been internal versus market shifts? And I don’t know if it’s best framed as what you think your new normal mix of Multi-Family would be when you sort through kind of the ebbs and flows? Maybe a little more quantification there or color?
Peter Jackson: Yes. Yes. No, your point is right on. We’ve had a lot of change in that Multi-Family category. We’ve invested a lot, and we’ve been very successful, even in the core business in terms of how we’ve competed in the marketplace. I think that the overall impact of our kind of leaning into this has been a big change in the market and a big change for us. So it’s increased that Multi-Family mix, but it’s a mix that’s attributable largely to truss, right? So we’re not in sky scrapers. We’re not in shopping malls or certain large-scale apartment complexes, right? We’re in four-storey and below wood frame structures. That’s sort of our operating arena and our sweet spot. That has been doing remarkably well. And I think we have been able to improve our positioning in the market and be seen as a serious, reliable competitor. We’ve got the ability to withstand sort of ebbs and flows. We can be counted on to deliver even if there are some capacity constraints through our network of facilities around the country. So, we do think we’ve gained share. We do -- we know we bought share, and we think that that has all sort of come together to really give us some nice momentum. And that momentum is true, even though we’re really in the middle of integration. So, this is still early days for us in terms of getting all those teams to work together. So, we’re really excited about what the future holds. Now, you are right about the reset. We think that as we get into probably back half of next year, when we’re seeing things normalize, maybe beyond that, it’s probably closer to 10% directionally, we’ll dial that in for you, but it’s probably 10% of sales in an environment like we’re in today in a normal world.
Dave Rush: Yes. I would just add. We were purposeful when we added that acquisition and entrants into that Multi-Family segment, knowing that it would be a diversification play from Single-Family and vice versa. So, what we’re expecting is as Multi-Family normalizes, we’re expecting Single-Family to remain on stable footing. In addition, in the truss world, what makes it so -- such a good investment for us is we can run Single-Family jobs out of a Multi-Family truss plan. So, we do that today. When we have Multi-Family plants that are maxed out, we run Multi-Family jobs out of our Single-Family plants and vice versa, when each side has more work than they have capacity. So, we’ve got a plan in place to manage through all ebbs and flows of both sides of those businesses and we did so intentionally.
Mike Dahl: Got it. Yes. That’s very helpful. Thank you. And then my second question, you’ve spent a lot of time kind of dissecting the margins. Maybe at a high level, just between commodities, between the Multi-Family legs, when you’re now talking about a 29% plus on normal, can you just kind of help us simplify this at a high level in terms of margin differentials by not necessarily every product category, but high level. Just where do you think your new value-add margin will be? Is it kind of like a low-30s value-add and a 20 on lumber? Just any -- what’s kind of driving at a high level the blended 29%?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So, if you think about the historical kind of guidances that we’ve had, we were running -- we were running gross margins kind of 25% to 27%. We talked about how the commodities were generally kind of high-teens to low-20s for gross margins. We talked about how value-add was 800 to 1,000 basis points higher than that. I would tell you kind of where we are today with some of the noise in it. We’re substantially higher than that on the value-add. But we’ve also seen sort of increases across the board. The increases across the board we talked about a lot, just to reiterate, we’ve seen some inflation, right? So if the cost of delivery is higher, the margins need to be higher in order to pay for the increased costs. So, we’ve seen some incremental margin increase across the board to cover that. And then, the two things that have impacted it the most is you’ve seen increased productivity. And what we’ve talked about in Multi-Family, some displacement causing the margins to be higher, full stop. And you’ve seen overall a pretty substantial mix shift away from the commodity side of the business, which used to be half of what we did back in the old days to closer to 25 to a third -- 25% to a third of our business now and that has allowed that normalized gross margin to really drift further and further up the more our mix swings. So, sort of all of those components are feeding in the productivity, the inflation, the overall mix shift to allow us to see that higher amount. But again, going from 35%, 34% for the full year is what we’re signaling, right, for the midpoint, down to the 29%-plus that is the Multi-Family. That is the continued normalization. And we’re going to continue to watch that play out, and we’ll dial in that guidance as we get more confident.
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.
Steven Ramsey: I wanted to continue the base EBITDA conversation along with the productivity. If I’m connecting the dots, you’re saying this year’s sales and base EBITDA go down $100 million each and then the productivity savings midpoint is $130 million. So, backing out that midpoint of savings, decremental margins look like a low-20% range, if my math is correct. I mean, with the productivity flowing in, is the dollar level of productivity in future years going to be as strong as this year?
Peter Jackson: Well, it’s certainly what we’re shooting for. Internally, we have a lot of projects that we think we can leverage to continue to improve our operations, continue to offset the impact of inflation, whether it be the way we buy, what we buy, how we deliver it, how we process it internally, back office, those are all things that we’re pretty confident that we can continue to improve, and those are the goals we’re setting for ourselves. Will every year be exactly this year or better, well, we’ll see certainly where we’re headed.
Dave Rush: We believe there’s a huge opportunity there given our platform of the 570-plus locations and our ability to take best practices from -- we’re a product of multiple acquisitions. And we’ve learned how to take the best practice from one of those acquisitions and leverage it across the platform. We’ve built a continuous improvement culture. We have people dedicated to it in each of our divisions for that very purpose, because we believe that the part -- the benefit of our scale is to be able to do it the best way across 570 locations versus just in one area or one market. So, we’re confident that we can achieve at the current levels of continuous improvement that we’ve set for ourselves each year for a long period in the future.
Steven Ramsey: Okay, helpful. And then to make sure on the productivity savings, how much of that is coming from the distribution side of the business? How much of that is more on the manufacturing side? And maybe how much of that is automation driven versus other general improvements?
Dave Rush: Yes. So, it’s probably half and half in terms of what we’re getting on the sort of the inbound versus the operating sides. We’re doing a lot in both with a bunch of individual projects that sort of accumulate to contribute. But directionally, it’s probably right.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank.
Joe Ahlersmeyer: I just wanted to -- just based on the visibility you may have into your inventory and your Multi-Family backlogs for this quarter. Just maybe any help on the phasing of the gross margin and even just the overall sales and EBITDA third quarter versus fourth quarter?
Peter Jackson: Well, I think normally, we would perform a bit lower in the fourth quarter just as a seasonal representation. Qs 2 and 3 are always better than Qs 1 and 4. This year, and I think it’s based on what I said before, we think it’s likely to be more normal. So, we would expect Q4 to be a bit weaker. Certainly, as always, that’s the weaker part of my forecasting confidence it’s one quarter out, we feel pretty good; two quarters out, gets a little more murky. So maybe the right way to think about it.
Joe Ahlersmeyer: Understood. And then on the inventory balance, that’s come down as commodity costs have come down and rolled through the P&L. But is there additional productivity you’re looking to gain on the inventory balances, or given what we’ve seen in the market, could we actually see it go the other way where you’re preparing, I guess, for a stronger spring in 2024, making sure that you have inventory on hand to service the market?
Peter Jackson: Yes, probably more the latter. So I’ll start by saying your observation is absolutely correct. We’ve had great performance. Operating teams have done a fantastic job of sort of continuing to clean up post the craziness of the supply chain over the last couple of years, clearing out excess that we feel we had on hand tightening up, whether it be windows or millwork or whatever, the teams have done a great job of really managing on -- in a very streamlined just-in-time way, the inventory that we’ve got rolling in and out of our facilities. But you’re right. When we grow, we absolutely have more working capital inventory included. So, coming into the future where we do see, at least based on what we’re seeing right now, growth on the horizon, we would expect working capital to stop being a tailwind and start being the usage into that group.
Operator: The next question comes from Collin Verron with Jefferies.
Collin Verron: You’ve highlighted the acceleration in orders from the public builders and the Census Bureau data really bouncing off the bottom here. I was just hoping you guys could talk about any differences you’re seeing between your customers with the large production builders and the smaller builders. And then a comment on this -- at this point, do you see the bottom in Single-Family being behind BLDR at this point, particularly from a Single-Family sales perspective?
Dave Rush: Well, we were certainly really encouraged by both the results that our public builders were reporting and even more about the projections for the rest of the year. So, we feel really confident that -- again, I’m not calling this robust, but it’s certainly better than everyone expected over the second half of the year and stable to up over the back half of the year. And that gave us the confidence that we have for being able to project what we feel like we can do in that environment.
Collin Verron: Great. That’s helpful. And then you guys provided some good color on the digital adoption, providing some takeoff figures. Can you just quantify those maybe in terms of revenues and talk about where you guys are in your journey in reaching that $1 billion sales opportunity?
Peter Jackson: Yes. We’re excited about digital. It’s continuing to move along. The technology is coming together. The pilots are going well and we’ve given sort of a few hints about some metrics and what that looks like internally but it’s all very, very early days, to be honest. We’ve got some revenue, but it’s pretty modest. It’s not the focus. The focus is not really growing that right now. It’s tuning. It’s completing the technology, tuning what we have built, making sure the technology is sort of stable and capable of running at the scale that we intend to put through it. That’s this year’s goal. We’re certainly expecting pretty significant increases in ‘24 and beyond. And we’ll have some more information on the timing of that and the layout of that as we get into our Investor Day in December.
Operator: The next question comes from Reuben Garner with The Benchmark Company.
Reuben Garner: Congrats again on the strong quarter. I guess, I had some connection issues earlier. So, if I repeat anything, sorry, in advance. But first question is on inventory. Can you talk about where your inventory stands from a volume perspective relative to kind of historically normal times? We’ve heard from both kind of two-step distributors and some manufacturers that the dealer channel is kind of thin and hesitant to add. I was just curious how you guys are viewing inventory? Is that something where you’re stocking and it’s an advantage you have product over some of your smaller peers, or are you the folks that are running thinner than usual now?
Dave Rush: I would say we’re running normal, right? I think we’re not seeing the same kind of supply challenges we did just after COVID. It’s more of a normal operating environment. Our guys have done an unbelievable job of coming through that and getting back to normal for us. We’re where we would be normally with just seasonal fluctuations now. So we’ll see a buildup of inventory during the third quarter, and it will start to wane in the fourth quarter as we head into the seasonal months. But we’re kind of business as usual at this point.
Reuben Garner: Okay, great. And then,, I’m not sure if this one was asked, but an updated way to think about sensitivity to lumber? I know you’ve got the base business lumber out there. But if we’re continuing to run $100 higher, how much of an impact does that have on revenue and profit?
Peter Jackson: Yes. That’s a good question, Reuben. You may have noticed we brought back the base business guidance and estimate, but we did not bring back that sensitivity chart in the back. Candidly, I think that caused as much confusion as clarity. So, we’re going to try a different approach. What I can tell you, and this is really based on what we’re seeing today, if lumber goes up or down by $100, $1,000, we think it’s worth between $175 million and $225 million in annual EBITDA. So, it’s -- if I use 200 as the midpoint, it’s in that range, but there are two things that I need you to just keep in mind, right? There are a number of assumptions that go into that type of rule of thumb metric. The two most important are: one, that’s assuming normalized margins. It’s a normalized margin impact of that up and down specific to commodities. And then, please keep in mind, it takes three, four months, sometimes a little bit longer of lag before that change in commodity will show up in our results, right? You think about the inventory on the ground, the order time, the delivery and then the pricing change impact as that flows through. So, just keep in mind, those two assumptions are very critical to that, that rule of thumb. But again, $100 lumber worth between $175 million and $225 million of annual EBITDA.
Reuben Garner: And a quick clarification, Peter. Is that lumber and OSB altogether commodity?
Peter Jackson: Correct. And we assume a 70-30 lumber OSB mix.
Operator: The next question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.
Kurt Yinger: Just given the strength in value-add and what you’ve talked about in terms of, I guess, the widening kind of margin differential versus traditional distributed products. Are you seeing competitors, I guess, invest behind the category to a greater extent or lean in more there? And I guess, over the long term, how do you think about your ability to kind of differentiate with some of those solutions?
Dave Rush: Yes. I think we’re the clear leader in the space, first of all. And we have made the most -- we’ve put the most emphasis on finding ways to increase our productivity, specifically in our manufacturing truss and door shops to extend that lead. We believe the investment required to do those type of improvements is not insignificant. And we’re -- we believe our commitment to us has made a difference. And we see that in the marketplace. We especially saw it coming out of COVID, where it was tough for people to find a truss manufacturer that wasn’t -- that didn’t have a significant backlog and people had to pick and choose who they wanted to do business with. And we saw where our customers wanted to do business with us in that environment. So, we feel good about our position. I think anywhere where you see opportunity, people are going to make investment. I just think we’ve got such a nice lead on our competition today, it will be tough for us -- for them to catch us.
Kurt Yinger: Got it. Okay. That’s helpful. And then just second, I was hoping you could just kind of frame how you would characterize your volume performance over the first half relative to what we’ve seen on the Single-Family start side. And I guess in manufactured products as well, I mean it seems like the core organic sales there trailed Single-Family starts a bit. Curious if that’s footprint, maybe some pricing in there and just how you’d kind of reconcile those different data points.
Peter Jackson: Yes. No, that’s a fair question. It’s something we look at pretty regularly, as you know. What I think it boils down to most simply is starts are the best indicator and the best sort of measuring stick for our performance over time. I don’t think it’s accurate at a quarter. And what we’ve seen is sort of as the market turned down, we didn’t go down as much as the market. As the market has turned up, we haven’t gone up as much as the market. And there’s a little bit of product mix to do with that, right? We’ve said in the past, we’re probably two-thirds that’s leveraged towards the beginning of the start, one-third towards the end of the start. So that’s one piece. Another of it is that we’re probably not at the start. We know we’re not at the start. We’re anywhere from 30, sometimes 60 days later when our first product starts to hit the job site. So, a little bit of shifting around that in terms of timing of when our orders hit. Based on the trends we’re seeing right now, we feel pretty good. We may have given up a little bit of share in our estimation, a couple of hundred million dollars worth. We talked a lot during the time line of the big supply chain disruptions about how advantaged we thought we were by having more product and being more effective at meeting customer needs where others struggle. And we’re probably giving back a little bit of that as we anticipated, but that’s kind of in the numbers you’re seeing now. So, feeling pretty good about where we are versus the overall market.
Operator: The next question comes from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.
Jay McCanless: The first question I had, we’ve seen lumber prices, especially framing lumber, move up sequentially for the last couple of months. I guess, is that starting to flow into your pricing not only on commodity goods, but are you also starting to be able to take some price on the value-add goods?
Peter Jackson: Like always, yes, sure. I mean, it will take some time to fully feather in, but it has started to move modestly and we certainly follow it on a consistent basis. The one point I’ll make on that though is that one of the big movers has been OSB. I’m personally a little bit skeptical on the durability of that, only because we hear so much about incremental capacity coming online over the next year. We’ll see. We’ll see where it pans out, but that certainly is something to keep an eye on.
Jay McCanless: Okay. That’s good to hear. And then just the second question, M&A phrased a different way. Are you starting to see some of this tightening in terms of bank lending standards and underwriting on some of your potential acquisition targets? Is that freeing up or making some people may be more willing to sell than they might have been at the beginning of the year?
Dave Rush: That makes reasonable sense that we would start to see that. I would say what we’ve been looking at lately, that hasn’t been a factor.
Operator: The next question comes from David Manthey with Baird.
Quinn Fredrickson: Yes. Hi. This is Quinn Fredrickson on for Dave. I’ll just ask one question here. Peter, your earlier comment made it sound like the competitive environment has remained pretty benign in value-add and better than you expected. Do you think that’s due to same dynamic among competitors with the commodity price lags in their contracts, or is there a structural change and improvement there? And then, are you assuming an uptick in competitiveness and the expectations for the slight back half gross margin moderation?
Peter Jackson: So, I guess, I need to be a little careful how I answer that. On the first hand, we have seen incremental competition and margin erosion in core business, period, full stop. Now, it’s not as much as we expected. It’s not as much as we forecasted, hence the outperformance in that area. I would say that there’s been a lot of strength in the volumes within the value-add, which gives us increasing confidence that we’re meeting a need that our customers see value in it, that they’re leveraging it to improve their cycle times, their job site efficiencies, their job site safety and that we’re at a price point that’s competitive that allows them to do what they need to do better. So, we’re certainly pleased with all of that and have been seeing the competition. Now, the components of cost, the investments that we’ve made, but also the inflation we’ve seen, certainly, I think that has had a structural impact on the overall market, us included, but others as well, where you got to make a little more gross margin if you want to cover those incremental wage costs or truck costs or whatever it is. But then lastly, we’ve done a lot of work. We’re much more efficient and that self-help has allowed us to earn more on the same equipment year-on-year because of our efficiency improvements, whether it be new automation that layers on the same equipment and facilities, sometimes it’s a new equipment, but sometimes it’s just better process. And all of those things are why that strength we’ve seen is sustainable. I think that helps to Dave’s point, us be more competitive, right? We can still make good money where others are struggling. And if we can do it by being more reliable or on time and in-full being better that our quality is better, then we’re always going to be the partner of choice for these builders who want to make sure their houses are high quality and on time.
Dave Rush: And I would just add a real-life example. In a major market we had a customer try someone else for 50 houses on truss for a lower price. They came back to us less than a month later at our price for those same 50 houses, which we, by the way, delivered inside of 10 days. So, the stickiness we generated or by being able to do what we do best for our customers, they recognize that value proposition. And that’s allowed us to make money for them and us, and that’s where we want to be.
Operator: This does conclude today’s question-and-answer session. I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional closing remarks.
Peter Jackson: Thank you very much. Have a great day.
Dave Rush: Thanks, everyone.
Operator: This does conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-03 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I’d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Neese: Thank you, Shelly. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today we will review our results for the first quarter of 2023. The earnings press release, investor presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Rush: Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call. Our start to 2023 has exceeded our expectations, as the work that we have put into transforming Builders FirstSource into the premier supplier of building product solutions is driving tangible results. We are confident that the resilience of our business and the exceptional positioning with our customers will become increasingly evident to the market as we progress through a dynamic year in 2023. Despite a challenging macro backdrop, we performed above forecast due to the strength of our product portfolio, execution on our strategic priorities and the tireless efforts of our team members.  We are managing through this complex environment by leveraging our best-in-class distribution footprint and end market exposure. We remain committed to enhancing our customer relationships by being the easiest in the industry to do business with, while driving improvements that will make home building more affordable and efficient. Our unrelenting emphasis on operational excellence positions us well to continue to execute our goals. We are driving share growth and mix improvement, while continuing to grow through accretive acquisition. Our recent transactions allow us to further expand our value added offerings and reach a more diverse customer base in attractive markets. While macroeconomic factors continue to dominate the headlines, we are closely monitoring local market activity by staying close to our customers and maintaining focus on our strategy. We are controlling what we can control and running the business for long-term value creation. Elevated mortgage rates and affordability challenges are headwinds. The feedback from some homebuilders has suggested that underlying demand has been resilient when we have seen mortgage rates dip. Though the results vary slightly by region, our April sales continued to offer encouraging signs that green shoes are starting to emerge across homebuilding.  On Slide 4, we show what we achieved in the first quarter. Among the highlights, our gross margin percentage increased 300 basis points to 35.3% driven by the strength of our multi-family value added product category. Our recent acquisitions which have diversified our footprint and enhanced our exposure to the multi-family sector have been a strong contributor for us this first quarter. Our EBITDA margin remained healthy in the first quarter as we executed well and drove improved productivity across the business. It is important to note that during the quarter with sales down 31.6%, our adjusted EBITDA margin was only off by 130 basis points compared to the prior year of quarter. This reinforces our belief that we can sustain a double digit EBITDA margin throughout this year as serving single-family starts declined by no more than 25%.  On Slide 5, while core organic sales declined relative to prior year, as single-family housing demand slowed, I would point out that multi-family and R&R/Other both grew. Multi-family was a tailwind this quarter and we expect this strength to continue for the remainder of 2023. Following recent acquisitions, multi-family margin more than doubled to 13% of our net sales in the first quarter versus 6% this time last year. We continue to focus on improving productivity and we are pleased to deliver $34 million in savings for the quarter as we leverage our BFS One Team Operating System. We are working hard to improve efficiencies through operational excellence focused on manufacturing and delivery improvements. This is evidenced by our 96% in full delivery metric.  We are dedicated to reducing our customer cycle times, with full deliveries and fewer trips to the job site, strengthening our customer relationships and helping to lower their total cost. We remain focused on the importance of controlling SG&A and other expenses. This includes efficient capacity utilization, ongoing optimization of our footprint, and balancing the need for variable cost reductions against future capacity needs.  In May 2020, we released our first corporate social responsibility report. We expect to release our 2023 CSR report later this month and look forward to sharing our progress on sustainability with our stakeholders. We are committed to addressing the risk of climate change, including taking actions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  In 2022 and early 2023, we undertook and completed an extensive project to consolidate and report our energy use data. Through this work, we now monitor our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions across our facilities and fleet and expect to report our 2022 greenhouse gas emissions later this month. We are leveraging this 2022 carbon emissions baseline to set appropriate emissions reduction goals. When we talk about our high-performing BFS culture, safety is our first priority. I am proud to say that we achieved a 22% reduction in our total recordable incident rate last year and have reduced it by another 30% so far this year. We continue to invest in our people by striving to make BFS the best place to work. We have improved benefits to a better track and retained high-performing talent and have trained over 99% of our team members today on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Turning to M&A on Slide 6, while the current M&A pipeline remains slower than prior years, we continue to target attractive opportunities with a disciplined approach. Thus far in 2023 these have been smaller deals, but given a highly fragmented nature of our industry, we still believe in our goal to invest an average of $500 million in M&A per year for the next several years.  As we mentioned on our call in February, we acquired Noltex Trust during the first quarter, a five-location trust manufacturer providing billing components to the single and multi-family markets throughout Texas. Since then we have acquired two more companies. Last month we acquired Builders Millwork Supply, a millwork distributor serving Anchorage, and this past Monday we acquired JB Millwork, which contributes important value added capacity in the Chattanooga area. We are excited to welcome these businesses and new team members to the BFS family.  Moving to Slide 7 and capital allocation. In the first quarter we deployed approximately $800 million of capital towards organic growth investments, tuck-in M&A, and share repurchases, and we have cumulatively deployed $4.3 billion against our 2025, $7 billion to $10 billion goal. Looking forward, I am happy to announce we plan to host another Investor Day in December in Atlanta, where we would update our progress on our strategic initiatives, including the latest on our digital offerings. We will also provide a tour of our nearby robotic trust facility. We are planning to release more details in the coming months.  Now, let's turn to Slide 8 and provide an update on our digital strategy. We continue to play a pioneering role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry, growing our capabilities in 2022, and are working to drive enhancements and adoption throughout 2023. We are executing our digital product development plan and introducing our customers to the tools and their benefits through the myBLDR.com platform. We firmly believe our long-term commitment to investing in digital innovations and technologies will deliver greater efficiency across home building, enhance our product and service offerings, and extend BFS's lead as a partner of choice in the market. During our last call we announced the launch of our myBLDR.com customer portal, which will ultimately provide our homebuilder customers with access to easy-to-use digital tools to virtually design and build their homes. One of those applications is Home Configure, which is already in use with a significant number of customers, while we continue to develop and pilot new capabilities that will be deployed throughout 2023. Home Configure is a three-dimensional virtual application that allows a user to configure a home while providing a more collaborative experience. These are the types of advancements putting us at the forefront of our industry as we continue to rapidly scale a whole suite of capabilities.  In Q1 we completed over 6,000 automated window and lumber takeoffs, an 80% increase over Q4 2022, and we had nearly 15,000 visitors who started 56,000 sessions in our Home Configure tool. This momentum gives us early confidence that our digital strategy remains on schedule, and we will continue to enhance the platform to drive adoption. Our digital tools will help us integrate more closely with our customers and ultimately result in incremental sell-through of our core building products as we gain share of wallet. We are on track to gain an incremental $1 billion in sales by 2026.  You have heard me say that our people are the building blocks of our organization. They inspire me every day to continue the evolution and growth of our people-first culture. Today I'm delighted to share a success story that represents the best of our sales team, Mitchell Ingram from Blairsville, Georgia.  Mitchell's journey began with us 17 years ago as a CDL driver, and from the very beginning he stood out for delivering exceptional customer service. For five years Mitchell was the driver that every customer wanted, as he flawlessly delivered materials to their job sites, earning their trust and loyalty. That natural ability for exceptional customer service led Mitchell to be then promoted to inside sales, where he continued to excel and quickly became the go-to salesperson for both our internal team and our customers.  Today, as a key member of our outside sales team, Mitchell has become the market's top salesperson and recently won a Leader of the Pack award, recognizing him as one of our top sales team members. On behalf of BFS, I extend my warmest congratulations to Mitchell for his outstanding contributions and achievements.  At BFS, we have many similar remarkable stories, further exemplifying our commitment to the team members that make us so successful. Their dedication and commitment are invaluable to our team's success, and we are fortunate to have them.  I will conclude by saying that our differentiated platform, experienced management team, and clear focus on delivering value-added solutions to our customers have positioned us well to win in the market and outperform. I'm very excited to lead this winning team. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail.
Peter Jackson : Thank you, Dave and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered exceptional gross margins in the first quarter, despite a challenging macro backdrop. The advantages of value-added products and services are evident and key to our outperformance.  We generated strong free cash flow as we leveraged our best-in-class operating platform and extended our track record of effective cost containment and working capital management. Our robust financial position, industry-leading products and solutions, and reputation for providing excellent customer service allow us to successfully navigate macro volatility and position us for above market growth in the years to come.  I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our first quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our second quarter guidance and provide an update on our illustrative full year scenarios. Let's begin by reviewing our first quarter performance on Slide 10. We delivered $3.9 billion in net sales. Core organic sales decreased by 26%, attributable to a 34% decline in single-family due to slowing demand and compared to a strong first quarter of 2022. Multi-family was a bright spot that reflects the benefit of our expansion strategy in this category, growing by nearly 70%. The growth was driven by multiple acquisitions and a strong rental market. R&R and Other grew by more than 3%, mainly attributable to increased sales focus and capacity versus prior year.  The cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately five percentage points of growth to net sales and one additional selling day had a favorable impact of 1%. While core organic sales and value added products decreased by nearly 17% due to slowing single family starts, this is almost 10 points better than the overall core organic result and underscores the resilience of the value added product portfolio. Importantly, value added products represented 56% of our net sales in the quarter, reflecting our position as the supplier of choice to these valuable high margin products.  During the first quarter, gross profit was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 25.2% compared to the prior year period. Gross margin increased 300 basis points to 35.3%, with more than half of the 300 basis points change coming from our multifamily value added products and services. SG&A decreased $64.4 million to $904.2 million, mainly due to lower variable compensation, partially offset by additional expenses from operations acquired in the last year. Acquisitions increased SG&A by $46 million in the quarter. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 630 basis points to 23.3%, primarily attributable to decreased leverage to net sales. We remain focused on disciplined cost management and are taking appropriate actions in response to volume dynamics on a market-by-market basis. As we have stated in the past, approximately 70% of SG&A expense is variable with volumes. We are striking the right balance between calibrating operations based on changes in volume and protecting capacity for future growth.  Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $632 million, a decline of 37%, primarily driven by lower net sales, including a decline in core organic products attributable to a slowing housing market and commodity deflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin was a robust 16.3%.  Adjusted net income was $410 million, down from an adjusted net income of $701 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.96, compared to $3.90 in the prior year period. The decrease in adjusted EPS was favorably offset by our repurchase of more than 7.5 million shares or $0.15 per share during the quarter.  Our first quarter results beat the guidance we provided in February, supported by gross margin strength, as value-added products over-delivered and productivity came in faster than forecast. As a result, we are increasingly confident that our long-term normalized gross margin percentage is now at 28% plus versus our previous expectation of 27% plus. Now, let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 12. Our first quarter operating cash flow was approximately $654 million, up from $180 million in the prior year, mainly attributable to disciplined working capital management and improved product mix, as well as effective pricing and cost management. Capital expenditures were $100 million. All in, we delivered robust free cash flow of approximately $554 million. Free cash flow yield is 28.5%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 47.1% for the trailing 12 months ended March 31. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.8x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end our total liquidity was $1.4 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion in net borrowing, availability under the revolving credit facility and $144 million of cash-on-hand.  Moving to capital deployment, during the first quarter we repurchased approximately 7.5 million shares for $628 million at an average stock price of $83.17 a share. In addition, we have repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares so far in the second quarter for $348 million at an average stock price of $91.90. In total, we have repurchased 39% of our outstanding shares since August of 2021. As we have completed our prior share repurchase authorization, the Board of Directors decided to approve a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and will continue to look for organic and inorganic growth opportunities and to repurchase shares at an attractive value while maintaining our fortress balance sheet.  Now, I would like to discuss our guide on Slide 13. Given the ongoing challenging conditions in the housing market, we are continuing to provide quarterly guidance. We will reassess our full year guidance for actual and base business as the year progresses. For the second quarter we expect net sales to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 13.1% to 13.7%.  Our adjusted EBITDA guide for the second quarter assumes gross margins in the 32% to 34% range. Our second quarter guidance includes the following full year assumptions, which are also outlined in the earnings release and on Slide 14. We expect total capital expenditures in the range of $325 million to $375 million. This includes continued investments in scaling our value-added products. We expect interest expense in the range of $150 million to $170 million, an effective tax rate between 23% and 25%, depreciation and amortization expenses in the range of $525 million to $575 million, no change in the number of selling days versus the prior year. And finally, we expect to deliver between $90 million and $110 million in annual productivity savings.  We recognize that it is important to think about potential outcomes for the full year. So on Slide 15, we have updated our scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance across a range of potential housing market and commodity conditions.  As you can see, our strong Q1 performance and visibility into Q2 have meaningfully improved our expectations for each of the full year performance scenarios. Single-family starts are down 15% for the year, we now believe we could generate roughly $2.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA, which is up $500 million from our fourth quarter scenario analysis. This increased EBITDA expectation reflects stronger gross margins and productivity savings than we previously expected.  As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are exceptionally well positioned to drive our strategic goals forward. We believe that we can sustain a double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin this year, and we continue to see the benefits of our transformed business. I believe that our long-term normalized gross margin percentage is now at 28% or higher.  I'm confident in our best-in-class operating platform, will continue to set us up to generate substantial free cash flow, which provides further financial flexibility on top of our healthy balance sheet. We will also continue to diligently deploy capital and work to manage, to maximize long-term shareholder value.  With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for his closing remarks. 
Dave Rush : Thanks Peter. Let me close by saying that we feel really good about our strategy and our execution so far in 2023. Our investments in value-added products, productivity initiatives, and digital solutions are all delivering on our goal to improve our customers experience in partnership with BFS, while driving growth over the long term.  While 2023 still appears to be a challenging year for our industry, I'm confident that we can create value for our shareholders through executing our strategy, our focus on value-added products and services, and our disciplined deployment of capital towards growth opportunities.  Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: Good morning everyone. Congrats on the results. Thank you for taking the questions. So jumping right to the gross margin question, you raised the long-term guide to – the normalized guide to 28% plus. I think I heard you say value adds a little better and productivity coming in faster. My question is, you talk about the benefits of kind of a transformed business. I mean, is this a view to some of these shorter term trends that you're talking about? You got a little more visibility to the trough as a result or just what are some of the bigger underlying pieces, market share, etc. that give you confidence to say that now is the time to raise that gross margin target. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Matt. Yeah, no, it's a great question. We've been talking, about gross margins for quite a while now, ever since the merger and trying to get a sense of where normal is. We felt really good based on where the business was at that merger date. That 27% or better was something we felt good about on sort of a long-term normalized basis, taking out all the noise around supply chain and that type of thing.  But we were continuing to look at it, right? We've been looking at it, managing the business, but in the meantime, we've been working. So, we've worked to improve our value add as a percentage of the overall business, right. The acquisitions we've made, improving mix, it's grown faster, and it’s been more resilient. So the biggest component being just the increased mix of value add on an ongoing basis, we think that's meaningful and important to our average gross margins over time.  In addition, we've done a really good job internally of managing productivity, even in a volume down market overall, certainly giving us a lot of confidence that the investments we've made in value add productivity and automation have yielded the benefits we were expecting. So those two factors are the most powerful. And the last one I think is, as we've seen a market as down as it was in Q1, and I think we can all admit, this was a challenging year-over-year compare, we still performed very, very well and that gives us the confidence that we needed to start moving that normalized margin up to 28% plus, because we see that as being really proof positive of the value of what that product does for our customers and for us.
Dave Rush: Yeah, I'd just add Matt, that customers see those products as less price sensitive because they are solving problems for them, they are addressing labor concerns for them, and they are reducing cycle times for them, and they can make up some of those costs through the reduction of those cycle times. So that's why we focus on it, from being easiest to do business with perspective and driving value for our customers. 
Matthew Bouley: Got you. Okay, great call there. Thank you for that. And then second one, kind of jumping into the near term. The Q2 EBITDA guide, I mean you're guiding in dollars and margin I guess to be lower than that of Q1, which is obviously unusual historically. And I know you're on this path to normalizing gross margin and that looks to be part of that. But any other detail on what are some of the underlying assumptions around Q2, and why you would have such a kind of unusual seasonality there? Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Sure. Yeah, and I'll let Dave talk to the overall market. What I would say is this is consistent with what we have been communicating. This still assumes that we're going to continue to see an increased competitive environment, a challenging volume environment in Q2, and normalization that continues to flow through in margins and sales. So while we're absolutely confident in the business, I don't want anybody to think that there still aren't some difficult comps coming, at least for the next quarter or two and that's really what you're seeing there in the numbers. 
Dave Rush: So, what we're hearing from customers is the word stability. You're not really hearing robust. You're hearing more things are stable and that's kind of what we're using as the backdrop of our valuations for our forecast as well. There's increased optimism when mortgage rates stay consistent, and the underlying demand supports a fairly resilient demand when mortgage rates stay consistent. But it's still a volatile overall environment, and we're working with that as a backdrop. And so we're feeling pretty good, but it's all on a relative basis.
Matthew Bouley: All right, well thank you Dave, thanks Peter. Good luck guys.
A - Peter Jackson: Thanks Matt.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.
Mike Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to kind of pick up on a couple of those points or questions that Matt had. When we think about the margins and gross margins specifically, you know I think clear enough in terms of your description of normal. You know in the first half of this year you're basically guiding to a mid-30s, low to mid-30s gross margin and even if I were to adjust for a mix, which seems more recurring than non-recurring, you'd still reach that level. It looks like the full year, like the middle scenario if you're at 13% to 14% EBITDA margins, also seems to imply maybe like a low 30s gross margin.  So I guess (a) is that the full year expectation embedded? (b) Could – you know I know there's still some potential timing impact in the first half. Maybe you could just articulate what some of those are in terms of things that have been good guides in your favor. And then if I – sorry for the multi-part question, but (c) would be, I think you said, ‘hey, we'll tell you more about base business as the year progresses.’ But if I take that delta between what you expect for gross margin this year and that 28, should we assume that it's kind of like a few hundred million dollars right now that could be still a little bit temporary in your opinion?
Peter Jackson: So there's one question in 27 parts. I'll do my best and you can tell me if I hit all the points. The first one is around margins. I mean the difference between our guide, which is 28% plus on a normalized basis and what we've talked about in our guide for Q2 for example in the 30, you know mid to low 30s, low to mid 30s, yes you're right, there is a disconnect there.  We didn't provide explicit guidance around full year. I mean obviously those scenarios have some numbers embedded, but I think the message we're trying to send is we're in a very volatile environment still. We're seeing pretty significant step downs in volumes and while we have a much better sense of how the market is going to react, we haven't fully digested it.  So what we're saying in our numbers for this year is that we started exceptionally strong. That'll of course take our full year average in gross margins up above what we would consider to be normalized margins on an ongoing basis. But as we learn more and as we get better confidence, we'll continue to update that normalized number with our best understanding.  You know in terms of what has happened in the near term, I think one of the things that we've been pleasantly surprised by in recent periods has been the strength of gross margins, the resiliency of gross margins. While a big piece of that is mix, I think it's important to point out that our gross margin performance this quarter was really primarily driven by that multi-family investment that we've made.  That business as you know has longer lead times on their quote to delivery, which means there's a bit more exposure to commodities and in this environment that's a favorable thing. So there's some transitory benefit in there. We're certainly pleased with that business's performance overall and really happy to have it as part of the business. But those are the types of things we're accounting for when we're giving these normalized gross margin numbers. Did I hit all your points Mike?
Mike Dahl: Yeah, yeah, pretty much.
Dave Rush: I would just add Mike that, yeah the multi-family tailwind will wane as we go farther into the year for sure. And you know we also anticipate the products that anyone can provide will be increasingly competitive, because supply chain issues have waned as well. But the stuff we're good at, the value-added stuff we're good at is where it's a little stickier. So it's a combination of all of those.
Mike Dahl: Okay, yeah, that's very helpful. Thank you both. And then in terms of a follow-up, just on capital allocation. I mean look, even if some of this is a little temporary in the first half, the underlying EBITDA number, it starts coming through consistent with your middle scenario is incredibly strong. The free cash flow conversions have been great. You've obviously been pretty aggressive buying back the stock, you know a billion dollars effectively in just the last four months.  The new authorization is for $1 billion. It seems like you'll throw off considerably more free cash this year. So just thoughts on kind of why not a bigger, why not a bigger authorization just to have it out there, maybe some puts and takes and any more explicit direction you could provide on what type of free cash conversion you'd expect for the full year?
Peter Jackson: Yeah, and I think probably the first point is that, our thinking around that free cash flow conversion is probably north of $1.5 billion now, because of that call-off we said north of $1 billion in the past, so that's a significant increase in terms of what we're seeing. As you know Mike, some of that is really attributable to the slowdown in the business and the spinning off of some of the value on our working capital balance sheet. The reality is, we are performing quite well and we will continue to deploy capital in the strategy that we've outlined in the past. The board has been very supportive, whenever we need authorization, because we think we have cash to put to work, they'll be there for us and they're absolutely hand-in-glove with us on this strategy, so $1 billion seems fine for now, but we'll revisit it if it makes sense.  I mean the only thing I'll point out is, right, we're done with sort of the windfall benefit of the very, very high commodities, so some of the volumes of share buyback that we've seen over the past couple of years because of those commodities are past that. 
Mike Dahl: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms: Hey! Good morning, everyone and yeah, congrats on the quarter. 
Dave Rush : Trey, thank you.
Trey Grooms: Sure thing. Peter, I think you said you expect to see increased competitive behavior or an increased competitive environment. How does the competitive behavior look in some of your maybe tougher demand markets versus some of the better markets and are you starting to see that behavior, the competitiveness kind of creep up more in these more difficult markets and is it more or less competitive maybe than what you've seen in prior slowdowns?
Dave Rush : Hey Trey, this is Dave. I think it's a market-by-market evaluation Trey. I mean, again, it's still similar to what we've said previously. If you go from west to east, it's a little tougher out west than it is in the east, and where demand is a little tougher, we're seeing definitely more competition, again, around the products that anyone can do. Where we're still doing really well is with the value-added products and the stickiness with those customers around those products and being able to get value for those, because they're more valuable to the customer. Again, it's something that creates efficiencies for them, solves problems for them, they are willing to pay more in those scenarios, because they see the value. But it's generally more west to east as far as competition is going right now around areas where anybody can provide the product and where the supply chain has started to normalize.
Trey Grooms: Okay, got it. Thank you for that, and then I guess as a follow-up, you call out the operational excellence and cost management initiatives that are helping to drive these gains in efficiency and productivity. Longer term, I see kind of it's obvious what it's doing for the near term and in a downside kind of an environment, but longer term, how do you think about maybe the sustainability of some of these actions and these things driving better margins as end markets improve? 
Dave Rush : Well, I think that the exciting thing for me Trey is, where we have the most opportunity is where we're already pretty good, and that's in the manufacturing efficiencies and driving technology that create labor efficiencies in the manufacturing process. You've heard us use that we have increased 22% of board foot per labor hour. That's continuing to improve, and as we continue to invest in that segment of the business, there's still a pretty long runway there.  As far as the distribution side of the business, the exciting thing there is, as we continue to develop best practices and then we leverage it across 570 locations, that generally also is a meaningful number, and we still think there's opportunity along those lines as well, and all of that supports our pledge that we're going to be the easiest to do business with, and it also is something that we can illustrate to our customers, where we bring value to the party beyond just delivering product. 
A - Peter Jackson: The other thing I would add is, you know when we talk about the productivity numbers, these are numbers that we've done the work around to analyze that this is permanent change. We're not trying to take credit on productivity for something that sort of comes and goes as a freebie in the year that we're not going to be able to repeat. These are changes to the business. These are operating changes. These are contractual changes that we feel good about in terms of having changed the business for the better over time and we do think it's cumulative and sticky.
Trey Grooms: Perfect. Thanks for that guys. I'll pass it on.
A - Peter Jackson: Thank you. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Collin Verron with Jefferies.
Collin Verron : Good morning. Great quarter. My first question here is just, you came in ahead of that 1Q guide which you gave at the end of February. Can you just talk about what came in better than you were expecting? Was it underlying demand? Was it a specific product category? Were you just able to hold on to commodity prices better? And since you gave that guide so late in the quarter, can you just give us a sense of how the year-over-year sales declines exited the quarter versus earlier in the quarter?
A - Peter Jackson: Sure. Yeah, no. That's certainly internally that was a bit of a black eye for the organization in terms of the accuracy of our forecast. We knew we were doing well and we felt like the momentum was good, but what we thought was coming was worse than what we actually experienced. That competitive dynamic did not ramp up as quick as we expected. The dynamics didn’t – you know a lot of it was obviously that value-add, that multifamily we've talked about. But even the commodity numbers on some of the longer-term contracts and just some of the way that we floated through was better than we anticipated.  So certainly that operating team has done a fantastic job of managing through all the local market dynamics to ensure that they are moving through product and getting a good compensation for what we've been seeing, but we were certainly surprised at how strong all that was. You know it was an interesting quarter in terms of what we saw in the numbers. You won't hear us whine about the weather, but certainly weather on the West Coast, weather in Texas was disruptive in certain periods. That's been a push and a take – that give and a take. That's definitely continuing to work through, so while we feel good about it that's a piece.  We also saw the impacts of those interest rate changes, whether they’d be surprises up or down were certainly influential on what our builders were reacting to, right, what our customers were reacting to in the market, but overall I think we feel pretty good as Dave was saying. 
Dave Rush : But I would just add, you know early in the year with the volatility of expectation that was out pretty much with anybody that you taught, it was tough to put a stake in the ground and say ‘we're great and we know we're going to be okay.’ Our guys did a fantastic job of preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. So we prepared for the downside scenario with our cost management, and then as we got clearer sights of how the market or the quarter was going to play out, we managed against that baseline.  And as you heard, even from our builder customers, we just reflected the same sentiment they did at that point in time. And as you're hearing them now, they are also saying it was better than they expected. So it's kind of a combination of all of that. 
Collin Verron : That's helpful color. And then just on the multifamily business here, obviously very strong in the quarter. Can you just talk about the size of the backlog that you guys have remaining in that business and any guardrails on how to think about the business through the rest of the year here?
Peter Jackson: Well, it's certainly a nice part about that business is we do have a bit more visibility to the backlog. Right now it is substantial, because that part of the market has been strong and in somewhat surprising fashion has maintained its strength. I think there's absolutely a great profitability story in that world right now.  But as Dave mentioned, that will continue to normalize over time as the coal prices and the market prices of commodities tighten. But yeah, that's absolutely part of both, what allowed us to do the M&A in that sector of the market, but what we're enjoying in terms of the results so far this year and through all of 2023.
Dave Rush: The only thing I'd add is we've got a really substantial backlog that gets us through 2023 and beyond. But that backlog is declining. In other words, we're completing jobs at a faster pace than we're filling the pipeline back up, because that sector in general is facing the same capital cost issues that the single-family sector is facing. And there's just kind of a pause or a hesitancy in that group to try to figure out what the value proposition going forward needs to look like.  We still believe, again long-term, housing demand wins, including in multifamily. But as there's a little bit of a recalibration of that capital cost, we are seeing jobs finished at a greater rate than jobs being entered into the pipeline out 12 months and beyond.
Collin Verron : Great, and good luck in the second quarter.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. 
Stanley Elliott: Good morning, everybody. Thank you for the question and a nice start to the year. Hey Dave, piggybacking on the commentary on the multi-family side, when we think about the value added part of the business, does it break down pretty consistently between your single-family, multi-family buckets? And then how quickly is it or how difficult is it rather, for you all to switch kind of focus in between the individual markets if we do see kind of a multi-family decline in ‘24 and beyond? 
Dave Rush: Stanley, can you repeat the first question? You broke up. 
Stanley Elliott: Yeah, sorry about that. So in terms of kind of the multifamily or the value-add piece as a whole, is there a way to differentiate or delineate between how much of your value add is going into multi-family now versus single-family? Maybe it's just consistent with the overall portfolio, but I was looking for maybe a little direction there. And then also in terms of the ability to pivot your products necessarily between multi-family or single-family, more on some of the manufactured side, depending upon what's going to happen with those end markets. 
Dave Rush: Yeah, thanks for that question. Within the multi-family segment for us, it's primarily value-add. We don't do a lot of non-value add with our multi-family customers and Truss is the overwhelming majority of the value-add. So it will always have a higher percent of multi-family sales as being value-add.  Now in the context of the overall business, it's still a fairly – it's 13% of our total business. So even in that context, it doesn't move the needle very much either way versus the single-family.  Now, what I will tell you, is our guys have done a great job where we have multi-family plants at capacity moving business to single-family plants that are under capacity. And that's the value of our platform and the ability to have, to manage the effectiveness of where we can build those Trusses in the most efficient way by having the availability of those single-family plants.  So there is a coordinated effort to build those Trusses where we can get the most efficient cost and it has to be within the radius of the job that we're trying to supply. But there's a lot of coordination that goes on there and a significant integration effort to make that happen. 
Stanley Elliott: Perfect. Actually, that's great color. Thank you and then in terms of kind of the outlook, I mean, the free cash flow continues to be quite good. Even with M&A, you guys are going to be below half a turn of leverage. Peter, how are you guys thinking about managing the capital structure? I mean, you mentioned repurchases, but so what is your comfort level in terms of leverage right now, given that we are in kind of a still somewhat uncertain market?
Peter Jackson: Yeah, I think as a general guideline we still like one to two times based business as a guideline that is helpful in terms of thinking about how to minimize our risk, but still take on an appropriate amount of it. It's a metric that if you think about base business in the last year, we'd say we have room, but we're certainly in the range, rather than if you just look at our trailing 12 actuals, it looks like we're a little bit under leveraged in that regard.  So as this business normalizes, as we get a better visibility into 2023 full year, we'll go ahead and update that base business, give you an updated thought process around the leverage ratio. But at this point, we feel pretty good about our borrowing, both the cost and the tenure and we'll continue to watch it.
Stanley Elliott: Great, guys. Thanks for the question. Best of luck!
Peter Jackson: Thanks Stanley. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jay McCanless with Wedbush. 
Jay McCanless: Hey! Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So just, I know that lumber, the actual commodity cost is becoming less relevant for your business, but it's been surprising how subdued the lumber market and lumber prices have been this year, especially in light of some of the curtailments that we're starting to hear about. I guess, maybe what are you hearing from your suppliers there, and how are you feeling about the direction of the lumber prices over the next two to three months? 
Peter Jackson: Yeah, that's a tough question to answer. I think we continue to manage it on a flow-through basis, ensuring that we get the right margins for us. It's been a little bit of back and forth, I hear you. There have been some indications that taking capacity out might be helpful to put a floor under it. There's been some other murmuring, particularly on the OSB side about adding capacity. I think it's kind of range-bound right now, but it’s tough to say. It's been such a surprising commodity over the last few years. I certainly don't feel comfortable predicting, but we're ready.
Jay McCanless: Okay. And the other question, I think and Dave you may have already addressed this, but just wondering with some of the financial pressures that supposedly are coming from banks tightening credit, etc. Have you seen your competition on the distribution side getting more aggressive on price or is this lift in sentiment from the builders in March and April been able to diffuse some of that or most of that? 
Dave Rush: I think what you're saying is or asking about is the bank implications on demand, and as a result, what is that doing with our supply chain partners? I would tell you there are products that there is a little of additional capacity versus demand, but in general, our supply chain partners at this point in time have worked through where they had excess capacity in the first quarter and kept things at a normalized environment.  So they are still experiencing inflationary pressures in their business as well, specifically around labor, and they've been a little reluctant to get too aggressive, unless it was to balance the capacity versus on-hand situation, which pretty much worked itself out in the first quarter. So I think we're in that. You know the word of the day for the industry is stabilization. I think we're all in kind of a stable market and trying to be nimble and be able to respond either on the upside or the downside as necessary, and I think that's kind of where we are today.
Jay McCanless: Okay. That sounds great. Thanks for taking my questions. 
Peter Jackson: Thanks Jay.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.
Steven Ramsey : Hi! Good morning. Maybe just to clarify on the first quarter, better than expected start to the year, was that in all segments or did one segment drive that over another? And maybe you can dovetail into the green shoots that you saw in April, maybe elaborate how that is connected to the better start. 
Peter Jackson: Well, fair question. I would say overall we saw more resiliency in the market than we had forecasted. I think that's fair to say across the board. We saw the most resiliency in the geographically in the East, I would say product-wise in value-add. And in terms of the timing on that, I don't think there's anything strong indicating there is a time horizon that caused the results to be different, meaning each market is digesting what their demand looks like, each market is resetting and placing orders. But overall, I think it's been more orderly and more disciplined in terms of reacting to the step down in sales than we'd originally forecast.
Dave Rush: As far as the green shoots comment, I think what we're seeing from our customers is they are cautiously optimistic. Again, that things will be stable, and there are areas where things are showing the ability for demand to be resilient when mortgage rates are at a level where buyers enter into the market again.  Areas of the country that we've seen where that's a little better are where there's actual pockets of strength with real job growth versus what was somewhat of a boom during COVID that's kind of now receded. So again, mainly moving west to east is where we see it improving. And west is coming, starting to show signs of at least of leveling out. 
Steven Ramsey : Okay, that's helpful. And then thinking longer term, the secular penetration of value added products in multi-family and single-family, how do you see that shaping up over the long term? You said multi-family is mostly value added products. So, is there less of a penetration opportunity there or adding more value added products into that portfolio for those customers? 
Peter Jackson: Yeah, I mean overall we're very excited about what value-add means in the long term. We've certainly moved the needle quite a bit in terms of our max being a 56% value-add this quarter, but we're not done. There's more opportunity geographically. There are more opportunities to have the full portfolio of products that we have in our offering in markets where it's not there yet. And I think where we ultimately expect to get to is if you look at the digital world, the ability to do more and more of that value-added [inaudible].  We're looking for ways to grow our ability to serve our customers, make them more efficient, help their total cost of build go down. So we're certainly excited about it. We think there's a lot of opportunity there still. You know, there's not a lot of great numbers in terms of share, so it's a little harder to talk about it that way, but we're certainly believers that there's much more to come. 
Dave Rush: And the only other thing I'd add specifically around Truss is the premise around adding multifamily Truss was in market diversification from single-family. And that only works when you have the coordination between the single-family plants and the multi-family plants to be able to share work. And what we're doing really well is figuring that out and integrating that, and it accomplishes our objective to make sure when multi-family's hot, we're able to hit there, when single-family's hot we're able to hit there.
Steven Ramsey : Excellent! Thank you for the color.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank. 
Joe Ahlersmeyer: Yeah, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the impressive results. 
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Joe. 
Joe Ahlersmeyer: Looking at your windows, doors and millwork performance in the quarter, essentially flat year-over-year, could you just maybe unpack that a little more with respect to what drove that? Are we seeing perhaps stronger pricing in doors? Is this mainly the multi-family performance or are we also perhaps seeing a manifestation of the single family completions still positive on a quarterly basis here? 
Peter Jackson: Yeah, I think it's a little bit of a couple of those things. The completion certainly remains strong on those back of the building process products, windows, doors and millwork, a good example. I think there was quite a bit of disruption in that part of the market as well, which slowed the ability to put product on the ground when needed. So that's another big component, but we've also invested. So there's increased ability to serve as well.
Joe Ahlersmeyer: Great. And sitting here this time next year, if we're looking at this bridge on page 10, is it likely that we see now the commodity deflation bucket fairly de minimis on a year-over-year basis? And relatedly, that same bucket in the second quarter coming up here, your expectation for that, I assume is a significant increase in the headwind versus 1Q. So maybe just some context around how that shapes up next quarter and this time next year? Thanks. 
Peter Jackson: Yeah, no, you're right. We should have digested the bulk of all this commodity noise, the commodity volatility by next year. Q2 would be the biggest comp in terms of peak pricing hit in Q2 of last year. So it may drain a little bit into Q3, but Q2 is the biggest impact on a year-over-year basis, that's right.
Joe Ahlersmeyer: Could it be as much as $2 billion to $2.5 billion of a headwind on sales or is that too aggressive?
Peter Jackson: We can get back to you on that one. I don't actually have that narrow of a guide off the top of my head. 
Joe Ahlersmeyer: Okay, no worries. Thanks a lot guys.
Peter Jackson: Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from David Manthey with Baird.
David Manthey: Yeah, thank you. Good morning everyone. When you talk about productivity savings here, I'm just definitionally wondering, is that mostly or entirely in SG&A? And for example, the $34 million in productivity this quarter, is that separate from your higher gross margin outlook or is there some overlap between the two?
Dave Rush: Yeah. The productivity savings actually is also a component of margin where it relates to manufacturing, where we've gained manufacturing efficiencies. It actually is a positive contributor to our margin as well, so it's both. When we get it in the SG&A categories and the COGS categories through manufacturing efficiencies.
David Manthey: And I assume that varies from quarter to quarter, so there's no base rule we should be thinking about? 
Peter Jackson: That is correct.
David Manthey: Okay. Thanks for taking the question. 
Peter Jackson: Thanks David.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman.
Adam Baumgarten : Hey! Good morning, guys. Can you walk us through what you're seeing on pricing for the non-commodity part of the business?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. I mean, I think commodity pricing has been the headline that we've all talked about, but there's certainly been a lot of work done on the pricing in the non-commodity side. It's an area that I think really lends itself to the process and the discipline that we've implemented over the last five years or so. So certainly, a nice offset to the volume headwinds from the pricing side. Obviously not all of it, but certainly strong healthy pricing in that space. A chunk of it is absolutely attributable to the multi-family mix change and the profitability of that business.
Adam Baumgarten : Got it. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.
Ketan Mamtora : Thanks for taking my question. Peter, can you just clarify how you think about free cash flow for 2023? I thought I heard $1.5 billion earlier in the comments. 
Peter Jackson: Yeah. You know, free cash flow continues to be a bright spot for us. We actually generated a substantial amount in Q1, and you know that's a bit unusual for us. Some of that has to do with the resizing of the business on a year-over-year comparison basis. But we're still performing well, still quite profitable. So we're comfortable saying that we expect cash flows to be kind of north of that $1.5 billion range for 2023, based on sort of the most likely or middle over the path scenario that we provided.
Ketan Mamtora : You said north of $1.5 billion Peter, just to clarify?
Peter Jackson: That's correct.
Ketan Mamtora : Perfect. Thank you so much.
Operator: And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-28 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Fourth Quarter 2022 and Year End Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Neese: Thank you, Brittney and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Rush, our recently appointed CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our fourth quarter and full year results. The earnings press release and investor presentation are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.
David Rush: Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Before we get into the results, I'd like to thank the Board of Directors for the opportunity to serve as the CEO of Builders FirstSource and for trusting me to lead this great organization. I also want to thank all of the BFS field leaders and team members for their support which has been inspiring. I come from a background in finance having spent the first 18 years of my career in various financial roles from controller to CFO. Over my 23 years with BFS, I've been fortunate to have had a variety of operational roles including Regional Oversight, primary responsibility for both the ProBuild and BMC integrations and most recently leadership of our enterprise-wide initiatives as EVP of our Strategic Management Office. I believe my experience and industry knowledge will be a strong basis to build on our success of creating long-term value for shareholders. Now, let's turn to the business results. Macroeconomic factors will undoubtedly continue to create headlines this year. However, with our exceptional and seasoned team, strong balance sheet and industry leading platform, we are in a great position to win in any environment. We have a field leadership team with over 30 years average experience in the industry. They have been through similar macroeconomic environments to the one we are currently facing today, which gives me great confidence in our ability to manage business changes with quick and decisive action as required. We have maintained very low leverage providing us with maximum flexibility to deal with any scenario and we continue to leverage our footprint, our scale, and our product portfolio to outcompete in the market. Let's turn to our long-term strategic priorities on Slide 4 for a moment. As we navigate a changing landscape, we see no need to alter our long-term strategy, and we remain focused on expanding organically in value-added products and services, driving operational excellence, continuing to build our high performing culture, and growing through strategic tuck-in acquisitions. On Slide 5, you can see our continued emphasis on the strategic priorities was key to our record full year 2022 net sales of $22.7 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $4.4 billion. Top line growth, value-added product mix improvement and disciplined cost management resulted in our adjusted EBITDA margin increasing 390 basis points to 19.3%. The combination of increased profitability and share buybacks supported 81% growth in full year 2022 adjusted EPS. On Slide 6, you can see that we delivered a 6.6% increase in core organic sales, including nearly 21% growth in our higher margin value-added products. We're extremely pleased to deliver $123 million in productivity savings for the year, exceeding our $100 million target as we drive improvement across a variety of projects and leverage our BFS One Team Operating System. We remain focused on the importance of controlling SG&A and other expenses. This includes efficiency, efficient cap capacity utilization, ongoing optimization of our footprint, and balancing the need for variable cost reductions and future capacity. Importantly, we have rationalized over 30 locations during the last year while main maintaining coverage and not exiting any markets. I'm extremely proud of how we continue to demonstrate our high performing culture through improved safety by lowering our recordable incident rate by approximately 22% year-over-year, which marks the second consecutive year of improvement. We also continue to invest in training enhanced DEI initiatives and improved employee benefits to better attract and retain high performing talent. Turning to M&A on Slide 7, in addition to our focus on profitable core organic growth, we continue to execute tuck-in acquisitions aligned with our strategy completing six acquisitions in 2022. Although the M&A pipeline has slowed in the current macro environment, we continue to be acquisitive while remaining disciplined in our approach. We are committed to expanding our geographic footprint in key markets with a particular emphasis on enhancing our value-added portfolio to better serve our customers, diversify our end market exposure, and leverage our technological capabilities. This is evidence by our recent acquisitions including Pima Door & Supply in the fourth quarter, which expands our millwork footprint in the Phoenix area and earlier this month, we acquired Noltex Truss, a five location truss manufacturer providing building components to the single and multi-family markets throughout Texas. This tuck-in acquisition further extends our leading position in value-added products across the state. We are excited to welcome both Pima and Noltex with their longstanding customer relationships and track record of profitable growth to the BFS family. The still highly fragmented nature of our industry supports our ambition to invest $500 million in M&A per year on average for the next several years. Moving to Slide 8 and looking at our capital allocation in aggregate for 2022, we deployed approximately $3.5 billion of capital towards organic growth investments, tuck-in M&A and share repurchases and remain on track to achieve the goal we established at our 2021 Investor Day of deploying $7 billion to $10 billion from 2022 to 2025. We will continue to closely monitor our customer sentiment, which currently suggests a challenging year ahead. During the fourth quarter, we saw a slowdown in average daily sales, which has continued into the first quarter. Higher mortgage rates and affordability challenge continue to be headwinds. On Slide 9, we outlined the benefits of our flexible business model for dynamic operating environments such as the one we're currently experiencing. As we have discussed, we are actively managing the business as conditions indicate, and we are acting decisively wherever we see decelerating demand. Our focus is on effectively managing costs through our variable expense structure to match costs with volumes. We are optimizing capacity and reducing discretionary spend without impairing our ability to maximize the recovery when this turns the corner. Stepping back, we realize affordability has been an increasing concern over the past several years as home prices and rates have increased significantly. We are working and making housing more attainable by investing in the value-added products, productivity and digital capabilities to reduce cycle times and make homebuilding more efficient. For example, in 2022, we invested approximately $125 million in CapEx supporting our value-added product growth and digital strategy. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize our investments in our fleet, value-added technology, and digital automations. Together, these initiatives will help lower total costs, improve affordability, and allow more people to buy homes. We are committed to strategically accelerate our leading market position and deliver on our overall value proposition, and we will continue to execute while keeping our focus on providing the best possible service to our customers. Now, let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss our pioneering role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry. We have a long-term commitment to investing in digital innovations and technologies that we believe will drive greater efficiency across homebuilding and enhance our product offerings. On the homebuilders software side, we are executing our development plan and integrating that with our BFS operations through our digital sales teams.

myBLDR.com: Last month at our national event, we announced our inaugural BFS Hall of Fame Class for 2022, the culmination of our annual employee recognition program and a highlight of our people first culture. These distinguished individuals represent the best of our frontline team members, but there is one person I would like to highlight today, Frank Gloria. Frank is a Fleet and Compliance Manager out in Southern California who has been with the company and its predecessors for an impressive 45 years. He oversees our fleet and machinery across 11 locations. Frank takes great pride in keeping everything running consistently and with minimal downtime. His manager emphasized quote, Frank's knowledge of everything mechanical is simply unrivaled. On behalf of the leadership team, I want to thank Frank and the other hall of fame inductees for their tremendous contributions. I will conclude by saying that we have the best team to win in a challenging environment. I am confident in our strategies and our ability to deliver long-term results for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail.
Peter Jackson: Thank you Dave and good morning everyone. I want to congratulate Dave on his appointment as our new CEO. I've worked with him for many years and couldn't be happier for him and for this company. I know he will lead us to continued growth and success. I also want to join Dave in thanking our team members for delivering a record year of performance. We sincerely appreciate your hard work and dedication to delivering excellent service to our customers day in and day out. I'm proud to report that we delivered solid financial results in the fourth quarter to cap off a record year of the business. We continued to manage through the complex operating environment with a proactive mindset and a disciplined approach. We expect that the structural enhancements we have made in our business over the past decade will help us mitigate the impact of softer housing demand and inflationary headwinds. Our ample liquidity, low leverage and disciplined cost management provides significant financial firepower to continue to strategically and opportunistically grow our business. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll recap our fourth quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment, and finally, I'll discuss our first quarter guidance and lay out illustrative full year scenarios. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter performance on Slide 12. We delivered $4.4 billion in net sales. Core organic growth decreased by 8% attributable to a nearly 14% decline in single-family as slowing demand compared to strong fourth quarter 2021 led to difficult comps. Both multi-family and repair, remodel, and other increased by almost 15%. Multi-family was driven by a strong rental market and resulting backlog. R&R and Other growth was mainly attributable to increased sales focus and capacity versus prior year. Two fewer selling days had an unfavorable impact of roughly 3% on net sales. The cumulative effect of our acquisitions over the past year contributed approximately 8 percentage points of growth to net sales. Value-added products saw another quarter of growth compared to total fourth quarters starts, which decreased by 16%. Core organic sales in the category increased by 0.6%, reflecting the macro trend of value-added product adoption and our success in the category. I'm very happy to highlight value-added products represented over half of our revenue in the quarter, a great proof point of success towards our goal of being the supplier of choice for these valuable high growth products. During the fourth quarter, gross profit was $1.5 billion or roughly comparable to the prior year period. Gross margin increased 200 basis points to 34.1%, mainly due to the increased mix of value-added products. SG&A grew 11% to $958.7 million, mainly due to additional operating expenses from companies acquired in the last year inflation and other costs. Acquisitions represented over 60% of the increase in SG&A. As a percentage of net sales total SG&A increased by 340 basis points to 22%. We remain focused on disciplined cost management and are taking appropriate actions in response to volume dynamics on a market by market basis. These actions include footprint rationalization, discretionary spending reductions, and cutting headcount and overtime. As we have stated in the past, approximately 70% of SG&A expense is variable. Within that 70% roughly 20% of sales is driven by volume based formulas, things like commissions and bonuses. The remaining 50% of sales is where we are actively managing our operations. We are striking the right balance between resizing operations based on changes in volume and protecting capacity for future growth. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $700 million, a decline of $97 million, primarily due to declines in core organic sales and commodities partially offset by M&A. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA margin was 16%. This represents the second fast fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin in our history reflecting our focused execution and expense control. Adjusted net income was $470.8 million, down from an adjusted net income of $532.4 million in the prior year quarter, attributable to a decrease in net sales and higher SG&A expense. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.21 compared to $2.78 in the prior year period. The increase reflects our more than $650 million in accretive share repurchases investments during the quarter. To put this in perspective, the repurchase equates to $0.21 or nearly half of the $0.43 change. Now let's turn to our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 14. Our fourth quarter operating cash flow was approximately $971 million, mainly attributable to increased profitability due to effective pricing and cost management, as well as disciplined working capital management. Generally, we see working capital as incremental or decremental of approximately 10% of sales. Capital expenditures were $131 million. All-in we delivered robust free cash flow of approximately $840 million. For the year we generated record free cash flow of approximately $3.3 billion, representing a free cash flow yield of 30.6% operating cash flow. Return on invested capital was 41.1% for the year ended December 31. Our 2022 net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.7 times and approximately 1.3 times our estimated 2022 base business EBITDA, well within our stated target of 1 to 2 times. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was $1.5 billion consisting of $1.4 billion in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $100 million of cash on hand. Moving to capital deployment, during the fourth quarter, we repurchase approximately 10.2 million shares for $651 million at an average stock price of $64.17 per share. In addition, we have repurchased approximately 900,000 shares so far in the first quarter of 2023 for $61 million at an average stock price of $65.94. During 2022 we repurchase almost 42 million shares for $2.6 billion [ph], and we have more than $900 million remaining in our authorization. In total, we have repurchased more than one third of our outstanding shares in the last 18 months. We remain disciplined stewards of capital and we'll continue to look for inorganic growth opportunities and to repurchase shares at an attractive value. We maintain a fortress balance sheet, which will help us withstand a slower housing environment and keep us well positioned for long-term growth. Turning to Slide 15, we continue to believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology. During 2022, base business revenue grew 13% while base business adjusted EBITDA increased 28% year-over-year. This approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity volatility. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes normalized commodity margins and static commodity prices at $400 per thousand board feet. Overall, I'm proud that we delivered solid results in the fourth quarter despite slowing housing starts. Additionally, our record results for the full year reflect our differentiated platform, talented team members, and intense focus on execution. I'm confident that through our leading footprint, investments in value-added products, and ongoing efficiency initiatives, that we can continue to gain share, grow our value-added products, and deploy capital. Now, I would like to discuss our guidance on Slide 16. Given the current challenging conditions in the housing market, amid elevated mortgage rates and general uncertainty in economic conditions, we are amending our guidance disclosures at this time to align with our public customers. Customers of all types and sizes have expressed their uncertainty about starts in the year ahead. As a result, we have decided to only provide guidance for the first quarter of 2023 as shown on Slide 16. We will reassess full year guidance for actual end base business as the year progresses. For the first quarter, we expect net sales to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion, and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $400 million to $440 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 11.7% to 11.9%. I would also note that the first quarter guide assumes gross margins to be in the 30% to 32% range. In addition, given the 2022 starts profile, we expect comparisons to prior year will be most difficult in the first two quarters. Our guidance includes the following full year assumptions, which are also outlined in the earnings release, and on Slide 17. We expect total capital expenditures in the range of $300 to $350 million. This includes continued investments in value-added products, and we continue to invest in our technology and infrastructure, and we will migrate to one integrated ERP platform in the coming years. I'll remind you that the related increases in CapEx and OpEx are included in our guidance and our 2025 financial projections from our December 2021 Investor Day. We expect interest expense in the range of $150 million to $170 million, an effective tax rate between 23% and 25%. Depreciation and amortization expenses in the range of 525 million to $550 million, no change in the number of selling days, and we expect to deliver between $90 million and $110 million in productivity savings. We recognize that it's important to think about potential outcomes for the full year, so on Slide 18, we provide a scenario analysis to demonstrate how we are positioned to generate resilient financial performance across a range of potential housing markets and commodity conditions. I will reiterate that we are not providing full year guidance here, but this scenario analysis should help clarify our range of performance expectations and demonstrate the capability of our business to achieve strong adjusted EBITDA margins in 2023. To summarize, we are exceptionally well positioned to withstand a slowdown in housing while continuing to drive our strategic goals forward. We have a strong balance sheet and no long-term debt maturities until 2030. We are operating in a proactive fashion and are taking the necessary steps to manage through this downturn with a relentless focus on execution. I'm confident our best-in-class operating platform will continue to generate solid free cash flow, which provides further financial flexibility. We will also diligently deploy capital and work to maximize long-term shareholder value. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for his closing remarks.
David Rush: Thanks Peter. Let me provide a few final thoughts. Having spent the greater part of my career with BFS, I firmly believe in our differentiated platform, which is the strongest it's ever been and will enable us to outperform in any environment. We have a clear strategy that we're continuing to execute. We generated strong cash flow, and we have significant opportunities to invest that cash to expand our value-added products and solutions, execute strategic acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. Through it all we remain focused on operational excellence to continue to drive increased safety, productivity, and profitability. 2023 will be a challenging year for our industry, but I'm confident in our talented team members who have clearly demonstrated their ability to execute and win in any market. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator, let's open the call now for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is now open.
Trey Grooms: Hey, good morning everyone. Dave, congrats on your new role. Look forward to working with you.
David Rush: Hi Trey. Thanks, Trey.
Trey Grooms: Sure. So I guess first, multi-family and R&R very strong in the quarter. Can you talk about how these two segments, the multi-family and R&R are trending through 1Q and, and how you're thinking about these business lines kind of as we progress through 23?
David Rush: Thanks, Trey. That's a great question. I'll start with R&R. R&R if you expand it in the current year primarily because we had capacity constraints in 2021 and 2022 just taking care of our existing business. Once those capacity constraints waned, our ability to focus on that segment again allowed us to go after new customers and try to generate more R&Rs business. But multi-family, it's been primarily through acquisition.
Trussway:
Panel Truss:
Trey Grooms: Perfect. Thanks for that. And I guess my next question you'd laid out Peter, you laid out expectations for over $1 billion in free cash flow if memory serves me right, and I think it that was in kind of this 800,000 single-family start environment. First off, is that still the expectation? And then how does free cash flow or how do you expect free cash flow to, to move relative to that sensitivity table you gave us in the deck?
Peter Jackson: Yes, no, thanks, Trey. So that's a good question. There's a lot going on in the market and so we've stayed away from the cash flow including it in the full year scenarios, but yes, the short answer to your question is we still think it's north of $1 billion in free cash flow, assuming about a 20% starts down scenario and a reasonably steady commodity environment. As you know, those, both of those things can move our working capital quite a bit. Generally speaking, we still believe that that roughly 10% incremental or decremental working capital with sales is a good way to think about us. So given the dynamics around what commodities are doing, kind of what starts are doing, as well as the core underlying business' ability to generate cash, we do think that north of $1 billion number is still right.
Trey Grooms: Got it. Okay, perfect. That's good and encouraging. If I could sneak one last one in, you know, the value-added piece now over half your sales in the quarter, that's super impressive. As the single-family business likely slows further in the coming quarters, how would you expect the value-added mix to change? Would there be or would you expect there to be more or less appetite from homebuilders to utilize these products?
David Rush: Yes Trey, I appreciate that question. It makes sense for you to ask it. The value-added has shown incredible resiliency even as we've had headwinds and starts and the market has turned a little bit, at least especially on the component side. They're just such a nice offset to the labor challenge and the labor challenge is going to be consistent even in the current housing environment we're in. So we haven't seen people move away from components even as their starts have gone down. We have achieved over a 50% of our sales in total value-added in Q4, which has been a nice buoy to our overall sales mix, and we think through growing through our recent acquisitions that we're going to be able to continue to maintain that pace.
Trey Grooms: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.
Peter Jackson: Yes and probably the only thing I'd throw in, the only thing I'd throw in there, Trey, is that it does correlate to some degree the starts, right? I mean, yes, they're still using it and they're not going away from it like Dave was saying, but we don't want to somehow argue that Truss is going to maintain its volumes when starts are down there. There is a correlation there, but we are seeing growth, we're seeing secular growth, and so that's certainly a strong area for us, and I think you heard it in my comments, right? So fourth quarter value-add, we were still favorable even though starts were down more than 16%.
Trey Grooms: Yep. Got it. Makes sense. Thanks for taking the question. I'll pass it on. Good luck.
David Rush: Thanks Trey.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is open.
Matthew Bouley: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions and welcome Dave to the earnings call. So first question on, you know, still kind of seeing that gross margin above 30% for the Q1 guide. When we look at the midpoint of your scenarios of that kind of 10% to 11% EBITDA margin for the year, what does that imply about the gross margin beyond Q1? How quickly does it normalize and any color on sort of commodity versus non-commodity gross margins as well would be helpful? Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Matt. The storyline for that gross margin number continues to be one of good progress. We're pleased with what we've seen so far, but certainly an open question in terms of where it gets to. So as you highlighted, things have stayed strong in the gross margin line. It is beginning to retrace what we've discussed in the past, right, beginning to normalize as the supply chain normalizes. We certainly have performed well. I mean our 30% to 32% gross margin guide for Q1 is certainly well north of what we've said historically is our normalized roughly 27% plus gross margin. We're continuing to see really nice performance and mix up from the value-add component of our business, which we hope for and which we're expecting. But as the year progresses, we do anticipate that continuing to trend back towards a normalized level. You know, we're pretty optimistic about what that looks like, but for now I'm not ready to provide any real guidance in terms of the full year.
David Rush: Yes, the only other thing I'd add Matt is, part of how we've managed margin is actually through some of our cost improvement initiatives around manufacturing. We've actually improved our board foot per man hour by 22% since the merger. That productivity in Truss allows us and will allow us to compete effectively for share even in a challenging environment. So we're kind of going at it from all angles and trying to maintain the margin the best we can.
Matthew Bouley: Got it. Okay, that's very helpful. That makes sense. Second one, on the value-add you had the 16% decline in manufactured products over the quarter. Clearly that's more tied to the front end of construction. And I think you had the windows, doors and millwork growing 22% reflecting completions. My question is, how should we think about the timing of those converging? Kind of at what point do you see this sort of tale of completions beginning to more closely resemble what we've seen in starts? Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Yes, Matt, that's a good question. I think we've pretty much already seen that convergence as we get farther into the quarter. Our door and millwork sales have somewhat normalized, but we still believe in the value-added segment as a positive for the overall business. And the Truss component, as I said, has been really resilient. We haven't seen people move away from Truss, granted, because there's fewer starts. We're going to have fewer sales in Truss, but the fact that we can maintain that percentage of our overall business is very encouraging to us and we believe it will continue.
Matthew Bouley: Got it. All right, thanks Dave. Thanks Peter. Good luck guys.
David Rush: Thanks Matt.
Operator: Good, thank you. We'll take our next question from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Ketan Mamtora: Thank you. First question, recognizing that there's still a lot of uncertainty around, can you give us some sense of how you guys are thinking about the multi-family business and R&R? It seems like that is becoming a greater focus area for y'all.
David Rush: Yes Ketan. I appreciate the question. Multi-family will certainly be a buoy for us in 2023. We are not quite sure how 2024 is going to play out. I was at the Harvard Housing Conference and there was some concern that multi-family in 2024 may start seeing some headwinds. What we're seeing in the amount of bid activity for 2024 has not tremendously waned though. So we're still slightly optimistic there. On the R&R front, again, the thing that made that difficult for us in prior years was capacity and the supply chain constraints that we were facing. It was hard to fully explore that opportunity and go after new business when we were having struggles with supply chain taking care of existing customers. So we will rededicate our focus on growing that share now that those kind of conditions have lessened.
Ketan Mamtora: Got it. That's helpful. And then my second question, either Dave or Peter, it seems like there is some investor concern about your sort of ability to hold onto price gains on the manufactured component side, with engineered wood pricing also starting to fall quite sharply, obviously single-family is down. Can you talk at a high level, sort of at least philosophically, how you'll approach that?
David Rush: Yes, that's a great question. I think for us we did invest significantly almost $100 million and our ability to gain productivity through automation in all our plants; that has created a cost advantage for us in the marketplace. We believe we're the low cost provider for Truss in the marketplace. That gives you a little bit of flexibility to go after share where that's the answer, and to be able to hold on to a little bit of margin for a little longer time where that's available. Anything you want to add there, Peter?
Peter Jackson: Yes and I think we've talked a lot about the amount of investment we've made in pricing management and pricing rigor and pricing discipline. That's certainly an important part about how we expect to manage this business on a go forward basis and combine with this point about how efficient we are, we think that puts us in a great position to offer a total cost benefit to our customer, while at the same time getting a fair margin and being able to hold on to what we worked so hard for. So we're certainly optimistic right now, especially as you see each quarter's numbers come through.
David Rush: I do believe normal margins for product that the margin ran up simply based on supply and the demand dynamics, that will normalize first and we're already seeing that. You've definitely seeing it, for example, with lumber and sheet goods as an example. The other products in our industry won't respond as quickly and as deeply as lumber and sheet goods have, but we should see some of that. But as far as what we can control, I think what we're going to try to do is, is win by providing better customer service, better reduced cycle times for our customers, allow them to win on cycle time costs, and then we'll be able to hold on to some of the margin that we've tried to create.
Ketan Mamtora: That's helpful perspective. Good luck in 2023. I'll jump back in the queue.
David Rush: Thanks, Ketan.
Operator: And thank you. We'll take our next question from David Manthey with Barclays. Your line is, I apologize, with Baird. Your line is now open.
David Manthey: Yes, thank you. And let me add my congratulations to you, Dave.
David Rush: Thanks.
David Manthey: First question, could you discuss your comfort level with the debt in a downside 2023 scenario? I assume you delever a lot from the balance sheet unwinding, but is there any change in your views at all on M&A or share repurchase as we move through this downturn yet or potentially in the future?
David Rush: Yes, thanks Dave. That's a great question. So the short answer is, we feel really good about the balance sheet and we think that our priorities around capital allocation are still the right ones. We're going to lean in on it. You know, we've got no really, no structured debt till 2030. The ABL is, we just reran that one from a timeline perspective. So we've got new maturity start, plenty of liquidity. We feel very good about the strength of the balance sheet. You layer on the fact that, as you noted, we would expect to release some working capital in the event of a further sort of slowing in the market. So that will be a nice tailwind in terms of available cash. The business is still generating cash, so feel good about that, even in some of these more aggressive downside scenarios. And then the overlay of all that is, we do expect there to be opportunities, right? While M&A has certainly been a source of growth for us, and it has slowed down in terms of total number of opportunities on the market, we still see nice targets at reasonable multiples as evidenced by the Noltex deal that we think should be part of the BFS family. And we're going to continue to execute those. So we're going to -- as we stay disciplined, we think there's really going to be, there are going to be nice opportunities for us to continue to do that. And as we've demonstrated up through now, we think there's real intrinsic value in the repurchase of shares. So to the extent we're not seeing good targets in M&A or we don't have the capacity internally to do more M&A, we'll continue to leverage that as well.
Peter Jackson: The only, the only thing I'd add on the M&A front is we are still at or above our plan that we laid out on Investor Day of $500 million per year dedicated to M&A. So even as it slows now over the long-term, we don't have any concern over hitting that target.
David Manthey:
READY-FRAME:
David Rush:
READY-FRAME:
READY-FRAME:
David Manthey: Okay, thank you.
David Rush: Thanks, Dave.
Operator: We will take our next question from Keith Hughes with Truist. Your line is open.
Keith Hughes: Thank you. On the guidance for the first quarter, can you give us any kind of breakout how much the revenue decline is from commodity deflation versus units, and the kind of value-added comment within that would be nice as well?
David Rush: Well, and then in terms of the breakdown, the commodity prices have pretty well, I would say leveled out based on what we're looking at been pretty stable. So the decline year-over-year in commodities is meaningful. It will get worse on a comp basis as we go through the second quarter. Last year it peaked in Q2, so certainly a lot of headwind from commodities. And you know, what we've seen is sort of that trend down on a year-over-year comp basis that trend down started probably Q3, Q4 last year, probably the best way to describe it. So comps will be most difficult in Q1 and Q2 and get a little easier in the back half of the year. We won't break down the guide in those sub components, but hopefully that gives you good context.
Keith Hughes: Yes, that's directly what I was looking for. And I guess the question on cash flow, you've played out some M&A targets with the stock where it is now, would you consider buying in excess of free cash flow on other borrowing as we go through this downturn on shares or are you going to be limiting yourself on share repurchase with cash you're generating?
David Rush: Well, I mean, I think the way we think about deploying capital broadly, right, is that we have an appropriate balance sheet. We're well structured. As long as we're in kind of our range of one to two times base business, we're extremely comfortable. Certainly not intimidated by the idea of being a little below or a little above for a window of time. I think that's just good management. But we certainly are committed to continuing to deploy capital. We think it's a responsibility of management. We think it's a responsible thing to do. We think it's good for shareholders, so we're going to continue to stay committed. And we'll look for opportunistic moments, right? Where in each one of those categories, we think there'll be times when it might make sense to lean in. But we're never going to put ourselves in a position where we put ourselves at risk. We've got a lot of confidence in our ability to sort of see what the business is capable of and manage that liquidity and we're confident we can work well in that range.
Keith Hughes: Okay. Thank you.
David Rush: Thanks Keith.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman. Your line is now open.
Adam Baumgarten: Hey, good morning everyone. Just a question on the mix of business. Is there any meaningful impact on margins, either positive or negative from a higher mix of multi-family and R&R revenue?
David Rush: Yes, Adam, that's a good question. In 2023 multi-family will be a tailwind for our margin. It only creates a little bit of a tailwind though, because it's still only about 15% of our overall business. R&R traditionally has been a higher margin product as well and we expect a favorable result from R&R on our margin maintenance. It will help us hold on to margin. Again, the combination of those two products is a smaller percentage of our overall business and generally our margin profile follows single-family, but they will be helpful in us maintaining as we normalize in other areas.
Adam Baumgarten: Okay, got it. And then just on digital solutions, you guys said you are on track to deliver $1 billion in revenue by 2026, can you maybe give us an update on where you ended in 2022?
David Rush: Yes, Adam I'd love to talk about our digital milestone. So 2022 is a year of development. We really weren't trying to monetize the concept in 2022, and actually even through 2023 it would only be a marginal revenue opportunity. We're playing end game here with the digital solution. What we're focused on in 2023 is the full development of the platform and we believe by the end of the year, we will have achieved all the development milestones. We're piloting it in 40 with 40 customers across four markets. We're going to learn a lot from that. We're going to go back, we're going to refigure, we're going to redevelop, we're going to change what we need to. Because at the end of the day, the full recognition of value in this solution is through pull through sales by making us easier to do business with. We believe fully in that concept still. We believe we are light years ahead of any of our competition as it relates to where we stand in the development process. And we still believe in our goal of $1 billion of incremental sales by 2026, primarily through pull through business. Anything you want to add there, Peter?
Peter Jackson: You nailed it. Perfect.
Adam Baumgarten: Okay, great. Thanks, best of luck.
David Rush: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Group. Your line is open.
Steven Ramsey: Hi, good morning. Maybe to start with, on CapEx, the last couple of years, it seems like there, the delay of delivery has caused some push out on CapEx spend, supply chain and labor is a little bit better now. Do you feel like you can deliver on all the CapEx this year are more likely to deliver than prior years? And is there any delay embedded in this current guidance?
David Rush: Yeah, no thanks, Steven, you're right. We struggled to get what we've wanted. It's gotten a little better. There has not been nearly the relief in things like rolling stock that there have been in certain other categories. So that's still a source of, I would say strain. It's getting better. So my sense is this year's CapEx will be more achievable than last year. There's certainly a lot we want to do, and we're still optimistic that that will continue to free up as the year progresses.
Steven Ramsey: Okay, helpful. And then another question somewhat related to CapEx and labor as you plan for a downturn, but also want to be prepared for taking advantage of longer-term strength in housing, how do you think about holding on to labor for the long-term and building out capacity even if it's not fully soaked up in the next 12 or so months?
David Rush: Yes, so the capacity question is a good one. But we firmly believe in investing in the long-term. So we aren't changing our priorities as it relates to investments and capacity, specifically around value-added products. And in fact, we're trying to address kind of labor concerns a little bit through some of these investments. We have fully robotic lines in Georgia and Texas that we're still working through and trying to make sure and having some success with. And I think we have six to seven more on the books that we're going to add over the next two to three years. So we're seeing investments in technology and investments in automations as a way to really address both labor concerns we have today and in the future. So that will definitely not stop. As it relates to the core business, we've been really diligent about protecting our A and B players out in the marketplace and that's not going to change either because we see that as and what we're experiencing now is somewhat of a short-term scenario and over the long-term we want to come out of this guns and blazing on the other side with our best people. So that's kind of how we're approaching it right now.
Steven Ramsey: Excellent. Thank you.
David Rush: Thanks you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Jay McCanless with Wedbush. Your line is open in
Jay McCanless: Thanks. Good morning. Congrats Dave.
David Rush: Thank you, Jay.
Jay McCanless: Yes, you bet. So Slide 18, kudos on this new EBITDA presentation, very useful. But when you talk to your single-family builder customers, where do you think they're falling right now on this, these three ranges, negative 15 to negative 25 seems to be what we hear from a lot of people. But would love to hear what feedback you've been getting from your single-family customers on where they think 2023 falls out.
Peter Jackson: Yes, I'll start on that one and Dave can jump on. So the short answer is, they're all over the place. There's a lot of differential depending on what market you're in, the type of house you're selling, your exposure to customer versus SPAC. We talked a lot about east to west, how much harder this market has been, how rapid the downturn has been in certain markets. So it really is all across the board with people quite pessimistic and quite optimistic being, I would say equally common. So what we try to do is account for a few of those scenarios playing out, trying to think about what they balance out in our numbers to give you some sense of if we lean one way or lean the other, right? If Powell [ph] got leaning one way or leaning the other what might potentially play out. So it's, as you can imagine, that's been a tough one for us.
David Rush: Yes, I mean it's the reason you have three different scenarios there to pick from, right? You saw it as recently as coming out of the year in December, most builders were really pessimistic. Mortgage rates dipped down a couple 20, 40 basis points and all of a sudden the light turned on and everybody started showing up again. So it was really hard to just try to narrow it down to one narrow range and that's why we gave you the different scenarios. But the good thing is, we do know underlying demand remains strong, evidenced by how quickly people returned to the marketplace once they realized mortgage rates were at a rate that they felt like they could execute on the home purchase that they were after. So it was just additional proof that over the long-term home, underlying home demand is there. We've just got to make sure that we balance that affordability against that demand.
Jay McCanless: Got it, thank you. And then my second question in terms of M&A activity slowing down a little bit, kind of surprised by that because we've been hearing that the banks have been tightening up on land lending and tightened up generally on anything related to housing or are you just, or the potential target you're looking at, are they not feeling that pinch right now or did everyone have such a good two or three years that they can hold off for a little bit? May be a little more depth on that?
David Rush: I think it's more of what you just said, the latter part. I think they had a good couple year run. They're looking at fairly uncertain environment now and they're just not ready to get off the fence. I think as the year plays out and as we see more certainty as the year plays out around interest rates and mortgage rates and people can evaluate what the next 12 to 18 months look like, I think they'll jump back in and of course we're looking continuously throughout the time that we're there.
Jay McCanless: Okay, great, thanks. And then the last one I had, just, if you think about whatever metric you want to use, bid activity, quote, request, et cetera, you know, because we did see kind of a tale of two cities of mortgage rates in January and February. Can you talk about how business was in January of what it, what February looked like compared to January just given the spike higher that we did see in rates?
David Rush: Yes, I mean, I think what you described is accurate. It has been a bit erratic ups and downs. I don't know that there's a trend there broadly other than to say it's slower than last year and it's certainly a market that's trying to find its own. Yes, I don't think breaking it down at this point is going to help anybody, but it's certainly a market we're staying very close to operationally to ensure we are responding correctly to whatever is dealt.
Peter Jackson: Yeah, they only, the only thing I'd add is this is not a 2008, 2009 scenario, right? Demand over the long-term is still extremely positive and that demand is not speculative. It's for houses that they want to live in. So over the long haul we still feel pretty good, even though it's going to be a little choppy until we get our footing.
Jay McCanless: Sounds great. Thanks for taking my questions.
David Rush: Thank you.
Operator: Well, we will take our next question from Reuben Garner with The Benchmark Company. Your line is now open.
Reuben Garner: Thanks. Good morning everybody, and congrats Dave on the new role.
David Rush: Thanks.
Reuben Garner: So I had some technical difficulties, so I'm just going to ask one question, so I don't repeat anything and hopefully this one's not repetitive, but the reiteration of the $7 billion to $10 billion in deployable capital from the Investor Day, I think starts are probably likely off in the 30% range and I kind of looked at that deployable capital as kind of a free cash flow equivalent. And maybe that's wrong, but I just wanted to, I guess, clarify if that 7 to 10 is kind of the cash generation of the business. And if so, what kind of, what is the biggest thing that gives you confidence that you can still do that even though the star environment has clearly moved against you in such a big way?
Peter Jackson: Yes, no, that's a good question. So 2021 guide for those of you who don't remember, was $7 to $10 billion of deployable capital. And the way that was, think about that is 7 was at a onetime leverage at the end and 10 was at a two times leverage at the end. So that's one to two times the, the base business EBITDA from a leverage perspective. The short answer is, we've talked about this a lot and I'm not sure everybody gets it, but commodities for us is an important part of our business, but we make money regardless. We make a lot more money when the price is very high. So it becomes a bit of an option where if you have a high future price, you get a lot more cash flow into the business. And that's exactly what we experience in year one of our execution against our Investor Day targets. We had an incremental amount of cash that has put us far ahead of the pace necessary to make our number, even though you're right currently the forecast of where 2023 is going to be for starts as well below what we have built into our forecast, we talk about low single growth is being, or low single digit single family starts growth is being embedded into the model. But we're certainly in a very strong position with the start that we've had to be able to deliver on that regardless. And as I mentioned, we still expect to see healthy free cash flow delivery throughout the remaining years on top of that nice strong head start.
Reuben Garner: Thanks Peter. Congrats on the strong results guys and good luck on board.
David Rush: Thanks.
Operator: And we'll take our next question with Collin Verron with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Collin Verron: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to start at the, the fiscal year 2023 scenario of single family starts down 15% to 25%. The sales range there is $15 billion to $17 billion, which is only about a 10% decline in sales versus the 2022 base business sales of $17.7 billion you reported. Can you just talk about the factors there that would get you to that outperformance versus your largest end market?
David Rush: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think that's a -- I'm glad you're asking the question that way. I think it's the right way to think about it. The variables obviously are starts. Starts in single-family being the biggest impact on us, the other being the impact of M&A right? We've been acquisitive and the year-over-year growth from those acquisitions are certainly impactful in terms of how we're performing versus the prior year numbers. There's a bit of growth margin in there. The normalization will be a bit of a headwind, but we are also seeing some share growth that we've embedded in that as well. So that's an offset. So, but you know, across the board being able to offset a share, a portion of that single-family decline through the strength of our core business and, and the differentiated model is a healthy thing for us and we're certainly quite proud of it.
Collin Verron: Great. That's helpful color. And I guess my last question here is just on the productivity savings, you guys are expecting that $90 million to $110 million. Can you just give some examples of those productivity improvements that you're executing on here in 2023 and just how achievable those are in these different volume type environments?
David Rush: It actually, it goes hand-in-hand with what we need to do from a standpoint of competitiveness related to slower housing starts and increasing our customer service reducing cycle times. So a lot of it is around synergies that we realized from new M&A we've done over the last 18 months. Some of it is related to payroll productivity, getting more for less specifically within our delivery initiatives and some of our truck turnaround initiatives. Some are around manufacturing productivity as I mentioned since the merger board foot per man hour has gone up 22%. That is a combination of best practices across plants as we continue to acquire value-added plants from other parts of the country and integrate them into the BFS way of doing things. There's productivity savings there. We're always constantly reviewing our indirect spend. There's opportunities there. So we, we, we've probably got six to eight different initiatives that will fund that $90 million to $110 million and we're very confident in our ability to get there.
Collin Verron: Great, thank you for the color.
David Rush: Yes.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Michael Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Michael Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, Dave. Congrats on the new role. Thanks Mike. A couple follow ups. On the on the first quarter guide, the slide has a comment saying, there's a bullet point saying that sales and adjusted EBITDA include the expected benefit of price, commodity and margin impacts for the quarter. You know, I think Peter, as you articulated earlier there is a sharper commodity headwind from a top line standpoint in one queue. So can you just elaborate maybe a little bit on what that comment means and if it's possible to then split out if there is still some benefit on margins, what your base business for 1Q would be estimated at versus that 400 to 440 total?
David Rush: Yes, so I think probably the biggest challenge in this is, that there's no base business at a quarterly level that's, that's not a, it doesn't actually exist, so I'm not holding out on you in terms of talking about that number. You're right, there is a, there is a lot going on in the year-over-year comps and the ability to break out those pieces. Unfortunately it is generally driven by some detailed analytics. We have some top side assumptions, but I don't think they're particularly helpful to you in terms of insight. A lot of the year-over-year comparison from a commodities perspective is negative in the first half or far more negative in the first half than the second. Unfortunately just from a, the ability to break those pieces apart, so starts comp. So I think that our guide or our comment when we were given the guide saying that the first half is going be harder from a comparisons perspective unfortunately it's probably my best insight to offer for the, for the numbers this year.
Michael Dahl: Yes, okay. Yes, I guess it was just, since that comment says there's still benefits in there, but maybe that speaks to the margin, margins haven't quite normalized yet in 1Q.
David Rush: Yes, I've got…
Peter Jackson: We have a footnote that is really just trying to say it's all in, that was all.
Michael Dahl: Yes, I got you. Okay. And, and so my second question is, is kind of somewhat related, but just a two-parter on the full year scenarios. And so as a point of clarification, when you say commodity price my sense has been that a blend of lumber in OSP [ph], but can you correct me if I'm wrong there and, and hit the starting point. Okay. So then just for a frame of reference if we're looking at a blended price year to date, you know, it, it seems like that's kind of in the mid three hundreds, maybe oscillating between mid-300 s and high 300 s. Is that a fair characterization of where you're at year-to-date on that blend?
David Rush: Yes, I mean, if I just talk to Randall Langs, I think that's right between 350 and 400 is the range a little bit below our base business assumption in terms of how the year has started, but it's early.
Michael Dahl: Yes, lot of changes on, on that on a week-to-week or day-to-day basis. Okay. And, and then, so when we think about the range of scenarios. Obviously you've spoken to the gross margin dynamics a bit and SG&A is going to flex up or down a decent amount depending on if you're like, down 10 versus down a 30, right? But when you think about putting this range together in terms of how you get down to the ultimate EBITDA number, which part is the bigger swing factor in in your models? Is the gross margin line pretty steady normalizing down and the swing factor in EBITDA margin is mostly SG&A flexing or is there a different mix as you get kind of progressively lower on the scale of these scenarios?
Peter Jackson: That's a really good question. You know, we're in the mid-20s, or sorry, low 20s for SG&A as a percent of sales and it's about 70% variable. You're talking about 6% that's in that fixed bucket. You probably think about the impact of margins, obviously that falls like price all the way through the bottom line, so that's very impactful. I guess off the top of my head they seem pretty comparable. I actually don't have a hard answer for you on that, but I think you're right. Those are two of the major components. What happens when sales decline and how much the leverage can we offset with, you know, rescaling the business. And then how does pricing fall through you know, the more aggressive any potential downturn might end up being. We do expect it to be harder on both margins and commodity prices.
Michael Dahl: Got it, okay. Thanks Peter.
Peter Jackson: Sure, thanks Mike. Good. We will take our last question from Alex Rygiel - B. Riley. Your line is now open.
Alex Rygiel: Thank you. You referenced a slowdown in the average daily sales sort of in December and January. Can you quantify that?
Peter Jackson: Well, I mean there's two pieces to it. One of them is the normal seasonality. We do see generally speaking about 20% less sales in the depth of winter than we do in the peak of summer. It's a lot more than that obviously in the seasonal markets, but we're also seeing the down trend of sort of orders generating starts, generating sales from us on new houses. So that decline has been pretty consistent as one might expect, we would expect to lap the peak probably Q2.
Alex Rygiel: And then excluding commodity products are you seeing suppliers reduce their prices yet?
Peter Jackson: More rumors than actions, but there are a couple of categories where they're, it looks like it's probably going to happen and will stick. For the most part though, it's been less increases or no increases.
David Rush: Yes, they're still struggling as well with labor and what they're having to pay for costs of labor. But at the end of the day, the normal dynamics around supply and demand are going to run out and people are going to go after share, they're going to do it with whatever availability they have. It just hasn’t been widespread at this point.
Alex Rygiel: Thank you very much.
David Rush: All right, thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-08 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Neese : Thank you, Todd. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Flitman, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our third quarter results for 2022. The third quarter press release and investor presentation for today's call are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during the call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Flitman : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Our strong third quarter results reflect the fundamental strength of our business, including our value-added products and services that resonate with our customers and our consistent execution. We are winning new business and strengthening existing customer relationships by consistently providing customers tailored solutions and excellent service, which collectively make us a partner of choice. In the third quarter, we delivered a 6.9% increase in core organic sales, including nearly 20% growth in our higher margin value-added products. That performance, combined with our investments in core operations, our relentless focus on cost controls and acceleration of productivity helped us produce record adjusted EBITDA. On Slide 3, I would like to remind you of our long-term strategic priorities: expanding organically in value-added products and services, driving operational excellence, continuing to build our high-performing culture and growing through strategic tuck-in acquisitions. On Slide 4, we outline how we continue to execute against our strategy this quarter. Specifically, we delivered record results in the quarter by increasing our value-added product sales. We leveraged our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System, leading to $33 million in productivity savings in the quarter. We deployed additional capital toward tuck-in acquisitions as highlighted by our recent purchases. Since the BMC merger, we have now deployed $2 billion of capital to strategic M&A. Through October, we have repurchased $2 billion in common stock this year. We still have slightly more than $500 million remaining on our current $2 billion share repurchase authorization and we will continue to look for favorable opportunities to repurchase shares, considering market dynamics and our ongoing commitment to maximize long-term value creation. Since we launched our buyback program 15 months ago, we have invested approximately $3.8 billion in repurchasing roughly 61 million shares, retiring nearly 30% of our common shares outstanding. Let's turn to our third quarter results on Slide 5. We delivered approximately $6 billion in net sales. Core organic sales in value-added products grew by nearly 20%, while single-family sales increased almost 2%. Repair, Remodel and Other increased over 30% and multi-family increased 16%. R&R and Other growth was mainly attributable to a weaker prior year when supply constraints limited our ability to support growth in this segment. Multi-family was driven by solid organic growth and a strong backlog of projects. Once again, value-added products drove our growth story, further validating that we are well positioned to be the supplier of choice for these products. During the third quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA with a margin of 20.3%. These results were driven by our strong execution, share gains, ongoing productivity initiatives and pricing discipline in a market that has been supply constrained, but is returning to normal. Turning to M&A on Slide 6. In addition to our focus on profitable core organic growth, we continue to execute tuck-in acquisitions that are aligned with our strategy. Since the start of the quarter, we have completed four acquisitions that collectively advance our objective of expanding our geographic footprint in key markets, enhancing our value-added portfolio to better serve our customers and diversifying our end market exposure. In September, we closed our acquisition of Trussway, which expands our footprint in multifamily trusses, accelerating our growth in the Southwest and Southeast. We also acquired Fulcrum Building Group in September, providing us with pro contractor-focused lumberyards, millwork facilities and additional resources in the high-growth markets of the Gulf Coast. In July, we closed our acquisition of HomCo Lumber and Hardware, which enhanced our footprint in Flagstaff, Arizona. Then in October, we acquired Pima Door & Supply, which provides us with dedicated millwork capabilities in Phoenix. These acquisitions represent our ability to acquire high-return assets that will boost our long-term value proposition. We're excited to welcome the HomCo, Trussway, Fulcrum and Pima teams with their longstanding customer relationships and track records of profitable growth to the BFS family. We have spent approximately $630 million on M&A so far this year. The highly fragmented nature of our industry supports our ambition to invest on average $500 million per year for the next several years while deploying capital in a disciplined manner. As we navigate near-term market dynamics, we will continue to be acquisitive where valuations make sense. We remain vigilant stewards of capital to ensure we continue to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our pioneering role in the digital transformation of the homebuilding industry. The end of the third quarter marks just over one year since the completion of our Paradigm and Apollo acquisitions. The original Paradigm business continues to perform exceptionally well and we are investing in the long-term growth of that business. On the homebuilder software side, we remain committed to executing our development plan to build out of our digital sales team and integration with BFS operations. As we highlighted last quarter, we successfully integrated our structural design, material takeoff and visualization models into one streamlined process for our pilot customers. We now have 18 new digital sales representatives in place with more than 330 customer meetings held during the third quarter. And we are excited to tell you about a new technology that we will be introducing to the marketplace at the beginning of 2023, our new mybldr.com website which will provide our small builder customers easy-to-use digital tools to virtually design and build their next home and engage with key operational functions, including planning, specifying products, ordering materials and budgeting. We believe our launch of this platform will help us grow the BFS brand and build on our momentum as the supplier of choice in the homebuilding industry. Turning to productivity. In addition to the $55 million of carryover synergies, we have delivered $73 million in savings so far in 2022 and we expect to exceed $100 million in productivity savings for the full year as we drive improvement projects and leverage our BFS 1-TEAM operating system. Last quarter, we outlined the increased resilience of our business model, and we believe these are important points to reiterate in this current environment of macro uncertainty. In the scenario of a challenged market where housing starts are down significantly, we have many levers to pull, as shown on Slide 8 that will allow us to quickly respond, including effectively managing costs through our variable expense structure to flex expenses with demand, optimizing capacity and further streamlining our footprint, reducing discretionary spend, accelerating productivity projects and taking appropriate workforce actions. Our scale, combined with these initiatives, allow us to operate in a much more proactive and effective manner compared to the last recessionary cycle 15 years ago. As we have all seen in the public builder announcements, the commentary has suggested a 30% to 40% decline in order rates on average. While we had very strong third quarter results, we have begun to see a slowdown in average daily sales as higher mortgage rates and declining consumer confidence are weighing on demand and commodity prices. Our September and preliminary October volumes were down low double digits versus a year ago, amid a significant decline in early-stage build products. As such, we quickly pulled a few levers to curb our costs, including bringing our inventory in line with evolving sales levels, putting a moratorium on nonessential travel, reducing headcount and overtime to align with volumes and rationalizing facilities. This work is never easy, and these are difficult decisions with respect to our affected team members, but we must be responsive to the market deceleration and best position the company to navigate this environment. We are proactively managing into the downturn, and we are prepared to act decisively to protect and resize the business as necessary. We anticipate that the operating environment will remain challenging for the foreseeable future, but we are committed to strategically accelerating our leading market position, allocating capital towards value-generating organic and inorganic growth opportunities and delivering on our overall value proposition. We are confident that no matter the operating environment, we will continue to execute well, outpace the market and create long-term value for our shareholders. As laser-focused as Builders FirstSource is on making fundamentally sound business decisions that drive value for our shareholders, we are equally devoted to supporting the communities where our team members and customers reside, especially in times of need. The past several weeks have been difficult for many due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Ian. Our hearts go out to all the individuals and families who have been impacted. We were relieved to learn that our team members are safe but saddened that a few of them suffered catastrophic damage to their homes. We stand behind each of them as they work to rebuild. In recent weeks, we've donated over $500,000 to humanitarian organizations supporting the Hurricane Ian relief efforts. The organizations Builders FirstSource has made contributions to include the American Red Cross, Samaritan's Purse and BFS Cares, the company's emergency assistance program that helps team members who are facing hardship immediately after a natural disaster. Moreover, I want to recognize our countless team members who have selflessly gone above and beyond to support those displaced by Hurricane Ian, with special gratitude going to our team members in Wausau, Wisconsin, who partnered with our local community to send a semi-truck filled with supplies and essentials, more than 1,500 miles to Fort Myers, Florida. It's times like these that we be truly humbled to lead such a caring and supportive organization. I extend my heartfelt appreciation to these exceptional team members and to all those individuals and organizations offering support on the ground and assisting with the relief efforts. We stand ready to support these communities and help them rebuild. I will now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our third quarter financial results.
Peter Jackson : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter. We generated a record quarterly free cash flow of $1.4 billion and repurchased $658 million of our common stock during the quarter, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our financial performance reflects consistent execution, disciplined operational management and alignment with our strategic priorities. We are operating with a proactive mindset and have enhanced our already strong expense management processes amid a challenging operating environment. Our fortress balance sheet, low net leverage profile and substantial liquidity provide us with the flexibility to navigate a dynamic but decelerating market. All the while, we are maintaining focus on creating long-term shareholder value. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our third quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on capital deployment. And finally, I'll discuss our guidance for full year 2022. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter performance on Slide 9. We generated net sales of $5.8 billion for the quarter, which increased 4.6% compared to the prior year period. Core organic sales in the value-added products category grew by 19.9%, reflecting our work to enhance our product mix and meet customer needs. Gross profit was $2 billion, a 17.6% increase year-over-year. Gross margin increased 390 basis points to 35% as we increased sales in our value-added product categories and continued pricing discipline in what has been a supply-constrained market, but is returning to normal. SG&A grew 14.3% to $1 billion, with about half of that increase driven by two factors: additional operating expenses from locations acquired within the last 12 months; and higher wages and variable compensation costs as a result of increased net sales and profitability. The remainder of the increase was driven by fuel-related expenses and strategic initiatives such as IT, productivity and digital investments. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 150 basis points to 17.4%. We remain focused on the importance of controlling expenses and driving EBITDA improvement. We executed successfully during the third quarter as adjusted EBITDA increased 20.1% primarily driven by net sales growth, a higher mix of sales from value-added product categories and disciplined pricing. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 260 basis points from the prior year period to 20.3%. Adjusted net income was $814 million or $5.20 of adjusted EPS compared to adjusted net income of $697 million or $3.39 of adjusted EPS in the prior year period. The 16.8% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by an increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income tax and SG&A expense. Now let's turn to our strong balance sheet and liquidity on Slide 11. Our third quarter cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion, while capital expenditures were $84 million. We generated robust free cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion, primarily driven by core organic sales growth, increased profitability due to effective pricing and cost management and disciplined working capital management. Free cash flow yield was 33.3%, while operating cash flow return on invested capital was 39.8% for the trailing 12 months ended September 30. Moving to capital deployment. As Dave mentioned, this year, we have put approximately $630 million to work through six acquisitions. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 11.2 million shares for $658 million at an average stock price of $58.57. To put this in perspective, the repurchase equates to $1.24, nearly 70% of the $1.81 adjusted EPS change. In addition, we have repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares so far in Q4 for $112 million at an average stock price of $61.54. We are committed to prudent capital deployment, and we will continue to look for favorable opportunities to repurchase shares. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of September 30 was approximately 0.7x our last 12 months adjusted EBITDA and approximately 1.4x our estimated 2022 base business EBITDA, well within our stated target of 1x to 2x. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. At quarter end, our total liquidity was $1.3 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion in borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and approximately $100 million of cash on hand. We had a fantastic quarter. We achieved strong metrics across the board, deployed capital and enhanced our overall leadership in our industry. I want to thank our entire team for their skill and dedication. Turning to Slide 12. We continue to believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology. This approach showcases the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity volatility. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes normalized margins and static commodity prices at $400 per thousand board feet. We are maintaining our full year guidance on our base business sales and adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 13. I would like to discuss our full year base business and total company outlook as we enter the final months of 2022. We expect results to decelerate over the balance of the fourth quarter amid higher rates, normal seasonality, declining commodity prices and the cooling housing market. While we are seeing slower single-family starts, we expect our results through the end of the year to be supported by the substantial backlog of homes under construction. Our base business guide on net sales remains unchanged at 8% to 12% or $17.2 billion at the midpoint. Our base business EBITDA guide also remains unchanged. We continue to expect growth of 18% to 22% or $2.2 billion at the midpoint. Given we have less than two months left in the year, today, we are also providing guidance for the full year 2022 including total net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. This will provide you with our anticipated full year total company performance. We expect full year total company net sales to be $22.5 billion to $23 billion or approximately 13% to 16% over our 2021 net sales of $19.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion or approximately 35% to 42% over our 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is forecast to be 18.5% to 19.5% or approximately 310 basis points to 410 basis points over the 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%. We now expect full year 2022 free cash flow of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, an increase from our prior range of $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion. The improved free cash flow forecast is based on our higher profit outlook on total results and the timing of commodity price fluctuations. Our 2022 outlook is based on several assumptions, which are outlined in the earnings release and presentation. Given inflation, higher mortgage rates and cancellation rates in the double digits, we expect full year single-family starts across our geographies to be down low double digits. We continue to expect multifamily starts to be up in the low double digits and R&R to be up in the low to mid-single digits. Regarding near-term demand, multifamily is gaining momentum and will improve diversification of our mix in coming quarters. CapEx guidance for 2022 is $275 million at the midpoint versus our prior estimate of $300 million due to continued supply chain delays. As we begin to close the books on 2022 and are in the midst of finalizing next year's budget, we thought it might be helpful to provide a reminder of our ability to weather a challenging operating environment. We will provide our full 2023 demand outlook during our Q4 call in February. However, in the spirit of transparency and to give you a high-level sense of what our business is capable of, I'd like to provide you an illustrative example of single-family starts declining 20% to 800,000 next year from approximately 1 million in 2022. In that example, we believe we can sustain a double-digit EBITDA margin and deliver solid cash flow of over $1 billion, given our differentiated platform, consistent execution and disciplined operational management. We are operating with a proactive mindset and have enhanced our already strong expense management processes to tightly control costs. Our premier positioning and robust operating platform have provided us with line of sight to more than $3 billion in free cash flow this year, a fortress balance sheet with no long-term debt maturities until 2030, and over $1.3 billion of liquidity to outperform into 2023 and beyond. With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave for his closing remarks.
Dave Flitman : Thanks, Peter. I want to close by reiterating the underlying strengths of our business that will enable us to gain share in any environment. We are the market leader in a highly fragmented industry. We have a growing portfolio of value-added products and solutions that resonate with our customers, making us a partner of choice. We have a diversified revenue stream and are constantly optimizing our capacity and operations for long-term growth. We are laser-focused on operational excellence, which adds to our competitive advantage. We take a disciplined approach to organic and inorganic growth with a long-term focus. We generate significant free cash flow which enables financial optionality in times of uncertainty, and we consistently generate solid returns while executing our long-term strategy. Our industry is clearly experiencing deceleration versus the prior year, but we are not discouraged. We are confident in our ability to navigate through any market environment and we will remain proactive in implementing our downturn playbook to streamline costs and stay close to our customers and supply partners. We will continue to execute through near-term market volatility while keeping our sights on our long-term goals, our core values and our operating principles as our guidepost.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we have a very strong, seasoned and highly experienced leadership team that has succeeded through many prior cycles and knows how to deliver compounded shareholder value over the long term. Thank you again for joining us today. Todd, let's please open the call now for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matthew Bouley of Barclays.
Matthew Bouley : Congrats on the results. So the comments you made at the end there about sustaining a double-digit EBITDA margin in a scenario of 800,000 single-family starts. If I look at the Q4 guide, for example, I think you're implying something like a 70% decremental margin on EBITDA. I know we're kind of in that period of commodity normalization and loosening supply chain. But how does that decremental for Q4 kind of breakout between commodity and non-commodity? And then just kind of give us some comfort around what that decremental could look like in 2023 that sort of allows you to sustain that double-digit EBITDA margin?
Peter Jackson : Sure. Yes. No, that's a good question. I think what you're highlighting there is what we're seeing in the market in terms of a confluence of numbers happening at the same time. So if we think about what Q4 normally is just in a traditional year, it's a decelerating time for us due to seasonality. We generally see a decline in commodity prices in those fall periods. And overall, the business is sort of buckling down for the win. This year, you overlay the market environment where you see a slowing market, you see a lot of the supply chain returning to normal and you see commodities decelerating into that as well as the seasonal decline. And so the trend, if you compare it to last year, obviously, is in the opposite direction in all of those categories. So what we're anticipating in that slower market is that decline in commodities, the decline in sales, some retrenching of the gross margins. We talked about that, I think, extensively over the last or so in terms of a return to normal over time. We're beginning to see all of those things play out. So that's really the dynamic in the fourth quarter. We've considered all of that in our discussion about where we think we would be at with 800,000 starts. We think that the normalized commodity prices, our ability to manage through the market as well as the strength of our business and our mix really will put us in a position to still be in that double-digit EBITDA space, considering all those factors.
Matthew Bouley : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks for that, Peter. And then secondly, I wanted to ask about pricing. You guys mentioned a couple of times at the top that there has been pricing discipline in a supply-constrained market, but that market is now returning to less supply-constrained. I think if I play with your implied Q4 guide, I take what you said at the top around volumes tracking down low double digits. I could be wrong, but it seems like you might be implying that core pricing might also be negative in Q4. And please correct me if I'm wrong there. But just how are you guys thinking about price deflation on non-commodity products? And are you starting to feel more pushback from homebuilder customers there?
Peter Jackson : Well, I'm going to give my customers plenty of credit. We always see pushback, right? I think that the dynamic in terms of the margins and the way that we're seeing margins flow through as a result of supply is, as you'd expect, right? As more supply becomes available, becomes more competitive, and that's what we've baked in. We do think there will be a bit of gross margin progressing back towards normal. We won't get there in the fourth quarter. But certainly, heading that direction. Competition is increasing, as you would expect, and we're ready for that. We're ready for the battle as part of kind of who we are and what we do. I'm not sure that there's a lot of detail that I can provide you, now a lot of pullback from vendors in terms of their pricing pass-through. It slowed down a bit in terms of increases, but we haven't seen cuts in any material way, but that could happen.
Dave Flitman : Yes. I think that last point is an important one there, Matt. I think the volumes, the allocations that we saw for the last couple of years have pretty much gone away. But to Peter's point, outside of the commodities, we have not seen price concessions from our suppliers to this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc.
Trey Grooms : Good morning, everyone. And I have to also say congrats on the great performance in the quarter.
Dave Flitman : Thanks, Trey.
Trey Grooms : So kind of just circling back for a little bit more clarity on that double-digit EBITDA margin you're referring to in that kind of single-family housing start around 800,000, Peter. And then also kind of going back to your long-term gross margin guide, 27%. I mean, you've talked about kind of margins progressing towards normal. Is that 27% kind of the -- if we kind of triangulate into that double digit, it seems like that's kind of the number you're pointing to in that environment. Am I off there? Or in that environment, is there a difference? And how we should be thinking about that long-term number?
Peter Jackson : So the two pieces. The 800,000 is just an example. We want to give you a sense of where we think that double-digit EBITDA can be defended. This is all forecast. I don't want anybody writing this on stone tablets or anything, but it's what we think. I think we've got a good business. We know we've looked at our numbers six ways from Sunday, and we feel good about where we think we'll be even into a modestly down market. When it comes to the gross margins, we talked about 27% plus, somewhere north of 27% of normalized gross margin that we feel good about spending. There's a lot of question marks still about where things will settle out with margins given the dynamics in the marketplace. Certainly, it will be more challenging than it has been over the last year or two just because of the increased competition and the slower starts, but there's still reason to believe that improved discipline in the market, improved work within our organization about how we think about pricing will allow us to maintain a level north of 27%. Certainly not ready to give kind of refined guidance there. But a movement back from 35% towards that 27% is what we continue to point to and what we expect to see, both in Q4 but also in that sort of down 20% start -- single-family starts metric that we threw out there.
Dave Flitman: I would just add, just on the double-digit EBITDA margin, I think you'll recall that neither legacy company had double-digit EBITDA margins at those sort of start levels. And I think we've been talking a lot since the merger about the strength of the platform that we've built and the differentiation that we have, and we're confident that we will see that play out through the cycle.
Trey Grooms : Yes. No, that's -- I got that very loud and clear, and you guys are executing well with all of that. So hats off there. And on that, I guess the $100 million in productivity savings that you're talking about for the full year, how volume or sales-dependent is that? And I guess how much of that would be sustainable in a year where if we were looking at that kind of housing start environment?
Dave Flitman : I'll start, and then I'll flip it over to Peter. When we outlined our forward projections and our financial plan at the Investor Day a year ago, we said importantly that we were targeting over the long term 3% to 5% in fixed cost productivity. And what you're starting to see as that play out, and we started slowly through the integration of the merger and we put those synergies behind us, and we've stepped on the gas on operational excellence, and we continue to build momentum. So the clearest answer that I can give you is we believe we are building fundamental strengths in that area of the business. There's lots of opportunity to continue to optimize what we do and get more efficient, and we're confident that we're going to move towards that long-term target over time.
Peter Jackson : Yes. And I guess all I would add there, Trey, is that while there will certainly be volume adjustments to certain items that are volume-driven, these are operational changes, right? We're tracking them as a finance organization to ensure that there's real P&L impact and things that have changed before and after. We're not just tracing volume improvements and telling you the leverage number. These are changes in operations, process, staffing expenses that you contract because we've done things differently to get rid of waste and improve our efficiency.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Dahl : So Dave, Peter, thanks for the additional color so far. One more follow-up on the '23 sensitivity. I appreciate it's a very high level at this point. If I think about, as you acknowledged, builder orders down 30% to 40% in recent months. The lag that, that hits you with in a starts environment of 800,000 or down 20 next year, it's possible that the lagged impact to you as potentially even worse. And so does that sensitivity contemplate that? Or I guess, maybe ask the somewhat different way. That's the level. It sounds like you're comfortable saying you can defend double-digit margins. What type of decline would it take in your sensitivity to drive margins below double digits?
Dave Flitman : Yes. I think it's a little early for us to dig in, Mike, on 2023. We certainly -- we're in the midst of our budgeting process here. We'll finish that up before the end of the year, as you'd expect. We certainly don't want to get ahead of our customers on any projections. As you know, it's a challenging market, and it's changing day by day. And we just gave that example as illustrative in the confidence. And as I said on the last question, we're in a different realm of capabilities in this organization and this company we've built than we were anytime in the past. So that was really illustrative and really didn't mean to opine on what starts may be next year. It's too early to tell.
Michael Dahl : Got it. Okay. My second question, just on the capital allocation. Obviously, you've got free cash flow to support your goals this year and really nice buyback activity. You have leverage on the base business ticking up a bit. If you're looking out to next year and anticipating some core declines in the business, while you may throw off some strong free cash flow, it seems like it's possible that leverage could keep ticking up towards the upper end of your 1x to 2x range. So how are you thinking about the relative aggressiveness of your buyback program? You've got funding earmarked for M&A. You've been really aggressive on the buyback. Is it time to toggle that back a little bit? Or any thoughts on how you're looking at the buyback going forward?
Dave Flitman : Sure. Thanks for the question. So look, our capital allocation priorities have not and will not change through the downturn. We'll invest first in the future growth of the company, inside the company. We'll look at M&A next and we'll return capital to shareholders as our third priority. However, even in the M&A front, our pipeline is still very strong, valuations have to make sense, and the same thing around share repurchases. So we, to this point, Mike, have been very disciplined stewards of capital. We will be disciplined stewards of capital through the cycle. We've got a bulletproof balance sheet. We're very comfortable with that. Sure, to your point, our leverage may tick up some. We believe our cash flow will remain strong, and we're going to do the right things with our cash.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ketan Mamtora of BMO Capital Markets.
Ketan Mamtora : Thank you. And congrats on a strong quarter. Peter, coming back to the example that you gave and whatever starts drop we may see next year, whether it is 10, 15, 20, whatever that number may be, but I'm just curious kind of how does that impact your base business EBITDA of $2.2 billion. It's not the margin, but just the absolute EBITDA. Should we think about it, with single-family as 3/4 of your total business, should we think about it as a similar drop in the base business EBITDA, should be greater, should be less? Any sort of high-level perspective on that will be helpful.
Peter Jackson : Sure. Yes. No, that's a great question. If you think about our base business, it really is representative of the core of our operations and how it is functioning at the combined entity post-merger, but more importantly, through the cycle. So it is fair to expect we would see sales on the base business move based on starts. It's the best predictor of our business in the long run. Single-family starts, multi-family starts representing probably a combined 80% roughly of our overall sales. As you think about the dynamics within the space more broadly, there has also been, and we've talked about this a lot, a pretty significant impact on gross margins due to the supply chain issues. So certainly, we would expect gross margins to normalize a bit. If you think about the -- if you implement, as you described, a number of scenarios around single-family starts or all starts declining and you account for gross margins, there is some delevering that is going to happen in the overall business. That's the nature of the math, right? We'll still be healthy. We'll still be very strong. but there is going to be a smaller amount of EBITDA to be gained on a smaller business with more competitive gross margins. So that's broadly how I would describe it. What I would say are the counterpoints to that is the increased investments we're making in value add, the share that we're gaining and the productivity improvements we're making in the business just to be better at what we do. So there's a balance there. That's what we're working through right now and are planning for '23 to be able to give you better dialed-in numbers.
Ketan Mamtora : No, this is great. Very helpful. And then one other follow-up question. So obviously, we are starting to see cancellation rates tick up, starts come down. But I'm just curious, how long do you think it will take for builders to work through sort of the current backlog of homes that are there? Is it sort of a one to two quarter event or less or more?
Peter Jackson : That's a great question. I really wish I knew the answer to that. On one hand, I think we've seen really nice trends in terms of those numbers of units, those homes under construction in total stay quite high, which indicates there's some cushion there. The counterpoint is a little bit what we alluded to in the script today, we have seen a bigger decline in the early products. So say that another way, if you think about the construction cycle of a home, you're going to start with your framing lumber, you move to trusses, then windows and doors, we're seeing bigger declines on the earlier products which would indicate that we're starting to build through some of that unit under construction backlog. Timing of it, tough to say. I think the most common forecast that I've heard would be Q4, Q1, we would burn through the bulk of it, but I think it's just too early to say.
Ketan Mamtora : Got it. That's very helpful. I will turn it over. Good luck in the back half and into 2023.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Adam Baumgarten of Zelman & Associates.
Adam Baumgarten : Just going back to the September and October volume trends, maybe give us a sense for how the value-add business performed? Did it continue to outperform the overall business in a down environment?
Peter Jackson : It did. It did. There's a few reasons for that. I mean, obviously, we've invested in the value-add part of our business over the last year. So both in the form of internal investments, new capacity, better facilities, better automation, better productivity, but also in the inorganic side with the acquisitions we paid. Both of those have done well and then you layer on the other components, right, windows, doors and millwork, that's an area we've made a lot of investments in over the past really decade and that has yielded some really nice performance and ability to compete. So our focus in those areas is paying off. We think it will continue to do that. Now that isn't to say that we won't still face challenges in a market where there's fewer starts, but we think we're very, very well positioned to compete to win in that environment.
Adam Baumgarten : Got it. And then maybe just some additional color on mybldr.com that launch that's coming up. It sounds like it's targeted towards smaller builders. Is that an incremental opportunity to the $1 billion that you guys have sized over time? And then maybe just maybe the market opportunity for that launch just in and of itself would be helpful.
Dave Flitman : Yes. Very good question. And no, it's not incremental to the $1 billion. As we said, we bought a platform that was -- we were very excited about with Paradigm, but it was very narrowly focused again on window and door manufacturers in the retail side of the business. And as we said, we've been investing heavily in the development of that platform to build it out to be able to handle the whole house design and configuration. We're hitting a major milestone with that launch. And as we've said from the beginning, we are targeting this at the small builders first. So consistent with what we said, we're excited about that milestone. And there will be more to come over time. But 15, 16 months in, with the heavy lifting we have and continue to have on the development side, and we're excited to bring that forward.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Collin Verron of Jefferies.
Collin Verron : I just wanted to start back with your illustrative 20% decline in starts environment. Can you just provide some more color about the organic sales declines and the decremental margin assumptions that go into that? I ask just because you're taking share, especially from the value-add products, there could be some changes in core pricing. So there seems to be a lot of moving pieces here and beyond just the single-family starts. So any color there would be helpful.
Dave Flitman : Colin. Yes, I mean, to be honest, the goal wasn't to try and get into the dissection of the sub numbers. I think that my comments that -- to Ketan a little while ago are certainly applicable here and that we do anticipate there to be declines on a number of different areas. We think starts will go down. We think commodities will continue to revert back to that long-term average. And we think there'll be some regression to the historical norms in margins. Beginning to see that in the third and fourth quarters and certainly expect that to play out through the year. But it's an environment where even with those pretty significant slowdown estimates included in the metric, we're still at double-digit margins. We're still in a position where we've got a market-leading platform where we've got investments in value-add and digital and improvements internally and our productivity is helping to lead us through a very difficult time with a very profitable business. So it's certainly inclusive of those factors. You're right, and we'll have a lot more detail for you as we get into the February announcement where we give the guide on '23.
Collin Verron : Okay. And then can you just touch on the M&A pipeline and your strategy here just given the weakening macro environment, what kind of purchase multiples you're seeing in the market and maybe how that's different from history?
Dave Flitman : Well, we've still got a very strong pipeline as we said for a while now. Valuation becomes the issue at times like this, right? And we've executed so far, 13 acquisitions since the merger, all we believe with high level of discipline on valuation. And we will continue to do that through the downturn. I expect that things may slow down a bit here for a while. And dependent upon the length and the severity of the downturn, the pipeline may get more active through the course of time. But again, I just want you to hear and understand we have been and will remain disciplined on valuations.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Reuben Garner of The Benchmark Company.
Reuben Garner : Good morning, everybody, and congrats on the results in the quarter. So the value add versus the commodity or non-value-added businesses, can you talk about what you're seeing on the margin front so far in this quarter or towards the end of the last quarter? Have the value-added margins kind of held in better and commodities kind of already returned to "normal" or have they kind of progressed in a similar manner?
Peter Jackson : Yes. So good question. The margins have, as you did maybe expect, begun to return to normal, but led more by the commodity side than by the value-add side, right? Historically speaking, value-add, prices and margins are a bit stickier and commodities are just -- they move more quickly. They respond more quickly just given the volatility of that cost category in general. We would expect that to continue, right? We would expect it over time to normalize quicker. We just haven't gotten all the way yet. We've got a little bit of it.
Reuben Garner : Got it. And then for the scenario that you provided for next year as well, I guess you mentioned facility rationalization. Any more detail that you can go into there? Is that mothballing of manufacturing capabilities? Is that just consolidation of distribution footprint? Is it none of those? And what kind of, I guess, savings are embedded in that outlook? You mentioned making some cost cuts to kind of weather the storm. Is there any kind of dollar amount that you could throw out there?
Dave Flitman : Yes. I would just say that to this point, from the peak, we've taken out about 2,600 of our headcount and that peak being really at the end of the second quarter, early in the third quarter. We have rationalized or in the process of rationalizing 17 facilities. And to your question, I just want to be clear, we are not taking out manufacturing capacity. This is more consolidation primarily in some of the smaller markets where we may have redundant assets that given the last two years and the strength of the market, we have not needed to shut those facilities down. In fact, we've needed all that capacity that we've had, but times are different now. And so I really don't want to quantify any of that at this point. But as I said on the call, we will be proactive and decisive in actions given what happens in the marketplace.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes of Truist.
Keith Hughes : A question on multi-families. Continues to be strong as you discussed in your guidance. I guess how long of a backlog or how long of a view do you have a multifamily continuing in anywhere near this kind of level?
Peter Jackson : Keith, yes, thank you. Multifamily is a bright spot. I mean, as we've talked about, there is a need for housing people need a place to be, and it would appear that with the slowdown in single-family starts, multifamily is certainly staying strong. And we have a great franchise in that space. The ability to invest is something that we've stayed committed to our existing multifamily business on truss and millwork we added to that with both Panel Truss and Trussway this year with acquisitions. And right now, we've got over of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of backlog in that space that we know we're going to be able to meet throughout the year.  Certainly feel good about the strength and the profitability of that business and as we bring the teams together and integrate them into a consolidated Builders FirstSource team, we're excited about what they're able to deliver. So we're certainly very optimistic in that space.
Keith Hughes : And on multifamily, activity planning and start activity slows down. What's kind of -- how long it take to show up in your numbers?
Peter Jackson : Generally, you're talking about multifamily being a substantially longer lead time. We usually say around nine months. Yes, it's usually around nine months versus 30 to 60 days probably on the single-family side. It does vary a bit, but that's a good average.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel.
Stanley Elliott : A quick question on the Slide 8. You talked about some of the downside actions you guys are taking. With the double-digit EBITDA margin framework that you've laid out, is that saying that you basically need to complete all of these downside actions? Or can you hit those targets where you are? And I was thinking more just from a leverage standpoint into next year, should things decelerate from here?
Dave Flitman : We didn't lead those actions directly to those double-digit EBITDA margin. That was more illustrative and given you an indication of the levers that we have to pull, depending upon how severe the downturn gets. And the Harvey Balls there just show you that we're fairly early into acting on all that capability. So I wouldn't think about those as directly linked. But certainly, where the downturn gets severe, we will pull more and more leverage as time goes on.
Stanley Elliott : And I guess switching gears on the automation side. You talked about some high-return CapEx projects. Could you help us kind of where you are? I mean I saw the CapEx guide come down modestly. What are expectations for some of those projects? And how should we think about them at next year?
Dave Flitman : Well, as we have been, we continue to invest heavily in automating our manufacturing facilities. We think that's the right long-term play. We think labor is going to be constrained in this industry and particularly skilled labor, which we need in our manufacturing facilities for a long time to come. We talked about our first fully automated four truss line that we started up in Georgia last quarter. And at that time, we said we had eight more coming over the next couple of years, and we are fully committed to that and looking to future automation potential across our facilities. That's the right long-term play in any market. We will continue outside of maintenance of our facilities and refreshing our rolling stock. That is the single biggest area we'll deploy capital into the company going forward.
Peter Jackson : And sadly, given the strength of our balance sheet, we have the ability to do that even in a slower market. And I think taking advantage of those windows where we can actually get access to some of this equipment that we need, it is the right way to manage for the long term, right? We haven't been able to get all the trucks, we haven't been able to get all the equipment we need, but we do have the ability to continue to refresh the fleet and do what we need to, to have that equipment when we need it even right now when things are slowing down.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Yinger of D.A. Davidson.
Kurt Yinger : Just on the gross margin front, has the speed at which you've seen that start to normalize, I guess, in the latter part of Q3 and into Q4 surprised you at all? And then is that 27% kind of dependent upon a certain start assumption?
Peter Jackson : Thank you for the question. So I think that the 27% is in a band of starts. I don't know if it's a specific number. And honestly, the 27% plus is unfortunately, at this stage, a bit hypothetical. We're going to have to watch the market and see how it pans out with the combined entity and the starts that we grapple with. Still feel good about it by what we've seen so far. I would tell you if I'm surprised on the gross margin side, just from a forecasting perspective. I would tell you I'm surprised it stayed as strong just as long as it has. It's done quite well. It's migrating down, but in a very measured way.
Kurt Yinger : Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, I mean, as builders start to kind of zero in on the cost side with the loss of some pricing power and maybe trade availability becoming incrementally better, how do you think about that impacting the value proposition of some of the value-added offerings?
Dave Flitman : Yes. We're excited about the long-term potential of those value-added offerings in any market. You think about it, labor may be more readily available. But even in a downturn, efficiency at the job site matters for our customers. They're going to be doing a lot with a lot less people. They're going to take some of the same actions that we described that we're taking here. And any way that we can make their work more efficient, we believe we'll continue to get traction and continue to drive growth in those products. And to Peter's earlier comments, we haven't seen any slowdown in our value add on a relative basis compared to the rest of the business. We think our penetration will continue.
Kurt Yinger : Got it. All right. Well, I appreciate the color, and good luck here in Q4 guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Rygiel with B. Riley.
Alex Rygiel : Can you talk a bit about your inventory level, your comfort with it, how it compares to historical levels? And any other sort of inventory that could be sort of out in the channel, understanding that you are most of the channel?
Peter Jackson : Thanks, Alex. Yes. So inventory has been a real focus for us as we've observed the market, trying to make sure that we're we have the right amount on hand, right? We generally manage it on a days basis in the field ensuring that we're able to support the dynamics in the market. So that requires us to stay close to it up in -- during up and down moment. That said, I think we're in the right position. I think we've repositioned and cleared the decks on what we needed to. We talked a little bit about windows being an overhang. Certainly, we've made progress on that. A little bit more to go. But from a company -- total company perspective, it's pretty immaterial. So we're feeling pretty good. Certainly, there's always improvement, we can always optimize but certainly well within the band of where we'd like to be.
Alex Rygiel : And then secondly, on Slide 17, that shows your estimated base business on certain commodity prices. It would appear that you didn't change it since the second quarter despite a number of acquisitions. Is there a sort of two or three simple explanations for them?
Peter Jackson : Yes. We don't full year adjust the new acquisitions. It's just the part years. We're trying to keep it linked to the current look and then applying the normalized margins and the lumber prices. We've talked about a couple of different ways to update that sensitivity. We think we're going to have something that might be a little more helpful to folks when we do our Q4 announcement. But it has stayed the same. It has not moved materially primarily because it's just the part year additions for any M&A.
Operator: It appears we have no further questions at this time. This will conclude today's third quarter earnings call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by the management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Neese: Thank you, Katie. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Flitman, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our record second quarter results for 2022. The second quarter press release and investor presentation for today's call are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. We will refer to several slides from the investor presentation during our call. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS calculation excludes amortization of intangibles. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they could be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Flitman: Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We ended the first half of the year on strong footing, delivering robust results during the first quarter with that positive momentum continuing throughout the second quarter in which we achieved sales growth of 24% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 80% in the face of difficult comps in a challenging operating environment. These outstanding achievements are a direct result of having strong alignment around the clear strategy and the focused execution against that strategy, driven by the hard work and dedication of our approximately 30,000 team members and their commitment to provide outstanding service to our customers. On Slide 3, our strategic priorities continue to be: organically grow our value-added products and services, drive operational excellence, continue to build our high-performing culture and pursue strategic tuck-in acquisitions. On Slide 4, we outline how we continue to execute against our strategic priorities this quarter. Specifically, we delivered record results in the quarter through expanding capacity, increasing value-added product sales and increasing productivity. We continue to leverage our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System with a focus on cost containment to drive strong P&L leverage and bottom line performance. We maintained our industry leadership by successfully navigating a challenging industry and macroeconomic environment. We strategically deployed capital toward accretive inorganic growth opportunities as highlighted by our most recent acquisition, HomCo. Through July, we have repurchased approximately $1 billion of the $2 billion share repurchase authorization, our Board approved in May. Turning to Slide 5. We continue to believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology to better appreciate the underlying strength and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity volatility. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes static margins and commodity prices at $400 per thousand board feet. We are maintaining our full year guidance on our base business EBITDA of $2.2 billion, as Peter will discuss in a moment. Turning to Slide 6. As we outlined in our Investor Day last December, I want to reaffirm our expected performance by year-end 2025 given our assumption of average single-family starts growth in the low single digits through that time. We expect our base business to deliver a 10% top line CAGR and a 15% adjusted EBITDA CAGR. Importantly, this represents an average 50 basis point per year expansion in adjusted EBITDA margin for a total of 200 basis points of improvement by 2025 when compared to 2021. And as we deliver this performance, we expect to have between $7 billion and $10 billion of capital to deploy through 2025. That includes money for this year's planned capital investments in innovation and organic growth, along with potential additional M&A and share repurchases. We have already deployed a total of $2.8 billion of capital since we gave this guidance last December. And in the last 12 months, we have repurchased 25% of our shares outstanding. Looking at our record second quarter results on Slide 7 in more detail. We delivered strong core organic growth of 12%. Our single-family core organic growth was nearly 16%, again exceeding a single-family starts decline of approximately 3.4%. Tough comps against 2021 results impacted year-over-year growth in our multifamily and R&R segments, leaving our year-over-year growth essentially flat. Core organic sales grew 12.2%, while value-added for organic sales grew by 32% compared to the prior year period. This highlights once again the strength of our strategy and that our team continues to execute it very well. Overall, we delivered record sales of nearly $7 billion in the second quarter and generated $1.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA with a record margin of 21.8%. These results were driven by solid demand for housing across our markets, ongoing productivity initiatives and pricing discipline in an improving but still supply-constrained environment. As we turn to M&A on Slide 8, we remain focused on executing tuck-in M&A that delivers a high return. Over the past 1.5 years, we completed 10 acquisitions, reporting $1.6 billion of capital, aimed at building out our value-added customer offerings, investing in our digital transformation and further scaling our distribution network. In July, we acquired HomCo, a lumber and hardware supplier in Flagstaff, Arizona, and are excited to welcome these new team members to the Builders FirstSource family. HomeCo had net sales of approximately $44 million in 2021. This acquisition further demonstrates the fourth pillar of our strategy, M&A. Building upon the strong reputation and presence of tuck-in targets while leveraging our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System to swiftly integrate these new businesses. We have spent approximately $230 million on M&A so far this year and we expect to invest at least $500 million for the full year of 2022. We remain committed to allocating capital in a disciplined manner that drives long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now let's shift gears and cover our digital strategy on Slide 9. Our momentum on our digital transformation of the homebuilding industry is accelerating. Foundational initiatives such as standardizing our house plan intake and bid process continue to progress well. We completed agreements with two new customers for our configurable visualization tool. Collectively, creative Homes of Minnesota and SnapADU of California complete over 300 starts annually. And we now have customers responsible for more than 5,000 starts using paradigm visualizer. We recently hit an important milestone in our technology development by successfully integrating the material takeoff, structural design and visualization models into one process. This means when selections are made in a lock specific model, such as choosing a siding type in color or expanding from a two to a three car garage is reflected in the material list in real time. Pricing of the base house and options can be made available in the visualization experience and reflected in the material list. Our three dimensional models also provide the basis for offering Building Information Modeling, or BIM services to our customers, allowing them to gain project efficiencies by resolving construction conflicts in the digital world, instead of at the job site. This important capability strikes at the heart of the efficiency gains we believe our platform will bring to the homebuilding industry. Also, we have ongoing BIM pilots with one large national builder and two custom builders. Our pilot with front-light building company in South Carolina is highlighted on their company website and will help you understand how our technologies and services are helping homebuilders today. Turning to productivity. We delivered $40 million in savings in the second quarter and we continue to expect to exceed $100 million in savings for the full year 2022 by driving improvement projects and leveraging our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System. Over the long term, we are targeting 3% to 5% of annual productivity improvement as our teams work together to leverage best practices and technology, allowing us to become faster and more efficient at serving our customers. We are accelerating our efforts in this important area to ensure we not only hit our financial targets, but to also make sure our industry-leading platform is as efficient as possible. Increasingly, we are being asked what's different about BFS today versus 15 years ago during the last housing downturn. On Slide 10, we would like to point out that the Company has seen a dramatic increase in scale and share, and BFS is now more than 12x larger and 60x more profitable than it was during the last downturn. We are a leaner, more efficient, consolidated company. This increased scale has enabled the Company to remove more than $400 million of annual run rate cost through several large combinations, including the integrations of ProBuild and stock building supply as well as our merger with BMC. We are operating as a consolidated platform, not as a decentralized organization, providing better visibility, alignment and greater efficiency than other players in our space. We've improved processes and reduced costs to more efficiently serve our distribution network of more than 560 locations. We optimized our footprint by closing 120 locations and repurposing numerous other facilities. Since 2006, we have increased our value-added components and no work facilities to over 200. That's nearly 6x. We have grown our manufacturing capabilities as we have invested in high-speed door lines trust automation and robotics, which have improved our variable cost to serve and reduced our dependency on skilled labor. A good example of this would be our recent announcement of our two-year partnership with Household Design on the development and recent startup of our first fully robotic for trust manufacturing line at our Villa Rica, Georgia facility. We have also contracted for an additional eight fully robotic lines including four roof trust lines. We have improved our expense structure, making approximately 70% of our SG&A variable. We have leveraged the size and scale of our business through strategic direct and indirect spend, enabling BFS to more efficiently serve our customers. And we have dramatically improved our cash generation, capital structure and leverage, providing us with significant financial flexibility. While we have seen strong demand through July that weighed near-term results, we fully recognize the current industry dynamics that are beginning to play out. We've heard from our customers that demand is slowing due to higher mortgage rates and overall affordability concerns. We remain confident that no matter what market conditions we face, we will remain nimble and balance any short-term dislocation, positioning BFS for long-term success, and accelerating our market leadership. Turning to Slide 11. In the scenario of a highly challenged market where housing starts are down more than 20%, we have several levers to pull to drive outperformance, including effectively managing costs through our variable expense structure to flex expenses with demand, optimizing capacity and further streamlining our footprint, reducing discretionary spend accelerating productivity projects, taking appropriate headcount actions and moderating capital expenditures. Our industry-leading platform led by our strong and experienced team is generating exceptional results, which we believe positions us well for any market environment, anchored by the strength of our balance sheet with no debt maturities until 2030. We're committed to investing to capture growth organically and through tuck-in M&A. Although there will certainly be some challenges over the near term, we remain very optimistic on the prospects for our industry over the long term. I am highly confident in our ability to outperform the market in any scenario. And given our bulletproof balance sheet, expect us to lean in opportunistically on M&A in a more challenged market. So to sum up, we will continue to execute our strategy gain share and deliver value to our shareholders in any environment. Our people are the building blocks of our company and our mine inspiration that come to work every day to continue the evolution and growth of our world-class company. I want to recognize Brent Goodwin, an exceptional team member who for the past four years, has worked as an inventory control analyst at our Raleigh, North Carolina Yard and Millwork facility. Raleigh has been one of the strongest housing markets in the country for quite some time, with more than 60 families moving there each day. For the past several years, rents contributions are a key reason why our Raleigh millwork facility has become the go-to supplier for homebuilders in this burgeoning market. Beginning in late Q3 2021, Brent's location began experiencing shortages across multiple millwork product categories. Over the past two years, Brent has been relentless in developing creative solutions to help augment inventory, keeping our stock levels consistent to ensure minimal delays for customers. What makes Brent work all the more impressive is the fact that he's been able to do it all while during first a demolition and then an expansion of this location's main storage warehouse. I want to thank Brent for his many contributions in helping keeping Raleigh's builders on track amid tight supply constraints and strong homebuyer demand. We are fortunate to have Brent on our team. And I again want to thank all of our team members for their continued tremendous work and focus in satisfying the needs of our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results for the second quarter.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We are excited to continue our exceptional track record of financial performance. We navigated through a complex supply and demand environment to produce record second quarter net sales, gross margin, net income, and adjusted EBITDA. I am also pleased to report that we have again demonstrated our ability to deliver strong cash flow results by generating approximately $900 million in free cash flow this quarter. Our accomplishments have come through disciplined operational management and solid execution of our strategic priorities. At the same time, we further strengthened our balance sheet by extending debt maturities and returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders through buybacks. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our Q2 results. Second, I'll update you on our capital deployment efforts. And finally, I will touch on our updated guidance for full year 2022. Let's begin with our Q2 performance on Slides 12 and 13. We had net sales of $6.9 billion for the quarter, which increased approximately 24% compared to the prior year period. Core organic sales in the value-added products category grew by 32% and highlighting our work to meet the demand across our customer channels. Although we continue to face supply chain constraints in the quarter, we are pleased to report that we are seeing signs of those constraints loosening and lead times starting to return to normal. Gross profit was $2.4 billion, a 52% increase compared to the prior year quarter. The gross margin increased 640 basis points to 34.8%, primarily driven by increased sales in our value-added product categories and disciplined pricing in a volatile supply-constrained marketplace. SG&A increased 15.9% to $1 billion, driven primarily by four items. Acquisitions represented over 40% of the increase. Incentive compensation represented nearly 40% of the increase due to higher net sales and profitability. Investments in strategic initiatives, such as IT, productivity and our digital strategy represented another 10% of the increase, and fuel-related expenses contributed 10% of the increase in overall SG&A. Adjusting for commodity inflation, expenses were 40 basis points better than the prior year even after funding our strategic investments and absorbing inflation in several P&L categories. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased by 110 basis points to 15.1%. Clearly, our team understands the importance of controlling expenses and has been doing an excellent job. Adjusted EBITDA increased 80% to $1.5 billion, primarily driven by poor organic growth, commodity inflation and acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 21.8%, which increased 680 basis points compared to the prior year period. Adjusted net income was $1.1 billion or $6.26 of adjusted earnings per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of $574 million or $2.76 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the prior year period. The 86.9% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income taxes and to SG&A expense. Now let's turn to cash flow on Slide 14. Our second quarter cash provided by operating activities was $947 million, and cash used in investing activities was $258 million. We generated free cash flow of approximately $900 million, primarily driven by core organic growth in sales and commodity inflation. Moving to capital deployment. This year, we have spent approximately $230 million on our M&A transactions, including our most recent purchase of HomCo in July. In the second quarter, we repurchased 16.9 million shares for $991 million at an average stock price of $58.7. In addition, we've repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares in July for $270 million at an average stock price of $61.18. Year-to-date through July, we have repurchased over $1.5 billion of stock. Since August of 2021, we have repurchased approximately 52.3 million shares of stock at an average price of $62.95 for $3.3 billion. This represents the repurchase of approximately 25% of our total shares outstanding since August of 2021. We are committed to balanced capital deployment, and we will continue to look for favorable opportunities to repurchase shares considering market dynamics and our ongoing commitment to maximize long-term value creation. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.8x our LTM adjusted EBITDA. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2030. Our total liquidity was $1 billion, consisting of $838 million in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility, and $166 million of cash on hand. We are pleased with our first half '22 performance, and I want to thank our entire team for their tremendous execution and dedicated efforts despite the dynamic environment and tough year-over-year comparisons. As we look to the back half of 2022, I would like to provide you with our full year outlook on Slide 15. Given inflation, higher interest rates for mortgages and cancellation rates in the mid-teens, we now expect full year single-family starts across our geographies to be down mid-single digits. We expect multifamily starts to be up in the low double digits and R&R projected to be up in the low- to mid-single digits. As a result, we are lowering our base business guide on net sales from 10% to 14% to 8% to 12% or $17.2 billion at the midpoint. Our EBITDA guide remains unchanged. And we continue to expect growth of 18% to 22% or $2.2 billion at the mid as our outperformance in the first half will be largely offset by market weakness as we move further into the back half of the year. We will continue to provide you with a commodity price sensitivity chart in our investor presentation on Slide 16 to allow you to incorporate your own commodity estimates into your models. CapEx guidance for the year is down to approximately $300 million in 2022 due to continued supply chain delays. Building on the approximately $40 million in productivity savings achieved during the quarter, we expect to deliver over $100 million in total productivity savings this year as we continue to drive improvements across our operations. We now expect free cash flow at the midpoint to increase from $2.2 billion to $2.75 billion, reflecting higher-than-expected commodity prices and increased profitability. Our projected free cash flow assumes average commodity prices in the range of $700 to $1,000 for the full year as prices decelerate through year-end. In conclusion, our efficient operating platform has provided us with line of sight to nearly $3 billion in free cash flow, a fortress balance sheet with no long-term debt maturities until 2030 and over $1 billion of liquidity. With that, let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.
Dave Flitman: Thanks Peter. Our industry is clearly experiencing pockets of deceleration. We've all seen mortgage rates rising single-family starts forecast coming down in the back half of this year and cancellation rates increasing. We are not deterred. Our company is a much different one today than it was in 2007, and we remain confident in our ability to effectively navigate the persistently unpredictable environment. We are operating with our eyes wide open to any near-term macro turbulence while keeping our eye insights on our long-term goals, our core values and our operating principles as our guidepost. BFS is a company with fundamental strengths and clear competitive advantages and we are prepared to win in any environment. We remain leaders in a highly fragmented industry with the opportunity to be the acquirer of choice in the event of market dislocations and given our belief in the long-term industry growth trends. Our more than 560 facilities are in 47 of the top 50 MSAs with tremendous geographic customer and end market diversification. We have an extremely strong balance sheet, and we'll continue to execute our strategy and deliver strong free cash flows. And finally, this is a seasoned and highly experienced leadership team that has successfully navigated many prior cycles, and we will deliver compounded shareholder value over the long term. Katie, let's please open the call now for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Matthew Bouley: Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the results in the quarter. Morning, Dave. So first question, just looking at the EBITDA sensitivities in the appendix, you've done $2.5 billion in EBITDA year-to-date. And I don't know, depending on our realistic lumber assumption, that sensitivity would suggest $1 billion or less of EBITDA in the second half. So my question is if that's the right way to think about our models here? I know that's a full year static assumption. So I wonder if those are more sort of run rate expectations versus a hard guide on top of the first half performance. So not to put words into your mouth, but sort of how should we think about that sensitivity and sort of the view to the second half EBITDA?
Peter Jackson: Matt, yes, that's a great question. The purpose our original intended lease of that sensitivity page in the back is really to give you a normalized environment, right? It dials out any fluctuations in commodity prices. It dials out any fluctuations in margins outside of what we continue -- what we consider to be normal, right? So anything more than normal margins we dial out. So -- if you think about what's happened this year, this has been anything but a normal year. Clearly, we've been substantially higher. There have been a lot of displacements continuing through the market this year. We've certainly performed much, much better than normal in terms of our margins. As you've seen, right, we've guided to 27% plus as our normal margins, and we're substantially higher than that. So, I would use the sensitivity chart as just a way to come up with deltas between various commodity price levels, but accounting for the fact that we're seeing pretty substantially different results in 2022 as you come up with your model and your estimate on the total included demand.
Matthew Bouley: Okay. Understood. Thank you for that Peter. I guess second one just on sort of the gross margin, again, robust performance there in the quarter. But now, we've clearly seen that sort of market inflection and potentially leasing supply chains and all these things that have helped or previously helped the gross margin. So just trying to -- thinking about your kind of long-term north 27% guide. I guess my question is, as the market is normalizing here or coming down, how should we think about the kind of pace of gross margin normalization at a base business level as we get into the second half?
Peter Jackson: Yes, good question again. That's an important part of how we think about our business and how we forecast, right, in addition to commodities and starts, it's certainly margins that are a critical component it's going to take a while for margins to get back down to that normal level, right? While we are pleased that the supply chain is beginning to show signs of normalizing a bit, it's certainly not back to the almost debt. So while we do expect it to sort of slowly progress as the year progresses back towards normal. I think we're -- we'll be a little ways out into next year before that gets back to what I would consider to be anywhere near normal, and we'll just have to watch it to see when that could potentially be.
Operator: Our next question will come from Reuben Garner with Benchmark Company. Your line is now open.
Reuben Garner: Maybe to start on -- just want to understand the base business top line guide. So I understand that the outlook for single-family looks like it's come down about 10 points, but there's only a two-point reduction in the base business. Can you talk about that? Is that largely because of the backlog out there and working through that before you really see any impact late in the late in the year-to-year volume? Or is it share gains or improved adoption in some of your value-added products that kind of let you hold the line a little bit?
Dave Flitman: Yes, I think it's a combination of all that, Ruben, you have to point out the backlog strength that is still there. We're seeing that really across the board with our customers. We do expect through the course of the back half of the year, that backlog to get worked off. As we've said before, it takes about a quarter or so until we start to see volumes shift relative to what's happening in the starts environment. But importantly, as you point out, we've been taking share in the value-added portions of the business for a long time, and we expect that that will continue. So it's a combination really of those two things. But aptly and largely, it's based on the starts decline that we expect to start seeing in the back half of the second half of the year.
Reuben Garner: Great. And then my next question is, I appreciate the color you guys gave on kind of downside with your fixed variable and the differences in the business versus previous period. Can you talk about what your revenue gross margin and even EBITDA might look like next year in a scenario where it starts fall single-family starts fall 20% or 30% and go back to kind of where we were in '17, '18 and '19. Just kind of compare those metrics to what you would have seen a few years ago.
Dave Flitman: Sure. I'll start out at a higher level and then Peter can kind of fill in any color. But as you point out, and we commented here in the script, we're not the same company. Clearly, we're 12x larger, 60x more profitable. We've got a bulletproof balance sheet, over $2.5 billion of free cash flow. And as you know, in a slowing environment, that free cash flow will accelerate as we unwind working capital. But importantly, we've been talking for several quarters here about any demand shift or decline being short-lived, certainly relative to what happened in '07. And two key reasons why. First, the demographic shift, we've talked a lot about the millennials driving a lot of the starts over the past few years. We think they're driving about 30% of the housing starts, and that demand is much stronger than it was, say, in 2007. And secondly and importantly, over the last decade plus, we've had a huge underbilling in this industry. So that demand is not going away. We've underserved the market somewhere between 2 million and 6 million single-family homes over the last 12 to 15 years. So, we think any of that recessionary environment will power through that through the long term. So that's why we're very bullish on where the industry ends up over the long term.
Peter Jackson: Yes. And while I'm not sure I buy into the downside range, I certainly spent a lot of time with the team working on models and making sure we understand how our business would perform in the event of a downturn that looks like that. We do think there's a bit of a buffer from backlog a quarter or so where we're going to continue to build out the homes that have been started and put under construction. Might go longer, could go quicker, but that's certainly a component to think about as you're looking at what's going to happen through the rest of this year. As you look into the future, though, you've got a couple of main components that I would highlight, right? So you're looking at those variables, it's starts, which we would expect to follow along with, right? We're going to move because we're in the main markets where starts occur, we're going to move with the market. Our margins, which are very much driven by both our product mix and the competitiveness and availability of product in the market; and then finally, lumber price is certainly influential. And we try and outline for you what that might go with -- or that might go to. Obviously, a recession would impact all three of those variables. And would really start us on that trend back towards our normalized margin level, a quick hit like that, something that moved very quickly, might put us under the normalized margins for a short period of time, maybe a couple of points below that, but we certainly think that's a reasonable range. It's a question really around what the regression looks like, how quickly it goes there and how resilient some of these markets and some of these customers are. But also keep in mind, we've gotten more mature and done a lot of work to improve our business in terms of the synergies, the productivity savings are consistently increasing mix towards value add there are all things we think we're going to be able to leverage quite well in terms of our results.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Your line is now open.
Trey Grooms: I have to echo the congrats on the very impressive results. So you guys have a long-term history of outperforming the markets you serve. And Dave, you reiterated that you expect to outperform the market in any environment. But more specifically, can you talk about expectations for product mix and slower periods of housing demand, would you expect to see any change in mix or maybe relative demand for prefab components or other value-added products?
Dave Flitman: Great question, Trey. We've seen that demand shift more to the value-added side of the business over the past several years. Obviously, both legacy companies were driving that, and we've certainly stepped on the gas. We think that mix shift will continue over the long term regardless of what's going on in the environment. If for no other reason that there's been such a tremendous exit of skilled labor in the industry since the last downturn, and you don't just get that back over time. So importantly, those efficiency gains that the builders are gaining from the work we're going off site will be important in even in a slower market environment because they need those efficiencies. They need to be as productive as they can in a slower operating environment. So we're excited about the shift we've had. Our teams aligned around it. We expect those product shifts to continue through the course of time.
Trey Grooms: Okay. And then kind of follow on around the same topic here. Can you talk about how your push towards digital plays into your strategy in a slower operating environment? And how that might change the way you go to market or anything like that?
Dave Flitman: We're really excited about our digital platform and the work that's been done. Importantly, we hit that important milestone. As we've talked about the long-term strategy and the vision when we acquired Paradigm just about a year ago now, we said we would take a platform that was fairly narrowly focused in the millwork side of the business and extend that to the whole home design. And importantly, we said we would start with our strength, which was a structural design of the home. And as I said in the script, we just recently hit an important milestone where we've integrated the material takeoff with that structural design into the visualizer with Paradigm. So, that starts to bring together some of those key elements and capability that we spoke about. Still a lot more work to do but the vision is intact, and we have invested heavily in the last 12 months. We'll continue to invest heavily, we believe in the vision. And regardless of the market environment, we think digital is the right long-term play, not only for us, but importantly, for the industry because we're driving a lot of efficiency gains, and I talked about it in the script here a little bit, finding all the problems in the digital world instead of at the job site, just drives tremendous efficiency gains, and that's really at the heart of what we're trying to achieve here. And we're excited about it. We think we're going to lean in pretty hard regardless of what's going on in the world around us because we believe in the long-term strategy and what this is going to bring to the industry.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mike Dahl: Peter, I wanted to follow up on the -- on Matt's question to start the call around the ranges and maybe a specific question around second half because you think it's causing some confusion. I think what you're saying is this year has been fairly unique, right? So if you were to say, pick a number in this kind of commodity tier, say, $800 lumber, your range here suggests that would produce $3 billion to $3.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA. I think what you're saying is in reality, the margins this year are stronger so you would produce higher than that in the current environment at those lumber prices. So is one, correct me if I'm wrong there, but more specifically.
Dave Flitman: That's exactly right. Yes.
Mike Dahl: Okay. So maybe just to clear up the confusion. Can you give us what the true base business EBITDA was in both the quarter and year-to-date?
Peter Jackson: I will say we don't provide a quarterly split for base business. We think the annualized view is still the right way to look at it as it accounts for the seasonality and the comparisons, we think, in a more rational way. I can offer up that the fall through in the second quarter was about 2/3 non-commodity, 1/3 commodity in terms of what EBIT it is to give you a sense of the type of outperformance. Obviously, we're seeing in both categories. But how that reflects on the base business side and the base business material is in there. So, you can see our expectation for the full year.
Mike Dahl: Okay. Got it. We'll do some more math around that. And then the second question, you have -- part of the increase in free cash flow presumably comes from similar performance year-to-date and some additional commodity tailwinds, you have pulled back your CapEx guide by about $100 million. And so could you elaborate a little more on kind of deltas for free cash? And then specifically the lower CapEx, what are you what's contemplated in terms of things that are either getting shelved or pushed out to next year?
Peter Jackson: Yes, sure. I mean I'm certainly -- I think the whole team is disappointed on the CapEx side where we've got a lot of really great initiatives that we're pushing on new facilities, trying to refresh our fleet, investments and a bunch of different projects that we're excited about. We've just struggled getting what we're looking for, whether it be buildings or trucks, whether it be development, the speed of getting properties ready to sort of turn on the switches and get things going. It's just gone more slowly than we anticipated. So, we're not looking at canceling or shelving anything at this point. It's all really just pushing out into next year. We're continuing to push forward and trying to make sure we have the capacity we need to meet our customers' needs. When it comes to the broader business, you hit the nail in the head. I mean, clearly, we outperformed in the first half. That profitability on the base business and the performance of the core operations critically important to that cash flow increase, but we also saw higher commodity prices than we anticipated. I think they went up more aggressively in the second quarter and probably came down pretty aggressively, too. But overall, it's higher than what we had been anticipating. And so the compounding of those three factors, we're going to pass that cash through the business. We certainly are excited about it. It does make an assumption, one that we've said repeatedly. And of course, people can have different opinions on this. But we do anticipate commodity prices returning to a more historically normalized level by year-end. So, there's certainly a component of that that's included any time we've given these guidance numbers.
Operator: We will take our next question from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.
Ketan Mamtora: Dave, I want to come back to that the mix question again. I mean, if you're assuming that the economy is slowing, housing starts special on the single-family side are going to, let's say, assume are going to fall next year. Presumably, the labor situation is much better than what it is today. Would you envision even in that scenario for your customers to not trade down from a mix standpoint to more commodity products? Or is that not a right way to think?
Dave Flitman: No. We -- as I said earlier, Ketan, we think we're going to continue to lead in. Our customers love these products. They solve a lot of problems at the job site and help make them more efficient. So, we believe we're going to lean in hard and the mix will continue to shift through the course of time.
Peter Jackson: And the thing I'd add to that is this isn't just an open a prayer. The LDR during the Great Recession grew our share of business attributable to trough and manufacturer products. So even during a recession that I think all of us anticipated is much more severe than what we're looking at here. The market continued to adopt these products for exactly the reasons that Dave mentioned.
Dave Flitman: And we've been through cycles, up and down cycles, ports of time over the last decade, and we continue to penetrate the market because there's real value for our customers with these products.
Ketan Mamtora: Got it. That's helpful. And then second question. Obviously, from a balance sheet standpoint, you guys are in a very strong position, as you mentioned, fortress balance sheet. I'm just curious, in case things were to the downturn were to be more severe than what we are expecting. How do you guys think about kind of keeping liquidity cushion versus let's say, share repurchases if the stock was to come under pressure.
Peter Jackson: Well, I'd tell you, looking at our balance sheet, as you described. We've got a disciplined approach to ensuring we have a bulletproof balance sheet, right? So our number one priority in terms of capital allocation is ensuring that we're able to withstand whatever comes. So, we run the, but the downside models to ensure that to ensure we've got proper coverage. The other point is that as it stands today, not only do we have liquidity, we still have a substantial amount of capital that's un-accessed on the working capital side that we could -- it's a cushion in case things reset in terms of the valuation perspective, but we certainly have more in our pocket as well, especially given the unsecured nature of our bond. So, I think as good as it is, it's even better than it looks. And I think what that does for us is it puts us in a position to be both selective but also aggressive as the opportunities present themselves. We've been very thoughtful about the way we look at M&A. We're disciplined about the criteria that we look that we look at, the financial expectations, the alignment with strategy. We're going to continue to do that. Even with that said, we've been very successful at adding very nice businesses to the portfolio. And we think there's going to be a lot more opportunity to do that and significant opportunities to do that opportunistically during a downturn, if that's the way this turns out to be. And let's face it, we have a high beta and we're going to be smart and opportunistic about buying back shares. We believe in it. We know our stock has tremendous value, and we're going to be smart about it and make sure we're allocating capital in a way that maximize the shareholder value over the long term.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from David Manthey with Baird. Your line is now open.
David Manthey: And back to Slide 16. This is a minor issue, but it seems like the revenues across the tiers ticked down by about $1 billion, and the EBITDA range shaded down by about $100 million across the tiers versus what you had in the grid last quarter. Is there anything to that? Is it just refining your thoughts on the grid?
Peter Jackson: Yes, there's nothing really to it. I mean we tweak it and adjust it to stay aligned with our core operating model. So, we try to move it. So, the two match up and minor things shift from time to time, but it's not signaling anything really.
David Manthey: Cool. All right. That's what I figured. And then second, when you talk about the price fluctuations versus a static commodity environment, we experienced rapid and significant downside in lumber in like the fall of '20 and May through August '21 and even year-to-date since about March, but we haven't really seen much of a falloff in EBITDA. In fact, a lot of those quarters actually saw better EBITDA. I'm just trying to understand what's different about the future versus the recent past performance we've seen here.
Peter Jackson: Yes. No, I think it's a great question, and it highlights a lot of the work we've done to make the business stronger, more predictable. But it also reflects, I think, the still supply-constrained environment. I know all of us have had a wonderful time talking about the downside opportunities that this industry faces since the beginning of the year, but in practice in reality, we're still running hard to be able to deliver on what our customers need to continue building out these homes. So I think what you've seen in a couple of ways, I think probably the most important one is around the way we've changed pricing. These changes have made our results a bit more stable, a bit more predictable in terms of upside and downside swings in commodities and what it does to our profitability. We talked about substantially reducing the amount of fixed as we used to call it, price contracts. So that's an important piece of it, why we wouldn't see as much sort of constraint or reduction in gross margin percentages during inflationary moments and inversely expansion during the down cycles. But I think it's more related to the overall demand environment in terms of our capacity, getting products to the market, having access to those products in the first place and being very careful about how we manage that capacity ensuring that pricing is disciplined and that we're moving our product quickly and efficiently. I think those things really have come together to allow us to have a superior profitability performance. Although, we do expect some of that will fade over time as we've outlined and margins will normalize a bit. But I do think we'll retain that that more consistent, more predictable profitability profile.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Stanley Elliott. Your line is now open.
Stanley Elliott: Congratulations. Dave, can you talk a little bit more about what's happening on the digital side? I mean it sounds to me like that things are accelerating or at least tracking almost ahead of expectations. And when I would have looked back at the Analyst Day, kind of the five-year build, you targeted $1 billion of revenue. I would have thought the first two years were more building it out. Maybe the last three years, you're starting to see the revenue flow through. Is that still the case? Or are you kind of tracking ahead of those expectations?
Dave Flitman: So I think we're right on track, Stanley. You're thinking about it right. We hit an important milestone in the quarter and wanted to share that. But that's part of the plan. So there's still a whole lot more work for our team to do. My main message is we're executing well the development is coming together exactly as we expected. We still expect to see that $1 billion, and it will be back-end loaded in that five-year time horizon per design. So we're right on track with where we want to be.
Peter Jackson: But the thing I would add is I think this reflects how much the market is underestimating how powerful this thing is, right? We've seen the vision for where it's going to go. And these things that we're that we're rolling out right now, as Dave mentioned, are amazing. They're massive. They're unprecedented in terms of capabilities for this industry, and we're just getting started.
Stanley Elliott: And switching gears a bit. You mentioned the automation piece, I can guess the eight lines, you did have to push some CapEx out. I mean is that going to impact your ability to get those automated lines up and running? And then how do you think about that in terms of throughput, productivity? Anything you want to share with us here today.
Dave Flitman: Well, we've been investing heavily in automation, base automation for many years. Both legacy companies have done that. We're continuing to automate. As Peter mentioned, there's some equipment challenges in just getting things in but our strategy is sound. And what I mentioned around the eight lines, this is new technology and capability that we've worked with House of Design around over the last couple of years. And this is beyond automation. This is fully robotic trust manufacturing. And so, we had an important data point coming together at Villa Rica, and we expect over the next couple of years to buy another eight more of those lines or four on the roof side, four on the floor trust side. So we're continuing to innovate and come up with new and creative ways to, first of all, get a more consistent product to our customers and secondly, deal with the same labor challenges our customers face that we've got inside. So, it takes some of those issues off the table. But we'll continue to invest, and we expect there may be some puts and takes here or there a carryover in capital, but we will spend that money and we're committed to that capability.
Peter Jackson: We're excited about this. I mean I think that the idea around not having all the capital that we want is really -- we're already doing 200 miles an hour and lapping everybody, but we want to do 210, right? We want to lap everybody faster on this stuff. And it's just disappointing it hasn't come in as fast as we'd like. But it's not going to hurt us. It's just maybe going to keep us from seeing the opportunities as quickly as we'd like.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman. Your line is now open.
Adam Baumgarten: Could you give us a sense for how the core organic sales growth in the quarter broke down by volume and price?
Peter Jackson: Yes, I'd say this time, it was much heavier towards price, more of an 80:20 split.
Adam Baumgarten: Okay. Great. And then just -- you guys did $40 million in productivity savings in the second quarter, target for over $100 million. Can you give us that number for the first quarter?
Peter Jackson: So, the first quarter was actually satisfying the remainder of our synergy savings commitment. So, we've changed our language as we committed to do. So that first number was $32 million or $52 million -- $52 million in the first quarter. And then the remainder, the other $100 million that we're talking about is two through four and productivity specific, not synergy. So $60 million come in the back half.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Colin Verron with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Collin Verron: I just wanted to touch on the long-term targets here. I know you reiterated your 2025 base business targets despite the change in end market expectations. So, I was just -- just to give some more comfort around those targets, can you just frame out what would need to happen in the macro environment in the single-family end market. For there to be risk to that guidance? -- whether that be from a financial perspective or a time line of achieving those goals?
Peter Jackson: Yes, I think the obvious one is that if the market for single family, in particular, stays down and doesn't recover back to sort of our expected low single-digit growth since '21 number by 2025, that would put pressure on our ability to make that tool. I'd say that's about it. I'd say all the internal operating stuff that we committed to, we've got line of sight to, we feel good about. But from a macro or external expectations perspective, that's the one thing that we count on.
Collin Verron: Okay. That's helpful. And then, can you just dive into the EBITDA bridge a little bit more? I think you said the split between non-commodity and commodity was 2/3, 1/3. It implies a pretty good 40% incremental EBITDA in the non-commodity business, I think. So could you just kind of define the moving pieces there? And how sustainable that kind of margin is? And maybe what you guys are looking at from a decremental margin perspective, if you start to see volumes turn?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I mean I guess the comments will sound a bit familiar, right? You're right, it was about 2/3, 1/3 in terms of the benefit that we saw in the non-commodity side versus the commodity side. We do think it overtime things are going to return towards that normalized 27% plus gross margin level. We don't think it's going to happen over a quarter or two. I think it will take a while longer for that to normalize primarily because of the same reasons we're seeing the benefit now. The primary reasons are around supply chain constraints around not having enough capacity to meet the demand and that happening in a number of different markets. So, there are obviously reasons for that to normalize. That will come through in the form of increased capacity from suppliers. It may come through in the form of decreased demand from the end markets. But we certainly think there is a permanent benefit in what we have experienced in the past couple of years as it pertains to our increasing value-add mix, the increased adoption in the industry as well as our ability to compete effectively in really successful markets around the country.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jay McCanless with Wedbush. Your line is now open. Jay, your line maybe on mute.
Jay McCanless: I'm sorry about that. Fantastic quarter, guys. After we purchased in July, how much do you have left on the authorization now?
Peter Jackson: There's $1 billion more left on that authorization.
Jay McCanless: Okay. And then -- and I apologize if I missed this, but could you kind of walk through what happened to get to the $2.5 billion on the free cash flow versus the $3 billion? That was a pretty nice increase in the midpoint. I'm just wondering what would cause the low end versus the high end, Peter?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I mean I think the biggest impacts are from what commodities did and what the profitability did in the first half. We -- and you know this, Jay, we've been very consistent about it. We continue to build our models with that expectation of a regression towards a more normalized commodity price. And instead of progressing it actually accelerated for a window of time. So that benefit is certainly real to us. It generates real cash that we put to work. So that's a big piece of it. Our profitability is up, right? So that outperformance certainly we're very happy with, and we think that is going to continue to be a positive influence on the business as we continue to execute on productivity initiatives and things we're doing to drive that profitability, and that's another big piece. And then probably the least pleasant component is that $100 million of CapEx that we don't think we're going to be able to pull in this year just given the pace of supply chain issues.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Alex Rigel with B. Riley. Your line is now open.
Alex Rigel: Very nice quarter, gentlemen. Quick question, Peter. At the very end, and it kind of goes back to the last question here, but you referenced line of sight towards $3 billion in free cash flow. Is this in reference to your 2022 guidance? Or is that incrementally over the next, say, 12 months?
Peter Jackson: No, that's the guidance. So $2.75 billion, I may have taken some liberty and round it up to $3 billion. We'll continue to watch, obviously, the results as the year progresses and if there's more there, I propose we'll deliver it.
Alex Rigel: Excellent. And then can you remind us what your lag time is to the spot price for commodities? And then as it relates to pricing in your non-commodities business, have you seen any products that are obviously manufactured by others? Do we see anyone cut prices yet?
Peter Jackson: It's about 1/4 between what the market moves at and what we would expect to flow through our COGS. On average, it's very open. It's a pretty wide bell curve, but yes, it's about 1/4. And I guess the answer to that is no. We have not seen any one cutting prices into this market with the exception of people who are following the commodity prices, right? I mean that is common. That happens all the time, good or bad.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group. Your line is now open.
Steven Ramsey: I wanted to touch on just one topic replenishing inventory given potential slowing of single-family demand, how are you thinking about replenishing inventory when you want to be a trustworthy source for builders and balance that against slowing demand? And then, are you replenishing now at the same rate as the first half? Or do you plan for that to happen in the second half?
Peter Jackson: Yes. We're just running the same play. We always do, Steven. Really, this is normal of for us. Just like normal seasonality, we continue to align our purchases with the inbound flow of orders. We maintain appropriate inventory on hand levels usually on a days basis, but really down to a granular level by market, sometimes by location, depending on the SKUs under consideration. Certainly, it's something that we were careful about from the perspective you can never run out, right? If you run out, it better be the suppliers but it better not be on us. So that's a requirement. That's a commitment we make to our customers and something that we work very, very hard to ensure -- but we're going to -- we're still running the same play in a down market as an upmarket in terms of how we think about ensuring the right amount of supply on hand.
Operator: Thank you. And for our last question today will come from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG. Your line is open.
Ryan Gilbert: First question, for me on gross margin, just given the lag between commodity price and when it hits your COGS I know that the reduced use of fixed-price contracts has reduced volatility in your gross margin. But just given what commodity prices have done, could we see that be a tailwind to gross margin in the third quarter relative to the second?
Peter Jackson: When it comes to commodities, I would say probably not. I think based on what we're seeing in terms of performance of the business. If anything, it's more competitive, not less as things normalize, that's kind of our expectation don't see it eroding in a significant way. But yes, I mean, I think there's certainly an opportunity for increased competitiveness. If we're going to be competitive in any part of our business, it's absolutely the commodity space in terms of a gross margin normalizing more quickly than that.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay. Got it. And second question, for me is on organic growth over the last few quarters, it's really broken away from single-family starts growth, whereas if you go back over a few years, it's, I think, pretty closely tracked single-family starts. Do you have a view on when the core organic, I guess, kind of reverts back to approximating single-family starts growth? Or do you think we can stay at this elevated level for some time?
Peter Jackson: I think I have a couple of different answers to that question. When we're talking about margins, I think we've been very, very clear that is going to return to normal over time. I think the other part of that answer though is really around value add. Value-add is an important part of the mix. Our growth is substantially higher than the rest of the business. And while there's certainly a gross margin component to that, we believe that, that is very sticky like Dave was referring to earlier and that, that is going to be held on to in terms of an important resource by the homebuilding community, and we're going to continue to invest and to be that partner for them. So, we do think that's sticky in the long term.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay. Got it. And then just a quick final question on July trends. I think you mentioned that that demand remains strong. Are there any numbers you can put to kind of quantify the strength that you're seeing so far in July or you saw in July?
Peter Jackson: No. I think continued is a good way to characterize it. We feel good about July, and we're going to continue to be reactive and responsive, maybe better said to the market dynamics that we're faced with. But right now, we are hitting on all cylinders and focusing on our customers.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's event. You may now log off and disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-10 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Builders FirstSource First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Neese: Thank you, Priscilla. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Flitman, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our record first quarter results for 2022. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS calculation excludes amortization of intangibles. The first quarter press release and our investor presentation for today's call are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and our presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.
David Flitman: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2021 was a phenomenal year for our company. We entered the first quarter of 2022 building on that strong momentum and delivered another quarter of record net sales, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA. We produced strong core organic sales growth of 15%, marking our fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Along with our strong start to the year, we continue to invest prudently in our operations and work hard to deliver outstanding service to our customers in the face of significant supply chain constraints that persist throughout our industry. The success we've achieved is directly attributable to all 28,000 of our hard-working and dedicated team members who go above and beyond every day to help us maintain our position as the industry leader. I'll cover four key topics on today's call. First, I'll provide a quick update on our base business and our record first quarter results. Second, I'll provide an update on our acquisition success that continues to strengthen our premier market position, including our most recent tuck-in deals. Next, I'll provide an update on our digital strategy. And finally, I'll discuss our view of the current state of the housing market. On Slide 3, I've highlighted this important point for several quarters and would like to share it again. As we discussed during our Investor Day last December, we believe it is important to assess our results using a base business methodology to better appreciate the underlying growth and profitability of our company by normalizing for commodity prices. As a reminder, our base business definition assumes static commodity prices at $400 per thousand board feet. Turning to Slide 4. Over the next 4 years, we expect our base business to deliver a 10% CAGR on the top line, a 15% adjusted EBITDA CAGR, and importantly, a 50 basis point per year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin for a total of 200 basis points of improvement by 2025. And our expected full year 2022 base business performance is ahead of these targets. As a result of this performance, we expect to have $7 billion to $10 billion of capital to deploy through 2025. That includes this year's planned capital investments in innovation and organic growth, along with M&A and share repurchases. Turning to our first quarter results on Slide 5. We delivered strong core organic growth of 15%. Commodity price inflation added 13% and acquisitions added 8%. Our single family core organic growth was nearly 17%, once again exceeding the single-family starts growth, which was about 4%. And our single family core organic growth was double digits across all 3 of our operating divisions. Our multifamily and R&R segments each grew approximately 10%. Core organic sales in value-added products grew by 31% compared to the prior year period, and value-added products were the key growth driver across all customer segments, accounting for nearly 80% of our organic growth in the quarter. This is another strong data point that confirms our strategy is working. We delivered record sales of nearly $6 billion in the first quarter and generated $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.6%. These exceptional results were driven by robust demand for housing, internal productivity and ongoing pricing discipline in a volatile, supply-constrained environment. Let's turn to M&A. We remain focused on executing tuck-in M&A that delivers a high return. As you can see on Slide 6, there are more than 1,000 potential opportunities with revenue less than $100 million clearly highlighting our future opportunity for growth. On Slide 7, last year, we completed 7 acquisitions for $1.2 billion. This year, we expect to invest approximately $500 million in accretive M&A, and we're off to a great start. On April 1, we acquired Panel Truss, a multi-location provider of building components to single and multifamily markets with 7 locations throughout Texas, Georgia and South Carolina. The additional component capacity expands our value-added solutions offerings in several key high-growth markets. Panel Truss had approximately $138 million in sales last year. Also on April 1, we acquired Valley Truss, a single-location provider of building components to single and multifamily markets in Boise, Idaho. Boise's active housing market is seeing an influx of national homebuilders rushing in to meet a rise in local demand, and we're excited to partner with builders to meet their ambitious goals. Valley Truss sales were approximately $26 million in 2021. I want to welcome the team members from Panel Truss and Valley Truss to the BFS family, and I look forward to providing future updates on how Builders FirstSource will continue to lead the way in consolidating our fragmented industry. Next, I'll provide a brief update on our digital strategy on Slide 8 as we continue to accelerate our pace of digital transformation. During our fourth quarter earnings call, I highlighted the deployment of Paradigm Estimate, which we continue to roll out across our operations to provide faster and more accurate customer quotes. Year-to-date, we have completed 2,000 estimates on customer plans across 9 states, and that adoption will continue to accelerate. In addition, this process provides a foundation for our configurable visualization technology and improved design and construction efficiency for homebuilders. Regarding our visualization technology, I'm pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement with Hayden Homes, a builder in the Pacific Northwest for the use of our Homebuilder Omni platform. With their plans of approximately 2,000 starts, Hayden Homes will become the largest builder currently using our digital solutions. We believe we are making the necessary investments to revolutionize our industry and that our digital strategy is on track to capture an incremental $1 billion growth opportunity by 2026. Turning to productivity. We expect to deliver over $100 million in productivity savings in 2022 by continuing to leverage our BFS 1-TEAM Operating System, which we've highlighted at our Investor Day in December. We're off to a strong start. As an example, our component manufacturing and efficiency metrics shows that our board feet produced per hour has improved by 19% versus the first quarter of last year as our teams work aggressively to maximize the throughput of our existing facilities to meet demand. Over the long term, we are targeting 3% to 5% of annual productivity improvement as our teams work together to leverage best practices and technology, allowing us to become more efficient and productive in serving our customers. Lately, many industry headlines expressed uncertainty and concern. From what we have seen across the thousands of customers and homesites that we serve, I can affirm that this industry remains strong, underbuilt and resilient. I believe the homebuilding industry will continue to grow this year and that we will outperform our peers as our platform delivers for our customers and our shareholders. Despite persistent supply chain challenges and rising interest rates, we are not expecting a significant downturn in housing because we are far healthier and more prepared industry than the last time we saw a significant downturn. Our beliefs are supported by 3 key facts: first, the significant underbuilding of homes that has occurred over the last 12-plus years; next, the improvement in underlying demographic demand; and finally, the credit quality of that demand. We continue to believe that the U.S. housing market is significantly underbuilt. And while I acknowledge higher mortgage rates will likely represent a near-term headwind to satisfying that demand, we continue to see tremendous momentum and long-term growth for the industry. In the first quarter, single-family homes under construction increased 27.5% versus the prior year to 789,000 units. As a result of this underlying demand and ongoing supply chain challenges, total units under construction hit 1.6 million in March. The last time this occurred was in the summer of 1973. Also, the cancellation rates have remained low at approximately 8% during the first quarter, essentially unchanged from last year, indicating customer demand remains durable. Turning to demographic growth. We see a clear favorable trend in the most populous age cohort of 25- to 34-year olds. This swell of young adults is moving into their early 30s, a time of life when many people start to buy their first homes or move from apartments to single-family homes, and we are seeing household formations reflect this demographic shift. And last month, according to the U.S. Census, the home vacancy survey revealed that all mature age cohorts younger than 50 years old posted year-over-year increases in homeownership, the first time this has occurred since 1994. This data indicates the overall financial strength and creditworthiness of today's buyers are far healthier and more resilient than in the last cycle as evidenced by the strong consumer balance sheets resulting from the trillions of dollars in COVID relief measures and the low 3.6% unemployment rate. So the homebuilding industry remains well positioned with significant tailwinds given the historic underbuilding, favorable demographics and consumers with strong finances. As a company, we have a long track record of successful execution, gaining share and driving efficiencies through innovation for our customers. We significantly overachieved our BMC synergy commitments and are ramping up productivity and operational excellence across the entire organization. We will continue to focus our efforts on accelerating our growth in higher-margin value-added products and investing further in our digital solutions platform to advance our goal of transforming the homebuilding industry. For 2022, we have increased our outlook and expect strong double-digit base business growth and significant free cash flow generation. We remain committed to deploying capital into high-return internal investments, accretive bolt-on M&A and share repurchases. I'd like to spend a couple of minutes highlighting Military Appreciation Month and its importance to Builders FirstSource. At BFS, we are honored to be a military-friendly employer and to be part of the journey for those who have served our country. One veteran we are particularly proud of is Rodney Hatch, who served as a marine and is now a safety coordinator for multiple locations across our Alabama and Mississippi geographies. Rodney honors and celebrates those who have greatly served our country by creating veteran walls at our locations showcasing those who are now growing their careers with BFS. His spirit of community doesn't stop with his coworkers.  Rodney gives back to local neighborhoods by maintaining blessing boxes and honor system food pantry where people in need can take food and necessities. And when Hurricane Ida hit the area last year, Rodney jumped into action, collecting donations from his fellow team members and delivering them to Louisiana himself. He does all of this on top of this vital role of keeping our people safe, a responsibility he excels at, day in and day out. His safety-first mindset and teachings have helped his 6 locations achieve 0 recordable injuries so far in 2022. People like Rodney are the reason we continue to see year-over-year reductions in our recordable incidents as part of our never-ending drive to 0. We are fortunate to have Rodney on our team, and I thank him for his service for our country and the communities we serve. And I'm grateful to all of our veterans and each of our 28,000-plus team members who embody our core values, putting people first and showing our customers why BFS is the most valuable partner in our industry. With that, let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q1 results and provide an update on our improved 2022 financial guidance.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I would also like to take a moment and thank each one of our team members who delivered an incredible first quarter of 2022. We are very pleased with our remarkable first quarter results. We remain committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment through 2022 and beyond as we leverage our strong cash flow to make accretive investments in our operations and add great businesses to the BFS family, all while executing against our share repurchase authorizations. I will cover 3 topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our Q1 results. Second, I'll update you on our capital deployment efforts. And finally, I'll provide you with our updated guidance for the full year 2022. Let's begin with our Q1 performance on Slide 10. We had net sales of $5.7 billion for the quarter, which increased approximately 36% compared to the prior year period. Core organic sales in the value-added products grew by an estimated 30.8%, underlining our work to meet the strong demand across our value-added channels and the continued supply chain constraints. Our focus on value-added products continues to strengthen our appeal to customers looking to improve efficiency on the job site. Gross profit was $1.8 billion, a 71% increase compared to the prior year quarter. The gross margin percentage increased 670 basis points to 32.3%, primarily driven by disciplined pricing in a volatile, supply-constrained marketplace as well as effective and timely sourced. SG&A was $968.6 million, an increase of $147 million or 17.9% compared to the prior year period, driven primarily by acquisitions and variable compensation. Variable and incentive compensation increased due to core organic growth and improved profitability. We also made strategic investments in IT, productivity and digital initiatives. Lastly, fuel-related expenses increased by $12 million or nearly 50% due to recent global events. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased by 270 basis points to 17%. Adjusted EBITDA increased nearly 120% to $1 billion driven by strong demand across our key customer end markets, higher commodity prices and improved gross margins. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 17.6%, increasing 670 basis points compared to the prior year period as we continue to manage spending in a fast-growing environment. Net income in the quarter was $639.6 million or $3.56 per share compared to net income of $172.6 million or $0.83 per share in the same period a year ago. Adjusted net income was $700.8 million or $3.90 of adjusted EPS compared to the net income of $296.3 million or $1.42 of adjusted EPS in the prior year period. The 136.5% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income taxes and SG&A expenses. Now let's turn to cash flow. Our first quarter cash provided by operating activities was $179.8 million, and cash used in investing activities was $48.3 million. We generated free cash flow of $131.5 million. I'll highlight the fact that we are cash flow-positive in Q1 for the first time. Historically, in the first half of the year, we are a net borrower as we make seasonal increases in working capital. This quarter's positive cash flow really highlights the strength of our market-leading platform. Let's turn to capital deployment. This year, we have spent approximately $180 million on our M&A transactions which closed in April. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares for roughly $286 million at an average stock price of $79.58. In addition, we repurchased approximately 4.3 million shares in April 2022 for $266.9 million at an average stock price of $62.21. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $552.9 million of stock. The number of shares repurchased was lower than the past 2 quarters primarily due to the timing of M&A and seasonal working capital needs. Since August 2021, we have repurchased approximately 35.3 million shares of stock at an average price of $65.10 for $2.3 billion. This represents almost 17% of our total shares outstanding in less than a year. I'm happy to announce that yesterday, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of $2 billion. When added to the $2.3 billion already repurchased, our authorization provides for $4.3 billion of total share repurchases. We remain committed to opportunistically repurchasing our stock and continuing to create value for our shareholders. Also on Slide 11, our pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.9x our actual EBITDA. Excluding our ABL, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2027. Our total liquidity was $1.2 billion, consisting of approximately $900 million in net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and $282 million of cash on hand. We are off to a great start this year. The team is driving higher-margin products, delivering value and efficiency to our customers, and our balance sheet remains rock solid. Let's shift gears and discuss updated '22 full year outlook on Slide 12. We continue to see strong underlying demand in new housing construction. We are maintaining our estimate of single-family starts growth across our geographies in the mid-single digits and R&R and multifamily growth in the low to mid-single digits. As we discussed last quarter, we are providing you with our base business guide on net sales and EBITDA as we believe this is a better measurement of our performance and assumes constant commodity costs at $400 per thousand board foot. We will continue to provide you with a commodity price sensitivity chart in our investor presentation to allow you to incorporate your own commodity estimates into your models. As a result of our Q1 performance, we are increasing our 2022 base business sales growth guidance from 8% to 12% to 10% to 14% or $17.6 billion at the midpoint. We are also increasing our adjusted EBITDA growth guidance from 12% to 18% to 18% to 22% or $2.2 billion at the midpoint. Our CapEx forecast came down $20 million due to supply chain delays and is expected to be approximately $390 million in 2022. This year's CapEx will be focused on adding capacities to existing and establishing new value-added facilities to support growth initiatives that will create capacity for higher-margin products. We delivered $55 million in cost synergies to the P&L in the first quarter, fully recognizing the synergy commitments of the BMC merger. In addition, we expect to deliver over $100 million in productivity savings this year as we continue to drive improvements across our operations. We expect to generate free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.4 billion in 2022, reflecting higher commodity prices, disciplined working capital management and our ability to capitalize on our industry-leading product portfolio. This is an increase of $400 million from last quarter's free cash flow guide. Our projected free cash flow assumes average commodity prices in the range of $700 to $1,000 for the full year. We still anticipate working capital coming down due to lower commodity prices in the back half of 2022. On Slide 13, we provide the sensitivity chart I mentioned, providing an illustrative way to think about our total sales and total adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2022 at various static commodity price points. We believe 2022 will be another strong year of growth. We continue to focus on growing value-added products, driving operational excellence across the company and delivering innovative technology to our customers. With that, let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.
David Flitman: Thanks, Peter. In summary, the homebuilding industry remains resilient and underbuilt, and we believe it will continue to grow in 2022 and beyond. Our momentum is strong. Our industry-leading platform is generating exceptional results, which we expect to continue in the second quarter, the remainder of this year and beyond. Our balanced capital application strategy is delivering significant value to our shareholders. We're committed to organic growth investments, tuck-in M&A and continuing to execute share repurchases to generate accretive returns. I remain optimistic on the prospects for our industry, and I'm highly confident in our company's ability to outperform the market over the long term. Priscilla, let's please open the call now for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question today from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Dahl: Nice set of results here. So I have a couple of questions on kind of the core and some of the margin trends. So it looks like you converted the core still in kind of the mid-30s or low to mid-30s incremental EBITDA and maybe a mid-teens organic or core organic margin. You're guiding to about 12.2% core for the year in terms of the margin. So understanding 15% is pretty exceptional or mid-teens is exceptional, talk us through the balance of the year and what some of the puts and takes are that bring you down to that full year margin number.
Peter Jackson: Mike, yes, it's a good question. There's certainly been a lot going on this year, as you know, the volatility in the markets, the supply chain issues, the ups and downs in commodity pricing. What we've been looking at is an exceptionally strong first half of the year. We knew it would be strong. I'm not sure we knew it would be this strong in terms of the dynamics. What we're anticipating is that the back half of this year, we'll see some normalization, that we'll see a directional trend in commodity prices back towards our long-term estimate around the base business, $400. Probably won't get there by year-end, but it will head that way. We also anticipate seeing increasing relief in the supply chain space. The interruptions we've seen historically due to the -- basically, the illness and the manufacturing facilities around some of the components we need to build homes, that's been improving pretty steadily over the course of the year. And as more capacity either comes on board or the supply chain stabilizes, we think that will normalize things a little bit in the back half as well. But pretty modestly, we think for the full year, the underlying market is still strong, margins will remain strong, but it will start to drift back towards a more normal level as the year progresses.
Michael Dahl: Okay. That helps. And I guess my second question, it's somewhat related. If I look at your bridge on sensitivities around different commodity price assumptions, both your sales and adjusted EBITDA ranges went up a decent amount compared to your prior sensitivities. So how much of that should we think of as being kind of true sustainable improvement in the base versus some of these -- just the first half being so exceptional like you're talking about and some things that may be still more transitory?
Peter Jackson: Yes. No -- but again, that's a good point that's -- that page is really focused around trying to layer on the impact of commodities over top of the core base business, right? So we did call up the base our -- both sales and EBITDA beat pretty handily. I think we beat by about 5% in terms of what we're guiding for the full year. That was really based on Q1 performance. So really, that's a really nice run rate in terms of what we've seen so far. That's the biggest kind of underlying factor on Slide 13 with the sensitivities. The only thing I'll highlight on that slide, just as a reminder, this is a -- it's a bit of a blunt instrument. We think it's handy. We think it's helpful. But just please remember this is a static commodity price snap the line. So volatility in commodity prices will move these numbers around.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jay McCanless with Wedbush.
Jay McCanless: Dave, could you give that stat again where you talked about the amount of homes under construction?
David Flitman: Yes. We said total 1.6 million.
Peter Jackson: Yes. Really a remarkable number, looking back through history.
David Flitman: It's been a long time since we've been at this level.
Jay McCanless: Yes. Absolutely. And I guess, the kind of the follow-up to what Mike Dahl was asking you if you have that many homes under construction along with what I think is a pretty heavy permit backlog at the builders, why -- I guess, why do you think maybe demand and/or activity slows down a little bit? It seems with the builders cancellation rates staying low that it's hard for me to envision a scenario where unit volumes really take a step back from what we're seeing now.
David Flitman: Yes. I think you're thinking about it right, Jay. We're actually not expecting volumes to significantly decline this year. As Peter mentioned, there's some comparison issues in the back half of the year. We may get -- we're hoping for a little bit of supply chain relief as the year progresses, but we're very confident in not only what we're seeing early in the second quarter. But to your point, given the backlog that's out there and conversations with our customers, the environment is going to remain robust here for the rest of the year.
Jay McCanless: Great. And then in terms of Hayden Homes, that's a pretty big announcement. Pretty encouraging to see that they're taking on the full platform. I mean, what -- I guess, maybe what is kind of your thinking on the growth trajectory there? You tested at Hayden for a year and then maybe move to a bigger builder? Or how should we think about that? And getting to that full $1 billion in omnichannel revenue that you talked about at the Investor Day, how does that progress?
David Flitman: Yes. Thanks for asking that one. We're excited about Hayden, and we're certainly excited about the work that we've got going on with our digital platform, and this is just great recognition of the work and the traction that we're getting in the market. Hayden is the largest customer so far that we've worked with on digital. They are the sixth customer that we have for Omni for homebuilders, but by far the largest at this point. And it's a really cool story actually. Legacy Paradigm had been working with them a year to 18 months ago, and they kind of lost a little bit of traction until our acquisition of Paradigm last summer. And Hayden really realized that the ability to build out this platform and -- with the financial wherewithal that we have and the investment we were committed to making in advancing digital is really what brought them back to the table and allowed us to sign this agreement with them. They also were a legacy BFS customer already in Idaho. So we've got a longstanding relationship with them. And so it was good to see that materialize into the signing of that agreement for Omni. So we're excited about it. To your second part of your question, we do expect things to ramp up. But as you recall, and we've said this the last couple of quarters and certainly in our Investor Day, this is a year where we're investing heavily in that platform to build out our capabilities for digital, in Omni and all the other pieces of the digital platform. And so as we would expect, we will see continued customer adoption of this through the course of this year and into next year. But that $1 billion of revenue is really back-end loaded, in the back half of that period of time and we said that from the beginning, only because of the digital ramp-up that we see coming over the next 3 or 4 years. So a lot of heavy lifting going on by the team. They're doing a great job, and we're excited.
Operator: We will take our next question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: Wanted to ask a first one on the base business revenue guide, some of the components of that. Seeing sort of base business sales guidance of 10% to 14% for the year. I think you said 5% to 6% from the smaller acquisitions and then, obviously, you've got the low to mid-single-digit growth in the end markets. And doing the math, that implies sort of minimal noncommodity inflation and other market share gains. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly and sort of how you guys are thinking about all the pieces there.
Peter Jackson: Yes. Thanks, Matt. The numbers do include the components you described. We certainly have had good success in organic growth on top of our M&A work. As you described, there are certainly some inflationary factors in the market. Our guide for this year tends to account for them in a balanced way and kind of forecast that out. But as I mentioned, if we do see relief from the supply chain, some of that inflationary influence will start to dissipate. Timing is a great question, and we've tried to incorporate that the back half in a reasonable way as our trend is down sort of analytics, but -- that's really what we're trying to account for in this forecast for the remainder of the year.
Matthew Bouley: Understood. Okay. Got that. And then secondly, the manufactured products and windows, doors, millwork, strength. I don't know, kind of a higher-level question to the extent you can see this. Are you finding that this is just continuing to be driven by better adoption by builders? Or are you seeing signs -- and maybe it's a combination of both, but are you seeing signs that builders are actually attempting to simplify their product given all the challenges they're going through with supply chain? And so that, in and of itself, is supporting kind of just increased usage of manufactured products across the board? I don't know, maybe it's an unfair question, but to the extent you can see, I'd be curious your thoughts there.
David Flitman: Yes. It's a totally unfair question, but we'll answer it anyway, Matt. And I think you hit the nail on the head there. It's really a combination of both. And as we've talked for a long time, both legacy companies and this combination are really stepping on the gas relative to the value-add components in millwork. And we've seen great adoption. But also last year, given the supply chain constraints, we did see builders become a little bit more agnostic on the products that they have taken. And also what you're seeing in our windows, millwork and doors, this quarter in particular, things were really tough a year ago relative to supply. I would say it's incrementally better now, particularly on interior doors. Window lead times have come down a bit, but there's still quite a backlog. And in fact, some of these products that we're talking about here have actually inhibited the timely closing of homes, as we've talked about over the course of the last year. So I think it's a combination of both of those. But listen, I couldn't be more excited about the momentum that we have around our strategy inside the company, the way our team members have embraced it and also the way our customers are ramping up because we are saving them time, money. And labor availability will remain tight, and we think these products are very sticky. We've seen that through the course of time. And we think there's still a long runway of adoption ahead of us.
Operator: We will move next to Keith Hughes with Truist Securities.
Keith Hughes: Kind of building on the last question. Your growth in manufactured products is -- it's been absolutely outstanding. As you talk to others in the industry and look -- and acquisitions that are coming in, are they seeing the same kind of growth levels above the market that you're seeing? Or is this something you need for Builders FirstSource?
David Flitman: Well, I really can't speak to what our competitors are doing there, Keith, but I can tell you that the phenomenon that we're seeing relative to adoption is not unique to us. It is certainly unique from how hard we're hitting it from our strategy and the way we're investing. I think we have a leg up on our competitors with the capital that we can deploy, preferentially to value added. And we are certainly doing that as we are spending a disproportionate amount of our capital on these assets for both organic growth and as you've seen over the course of time here, the acquisitions that we're doing. And we will continue to do that through the course of time.
Peter Jackson: Yes. We're really meeting a need there. The amount of stress builders are under to get homes completed, it's hard on them, right, with all of the supply chain disruption. So this is an area, by leveraging what we do best, that they can make their lives easier, they can be more efficient, they can be more effective. So it's certainly been really good momentum, and we think our positioning strategically, as Dave was saying, is powerful.
Keith Hughes: Okay. And just one follow-up. Your last two acquisitions, the Truss acquisitions. As you look at doing acquisitions in the future is -- that's where a lot of the dollar is going to get just because there's a lot of those available out there? Are there other areas you think you would send the acquisition dollars again to grow the manufactured product base?
David Flitman: Yes. I think you'll see us, again, continue to invest heavily in value add. There are a number of potential targets still out there. Love our footprint, love what we're doing across the country, but we will take opportunities to strengthen the value-added side of the business differentially through M&A through the course of time.
Operator: And we will go now to Reuben Garner with The Benchmark.
Reuben Garner: Congrats on the strong quarter and outlook. So maybe the gross margin line, I don't think I've heard any updates to the long-term outlook there, Peter. But maybe it would help if you could kind of -- I think, historically, I would think about rising commodity periods like we just had in the first part of the year as a detractor to gross margin, and yet you guys still posted well over 30% gross margin, which is way above, I think, your normalized range. Can you kind of walk through the components there and why you think it's so elevated now versus where things will normalize when, I guess, the supply chain loosens up?
Peter Jackson: Yes. No, that's a good question. And it really does boil down to the dynamics, whether it's attributable directly to COVID or supply chain interruptions, post-COVID, combined with that demand that we're referring to in some of our scripted commentary. The push, the amount of interest from homebuyers and the resulting drive by homebuilders to meet that demand has really put pressure on an industry that over the years has just shrunken down its capacity post kind of the go-go years of the early 2000s. So getting to that limit of available capacity is, I think, in a lot of ways, just pushed us up the bell curve. It is what it is. We're responding to it and managing it very, very well, I think. Staying disciplined, disciplined in the way that we purchase, the way that we partner with vendors and with customers to keep the supply chain moving the best we can. But that has certainly created opportunities along the way to manage profits and to push through the product that we know we can get. I do think over time, though, that supply chain, that difficulty will start to release a little bit, right? It'll alleviate. And as more product becomes available to more folks broadly in the market, we do think there will be a normalization. So you're right, we have not updated our normal gross margin guide. It's still 27% or higher in the long term. We still think we're on track for our LRP goals, but there'll be some ups and downs along the way in our estimation.
Reuben Garner: Got it. And then correct me-- this could be wrong from the start, but I think I saw the CapEx guide came in lower than you previously were looking at. Any color there, just like an inability to get projects done? Or is it reducing the spend because of the environment? Any color there would be helpful.
Peter Jackson: Yes. No. Unfortunately, it's really just supply chain. We've got orders out for rolling stock and equipment and buildings and all these things we're trying to do. And unfortunately, it's just slower moving than we would have hoped. There was an article in The Journal yesterday, I think, about just how hard it is to get heavy-duty trucks. Lead times are long, and the chip and supply chain shortages in that industry have really made it harder on us. We're spending more on R&M, just trying to keep up with the units we have versus getting the new ones we would rather have.
Reuben Garner: All right. Great. Congrats again, guys.
David Flitman: Thanks, Reuben.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Manthey with Baird.
David Manthey: Your outlook for $7 billion to $10 billion of free cash flow between now and 2025, could you remind me what single-family housing start assumption was baked into that? Was it kind of a low single-digit number?
Peter Jackson: It was. Yes.
David Manthey: Yes. Okay. And then does it matter how we get there? If the average is the same, does it matter if it's a consistent growth rate or a U-shape or an S-shape or something? Does it matter over that time frame if it's consistent versus more volatile?
Peter Jackson: No. It really doesn't. It's an endpoint target in 2025. So to your point, the path to get there I don't think is important. It certainly is informative as we go through this process that it's a base business guide, right? So all these changes you see in commodities and cash flows along the way, at least so far, have been incremental. But you're right, there's plenty of opportunity for us to move through unusual markets along the way to that ultimate target.
David Manthey: Yes. Okay. And then could you potentially bridge SG&A for us versus last year? I'm just trying to kind of parse out how much is acquisition versus the core, meaning compensation, occupancy, transportation, that's sort of thing.
Peter Jackson: We certainly can. I'm not sure I can do it off the top of my head. We can cover it and give you sort of the bigger pieces when we talk or we can get back to you in an e-mail, if that's helpful.
David Manthey: Yes. That sounds good.
Operator: And we will go next to Ryan Gilbert with BTIG.
Ryan Gilbert: Could you offer any commentary around end-market core organic growth trends just so far quarter-to-date in 2Q?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So there's -- I mean, I'll say this the right way. We have certainly continued to see strength across the end markets. There are certainly regional strengths that we notice. I would say the central and south part of the country certainly doing the strongest, but all of the markets are up geographically. Some mix between products, some mix between what we're seeing in sort of the single-family core, which I think has kept really good momentum versus the R&R, which we think we -- I think we've seen some ebbs and flows. Whenever you see significant increases in commodity prices, for example, that can sometimes put a headwind on the total demand. But on average, in total, everything -- each one of the pieces and in total, everything is green and positive year-to-date so far. Good momentum.
David Flitman: And as I said, Ryan, all 3 of our operating divisions, West, Central and East, had double-digit core organic growth in the quarter. So to Peter's point, very consistent. Some ebbs and flows in certain geographies, but very strong overall.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay. Great. And I guess, considering the increased adoption in value-added manufactured products, are you seeing any changes in builder interest levels in looking at more vertically integrated off-site solutions?
Peter Jackson: Well, I certainly think they would take it if we could build it fast enough. The challenge today is really just getting the capacity on the ground and available to them to shorten the existing lead times. But it's -- what I think is important to highlight here is that it's really opened the eyes, I think, of more builders than ever to the advantages to what offsite fabricated components can do for builders who want to professionalize and be really good at their art and craft of homebuilding.
Operator: And we will move now to Adam Baumgarten from Zelman.
Adam Baumgarten: Nice quarter. I guess to start, just could you give us a sense for how much price inflation contributed to the core organic sales growth of 15% in the quarter?
Peter Jackson: It's an important part of it. No question. We haven't broken out the PBM. We might at some point in the future, but it was meaningful.
Adam Baumgarten: Okay. Got it. And then just given the free cash flow outlook and the incremental $2 billion authorization, is there any reason to believe that share repurchases in '22 won't be at or above '21 levels?
Peter Jackson: Well, we certainly won't give a specific guidance like that, but I will say that our strategy is consistent. We're not going off script on this. We're going to prioritize investing in the company, making sure our debt is in the right position, making sure our investment in organic internal growth is right. We've committed to continuing to do smart, accretive tuck-in acquisitions. We're going to continue to do that, as you've seen. But we're generating a lot of cash. And we think our stock is undervalued, and we've highlighted that as a pathway that we think is a smart thing to do for investing.
Operator: And we will go next to Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Noah Merkousko: This is Noah Merkousko on for Trey. Congrats on the strong results.
David Flitman: Thanks, Noah.
Noah Merkousko: So first question, it sounded like you're anticipating some supply chain normalization here in the back half of the year. Do you think you'll start to see gross margins get closer or even be at that 27%, maybe as we exit the year?
Peter Jackson: I do think there'll be some normalization. I don't think we're going to get all the way back. There are certain products that will remain elevated for some time. Just barring a significant change that we don't really see coming, that would indicate that the other products would bring it down somewhat. But I would say at this point, no, we don't think that 27% by year-end is right, but a trend in that direction is reasonable to expect.
Noah Merkousko: All right. That makes sense. And then on my follow-up, I was hoping you could kind of frame the magnitude of the capacity expansion that you're doing in value add. And if we continue to see this kind of growth, do you think you'll run into any capacity constraints before you can get that new capacity online as we look out for the balance of this year?
Peter Jackson: Well, we certainly have capacity constraints now. Our lead times are longer than we would like them to be. We look at ways to improve our ability to deliver to customers all over the country. They talked about our board feet per man-hour productivity metric, where we're trying to get the -- more production out of the same. We've talked in the past about adding shifts. We continue to do that. We continue to add lines, and we continue to add plans. So we're double-digit equivalent plans in any given year in terms of everything we're doing. But then that is -- that comes with its own challenges in terms of available components to put into that, the people we need to do that. But it's certainly a focus on meeting that demand because it's impressive right now, and it's something that obviously we do very well.
David Flitman: And it is a disproportionate amount of the capital we're spending in total for the company into those value-added products.
Operator: We'll take our next question today from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.
Kurt Yinger: Here in Q1, there's been a lot of grumbling on the distribution side just around material availability and comments around -- kind of along the lines of we have more, we could sell it, and perhaps that's the case for you as well. But I think the growth pretty clearly highlights that you're getting more than your fair share of that vendor supply. And I was hoping you could just talk about what you think is driving that and what it says about the BFS platform.
David Flitman: Yes. Very good question. And we've commented on this in the past. I think the strength of our platform since the merger is enabling exactly what you highlighted there, which is we believe we're getting a disproportionate amount of share from our suppliers. These are long-standing relationships. And importantly, they're symbiotic relationships. We're equally important to our suppliers as they are to us, and we've got really good momentum in those relationships. To your point around supply, I think, incrementally, I would say, as I think I commented earlier, windows were slightly better than they were a year ago, interior doors, lumber is more readily available. But to your point, I would expect things like engineered wood products to be constrained in supplied for a long time to come. Exterior doors are still tight. Siding and trim are difficult. Some of that -- some of those products are even still on allocation. So it really is a mixed bag. And when we say we're incrementally better than we were a year ago, I mean exactly that. Some are better, some are no better. And there's some that are no better, unfortunately, we think, are going to be in tight supply for quite some time to come.
Kurt Yinger: Great. Okay. And then Peter, just a follow-up on the normalized gross margin and where you've been running over the last couple of quarters. Are there any product categories that really stick out in terms of significantly outperforming? Or has it been pretty broad-based?
Peter Jackson: It's pretty broad-based. I would say the timing of different products and how they moved throughout the last 1.5 years have been varied. But I think it's fair to say that it's a pretty wide range, pretty broad brush increase in pricing that we've seen come through the channel.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll go next to Collin Verron with Jefferies.
Collin Verron: Great quarter. I just wanted to turn to the productivity improvements. You talked about how you've hit your BMC synergy target, and you're pivoting to more productivity. Can you just talk about some of the larger examples you have? I know you mentioned the increased throughput. And then any color as to what that 3% to 5% of annual productivity improvement translates into dollars on an annual basis and what that does to your long-term incremental EBITDA margin guide for the base business?
Peter Jackson: Yes. Thanks, Collin. So the productivity is an exciting part of the business. I think there's a lot of history in our company at finding ways to drive improvement. And we think we have a real opportunity at this stage at our scale to really share those best practices and leverage people, process and technology to continue the momentum that we've seen with the synergy savings from BMC. It's a variety of things. It's process. It's redesigning certain things that we work on, but it hits a lot of different areas, right? It's reporting, driving over time. It's changing the architecture of certain organizations. It's improving our ability to optimize our tax rate. It is -- they're all things that we think are going to drive the business over the next long range of time. Good businesses do it regularly, year in, year out. And we certainly think that we have the capability to do it. What we're looking to do is make it a more normal part of our cadence and less dependent on big acquisitions to be a catalyst for that. So we did build a number into our long-range plan. So we certainly have accounted for that SG&A improvement in the numbers. I can be candid and tell you it's not equal to the 3% to 5% target we're going to set for ourselves. We're going to be more aggressive with what we push for. And we're going to commit to our long-range plan having a number lower than that, but success, nonetheless. So we certainly feel good about it, and we feel good about our track record and being able to continue to drive those types of improvements in a variety of areas.
Collin Verron: That's helpful color. And then I guess just turning to the macro environment quickly. I know there's a lot of debate out there about housing and concerns around what happens to BLDR's margins if new resi volumes start to decline. So I was just hoping you can give us a little bit of color as to what leverage you can pull to adjust to that kind of declining volume environment to protect your margin. And just help us think about how resilient your EBITDA margins would be if we do start to see any volume declines.
Peter Jackson: Yes. I mean that's a good question. While we're not at all concerned with what we think the market is doing or where it will go, we're also not blind to the idea that this is a cyclical business at times and mortgage rates are going up. So we're going to fall back on the playbook and the leadership that we're so lucky to have. We have a lot of experienced leaders that have been through these types of situations before. And when we look at our ability to perform, we're certainly very, very pleased with our starting point. To be more specific, we are clearly a better scale, a more efficient and leaner organization. We have better analytics and a better ability to monitor our performance than at any point in our history. We've taken out what is over $500 million in costs as a result of the combined mergers over the last 5 to 10 years. Those are really important things to consider when you look at what our business will perform -- how our business will perform in the face of a headwind environment. More specifically, we have some really obvious actions, right? We manage variable expenses every day. And as the volumes of our business shift, we're going to stay very focused on making sure we're sized accordingly. At our scale, we have a lot of pathways available to us. We also talked about operational excellence and productivity. Those are important characteristics that we will leverage into any sort of headwind environment.  And the other factor to think about is that when we are investing in our company, the biggest investment we make in any given year is really about working capital. And that working capital that we fund as we grow this business comes back to us in those moments when the business sees downturn. We've seen it in past years. We've done a good job at it, and we know we can do it in any environment. That's certainly something that I think is important for investors to keep in mind, just how much cash we spin off in any sort of downside environment. There are more on the list of things we can do, but we're certainly prepared for any sort of downturn. At the same time, we're confident that the market is strong and our momentum is very, very good in this market today.
Operator: And we will take our final question today from Alex Rygiel with B. Riley.
Alexander Rygiel: Nice quarter. Can you expand upon how BFS is going to get paid for Omni and digital platforms? And then how should we think about the profitability of this business in comparison to the legacy BFS business?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So the nature of our committed improvement in performance and financial performance when we did the Paradigm announcement, and subsequent to that, we feel good about confirming our estimates. That $1 billion of increased sales by year 5 is primarily driven by increased pull-through of what BFS sells. So if you think about what we're offering into the marketplace, it's improved capabilities for homebuilders and homebuyers to make the build process more efficient, right? It's taking plans. Having configurable visualizations is a powerful tool, especially when you link it to structural design. And that capability is unique and it's powerful in terms of what it allows us to do for our customers. It allows us to offer more options. It allows us to offer more value add. It makes us more efficient in our ability to give good quotes and be better partners for our customers. And it's just easier to place an order, easier to work with us when you're leveraging those technologies that Paradigm has developed. So that's where we believe we're going to make our money. It's incremental sales in those core business markets in value add. There'll be more. We'll certainly see licensing revenue. We think there are other revenue streams through the Paradigm platform. But initially, that's the biggest impact in terms of what we've committed to do.
Operator: And this does conclude our Q&A for today. I'll turn the call back to Michael Neese for any additional or closing remarks.
Michael Neese: Thanks, Priscilla, and thank you for your time today and for your interest in Builders FirstSource. Have a great day. We will be in New York City tomorrow for the BTIG conference, and we hope to see you there. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-03-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for joining Builders FirstSource Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Conference Call. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource, will now provide the company's opening remarks.
Michael Neese: Thank you, Britney. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. With me on the call are Dave Flitman, our CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our record fourth quarter and full year results for 2021. We've provided results that include BMC in the fourth quarter of 2021 and stand-alone BFS in the fourth quarter of 2020. We've also provided pro-forma results, as we own BMC in the fourth quarter of 2020. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS calculation excludes amortization of intangibles. The fourth quarter press release and investor presentation for today's call are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. On behalf of the entire company, we want to thank everyone who attended our Investor Day in-person or virtually and for your continued interest in and support of Builders FirstSource. I would encourage you to visit our Investor Day slides and commentary on our IR website at bldr.com. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes and they should not be considered in isolation for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they can be useful to investors in our earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call, contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Flitman: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2021 was a phenomenal year for our company. We achieved four straight quarters of double digit core organic growth, delivering above market performance and record results. I want to thank our more than 28,000 team members for an incredible year. I'm extremely proud of their outstanding results, despite the many supply chain challenges and strong demand that is impacting our industry. I'll cover three key topics on today's call, which speak to the strength of our business and the strategy that is enabling us to excel as a leader in our space. First, I'll provide an update on our record full-year results, including our base business and our view of the current state of the housing market. Peter will discuss our fourth quarter results in his remarks. Second, I'll provide an update on our tuck-in acquisitions that continue to strengthen our industry-leading market position. And finally, I'll provide an update on our digital strategy, which we laid out during our Investor Day in December. As you know, we are the nation's leading supplier of structural building and value-added products and services, primarily to the residential construction market. We are a consolidator in our industry with arguably the best balance sheet of anyone in the space. We have a long track record of successful execution, combined with a very strong value proposition, a highly differentiated platform, and an unwavering commitment to customer-focused solutions. We are now 14 months into combining BFS and BMC with plenty of low-hanging fruit remaining for us to continue to harvest as we look to accelerate growth, capture synergies, and drive new productivity. Before I review our full-year results, I would like to highlight an important slide from our Investor Day. As we discussed during that event, we believe it is important to assess our results on a base business basis to better appreciate the underlying growth and profitability of our company by normalizing commodity prices. As you can see on Slide 3, over the next four years, we expect our base business to deliver a 10% CAGR on the top line, a 15% adjusted EBITDA CAGR and, importantly, a 50 basis points per year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin for a total of 200 basis points by 2025. Given the strength of our cash flow and the leverage target that we laid out last year between 1 and 2 times adjusted base business EBITDA, we expect to have $7 billion to $10 billion of capital to deploy through 2025, and we will put that capital to work through continued investments in innovation and organic growth, accretive tuck-in M&A, and returning capital to shareholders as evidenced by the recent announcement of our third $1 billion share repurchase program in the last seven months. Turning to Slide 4. On a pro forma basis, we delivered an impressive single family core organic growth of approximately 28% in 2021. Meaningfully exceeding the single family starts growth of 13.6%. We produced record sales of nearly $20 billion to deliver $3.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA and a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%. As you can see on Slide 5, our base business is strong as we grew sales by 26% to $15.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA by an outstanding 63%, while our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 250 basis points to 11.2%. Our momentum carried through the fourth quarter, in which we delivered $4.6 billion of revenue and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.1% on the strength of robust demand for housing, pricing discipline, and our continued focus on serving our customers with our value-added offerings. Last month, we attended the International Builders’ Show in Orlando. Based on our conversations with many customers and suppliers, we believe demand for single family housing will remain strong headed into the spring homebuilding season. We are encouraged from these anecdotal conversations, but more importantly, by the double digit top line increases that we have seen in our results so far this year. The number of single family homes under construction increased 27% in 2021 versus 2020. One fact I'd like to remind you of is that there are currently more single-family homes under construction across the country than there have been in more than 14 years. And the homebuilder backlog is currently at the highest level it's been in the last 15 years. Backlogs, in fact, were an estimated 145,000 single-family units authorized, but not yet started as of last month, up 32% year-over-year, an encouraging sign of continued demand strength. On Slide 6, you will see that we also remain focused on executing our strategy of investing in inorganic growth. We have completed seven acquisitions for $1.2 billion since we closed on the BMC merger, and we believe we can invest at least $500 million each year in accretive M&A to augment our organic growth strategy. And as such, we will remain a disciplined consolidator in our industry for many years to come as we continue to focus on expanding an attractive high-growth markets and product categories. On December 31, we closed on our most recent acquisition of National Lumber, the largest independent building materials supplier in New England. National Lumber operates 16 facilities and employs more than 700 people across Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island with a diverse mix of products and end markets. This acquisition adds to our value-added portfolio and provides a favorable R&R mix in the New England area where we previously did not have a presence. We're excited to welcome the National Lumber team members to the Builders FirstSource family. Now, let me provide a brief update on our digital strategy on Slide 7. As a reminder, during our Investor Day, we provided an in-depth commentary on Paradigm and how they anchor our digital strategy. Our teams are working with our customers to pilot our technology, aiming to improve the pre-construction process, create more accurate material lists, bring our supply partners into a digital workflow and better engage homebuyers. We're actively pursuing several initiatives to advance our digital transformation. Among them, we continue to deploy paradigm estimate across more markets to accelerate customer quotations, and we are working on a specific pilot with a customer in South Carolina to improve our understanding of how to connect the home builders front-end sales process, utilizing paradigm visualization technology to enable a full band execution model and enhance home-building efficiency. We're making investments and executing projects that we believe will put us at the center of the homebuilding ecosystem. While these concepts may be basic, relative to other industries, they simply do not yet exist the scale in residential homebuilding. We believe we're on our path to revolutionize our industry for the benefit of our customers and to us, this represents an incremental $1 billion growth opportunity over the next five years. Next, on Slide 8, I'm pleased to announce that we've delivered $32 million in BMC merger-related cost synergies during the fourth quarter for a total of $108 million for the full year 2021, I can also announce that we have achieved a synergy run rate of $160 million as we exited 2021, well in excess of our $130 million to $150 million commitment at the announcement of the merger, and we captured those synergies two years faster than what we initially projected. I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome of our merger integration. With our merger-related synergy capture now officially completed, we have turned our attention to ramping up our internal productivity efforts. In 2022, we expect to capture total P&L productivity and synergy savings of $150 million, and we'll provide updates on our progress as the year proceeds. I believe great companies, and we are one, drive productivity on an ongoing basis and reinvest a portion of those savings to fuel future growth. We unveiled our BFS 1-TEAM operating system at our Investor Day, and the best way to think about that is continuous improvement in three key areas of our business. The first two are building people and building excellence. And as we do those two well, we will deliver the third, which is driving growth. Long term, we are targeting 3% to 5% of the annual productivity improvement through our BFS 1-TEAM operating system. Looking at our progress as a combined company, we are clearly leveraging the strength of our industry-leading product portfolio, national network, and disciplined operating model alongside the robust demand environment to deliver exceptional growth, profitability, and free cash flow. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities to invest both organically and with M&A while returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases. With a thoughtful and disciplined approach to deploying our capital, we are transforming the homebuilding industry through our investments in digital, expanding value-added offerings for our customers, and making strategic acquisitions that bolster and extend our industry leadership position. For 2022, we expect a continued strong execution by our team, combined with our diverse portfolio of value-added offerings, will enable us to deliver double-digit net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth in our base business. Our team members continue to impress me at every turn from the sales forward to the yard and everywhere in between. Their commitment to excellence is where it keeps this company moving forward, and I love to highlight their collective and individual progress. For example, Alonzo Christian, the delivery manager at our Williamsburg, Virginia lumber location, gets his team started at 5:00 AM to ensure that Builders FirstSource trucks are the first out every morning to maximize seeing our customers each day. Not only does this give us a strategic advantage, but it shows our customers that BFS will be there for them when they need it, especially as they confront supply chain and labor challenges. With Alonzo's leadership, the yard runs efficiently and safely with no recordable injuries over the past five years, coupled with remarkably low-operating expenses and team member turnover. In total, we've made great progress in keeping our people safe. In the last year, we delivered an 18% reduction in recordable injuries across the company, beating our 10% reduction target, and we have another 10% improvement targeted for this year. It's a journey that never ends and we're getting better, but we're not going to stop. Our goal is zero. I'm grateful to team members like Alonzo who embody our core values, putting people first and showing our customers why BFS is the most valuable partner in the industry. With that, let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q4 results and provide an update on our new share repurchase program and our 2022 updated financial guidance.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I want to add my thanks to our team members for delivering an outstanding and record 2021. We wouldn't have been able to deliver such fantastic results without your hard work, your dedication, and your focus on our customers. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our fourth quarter results compared to combined pro forma results from the prior-year quarter. Second, I'll update you on our capital deployment. And third, I'll provide you with our updated guidance for the full-year 2022. Let's begin with our Q4 performance on Slide 9. We had net sales of $4.6 billion for the quarter, which increased approximately 24% compared to the combined pro forma prior-year period. Value-added core organic sales grew by an estimated 28%, highlighting our work to meet the strong demand across our value-added channels, especially impressive given the continued supply chain constraints. Despite the price volatility, commodity price inflation benefited net sales by 5% and acquisitions contributed another 7%. Gross profit was $1.5 billion, an increase of 52% compared with the combined pro forma prior year period. Gross margin increased 610 basis points to 32.1%, driven mainly by cost increases coupled with disciplined pricing, as well as effective and timely sourcing in a volatile, supply constrained marketplace. For the full year, our gross margin increased 360 basis points to 29.4%. Following this recent performance and our increasing mix of value-added products, we believe our normalized gross margins will now be approximately 27% or better compared to our prior expectation of 26.5%, a 50 basis point increase. For the quarter, SG&A was $864 million, an increase of approximately $189 million or 28% compared to the combined pro-forma prior-year period, driven primarily by expense related to the BMC merger and other acquisitions, including amortization expense of acquired intangibles and onetime charges. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A increased by 60 basis points to 18.6%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 110% to $793.4 million, driven by solid demand across our key customer end markets, combined with disciplined pricing on increasing costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 17.1%, which increased 700 basis points compared to the year-over-year pro-forma period. In the fourth quarter, net income was $442.5 million or $2.31 per share compared to combined pro forma net income of $200.7 million or $0.96 per share in the same period a year ago. Adjusted net income was $532.4 million or $2.78 of adjusted EPS. This compares to a combined pro forma adjusted net income of $225.5 million or $1.08 of adjusted EPS in the prior-year period. The 136.1% increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher income tax and SG&A expense. The 157.4% increase in adjusted EPS is driven by the increase in adjusted net income coupled with our reduced share count, which I'll cover in a moment. Now, let's turn to cash flow. Our fourth quarter operating cash flow was approximately $840 million, driven by increased net sales and the impact of inflation. Free cash flow was $774 million during the quarter. Turning to Slide 12, for 2021, our full year free cash was an inflow of $1.5 billion, primarily driven by the impact of commodity inflation and core organic growth. The free cash flow for 2021 was a bit lower than our forecasted guide as a result of higher than expected sales driving an increase in year-end working capital due in large part to rising commodity prices later in the year. Let's turn to our capital deployment. For the full year of 2021, our M&A bolt-on strategy resulted in our purchasing seven companies for approximately $1.2 billion. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 16.5 million shares of BFS common stock at an average price of $70.89 for a total cost of approximately $1.2 billion. Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in August of 2021, we have repurchased 30.6 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $2 billion for an average price of $65.43 per share. That's more than 15% of our shares outstanding while maintaining a rock solid balance sheet. We have completed the share repurchase programs authorized in August and November of 2021. In February 2022, the board then authorized another $1 billion share repurchase program. As we mentioned during the Investor Day, we plan to deploy $5 billion to $7 billion of capital by 2025. Of the $3 billion of share repurchase authorizations announced today, $2 million pass towards our target. We accelerated $700 million of the second-billion authorization at the end of 2021 and finished the remaining $300 million in January. As you may have seen, last month, we completed a private offering of an additional $300 million of our 2032 notes at an issue price equal to 105% of our value. Net proceeds from the offerings were used to repay borrowings on the 2026 ABL facility. In addition, the company amended the 2026 facility to increase the total commitments by an aggregate amount of $400 million, resulting in a new $1.8 billion amended credit facility. Also on Slide 12, our pro forma net debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.7 times our base business EBITDA. Excluding our ABL, we have no long term debt maturities until 2027, and our total liquidity was over $700 million as of year-end, consisting of about $686 million in net borrowing availability and $43 million in cash. Our fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results were tremendous. The merger of BFS and BMC has gone better than expected, the combined field sales team is driving higher margin products and delivering value to our customers, and our balance sheet is strong. Let's change gears and discuss our 2022 full year outlook on Slide 13. We continue to see strong underlying demand in new housing construction. We are estimating single family starts growth across our geographies in the middle single digits. R&R and Multi Family growth in the low-to-mid-single digits. Going forward, we are going to provide you with our base business guide on net sales and EBITDA as we believe this is a better measurement of our performance and assumes constant commodity costs at $400 per thousand. We'll continue to provide you with a commodity price sensitivity chart to allow you to incorporate your own commodity estimates into your models. We expect base business net sales to grow approximately 8% to 12% over 2021 net sales of $15.7 billion. We expect base business adjusted EBITDA to grow 12% to 18% over 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion. The growth in these metrics is consistent with the long-term plan we communicated our December 7 Investor Day. CapEx is projected to be approximately $400 million in 2022. The increase from prior year is due to adding capacity in several of our facilities, largely related to value-added growth initiatives that will drive higher-margin results. In 2022, we expect productivity gains will contribute another $150 million to EBITDA, of which $50 million will come from the realization of BMC synergies. We believe free cash flow will be in the range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion, assuming an average commodity price in the range of $600 to $1,000 for the year. This assumes working capital coming down due to lower commodity prices in the back half of 2022. On Slide 14, we provide the sensitivity chart I mentioned, providing a way to think about our total sales and total adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2022 at various static commodity price points. It's important to note that our base business outlook is the same under any of these commodity assumptions. While we are not providing explicit guidance for total sales in total adjusted EBITDA, we believe this table is helpful in understanding the relationship between expected base commodity performance and total results under various commodity assumptions. We believe 2022 will be another strong year of growing our value-added products and profitability, outperforming the market, introducing innovative technology, and driving operational excellence across our geographic footprint. I'm proud of our 2021 performance and excited for what is in store for 2022. With that, let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.
Dave Flitman: Thank you, Peter. In summary, the homebuilding industry is resilient, underbuilt, and we believe will continue to grow in 2022. As a result of the hard work of our team members every day, our company's momentum remains strong. We are leveraging our industry-leading platform to grow and sustain our profitability and will continue to benefit from our robust record free cash flow generation. We are poised to transform the homebuilding industry through our investments in value-added products and services and expanding our digital offerings. Our M&A pipeline remains strong and attractive, and we have the balance sheet to continue to execute on this important pillar of our strategy. We will remain disciplined in doing so. We are committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment and in our most recent $1 billion Committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment, and our most recent $1 billion share repurchase authorization is another indication of this commitment. We have a very clear and simple business strategy that our team is fully committed to implementing, and I've never been more excited about our potential in our future. Britney, let’s please open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Matthew Bouley: So, I want to start the question on the digital slide. Very helpful color there and everything you’ve done for the past few months. Can you - I guess a two-partner. Number one, can you speak specifically that minimum viable product, is that the integration of Builder Omni and Estimator, kind of what stage are you in there? And part two is just more broadly, what are some of the next batch benchmarks that we, as analysts and investors can look out for on the digital progress this year? Thank you.
Dave Flitman: Sure. Great question, Matt. We outlined a lot of this at our Investor Day, but as we anticipated and communicated in the Investor Day, we do anticipate the next year to 18 months to be heavily development-focused. So to your point, we are taking Estimate, Omni for homebuilders and building this transactional capability that we spoke about. Importantly, in terms of milestones, again, we're going to be headed down this year, pouring in a lot of energy around development. And I think, we spoke about one pilot that we have going on in South Carolina. There are several other pilots that we have going on testing various theories of our case and how we might put this platform together. And I just would expect that we will continue the share progress as we learn through those and certainly as we work towards the commercialization of the platform through the course of time.
Matthew Bouley: Thanks, Dave. And then secondly, I want to ask on that step up in CapEx. Peter, I heard you say you're sort of pressing on adding capacity. I think in the past, we had thought that even the truss plans were relatively low spend from a dollar perspective. So, I guess the question is just sort of what level of capacity are you looking to add here? Does this also include kind of step up in digital investment and other automation? Just what are some of the pieces of that stepped up CapEx guide? Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Yes. Thanks, Matt. That's a great question. I think you hit the nail on the head with your initial comments. The focus is really around value add. And what you're seeing here is that the same fleet size of the company having grown substantially as well as the acceleration we're trying to invest in. So this is new facilities. We have a number of those and we'll continue to talk about them. This is new lines within existing facilities. It's new equipment within existing lines, in existing facilities, and as well as the maintenance and the core of the operation rights. We're talking about fleet and force and all the different markets and things that we would need throughout the business. A little bit of inflation in there, but the bulk of it is core, the core maintenance and a substantial increase on that value add - value add side of the business. We're seeing a ton of demand. We're certainly seeing capacity particularly in hot markets be used up very, very quickly. And we're trying to make sure we stay on our front foot and stay aggressive given our cash flow and what we're able to do with it.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open
Unidentified Analyst: It’s actually, [Chris Cohen]. Congrats on the results. Very impressive stuff so far. I want to touch on the free cash flow guidance for next year, $1.6 billion to $2 billion is very impressive, particularly given the step up in CapEx. So, I was wondering, obviously, commodity - the commodity outlook is going to dictate the range a bit, but I was hoping you could help give us your thoughts on what you're expecting from the non-commodity side of business. Obviously, incrementals have been very strong so far this year, and I was wondering you could touch on the outlook there and some of the other puts and takes embedded in that guide.
Peter Jackson: Sure. Yes. I mean, to talk to the basics, we are expecting to continue to see good growth. You know we have to give you a commodity range in order to make the cash flow work. Right? It’s not a base business metric. Cash flow isn't leased. So we did give you a midpoint. Your guess is as good or better than mine in terms of what commodities will be. Our job is to make sure we continue to deliver on profitable business related to it. But the overall growth - you saw top line in the base business being a midpoint of 10% in line with what we did, too, in Investor Day. Again the EBITDA growing midpoint of that 15% in line with what we said on Investor Day. In that fall through, we think we'll continue to work in line with our discipline around working capital. And what we've seen is it's still a healthy market, while there is certainly a lack of availability and supply in certain key areas. We are managing both our air and inventory very well, and I think the balance of our working capital is still healthy, so that combination, along with the other components which we have here in terms of the inputs on the cash flow are pretty much in line with prior year. And we think that certainly supports our commentary around the strong cash flow that we have seen and we expect to continue to see from this business in the coming years and kind of circles back to that Investor Day commentaries. We think by 2025, we’re going to be deploying between $7 billion and $10 billion of cash, this is one installment of that cash.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood. And just turning to capital allocations, I was hoping you could maybe give us your thoughts on priorities here. Obviously, the free cash flow supports a lot of options that are just - just your latest thoughts.
Dave Flitman: Yes, I would - this is Dave. I don't expect any change in our approach to capital allocation. We always have said and stated publicly that our first priority is to invest and grow organically inside our company. And as Peter just highlighted for you, we have great opportunities and have been doing that. Secondly, is finding the right accretive M&A to do and appoint for our $1.2 billion of spend in that area last year. And finally, where we have excess cash, we will return it to our shareholders. So, I don't expect any near-term shift in what we said are our priorities.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.
Ketan Mamtora: And let me add my congratulations as well. I was just curious if you can just give us quick update on how some of these recent tuck-in M&As have gone and sort of your early read on how the integration is going there, whether it's the Arizona [indiscernible] in California?
Dave Flitman: Yes. I would just say that every one of the acquisitions that we did last year, we were excited about the day we announced them, and we're even more excited about them once we've got through the integration. Our most recent one, National Lumber, we've got a great team up there. Again, that's an area where we didn't have a footprint. As you know, not a tremendous region for starters, but they have an increased mix of R&R business and are the market leader across those three states. So consistent with how we've approached those acquisitions in times past, we're looking to augment our capability and our mix through value-added R&R and strengthen our footprint either in geographies where we do have a presence and are underrepresented in some of the value-added portions of the business or go in with scale into a market where we haven't been like you just saw us do in National - with National. And also s you saw us do with Alliance last summer in Arizona.
Ketan Mamtora: And then just on the supply chain side, I'm just curious on what you guys are seeing in terms of material availability, so absenteeism from just a labor standpoint. Is that really driving growth and offsite performance as you talk with your customers.
Dave Flitman: Yes. I mean, we've seen continued trends consistent with what we've talked about as recently as Investor Day. Those labor challenges and supply chain challenges have not abated. There might be pockets of improvement in some product areas but, broadly, is still challenged. I think that's consistent with what you've heard on a recent homebuilder commentary. And again, our value-added component adoption in particular, is strong. We've been driving that trend for a number of years, and we've just continued to see that accelerate really broadly across all of our geographies as our customers have gotten more comfortable with the offerings, importantly, continue to fight those labor challenges, which we believe are going to persist for a long time to come. So, we see strong tailwind both in terms of demand as well as the adoption of the value-added portions of our business.
Operator: We will take our next question from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman. Your line is open.
Adam Baumgarten: Just thinking about maybe the new construction business. Just what are you guys seeing on homebuilder cycle times? It seems like they extended a bit in 4Q. Just curious if year-to-date here, if you’ve seen that continue, or maybe there's some stabilization?
Dave Flitman: Well, I think as you point out, Adam, I mean, we saw cycle times extend really going back to early days of the pandemic, given the ramp up in the demand and the supply chain challenges, which kind of overlaid with that. We really haven't seen that abate significantly through the course of time here. And importantly, I think, even if we were going to see some improvement on the supply chain side, what happened when Omicron hit was we saw a lot of our suppliers face those challenges late last year, and in particular in January of this year. And we're just unable really to catch up on the backlog. So, we really haven't seen any abatement of the supply chain challenges broadly. Like I said earlier, maybe a few pockets of improvement, but things are kind of status quo on that front from our view.
Adam Baumgarten: And then just thinking about guidance, the base business revenue growth of 8% to 12%, how should we think about the price versus volume split there?
Peter Jackson: Well, I mean, we've certainly seen strong margins over the last year. There has been a lot of work as we've described in the past that improving our management of price, we've seen a tremendous amount of movement on the cost side and trying to stay very disciplined in their pass-through disciplines around that as well. As you look at both 2021 and 2022, we do believe there was some improvement in price. We haven’t given the split historically. We probably won't do that for the foreseeable future, but certainly seeing both of those as being tailwinds for us in both 20221 and 2022.
Operator: We will take our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.
Trey Grooms: Dave, you mentioned seeing double-digit growth so far this year. I missed it in the comments maybe. But was that overall or was that in the base business?
Dave Flitman: That was overall across our business. But importantly, we're talking about kind of organic volume growth across the company here in the first couple of months.
Trey Grooms: Okay. Organic. Got it. And then on the incremental margins, I know you touched on it a little bit earlier, but just to get into the weeds a little bit more here. You put up strong incremental margins on the base business in 2021. And in 2022, the guide implies kind of a wide range there. I think it's like 12% to 26%, I think it might be the range on incremental margins. And I think the midpoint, something like 17%. So, could you talk about what are some of the puts and takes there that could get us to the high or low end of that range, given that it is a pretty wide range there?
Peter Jackson: Yes, Trey. This is Peter. So, my goal there was to give you guys a range of our outcomes. I think we all understand the volatility of some of that inputs this year. We've certainly got a few curveballs thrown at us already in 2022. I - what I will tell you as we build out our plans and look at the materials that the field is prepared in conjunction with their conversations with customers with our plans for new facilities, for productivity, for all the initiatives we're managing internally. We are really on that midpoint. That's where we think it'll be. Now, certainly, the potential for movements up and down and the supply chain availability movements up and down to starts that we think that will influence within supply chain is really the biggest limiting factor today. External factors, probably not as big of a deal, I don't think we're seeing a lot of risk associated with anything to do with what's going on in Europe and Ukraine right now. I think most of what we're looking at is the work around clearing those supply chain backlogs and continuing to get labor into job sites or at least into manufacturing facilities that need those job sites to make sure we're keeping the process flowing. But those are the big variables.
Operator: We will take our next question from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group. Your line is now open.
Steven Ramsey: To start on windows, millwork, and doors, you’ve got strong organic growth there. You talked about material availability improving. Was that broadly where certain products within that group? And then secondly, it seems like production from the manufacturers was more challenged in December and January with COVID. Do you think this tightens again in the next few months?
Dave Flitman: And just my comments earlier weren't aimed at any particular product category. We have seen a little abatement in a few. I might mention interior doors, but exteriors are still very tight, so it really varies. Windows might be incrementally better on lead times than they were six months ago, but they're still double-digit weeks kind of lead time. So, that's my point. Incremental improvement but not any major relief broadly across the supply chain, Steven, is what I point to.
Steven Ramsey: And then CapEx nearly doubling year-over-year for greater revenue capacity. Is this broad CapEx or is this targeted geographically? And then how much of this is potentially delayed spend from 2021?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So geographically speaking, I think it's a little bit predictable. Where we're putting new capacity is where there is a lot of growth. The smile phase or the banana phase, whatever descriptor you choose, those southern and coastal stars-focused communities is where we're particularly strong and certainly seeing, over time, an increased adoption of that manufactured product offering whereas, historically, maybe it wasn't as concentrated as northern state. So a lot of focus definitely in value add. And in those states, I don't think there's much in the way of catch-up. Off at the top of my head, I can't think of anything that we've deferred at all. It's somewhat to do maybe catchup if you want to attribute it to supply chain and availability issues. We've seen a little bit of improved relief in some of those categories. Again, not as much as we'd like but, as Dave mentioned, incremental improvement.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Manthey with Baird. Your line is open.
David Manthey: First off, on the 2021 base of revenues and EBITDA on Slide 13, is it correct to assume that those figures exclude the divested gypsum operations and exclude all 2021 acquisitions?
Peter Jackson: So, we did exclude - well, because the business wasn't owned, we do not have anything included. We didn't go back into the prior periods and pull it out. It's actuals. To that end, what we purchased the component of the year is included, so you'll get the lapping effect of the 2022 or on 2022 for both of those.
David Manthey: Yes, mainly to follow up on that definition. But just as you look at the 2022 growth outlook and then the information on Slide 14, those include known acquisitions then is what you're saying, Peter?
Peter Jackson: They include closed acquisitions. Right? So, we, of course, are continuing as we described to pursue M&A opportunities, but we don't have any forecast in there in 2022 for what incremental ones, just what we've already closed as of year-end. So, including national, but nothing beyond that.
David Manthey: Okay. And then another definition factor here. Year-to-date, obviously, lumber has averaged well over $1,000 per 1,000, but does your assumption of $400 lumber include the two months that are actuals and then the remainder at $400 or less than $400. Or are you just straight lining $400 from January 1, 2022 without regard of what actually happened here year-to-date?
Peter Jackson: Yes - no, that’s a great question. And I think our goal of here is to be very, very static in all of the commentary we're making about commodities. Everything based assumes $400 for every period, for every year always. We’ll let you know of that $400. We think it's appropriate to change that $400 at some point, but for the time being, $400 is the number and applies equally to all those periods. So, why –it’s why I’ve used the phrase static a few times, because as we all know, commodities is - if it's one thing, it's not static. But in order to give you a nice clean comparison to help you understand the core of the business, that base business metric, that's why we use that. So our number, if you want to think about it this way for cash, assumes that $600 to $1,000, that's an average. It’s an average for the year, and it would assume that we would be in the midpoint of that in order to generate that kind of cash flow. And so, if you're thinking about the sensitivity page, we'd like you to think about your average for the year, sort not just emulate or replicate a static commodity number for the year. Does that help?
Operator: We will take our next question from Collin Verron with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Collin Verron: Just given the rising interest rates and affordability pressures, what gives you confidence that single family starts will grow in that mid-single digit range? And I guess, how are you thinking about growth in 2023 and 2024 if rates continue to rise and pressure affordability?
Dave Flitman: Yes. I would say obviously we've been talking about affordability challenges for quite some time. I would characterize our confidence around two things. First of all, a lot of in-depth conversations with our customers and suppliers as we've talked about the strength of the backlog, which I commented on. And importantly, two underlying fundamentals here that are probably much different than in times past. First is just the demand strength that we've seen over the last several years. We're talking about millennials who's driving the home buying, particularly the first time buyer or this first time step-up buyer. That dynamic has not changed. And secondly and importantly, and we've talked about this at length, the huge overbuilding that's occurred in this industry over the last decade and overlaid with that strong demand. We have a lot of confidence that that will continue to drive growth not only this year, but for a long time to come. At some point, the interest rates could become a factor. We're certainly not hearing that at current levels from our customers today.
Collin Verron: And then how should we think about the cadence of base business sales growth in 2022 just given the pretty difficult comps that you're going to be facing and the current backlog of homes that are still under construction in the US?
Dave Flitman: Yes. So, on the base business side, it's consistent, right, with the overall growth. You're right about the costs getting more difficult, right? And we had a pretty nice stretch there of solid double-digit percentage growth. We think that will slow this year, obviously. But I think as you look at the actions being taken in the market, we hope to see or we expect to see incremental, as Dave mentioned, over time, relief on supply chain side. And we think that’ll roll out of the market to continue to accelerate. Again, that demand, for a variety of reasons, we think is very, very healthy. So there's room for growth, both from orders already taken but we think from customers eager to get in as well.
Collin Verron: Okay. And just to clarify, I guess does that mean that growth - sales growth will be more back half-weighted in 2022 just given the difficult comps and supply chain loosening or do you think you can deliver pretty consistent growth throughout the year?
Dave Flitman: I think it's more of the latter. We saw growth all year. We'll need to continue to see incremental as the year goes on. We think that will be supported with that relief on the supply chain side.
Operator: We will take our next question from Keith Hughes with Truist. Your line is now open.
Keith Hughes: Thank you. On the base business growth that you've highlighted, I assume your manufacturing products will be growing faster than that. Give me an idea of what you're thinking in this guidance and how much can you - I mean, what's your limit average there given capacity?
Peter Jackson: We don't break it out at that manufacture product level in terms of specific guide, but you're right. It is growing faster. I think that really what you're seeing now, Keith, is the next leg of the growth that we've been hoping for, and that's the expansion of the utilization of those manufactured products into markets that historically haven't adopted it. Some of the southern markets where you have not seen the adoption of manufactured products because there was a substantial amount of available framing labor, and it was relatively cheap. The nature of the speed of the recovery and how aggressive homebuilders are being trying to get homes built, trying to compensate for the extended build cycles is really, really common to fruit on the tree of manufactured products. We are seeing rapid growth there. We talk about manufacturing - or how value add was up 28%, high 20s across the board for 2021. Those are heady numbers, but we think we can continue to see growth. The challenge for us is we sort of harvested the second shift stop, now you're talking about really putting to work the numbers that we're investing in, that real new capacity. We feel good about it. We have a great track record of doing it, and we expect it will continue to grow those strong double digits definitely better than the rest of the business throughout 2022.
Operator: We will take our next question from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Kurt Yinger: I just wanted to start out on the pricing side in Q4. Could you just talk about some of the dynamics that drove commodity to be a year-over-year tailwind? Just looking at the composites on the lumber and panel side, kind of flat to lower. And then as we think about modeling the impact from commodity fluctuations going forward, is there a certain level of other inflation being passed through there that we should be considering in terms of maybe dampening that downside?
Dave Flitman: So, well, a couple of comments. First of all, you're right. It was pretty dynamic, right? We had talked openly about how we felt like it was important to use $400 as our long-term average We're at about the 10-year average for commodity prices. And I think it's fair to say that I took a little grief over putting that number out there, but we kind of saw that number in September. So, a lot of volatility last year to go to 1,600 to 400 million back to 1,300 plus right now. A lot of that flow through in terms of volatility in the fourth quarter. The fall and when the products came through, then the run, and when we started to see the impacts on working capital in sales, that’s a big piece. Those are always tricky to guide you on and to give you some good tools. It's the turn that's always the most difficult part model, as you know. What we expect to happen is sort of consistent and then we will continue to focus on passing through cost pricing on replacement, staying disciplined about what we have availability on and being careful to support customers and be clear and candid with them about what they can get and what they can't and why but are disciplined around pricing, around inventory purchases and around inventory management. And on the ground days, it continues and we will continue to invest in it over time. I think that to reiterate something that maybe I - maybe you heard me say in the past, we do think there is a moderation on the amount of gross margin tailwind and headwind versus who we have been in past the year. We think as prices inflate and deflate as they do in commodities, we are seeing less of an expansion and contraction in our gross margins than we have historically.
Kurt Yinger: And I guess kind of leads in to my second question. Could you just talk about how the gross margins could you just talk about how the gross margins trended over the course of the quarter and what you're seeing in Q1 as commodities have really taken off? And then second, is that 27% kind of normalized gross margin, what's embedded, I guess, loosely within that profitability grid in terms of at the different lumber and panel price levels?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So, let me draw a distinction that that normalized is ignoring anything unusual or outside of the base business metric for commodity prices. So, just to say right, this is at normal banks at normal prices, we think we're at 27%. There is another layer that I'm sure you appreciate. I think we are seeing unusual margins based on the supply chain issues that we're experiencing right now. I don't want to give anybody the impression that 29%, 32% margins or the reduced margins if you exclude the commodity component and just look at phase that those are normal. We think we're in a bit of a displaced time right now. We think over time, things will refer back to a normalized gross margins of around 27% or better. Obviously, we're doing our best to manage that carefully, to improve our productivity, to add overall performance to those gross margin numbers. But we're trying to give people an insight that as we've seen that value add grow and as we've seen our business stabilize around the country, we feel very good about our ability to revalue for what we're providing and to partner with customers. And we think 27% gross margin is a better basis. We've certainly seen strong performance both in the fourth quarter and into Q1. I think that's been pretty consistent, even though we're laughing more difficult comps on the revenue line.
Operator: We will take our next question from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is open.
Stanley Elliott: Thank you, guys for fitting me in. A quick question about the national lumber, you mentioned the integration’s going well. That’s got such a higher mix of our R&R, is there any way to comment on what you're learning from that particular market. As at the Analyst Day, you guys talked about trying to expand the R&R part of the business overall. Curious what you've learned so far from that integration?
Peter Jackson: Well, it's early days and obviously, more color to come on that. We’ve got them for - right at two months. We got a company full of great people that have a very strong market position, and that's more an R&R market up there. So, what we are learning is the product portfolio that they have, the growth that they've developed consistently over time aimed at R&R. I’m sure there’ll be significant learnings for us that we can expand our thinking around, across the company through the course of time. But it's early days now. We've been working to get the teams aligned and make sure that the team was confident there that we weren't coming in to change anything significantly in the business, and get them in part of the family. And that's really the - it’s early days to draw in significant conclusions.
Dave Flitman: The only thing I'd add is that national joins a freely group of R&R businesses within the Builders FirstSource family already, TWParry, the Dixieline business, Pinar's business. We certainly have R&R exposure around the country. So really, we're to be able to learn from each other, right, share best practices, look for ways to grow and continue to make that an important part of our growth now.
Stanley Elliott: No. A good fit for sure. And then quickly on the - some of the Paradigm tests you guys are doing in South Carolina and other markets, to what extent are you guys pushing kind of this whole house take off like you've done or like you talked about at the Analyst Day, and what other products that you're trying to put into the kind of the systems here?
Peter Jackson: Well, obviously, that's the vision, and that's where we're going. It's early days, and as I mentioned, a lot of heavy development we're going into to develop the theory of that case, and we're going to do it in pieces through the course of time. And that's really what the different pilots are aimed at - or developing those statements with customers and iterating our design and our thinking as we need to. So, certainly have not changed the focus on where we're heading. And we'll share more about our progress here as we make it.
Operator: We will take our next question from Reuben Garner with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.
Reuben Garner: Thanks. Good morning, guys, and congrats on the strong close to the year. Peter, you mentioned or you were discussing the 27% gross margin. Just a clarification about that. So, the - what mix are you assuming there? Is that 60:40 mix between the manufactured or value-added products and commodity? Or, I guess, just help me walk through that math. And maybe what's changed the most from the way you guys used to talk about gross margin a few years ago? Is it more mix driven? Is it synergies from the all the deals you've done? Is it just operational improvements, or is it a combination of all three?
Dave Flitman: Yes. The end of your second question, first, certainly a combination of all of them. On page five, you can see our base business product mix that you should think about in light of that 27%. And over time, that number associated with value-added product mix continues to increase. Certainly, we do well with specialty products as well, but that increase in value-added business the incremental margin that we're able to see in that part of the business because of the incremental value we're providing customers, that combines for us to give us confidence. But you're right. We are working on productivity. There are initiatives within our manufacturing facilities, discipline in pricing management, operations management, all the synergies we've seen from the combination of the businesses we purchased and, just in general, that growth of the business and improved leverage from our improved scale. So it is a combination, but that's a really positive thing, we think, for us being able to get more and more comfortable with that 27% plus normalized gross margin number on base business.
Reuben Garner: That's helpful. And then the - more of a longer-term strategic type question with the software play. So you guys have some expertise or some capabilities already in some of the categories in the house, windows, and doors or trusses or other manufactured products. But as you build out the software's capabilities to get into some other areas that you maybe don't participate in, say like, I don't know, paint, drywall, whatever they may be, do we - should we look for you guys to maybe build that out organically? Would that require future M&A? How do we think about longer term and how are you going to build that capability out?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I would say think about it in the context right now of us building this platform to sell more of our products to our existing customers and look for ways to add new customers. We talked at Investor Day about - and in other conversations about playing to our strengths around design capability, our vision around the whole house design and embedding our products in there. I think it's way too premature to talk about what other products might look like. Certainly, you've heard me say out loud, we don't need to back or integrate into other product categories at the moment. That's certainly not part of the vision today. It's hunkering down, building out the capability that aligns with our strengths today and getting more of them into our model. So…
Operator: And we will take our next question from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG. Your line is open.
Ryan Gilbert: First question - the first question is just on - just the really strong growth you saw in single family core organic, up 14% against. Housing starts maybe, single family starts anyways, down 5% in the fourth quarter. Do you think that differential between the two represents maybe a lag between the single family starts growth that we saw earlier in 2021 and BLDR’s revenue recognition? Or is that more a function of market share gains that you achieved in the quarter?
Peter Jackson: Yes. No, that was a great question, Ryan. And then you've heard me talk about this before, in any given quarter, it's extremely difficult to align starts with sales and market share. But what I think you're seeing here is kind of what we committed to or what we told you was going to happen in past quarters. There have been periods where our growth looked like share declined. This is a period where it looks like a pretty healthy share expansion. I think if you look at it over time, we are continuing to take share in modest increments as we continue to deliver a superior product and partner with our customers. What you saw in this period, if I take you down to another layer of granularity is some rebounding in some of those windows, stores, and millwork categories, for example, where the supply free up a little bit. And the timing of the builds started to move through those components. Obviously, the fourth quarter is a big push point for many of the homebuilders just for them to do their completions so that they can get credit for the homes sold. So that's a lot of, I think, what you're seeing. It's just hard to in any given quarter sort of conclude on the numbers that you're winning or gaining. I think of winning or losing. But I think over the medium and long-term trend, we certainly feel good about our market share gains.
Dave Flitman: Yes. We are gaining share. Just to add to Peter's comment there, I would point not to the quarterly data, but if you look more broadly on what we did in 2021 with that 28% in single-family core organic growth versus roughly half that in terms of starts, I think that's a good judge. It gives us confidence that we are taking share in particular with the value-added components in millwork, which we're really pushing hard with our customers. So, we're seeing great adoption there as Peter commented earlier.
Ryan Gilbert: Second question is on the value-add product mix. It sounds like a lot of that's demand-driven, but maybe you can just give some broad brushes around what you're seeing on - in terms of I guess both value-add mix for revenue and value-add mix driving margin higher from just demand from your end markets versus your ability to drive more cross-selling volume with the - with BMC and BLDR combined?
Peter Jackson: Well, I think it's a little bit of both. And we are very excited about the combination here. And as you might have heard us say in the past, even where we overlap in some of the major markets, the product capabilities were very complementary. Builders was legacy, Builders was much stronger in components more broadly across the country. BMC had a really good core strength around millwork. So, it's given us a nice opportunity here to add to the breadth of our offering for our customers. And I think that's also playing into our growth. Our customers aren’t feeling the need to go elsewhere to get their product or their needs met because we've got such breadth and depth and capability across our portfolio. So - and then as we’ve commented here, we are seeing increased adoption in all the areas of value-add. And it takes time, particularly as we've talked about in the south and east which were legacy state-framing markets. It's taken us a number of years to consistently get our customers and the framers comfortable with moving towards the value-added portions of the business. But what we found is we found in other markets is once you reached that tipping point, the adoption rates accelerate. That's certainly been what we've experienced.
Operator: We have no further questions on the line at this time. I will turn the program back over to Mike Neese for any additional or closing remarks.
Michael Neese: Thank you, Britney. And thank you for your time today and for your interest in Builders FirstSource. Have a great day.
Operator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-04 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Builders FirstSource management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Neese: Thank you, Leo. Good morning and welcome to our Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I hope you and your families continue to remain safe and well. With me on the call are Dave Flitman, CEO; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today we will review our record third quarter results, discuss our ongoing integration progress and achievements and cover our recent M&A activity. We remain bullish on the housing sector and believe we are well positioned for continued profitable growth in a highly fragment - fragmented market. We provided results that include BMC in the third quarter of 2021 and standalone BFS in the third quarter of 2020. We have also provided pro forma results as if we own BMC in the third quarter of 2020. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS calculation excludes amortization of intangibles. The third quarter press release and supporting presentation for today's call are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results, adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes and they should not be considered in isolation from the most direct comparable GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they are useful to investors can be found in the earnings press release, SEC filings and presentation. Our remarks in the press in - the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigations Reform Act and projections of future results, Please review the forward-looking statement section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Flitman: Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. I'll cover three key topics on today's call. First I'll provide a quick update on our record third quarter results, including our base business and our view of the current state of the housing market. Second, I'll provide an update on our recent tuck-in acquisitions that further strengthened our leading market position. And finally, I'll provide an update on the BMC integration, which is progressing exceptionally well and continues to track ahead of plan. As you can see on Slide 3, in the third quarter, our team delivered exceptional performance continue to produce core organic growth, expanded margins and delivered strong cash flow. Sales grew an impressive 63% to $5.5 billion. Embedded in our top line performance, we also delivered core organic growth of 16.1%. Gross profit expanded 103% to a new quarterly record. Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled when compared to the prior year quarter to a record $976 million with adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 930 basis points to a record 17.7%. Finally, the increase of our EBITDA and margins helped us deliver approximately $1.1 billion in free cash flow while repurchasing 5.3% of our outstanding common shares. This strong performance underscores the strength of our industry-leading platform in the tremendous execution by our team members as we continue to outperform in our markets despite the unprecedented supply chain challenges affecting the homebuilding industry. Last quarter, in an effort to provide greater transparency into our underlying business performance, we provided an overview of the top and bottom line growth of our base business. As shown on Slide 6 for the full year of 2021, we now expect our base business net sales to grow to $15.7 billion from $12.5 billion or 26% and adjusted EBITDA to grow to $1.8 billion from $1.1 billion or 64%. Over time, we believe our base business will sustain and grow our double-digit EBITDA margin and expect to deliver 11.2% EBITDA margin for the full year 2021. Demand for single-family housing continues to support our top line growth and we believe that growth will be sustained over time as demographics, continue to develop favorably coupled with more than a decade of under. For the quarter on a pro forma basis, our core organic customer growth was 27.5% for single family. Value added core organic sales grew by an estimated 31.2% led by 44.6% growth in our manufactured product category. Our team members are doing an outstanding job getting our customers what they need in a very challenging environment. Single family starts to increase to approximately 5% in the third quarter on tough comparisons to a strong prior-year period. However, we were encouraged to see our core organic growth remains strong as underlying demand leveled off during the quarter. In addition, looking beyond the effects of the pandemic in the third quarter of last year, single family starts this quarter grew 21% when compared with the third quarter of 2019, which are core organic growth outpaced by 650 basis points. The country has averaged 1.2 million units of existing inventory in 2021 which is 14% below the 5-year average and a roughly a third of historical highs. Single-family housing under construction also increased 31% in the third quarter. In fact, there are currently more single-family homes under construction across the country than they have been in more than 14 years and our homebuilder backlog is currently at the highest level it has been in the last 15 years. This data is an encouraging sign for our business as we finish 2021 and look to next year, and we expect demand to remain robust. On Slide 7, we are focused on executing our strategy of investing in growth. We have completed five sucking transactions in 2021 since merging with BMC and believe each acquisition as unique value to not only our portfolio of best in class solutions for customers, but also our geographic presence in attractive economically sound high growth markets. Turning to Slide 8, we were excited to welcome the California TrusFrame team to the Builders FirstSource family in the third quarter. CaliTrus was California's largest independent truss manufacturer and has added substantial and profitable scale through our value-added products business on the West Coast. This acquisition adds for our value-added portfolio and provide access to new customers for our continued growth. Also during the quarter, we acquired the Apollo software assets from former construction technology startup Katerra. The Apollo platform provides design collaboration and workflow, construction budgeting and scheduling and job site management capabilities combined with mobile functionality. A quick update on our Paradigm acquisition. The BFS and Paradigm teams have come together nicely and are aligning on our digital strategy to drive efficiency and residential construction which will create value for our homebuilder customers and revenue growth for us. Our teams have made a number of customer business which have helped us validate the market opportunity associated with developing an end to end digital solution. And we are now working with several customers on pilots that will improve the preconstruction process, create more accurate material lists, bring our supply partners into a digital workflow and better engage home buyers in the process. We remain confident in our investments in both Paradigm and Apollo and our ability to drive long-term value through digital transformation. Moving forward, we will continue to reinvest in our business to accelerate organic growth while actively pursuing accretive tuck-in M&A opportunities to improve our mix and build scale in key growth markets. We firmly believe the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow generation will allow us to remain a disciplined consolidator in this industry. Next. On Slide 10. I'll provide a brief update on the BMC integration. As reported last quarter, synergies are tracking one full year ahead of our plan and are projected to be in the range of $140 million to$160 million by the end of 2022 exceeding our initial expectations. We delivered $36 million in cost synergies in the third quarter and $74 million during the first nine months of 2021. We now expect 2021 cost synergies to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million and mid-point increase of $10 million above the expected outcome we reported in the second quarter. Our ability to achieve our synergy commitment in half the time underscores the cultural alignment of our two companies and the strength in collaboration of our leadership team. As we approach Veteran's Day, I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank the veterans at BFS and their families. Earlier this fall. I had the honor of signing a statement of support on behalf of our company with the employer support of the Guard and Reserve or the ESGR, I had the privilege of meeting BFS team member and US Army veteran Corey Basinger. Corey spent 8 years in the Army and has been with BFS nearly 10 years. He is our maintenance manager in Houston, where he oversees critical facilities and equipment processes so we can seamlessly serve our customers. Corey receive the Pro Patria and above and beyond awards for his excellent leadership and supporting Guard and Reserve employees, in part due to do to his empathy, experience and understanding of what it means to be a veteran. Thank you. Cory, and thank you to all of our veterans for your service. With that let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q3 results and provide an update on our share repurchase program and our 2021 updated financial guidance.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Dave and good morning everyone. I want to thank all of our team members for delivering another incredible quarter. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our third quarter results compared to combined pro forma results from the prior year quarter. Second, I'll update you on how we are deploying capital supported by strong operating cash flow. And third, I'll provide you with our updated guidance for the full year of 2021. Let's start with our Q3 results, we had net sales of $5.5 billion for the quarter, which increased approximately 63% compared to the combined pro forma prior-year period. Value-added core organic sales grew by an estimated 31.2% led by 44.6% growth in our manufactured products category. Robust in internationally continues to be constrained by supply chain challenge. Commodity price inflation benefited sales by 39% and acquisitions contributed another 8%. Gross profit was $1.7 billion, an increase of $868 million or 103% compared with the combined pro forma prior-year period. Our gross margin increased 620 basis points to 31.1% primarily driven by disciplined pricing in a volatile supply constrained marketplace along with effective and timely source. Based on our year-to-date experience with the combined entity, we now believe our normalized gross margins will be north of 26.5%. SG&A was $875 million, an increase of approximately $235 million or 36.7% compared to the combined pro forma prior-year period. This was driven primarily by expense related to the BMC merger and other acquisitions including amortization expense of acquired intangibles and one-time charges. Excluding acquisition related one-time charges and variable compensation, underlying SG&A increased 8.1%. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased by 300 basis points to 15.9% due to the impact of higher net sales and continued expense control, which more than offset higher variable compensation driven by the increase in net sales and profitability. Adjusted EBITDA increased 244.4% to $975.9 million driven by consistently strong single family home demand, commodity inflation, execution of merger related synergies and cost leverage. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to a record 17.7%, an increase of 930 basis points compared to the year-over-year pro forma period. In Q3 adjusted diluted EPS was $3.39 compared to a combined pro forma of $0.74 in the prior year period. The more than 3-fold increase was primarily driven by the growth in operating income, partly offset by higher taxes. Now let's turn to cash flow, our third quarter operating cash flow was approximately $1.1 billion, driven by increased net sales and disciplined working capital management. Free cash flow was also a robust $1.1 billion during the quarter. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $11 million shares or 5.3% of our common shares outstanding at an average price of $52.74 for a total cost of $578 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $422 million remaining under our existing $1 billion share repurchase authorization. In October, we repurchased an additional $4.5 million shares at an average price of $55.99, leaving approximately $172 million in our current authorization. On Slide 11 our pro forma net debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 1.1 times our base business. We have no long-term debt maturities until 2027 and our total liquidity was roughly $1.5 billion consisting of about $1.3 billion of net borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility and $225 million in cash. Our strong third quarter and first nine months performance is a testament to our field teams who are delivering excellent value to our customers. We will continue to focus on growing the higher margin specialty and value-added products and services in our portfolio. And now let's discuss our 2021 full-year outlook, which we are revising upward and can be found on Slide 12. We continue to see strong underlying demand in new housing construction. Based on our first nine months results, we are increasing our full year '21 outlook. Net sales is expected to grow to a range of $19.3 billion to $19.8 billion or approximately 51% to 55 over 2020 combined proforma net sales of $12.8 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $2.85 billion to $2.95 billion or approximately 166% to 176% of our 2020 combined proforma adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion. In 2021, we expect BMC synergy savings of $90 million to $110 million to be recognized in the P & L. Free cash flow will be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. A decrease of $400 as the expected increase in EBITDA will be partially offset by higher cash tax. Our outlook is based on several assumptions, which are outlined in the earnings release including mid teen percentage growth and single family starts, R&R growth in the low single digits and multi-family starts growth in the high single digits. Overall, we are having a tremendous year. Our base business is robust and growing and we believe there is a long runway for growth into 2022 and beyond. We are focused on creating value for our stakeholders and are continuing to build our world-class distribution network founded on operational excellence and delivering exceptional value to our customers. Let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.
Dave Flitman: Thanks, Peter. In summary, the homebuilding industry momentum continues to be strong. Our core organic growth and in particular our value-added product categories is outpacing the industry in this unprecedented time given rapid growth in demand and widespread supply challenges. Our base business is large and we believe it will grow in 2022, the BMC integration and cost synergies are well ahead of schedule and the implementation of our digital strategy is ramping up. Our team is focused on operational excellence in delivering exceptional results for our customers and for our shareholders. I'm confident that our differentiated platform and our ability to invest organically and through M&A will deliver above market profitability and generate significant free cash flow for many years to come. Finally, we are excited to host our first ever Investor Day on December 7 and hope to see many of you here in the Dallas area. Operator, let's please open the call now for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take a question from Matthew Bouley of Barclays. Your line is open.
Matthew Bouley: Many areas to touch on here, I guess I'll start with the gross margin. You - Peter, you said the normalized gross margin, you can now commit to north of 26.5. I obviously have to ask the question of how far north are we talking if you have any elaboration on that and maybe within that it would just be helpful if you could describe with this quarter's 31%, how much of that might have been driven by commodity deflation. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Yeah. Thank you. The gross margin numbers we're seeing now are really encouraging from our perspective, because it underscores the strength of the product portfolio the way we're combining the sales of value add with the other products. Certainly the tailwinds from commodities have been welcomed and I think we've done a nice job of generating real profitability and cash flow from it. There is also a little bit of unusual in this quarter and everybody is talking about it obviously given the supply chain constraints. That's caused some unusual numbers and some unusual dynamics based on timing and the price increases and things of that nature. So we can think it's a little bit unusual, certainly a significant portion of that gross margin fall through that comes from the benefit on commodities. And so the 26.5% is where based on what we've seen in the nine months combined in the company, we feel very good about. I think we sort of demonstrated a willingness to commit to things that we know we're confident in. I mean, we are very confident in that 26.5% or better. We're certainly thinking about it in context of the longer-range of the business. It was a more long-term normal where we think we can get to and we'll be talking a lot more about that in our Investor.
Dave Flitman: And then I would just add that we have re-companies in our ability to outpace the market and continue that in our value-added portions of the business, which is also helping to shift the mix of the company. As you saw the strong performance in manufactured products. We also had core organic growth above our average in our millwork, doors and windows business which has continued to strengthen throughout the year despite all the supply chain challenges with that.
Matthew Bouley: That's great color. Thank you both for that. Second one on capital deployment clearly great progress on deploying the balance sheet there with the buyback just in the past 3 months. So I think you're still guiding to over $1 billion of free cash flow just in Q4. Any thoughts on kind of a future buyback authorization and Dave, you also mentioned that just being a disciplined consolidator in M&A, there's other consolidators out there, I'm just curious if you can kind of outline what you're seeing in the M&A market from a competitive perspective and valuations and all that. So thank you both and congrats on the results.
Dave Flitman: Yes, thank you. So with regard to the share buyback. To date, we're very, very pleased with what we've been able to accomplish. We think we were able to move, put a lot of capital toward this quarter added on an underpriced stock, and I think we're doing pretty well there. Certainly happy with the momentum. We do have remaining allocation. So we've all been authorized for another roughly $175 million. That is going to be our first priority. No new announcement today or anything into the future, but obviously we sort of demonstrated the way we think about the business and how we're going to work in terms of a balanced capital allocation.
Peter Jackson: The second part of your question there on M&A, we have been disciplined in our work both us in place. the companies have. As you probably expect there's been a lot of opportunities in the market through the course of this year. Valuations have. We've been disciplined around how we think about the long-term profitability of our targets, especially given the lumber environment that we've have here. We can get the deals that we want and we're going to stay disciplined around that. The five deals that we've done this year we feel very good about. And so we didn't say a lot about the pipeline slide in the deck, but it's still very strong and robust. And we're going to continue to play out our M&A in a way that makes sense for the company.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.
Mike Dahl: Good morning. Congrats on your results, really exceptional I. A couple of questions around the value add. The first one really manufactured products another really strong quarter, your other value add categories up nicely as well but lot of strength in Manufactured Products combination of a lot of hard work on positioning that business, can you remind us where you're at now from a capacity standpoint and potentially speak to how you're thinking about incremental investments and further capacity expansions there.
Dave Flitman: Yes, I'll start and then Peter down any color on it, but we continue to see very high demand in manufacturing performance. It's really not just in one geography, it's all across the country. And as we said when we combine these two companies, the complementary nature of our value-added capabilities was going to be very powerful and we certainly see that - see that play out exactly as we expect. I would tell you right now, we haven't more demand than we have capacity for our products and we expect that's going to continue. We have moved the market this direction and the labor challenges, the - the performance around inflation is real. Our customers are all talking about it, we've seen it every day and that's helped us continue to move the market towards offsite manufacturing and helping them be a lot more efficient at the job site. \We have invested heavily in that part of the business and we will continue to do so to make sure we're meeting demand.
Peter Jackson: Yeah, you see that point, we have a number of projects around the country where we have seen the utilization of our existing capacity to expand it. We can do that in a number of ways. The easiest way is obviously adding shifts, next would be adding equipment, automation equipment more sophisticated equipment, more equipment in total. Some limitations in that right now, just given the supply chains and availability of the wrong funds further up the supply chain and in greenfield along the line in greenfield, we know there are markets around the country that's been adopting this type of solution, this value-added solution, very, very quickly and we see tremendous opportunities in expanding our footprint, being the provider of choice and the provider with the best sort of variable cost position as we execute that as well to be successful long term.
Mike Dahl: And my second question, obviously the scale, the execution, the way you positioned the business has helped you to capture a decent amount of share in a very dynamic and supply constrained environment and it's demonstrated the potential power and profitability of the business. As you look forward, there is probably a world in which when things normalize, some of your maybe smaller mom and pop competitors are, get back on their feet and I guess the question is really, when you think about customer stickiness and share the stickiness in share gains, how does your experience this year affect how you think about balancing share versus price and margin in a more normal environment and maybe if that differs when you think about commodity versus value add.
Peter Jackson: Well, certainly on the value-added portions of the business, we continue to see great adoption. We expect that that will continue. However, we have to remain competitive and to your point around that, this is still a very competitive market. We have seen as we said in times in the past that these products are very sticky with our customers because of the value proposition and the benefits goods that our manufactured components deliver to them which is very real. And that's been nothing but validated since the merger has come together, but that's why we drive productivity and efficiency. Right. We won't rest on our laurels, we know this will continue to be a competitive market and we have to earn that business with our customers each and every day. That's the mentality. I have some value our entire leadership team has around us. We take nothing for granted.
Dave Flitman: Yes, just from a modeling perspective, I think, how that manifests itself is a little bit of having both. There will be quarters when certainly the mom and pops will level things out in certain of the more commoditized product areas. Our commitment is to just to be the organization that wins at the end of the day, we think we can continue to perform better than market. We think our mix of products allows us to execute that achievement at a higher than higher than industry margin because of our ability to pull through that value-added mix, do it very efficiently and to manage the combined entity in a way to really leverage scale and drive through those investments in technology and leadership in ways that others can't touch. So certainly think it will continue to be competitive, what they said that doesn't change and there'll be some ebbs and flows and that never moves in a straight line, but we think that base business trend over time it's going to be - is going to be very desirable to all involved.
Mike Dahl: Okay, great, well thank you, both. I appreciate that and look forward to the Investor Day.
Dave Flitman: Thanks a lot Mike.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ketan Mamtora of BMO Capital Markets.
Ketan Mamtora: Thank you and let me offer my congratulations as well. A really strong performance. Within manufactured products. I'm just curious, are there any specific product categories that you are seeing kind of stronger growth versus the others and that these labor challenges are kind of driving faster adoption of component offsite manufacturing.
Dave Flitman: Yeah, I think - the great news is we're seeing strength in all categories of our manufacturing components, whether it's a roof truss systems or floor systems, it has been well publicized. EWP has been a challenging supply environment this year through the great work of our - teams. All around the country we've been able to get the volumes that we needed, although it's been a price, and they remains there. But importantly also our Ready Frame is up over 30% this year on a year-to-date basis in-house count. So we're not really seeing any areas of weakness. And really the system approach that we're taking the structural design helps support all pieces of our manufactured components business. So we're excited about we're getting big traction everywhere.
Ketan Mamtora: And then my other question with other base business steadily moving higher, I'm just curious kind of how do you think, or is there any rethink in how you - how you look at the leverage on the Company.
Dave Flitman: So the base business is certainly a - but really important metric for us going forward for those that maybe don't remember is, is re baselining us at a normalized historical commodity value just taking all that volatility story. What that yields is sort of underlying business that's showing a steady strengthening and increased profitability and yeah, that is the basis for our leverage. We include that in in the investor presentation this quarter to give you an anchor point. We think that's the right way to think about how we're levered over time, because that's a part of the business you can really count on and rely on. So we're going to leverage based on that in terms of our guidance and our commitment over time.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Reuben Garner of The Benchmark Company.
Reuben Garner: Thank you. Good morning, everybody and congrats on the results. So can you just talk about, I mean the big businesses. I'm looking at it correctly, going to be up over 25% revenue this year. Profit is going to be growing north of 60%. What kind of gives you the confidence that you'll be able to grow. I think you made the comment that you think you can grow the base business next year. Can you just talk about what you're seeing that gives you that level of comfort.
Peter Jackson: Sure. Well, a couple of things, first of all, I just want to be very clear. The strategy of the company is predicated on the base business and are always has been. So the fact that we've broken that out has provides an external clarity, but this is what we're trying to drive. Right. Our organic growth or value added portions of the business is at the heart of what we're trying to do and so I'm not surprised by it. And given the demand environment that we're seeing, we expect that will continue, but also in the areas of the value add that we're focused on, we have been for quite some time now taking market share and we do expect that will continue for a long time to come. So I just want to be clear though, this is the focus of the companies, with the leadership team is a breeze every day and that's what we're driving into the marketplace with our customers.
Reuben Garner: So, in an environment where maybe the starts single family or total DARTs are flat next year. Do you think that you still, with the backlog in the business that you have and the initiatives you have to grow the value add to be able to grow the business in that environment?
Dave Flitman: Yes, absolutely. And we do think, it's been well publicized here starts of slowed through the third quarter of this year but, but to a customer, every one of them point to supply chain challenges not weakening underlying demand. So there has been a little pause on stores and we saw that through the third quarter and you just see in our results. So that gives me even more confidence that we're going to be able to sustain our performance even in a weaker starts environment. These products are very sticky even if start slow, that the labor challenges are going away, the things we're delivering value on for our customers are not going to change for our value proposition is robust and strong in any stores environment.
Reuben Garner: Okay. And then last one for me. Are there any areas, most companies that have reported third-quarter results so far ran into some kind of supply chain issues and had volume even volume pressure in some cases. Are there any areas of your business that you're having product shortages or where there is bottleneck that you didn't see growth that's been pushed out to future quarters or if you guys have been able to overcome this somehow with your scale and reach.
Dave Flitman: Well, to your last point, I mean, our scale and reach is tremendous even more so in the combined company. And I think our procurement teams and our field leadership teams are now credited for the great work in securing what we needed for our customers. It has been a dog fight I believe all remaining that we also have great suppliers and they've been tremendous throughout this period in helping to get us more than our fair share in what our customers need. Now having said that, EWP remains a challenge. Even where we've seen lumber and OSB, for instance, kind of loosen up a little bit, the challenge is less than manufacturing right now it's more in drivers and given the, the material to the job sites from a lot of our suppliers, that's also been well publicized exterior doors are still a challenge. So things might be in a little different spot than they were three months ago, but there is still a widespread challenges that that we're up against in the industry every single day. And then just acknowledged your comment about the industry homebuilders wide any one of them that have had very much success this year have had to govern and sort of pull back a little bit on how many stores and how many sales they can make because of those, those same supply chain issues and availability issues. We certainly have seen that but we are not somehow immune to that. That has run through our numbers, but we've also seen the normalization in the bounce off the bottom. So I think there is, there is a lot of reason for optimism that this is a healthy industry making smart decisions about how much we can flow through given the constraints and really looking forward to the day when some of those constraints are.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Keith Hughes of Truist.
Keith Hughes: Just getting back to the availability questions that we've had before. Are you seeing, if you could call it major product galleries, were you seeing things actually getting better sequentially or is the situation just not improved in the last 3 to 4 months.
Dave Flitman: Yeah, I would say Keith it's incrementally better, certainly on the commodity side of the business as I mentioned. That is loosened up a bit. Interior doors are better than they were a quarter ago. We're still struggling with exterior doors. Hardware remains a challenge, moldings remainder challenge. A lot of the specialty products are a real challenge. Windows remains in high demand and with - backlogs. Our team is working on that challenge. It has been for a long time. This is - the encouraging part of it is, even though our millwork, doors and windows organic growth was lower than our total or lower than our total for single-family, we have seen sequentially each quarter of this year that continue to improve. Right. We were at 19% this quarter versus single family of 27.5%, but we were 15-ish in Q2. So I think that just speaks to over to softening, but more importantly, the great work that our team continues to do every day to get us what we need.
Keith Hughes: And final question. Comments from your builder customer, you talked about some of the slowdown they've, many of them have talked about. As I talk to you about next year are they expecting average pacing of completions during the year, more front loaded any sort of color you can give on that would be helpful.
Dave Flitman: Yeah, it's still early and we are in those conversations. But obviously we're kicking stars out of this year. We'll certainly many good things for the first half, at least the next year. The other piece of it, which we heard a little bit about is land and development of that and I think this gives them a chance to catch the breath, a little bit and get out in front of that a little bit, where I think they were may be caught off guard a bit with the strength of the start this year. But what we're hearing, by and large is continued strength and continued high demand for what we offer them.
Operator: We'll move next to David Manthey of Baird. Your line is open.
David Manthey: David mentioned Ready Frame and I was wondering if you could talk about what percentage of revenues that is today and what was the comparable figure in the third quarter of 2019. You also gave us an interesting stat there. You said that house count was up 30% year-over-year. Could you provide that number from the Third quarter of 2019 as well. Sorry for all the data request here.
Dave Flitman: Yeah, I know and we may have cash you offline on all that. I don't have all that in my fingertips at the moment Dave but just suffice as to say that we're quite pleased with the penetration that we continue to get and we've put to actually even in the BMC days we've put into looking at this more at a house account level to understand. It's more but organic growth of the business, how are we penetrating the market more. So that's really not a new metric for us and it takes out the noise around what's going on with the commodities in the revenues up and down and we were focused squarely in-house account penetration, as I said, that's up 40% over 30% this year and as you recall, last year was pretty strong. So we're excited about it. It is mirroring very much what's going on with our manufactured products in general and we expect that growth will continue.
David Manthey: Okay, great. Yeah, I'll look forward to catching up with you on that. And my second question is on the software acquisitions. Could you describe how Apollo and Para kind of fit together and are there additional modules or capabilities that you're going to need to complete your tech platform or is this sort of a complete suite of software now.
Dave Flitman: We're very pleased with Paradigm and that is the broad capability - start the digital platform, right, and the configuration capabilities they have. That they comply almost exclusively to the newer portion of business. As I've said previously, we're excited to be able to take that on the prior categories and expand it more broadly. Apollo was a unique one and that was very opportunistic. If you saw that the - we got a really good deal on that. And it provides particularly mobile capability and some of the fast end works that the Paradigm - provide and take orders chance like management capability. And so we're excited about the end-to-end solution that we have now and if all pick up just say the development were from the back end.
Operator: And we'll move next to those light to the site of Steven Ramsey. Your line is open.
Steven Ramsey: Maybe to start with the synergies, can you clarify the new synergies are updated synergies, as you say, does that include any of the acquisitions that have been made. If I think about distributor acquisitions, the sales total over $600 million of. So it seems like there would be some meaningful synergies coming in.
Dave Flitman: Yeah. So it does not. Those are still - hose are limited to the DMC merger synergies. So midpoint of 100 on the P&L for '21 and mid-point of our run rate for what 150 by 2022. That does not include the tailwinds from the smaller entities not tracking in the same way. I don't think it's particularly helpful to report it in that consolidated way. It is showing up in the materials for the profitability obviously in that organic growth number. So probably we won't be breaking that out separately, but certainly we'll continue to talk about excellence metrics and where we can identify significant projects.
Steven Ramsey: Okay, helpful. And then if I'm looking at this correctly, it appears the incremental margins on the base business in FY '20 and FY '21 guide or in the low 20% range above normal, is that expected to moderate as the environment in demand trends normalize over the next year, two years.
Dave Flitman: Yeah. So that goes back to kind of the, my comment about the unusual nature of the market in the current period, there certainly is some expectation that certain aspects of that will moderate things that were based on the timing of sourcing, the things that were based on usual disconnect service placements in the market there has though been a real trend of better discipline around pricing in the right markets making smarter decisions about how we provide value and are compensated for that value. So it's a mix. There will certainly be some underlying sustainable improvement and will probably get back.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll move to the side of Collin Verron of Jefferies. Your line is open. Mr. Verron, you may want to check your mute switch. Your line is open.
Michael Neese: Leo, let's - we'll move to the next analyst please.
Operator: We will. We'll move next to Kurt Yinger of DA Davidson. Your line is open.
Kurt Yinger: Kurt Yinger of DA Davidson. Your line is open.
Kurt Yinger: Great, thanks and good morning Dave and Peter Just on the base business. EBITDA increased to $1.8 billion from $1.6 billion previously. Kind of curious what the moving pieces are there. Maybe it just goes back to kind of the last point around pricing discipline and whatnot, but it seems like a pretty nice uplift, considering the volume outlook and what is unchanged here. And then as we think about kind of building out 2022 kind of how confident are you in using that as kind of a good jumping-off point.
Peter Jackson: Yes. So the work in pricing. As you know, Kurt is something we've been focused on for a few years and putting these two teams together letting really high quality leadership to engage with that yield, working together, sharing best practices, that really has moved, we think, the baseline. I think that's certainly there were some examples of situations where we found ourselves in possession of product outline cost in terms of current pricing and not going to apologize for that. But certainly our ability to continue to be disciplined helped us in the quarter and will help us on an ongoing basis and that is the result of that historical investment, that alignment, the way we think about pricing, the tools we put in place, the way we train. All of that has come to fruition, particularly as you look at the business, this combined wealth, has a great market position and in markets around the country where there is just tremendous demand and growth, we're really well positioned.
Kurt Yinger: And then second, just as I think about the products you sell from a pricing perspective. Commodities, likely to be a headwind here over the next couple of quarters but you name it EWP, windows, siding doors, there is a pretty significant level of underlying price inflation out there. So can you just talk a bit about how you're thinking about that impact on the top line here going forward and how it might help offset that drag from lumber and panels.
Peter Jackson: Well, you're right, there is tremendous inflation in the marketplace. Like you said a number of different products, we are very focused on making sure we're passing that through. Some of the leverage you see from that is part of what is driving some of those margins, obviously. It doesn't cost any more to transport a more expensive piece of lumber window or door. It is probably a smaller component, but certainly important to mention. As we continue to see volatility in prices, we are going to maintain our discipline around passing it through. There will be instances where things will go back down and we all but adapt to that and make sure that you are still the provider of choice, that we're providing tremendous value to our customers, that are our products or relationships with vendors are served to move through, that the high volumes that our - that our vendors want to see to meet the demand that their customers want to receive but that dynamic, that ability to continue to be consistently disciplined, it is something we pride ourselves in and that's something I think we've proven the capability to do even in really unprecedented, we call it times.
Operator: And we'll move next to Jay McCanless of Wedbush. Your line is open.
Jay McCanless: Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Great quarter both. So another question on Slide 16. It looks like the EBITDA ranges at all the dollar per MBF. All the EBITDA range has moved up. I guess: A, is that right, and then B, what's the biggest driver here is? is it a change in mix, some of the acquisitions. Just any - which one of these assumptions on the right hand side of the slide, which was the biggest driver on that.
Peter Jackson: Yeah, no, The catch. So it doesn't move right when the base business on the prior slide bumps up, which we did increase the guide there. It reflects in that, that sensitivity on Slide 16 about what this business might look like at different commodity prices. It's a couple of factors. I - obviously with the growth of the value add faster than the four, you continue to see that favorable performance on an ongoing basis in what we consider base right that normalized margin level as a powerful influence on this. Our ability to manage price in see sustained margins across the portfolio and in the way we do things is certainly reflected in here. As this discipline around expenses, the improved performance and synergies, the operational excellence initiatives we're seeing in there are bearing fruit. All of that is in some way, contributing to the increased sort of starting point and as reflected on the sensitivity.
Jay McCanless: Great, thank you. And then my second question, I guess, staying on the slide, where, where did in the way you are calculating this blended. I think it's a blend of both framing lumber and sheet lumber. Where did this dollar per MBS in within the third quarter.
Peter Jackson: Yeah. So you're hitting a point that's always a challenge right it is. We don't know where commodities are going to go, it was certainly a bit of a surprise for us in terms of the guide in the back half of the year. It has absolutely leveled out above the $400 levels. It is going up, I mean branded alliances between 500 and 600 if you're talking about kind of lumber and sheet in terms of what we're seeing. We'll see where it goes from here. But on a year-over-year basis as Kurt mentioned earlier, there is certainly a turn in terms of the year-over-year comparisons, but still very, very strong and healthy from our - from a historical perspective. But at the end of the day, we're still going to circle back to base business and we're going to focus on running the quarter. We'll reap the benefits of commodities, but that's not where our attention is going to stay.
Jay McCanless: All right. And one other - one if I could sneak it in. Do you feel like from a pricing power perspective during the third quarter, did you get - were you able to take more price on the value-add goods or were you able to hold the line better on commodity goods even as the underlying commodity went down in price.
Peter Jackson: Yeah, I'm actually proud of that and we did both. We did bout but I think there are certainly good discipline in not getting on certain products acknowledging the relationship working with customers, but at the same time switching vendors for quickly re-setting where appropriate, but it always focusing on getting paid for the value that we're providing appropriately. But really across the board. It's been a really positive story.
Operator: And we'll move next to Iman Akram of Lord Abbott.
Iman Akram: Thanks for taking the question. Just back on the commodity front. Just want to better understand the lumber dynamics. How - like is there - when you're talking with contractors is there a pricing law for that log or - as the prices no or how does that market work.
Dave Flitman: Yes. So I mean it is - price is a small part of what we do now, it's certainly shrunk in recent years. The vast majority of what we're selling in the commodity space is quoted in pass-through in a pretty narrow period of time. We're pretty happy with that balance. The amount of inventory we have on hand and on order with the way we're quoting but we can walk through that in more detail for you offline. If you look at the end of the day with commodities important part of what we do, we think of our more important part is certainly the base business and what we're doing with the overall strategy.
Iman Akram: Okay, thanks. And yes, it will be helpful. If we could talk offline at some point.
Dave Flitman: Yeah, happy to do it.
Operator: Our next question is from Ryan Gilbert of BTIG.
Ryan Gilbert: And my first question. Good morning. And I want to talk about, or I should say Peter you've talked in the past about the backup in units authorized but not started. And that's certainly something that we're seeing in the data and Dave, it sounds like based on your comments earlier builders are certainly planning for more units going ahead. I'm just wondering if you're, if you're seeing so far in the fourth quarter, some movement on getting those units started. Maybe a re-acceleration and starts or if we think that's more a 2022 story.
Peter Jackson: So we. I think our, if we're looking at our numbers, our assessment is July was probably though we guessed in terms of the context of the business was bad, but it was weaker from a growth perspective than the rest of the year and we come back for them. So we started to see a little bit of a re-acceleration. I think what a bit on characterizing it, the homebuilders as a group sat down and said, oh, we've come way too many units under, under construction are not yet started. Let's govern this and there was a bit of a pause and then they continue to roll along trying to get to a point where it's very supportable and sustainable. I don't think it's possible to know that with precision but certainly, we know better now than we have in the past. And that does represent a bit of a re-acceleration in growth from that July's low point. - to say right, I mean it will always be dependent on weather, particularly this time of the year, but broadly speaking, there certainly a very strong demand and we do think those sold units and even some started units will accelerate and continue to grow just given that strong demand.
Dave Flitman: And we also know that they are squarely focused on winning completions between by the end of the year. And so, my earlier comment, I do think the stars growth will still and in the first half of next year quite nicely.
Ryan Gilbert: Second question is on multifamily just parsing the guide, it looks like we should expect a big year-over-year increase in - in multifamily in the fourth quarter and am I thinking about that correctly? And how does the pipeline or the backlog of multifamily projects look as you sit today.
Dave Flitman: Yes. No. Good question. So there is multi-families of venture and we like to be able to reference it as a comparison, the National Multifamily number but still it is not a comparable metric for us given we're really sort of focused on our few key regions around the country. A lot of movement within those, within the market is project driven. - the sort of lumpy moves in and out in any given period. I don't know that I agree that it's a large expected increase for the fourth quarter. I think we're still positive, I think that the one adjustment that I will highlight is we did dispose of our standalone gypsum business that did have some multifamily and commercial exposure fuel feel a little bit of moves in that in the R&R another bucket but it is pretty modest overall. It's a good area for us. We are seeing growth and we think that will continue through the fourth quarter and into next year.
Operator: And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I'd be happy to return the call to Michael Neese for any concluding remarks.
Michael Neese: Thank you for your time today and for your interest in Builders FirstSource as Dave mentioned, we are hosting an Investor Day on December 7th in the Dallas area. We look forward to hosting you in person or virtually through webcast, if you'd like to attend in person, please email me at michael.neese@bldr.com. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect your lines and everyone have a great day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-07 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for joining Builders FirstSource Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource will now provide the company’s opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Neese: Thank you, Sarah. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings call. I hope you and your families continue to remain safe and well. With the increase in the COVID-19 Delta strain, our COVID task force continues to closely monitor the developments and we will continue to follow CDC guidance and protocols for the safety of our team members, customers, suppliers and communities. With me on the call today are Dave Flitman, CEO and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will review our second quarter results and provide an update on our base business momentum, our ongoing integration progress and achievements as well as our recent M&A. We remain bullish on the housing sector and believe we are well-positioned to continue to capture double-digit single-family starts growth. We have provided GAAP results that include BMC in the second quarter of 2021 and standalone BFS in the second quarter of 2020. We have also provided pro forma results as if we own BMC in the second quarter of 2020. Our adjusted EPS calculation excludes amortization of intangibles. The second quarter press release and the supporting presentation for today’s call are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. The results discussed today include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they are useful to investors can be found in the earnings press release, our SEC filings and presentations. Our remarks in the press release, presentation, and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today’s press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to David.
Dave Flitman: Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. Our record second quarter and first half earnings are the result of the hard work and strong execution by our more than 26,000 team members who have been relentless in providing superior customer service amid robust demand in a very tight supply environment. I want to start by thanking them as I couldn’t be more proud of their efforts. In the second quarter, we delivered core organic sales growth above 35%, along with record gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and margin. Our performance accelerated in the second quarter as we continued to expand our value-added offerings, executed disciplined pricing strategies and accelerated merger-related integration savings. I will cover three key topics on today’s call. First, I’ll provide an update on the residential housing environment, which remains very strong, review our second quarter results and given the unique demand and supply dynamics, share some insights into the strength of the underlying growth in our base business. Second, I’ll provide an update on our recent M&A transactions that further strengthen our market position and advance our digital strategy and highlight our very strong pipeline of potential tuck-in acquisitions. And finally, I’ll provide an update on the BMC integration, which is progressing exceptionally well and running ahead of plan. Let me start with the current state of the residential housing environment. we continue to see strong demand across the country. Specifically, single-family housing demand is robust and our entire supply chain is working hard to keep up with that strength. Regardless of short-term fluctuations, we believe the nation’s homebuilding sector is growing today, and there is sustained growth in store for the next several years. Freddie Mac stated earlier this year that the U.S. is underbuilt by approximately 4 million homes. The National Association of Realtors believes we are 5.5 million homes underbuilt. Whichever number you believe, there is a significant shortage of housing in this country that will take many years of above normal starts to overcome. According to the NAHB’s second quarter 2021 housing trends report, almost 20% of American adults are considering the purchase of a home within the next year. This statistics have increased for 5 consecutive quarters and is nearly double to 10% in Q1 of 2020. Additionally, 64% of these potential buyers are first-time buyers, which is the highest share in history. The millennial generation, some 82 million strong, will continue to provide support and growth in new housing construction for many years. There is also an extremely tight supply of existing homes for sale. We have averaged 1.1 million units of inventory in 2021, which is 20% below the 5-year average and well below the high of 3.5 million units of inventory in 2007. This data further supports our strong belief in the need for new home construction. Single-family starts increased 41.7% in the second quarter, which we outpaced by approximately 240 basis points with our single-family core organic growth. In addition, adjusting for the effects of the pandemic in the second quarter of last year, single-family starts this quarter grew 27% when compared with the second quarter of 2019. Housing under construction also increased 29% in the second quarter. There are now 439,000 more single-family homes under construction than there were at this time last year, and 396,000 more than at the same time in 2019. Some industry observers are racing to call at the top of the cycle, but the data tells us there will likely be continued strong momentum in new home construction, which will bode well for us and the industry as a whole. Recently, we’ve heard from several of our homebuilder customers that they are tapping the brakes on starts for a few reasons, namely labor, material and land availability, even though demand remains strong. These challenges, coupled with the growth we’ve seen in the first half of the year, suggests builders are exceeding their growth forecast for this year and are pushing some new home construction into next year, supporting our belief that growth will continue for some time. And our 58% core organic growth in our Structural Components business, underscores our belief that our value-added offerings will be increasingly important to builders as they continue to navigate material and labor challenges and look for ways to get more efficient. Housing starts showing significant growth, mortgage rates remaining at historical lows and a continued shift to homeownership are all significant tailwinds. As a reminder, we are in 84 of the largest and fastest growing MSAs in the country. Our team is poised to continue to capture a disproportionate share of the growth as we have done for the past several years and as evidenced by our most recent 260 basis point outperformance over the last 6 months. I am confident we will outperform the market in any environment. And what we are experiencing now is exactly what we envisioned when we put our merger together. A best-in-class operation located in the top markets in the country, focused on serving customers with the best portfolio of products and services and solving their construction challenges. We have a seasoned, cycle-tested management team, and we are just getting started. Now let’s turn to our record second quarter results. We delivered another strong quarter of top and bottom line performance and importantly, core organic growth of 44.1% in our single-family segment and 58% in manufactured components, again outpaced the market as we continue to gain share. Turning to Slide 4, I will review our pro forma results for the quarter. Total sales grew 91% to $5.6 billion. Core organic sales increased 35%. Gross profit expanded more than 105% and adjusted EBITDA increased a remarkable 232% to $836 million with adjusted EBITDA margin expanding by 640 basis points to a record 15%. Turning to Slide 5, we have received many questions from analysts and investors regarding the impact of commodities on our business results. In response, we are providing an overview of the underlying top and bottom line growth of our base business, on a normalized basis, assuming a static commodity price of $400 per thousand board feet. For the full year 2021 versus 2020, we expect our base business net sales to grow to $15.3 billion from $12.5 billion or 22% and adjusted EBITDA to grow to $1.6 billion from $1.1 billion or 45%. Given consistent single-family starts, we believe our 10.1% EBITDA margin on our base business is sustainable and can grow over time, as evidenced by our 240 basis points of growth since 2019. That’s a 31% improvement in profitability in 2 years. Peter will go into further detail in his prepared remarks, but I want to point out to everyone that our base business is large, it’s growing, and it has a sustained double-digit EBITDA margin profile. Now, let me spend a bit of time on M&A and our recently announced transactions, Alliance Lumber, which closed on July 1 and Paradigm for which we signed a definitive purchase agreement in late June. Turning to Slide 6, Alliance Lumber is the largest supplier of building materials in Arizona, primarily serving the fast-growing greater Phoenix, Tucson and Prescott Valley metropolitan areas. The Phoenix Metro area alone is expected to add more than 100,000 jobs in 2022, so we’re excited about our increased presence in the state. Arizona is the number three ranked single-family MSA in the U.S., encompassing the nation’s fastest growing county, Maricopa. This acquisition is aligned with our strategy of investing organically and through M&A to grow our portfolio of high-value and faster growth categories. Alliance has an estimated 45% market share with the top homebuilders and catapults us to a leading position in the state. Its geographic footprint and component manufacturing capability is an excellent strategic fit. And the limited overlap of our existing coverage enables us to expand our product offerings into previously untapped regions. Alliance is margin accretive and we have an opportunity to embed our millwork capability into their operations. With deep, longstanding customer relationships and a reputation for offering outstanding customer service, Alliance is an established and trusted adviser to leading homebuilders and contractors across single-family, multifamily and commercial end markets. Founder and CEO of True Carr and his team have built a fantastic company with strong leadership and values that align to our own in a similar culture of growth. We are thrilled to have the Alliance team members as part of the BFS family. Now turning to Slide 7, I want to spend a few minutes on our strategy and recent M&A in the digital space, which has been a priority and focus for us over the last several years. Based on third-party research, the homebuilding market is lagging almost every other industry in digital transformation. As the new generation of builders emerges, a generation that grew up with digital technologies, which has accelerated given the impacts of COVID, we are seeing a shift in how our customers want to do business. And we see this trend having a long tail as adoption accelerates. Digital is a significant growth opportunity for BFS as the industry goes through a shift to digital execution. Given the scale of our platform, we feel we are well positioned to help shape important outcomes for our industry, including improved efficiencies and productivity through digital technologies. Our digital strategy includes three main areas: first, a focus on our internal processes and productivity by investing in technology to drive operational efficiency and excellence; next, help streamline interactions with our vendors and customers; and finally, a focus on external innovation and investment to offer value-added digital products and services that support our customers’ success and growth. On June 29, we announced a major step forward in our digital strategy with our intent to acquire Paradigm, an innovative software solutions company that is transforming the way new construction and renovation this time. Over the past 20 plus years, Paradigm has grown to over 300 employees, serving more than 250 customers spanning homebuilders, lumber yards, manufacturers, retailers and distributors with an expanding list of 70,000 end users. From home visualization to material takeoff technology to drafting services and estimating, Paradigm software platform helps increase sales and operational efficiencies for new construction and renovation businesses. The addition of Paradigm offers several compelling strategic benefits to Builders FirstSource. Specifically, we will scale Paradigm’s platform from the current 250 customers to our broader base of 70,000 customers. Paradigm’s platform will help us drive internal productivity in our team of over 700 designers and estimators. Paradigm provides another value-added capability to reduce inefficiencies and costs for our homebuilder customers, strengthening our current partnerships. And finally, and most impactfully, we believe we can capture more than $1 billion of incremental sales over the next 5 years by utilizing our digital assets to accelerate the adoption and capture rates of value-added products. To be clear, neither Alliance nor Paradigm signal a change in our M&A strategy. We will continue to reinvest in our business while actively pursuing accretive tuck-in M&A opportunities to improve our mix and build scale in key growth markets. As you can see on Slide 11, we have identified more than 460 targets in the $15 million to $100 million revenue range. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation will allow us to be a disciplined consolidator in this industry for a long time to come. Finally, I’d like to update you on the BMC integration, which is going very well. Synergies are tracking 1 year ahead of plan and are projected to exceed our initial expectations. Through the second quarter of this year, we have already captured $36 million in cost savings. Based on our progress to-date, we are increasing our synergy targets. Specifically, we are raising our year one 2021 projected savings to between $80 million and $100 million from the $60 million to $70 million we had previously communicated and now, we expect to achieve total synergies of between $140 million to $160 million by the end of 2022, allowing us to overachieve in just 2 years versus our original 3-year commitment of between $130 million to $150 million. These increased synergy targets underscore the success of the BMC integration to date. In addition, our teams are working closely together to leverage our scale and product offerings. Specifically, we’ve been able to create additional capacity for our component facilities in overlap markets, accelerating growth in that key category. We have also been able to use our combined relationships to divert more national builders in attractive markets, accelerating growth in structural components, READY-FRAME and our millwork offerings. These are exciting times and our outstanding results reflect the strong housing market and underlying demand for new homes. Our industry leading platform, coupled with our ability to deliver value to our customers, and a continuation of our disciplined approach to cost management and operational excellence, and we are confident in our ability to consistently execute at a very high level. In conclusion, I would like to highlight one of our many valued associates. Nothing is more important than safety of our team members here at BFS. It takes hard work and commitment to build and maintain a strong safety culture. I wanted to spotlight someone who is going above and beyond to lead that culture in her location. Kelly Rhodes is a regional safety manager in Oklahoma. She and her team invited OSHA to voluntarily visit the North Oklahoma City lumber and millwork location to further improve their safety and health program. While there, the OSHA representatives were so impressed that they gave Kelly a special OSHA commemorative coin as a token of appreciation for a successful inspection and for their outstanding training documentation. Dedicated team members like Kelly help reinforce our safety culture, and we are glad to have her on our team in Oklahoma. With that, let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q2 results and our 2021 updated financial guidance.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Dave and good morning everyone. I want to thank all of our team members for delivering incredible results. Your execution is rock solid. I will cover three topics with you this morning. First, I will review our second quarter results compared to combined pro forma results from the prior year quarter. Second, I will discuss our financial position, supported by a strong operating cash flow. And third, I will provide some color on our guidance raise for the full year 2021. Starting with our Q2 results, we had net sales of $5.6 billion for the first quarter, which increased approximately 91% compared to the combined pro forma prior year period. Turning to Slide 13, value-added core organic sales increased by 35% led by 58% growth in our manufactured products category and 17% growth in our windows, doors and millwork category. Commodity price inflation benefited net sales by 52% and acquisitions contributed 3.5%. We experienced stronger than expected demand in Q2 single-family starts across the country, and we were well positioned to support this demand and take market share. Our Q2 gross profit of $1.6 billion increased 105% year-over-year, while our gross margin expanded 210 basis points to 28.4%, above our stated more than 26% long-term target, primarily driven by disciplined cost and pricing management and a dynamic supply-constrained marketplace. SG&A was $902.9 million, an increase of approximately $324 million compared to the combined pro forma prior year period, driven primarily by expenses related to the BMC merger and other acquisitions, including intangible amortization and onetime charges. Variable compensation was also higher due to the increase in net sales and profitability. Excluding acquisition-related onetime charges, underlying SG&A increased by 18.9%. As a percentage of net sales, total SG&A decreased by 360 basis points to 16.2% due to higher sales and continued expense control. Adjusted EBITDA increased 232% to $835.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to a record 15%, an increase of 640 basis points compared to the year-over-year pro forma period, driven primarily by higher sales at strong margins and cost management, including synergy savings. In Q2, adjusted EPS was $2.76 per share compared to combined pro forma of $0.64 a share in the prior year period. The 331.3% increase was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and gross margin, offset by higher tax and higher SG&A expenses due in part to the normalization of COVID expense costs. Adjusted EPS excludes amortization and onetime expenses related to merger and acquisition activity. Let’s turn to cash flow. Our second quarter operating cash flow was an outflow of $3.3 million and free cash was an outflow of $56 million, primarily due to the impact of commodity inflation on working capital. Turning to Slide 15, at the end of the second quarter, our pro forma net debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 1x. We have no long-term debt maturities until 2027 and our total liquidity was approximately $750 million, providing us with significant financial flexibility. Last month, we successfully completed an opportunistic offering of $1 billion of aggregate principal amount of 4.25% unsecured senior notes due in 2032, further strengthening our balance sheet. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay the credit facility with remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. Our strong second quarter and first half performance are the result of superior execution from our field teams. They are meeting the demands of the strong market momentum while delivering excellent service to our customers. While the impact of increased commodity costs is evident in our results, our structural focus remains on profitable growth in our base business. As Dave mentioned, our base business EBITDA is expected to grow 45% this year. We will continue to focus on growing the higher-margin specialty and value-add products and services in our portfolio. At the $400 per thousand commodity level, our value-added mix is roughly 43% of our total sales. From 2019 to 2021, our base business net sales are projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 15.4%, while our EBITDA is projected to grow 32%. That exceptional base growth is expected to be further augmented by commodity tailwinds. In the appendix of the investor presentation on Slide 20, we’ve also provided a sensitivity analysis with various commodity cost assumptions and the corresponding profits if you assume static commodity prices at those levels. Please keep in mind that shorter-term price fluctuations can result in materially different results than in a static commodity environment. Most importantly, the base business perspective provides a sharper view of our run rate regardless of where commodity prices ultimately settle. We believe we can continue to grow our base business next year while sustaining a double-digit EBITDA margin. Let’s turn to our 2021 full year outlook on Slide 16. Our differentiated platform is delivering above-market growth and strong results, which we expect to continue. We are seeing strong underlying demand in both new housing construction and remodel. As we anticipated, builders are seeing such strong demand that they are limiting sales in certain communities to maintain backlogs at prudent levels, given material and labor constraints. Based on our stellar first half performance, our positive conversations with customers, our accelerated integration synergy capture, a better view of our inflation environment and our continued strong organic sales through July, we are increasing our full year 2021 outlook. We expect net sales in the range of $18 billion to $19 billion representing growth of approximately 41% to 48% over 2020 combined pro forma net sales of $12.8 billion. This is driven by an increase in new starts as the key catalyst for our base business growth plus the benefit of robust but receding commodity prices. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion, or approximately 105% to 124% over 2020 combined pro forma adjusted EBITDA and of $1.07 billion. We expect to deliver significant free cash flow over the next 6 months based on normal seasonal flows, declining commodity prices and an active working capital management. Our 2021 free cash flow guidance increases by $100 million to approximately $1.5 billion as increased EBITDA is partially offset by higher working capital from higher sales as well as higher taxes and interest. Our outlook is based on several assumptions, which are outlined in the earnings release, including: mid to high teen percentage growth in single-family starts; our R&R growth in the low to mid-single digits; and multifamily starts growth in the high single digits. As discussed earlier, our commodity assumption provides an 18% to 28% lift to our base business sales growth. Commodity costs have come down over the past several months, and we expect OSB in particular to continue to come down, during which time, we will remain vigilant as we sell through our higher commodity cost materials. Despite the commodity price volatility, we feel confident in hitting our full year guidance. As Dave mentioned, the integration with BMC is ahead of our initial expectations. We now expect to deliver cost synergies of $80 million to $100 million this year. And in addition, we remain focused on accelerating our operational excellence initiatives. Turning to capital allocation, since the merger of BFS and BMC 7 months ago, we have spent considerable time focused on our strategic alignment and the analysis of the best way to deliver value to our shareholders over the long-term. As a result, our priorities for balanced capital deployment are in order, maintaining a strong balance sheet, reinvesting in our business to drive growth and productivity, continuing our tuck-in M&A strategy to grow our capabilities in desirable markets across the country with a specific focus on value-added capabilities, and returning capital to shareholders as appropriate. As part of our balanced capital deployment strategy, we are setting our leverage target in the 1 to 2x range, recognizing that we will appropriately adapt that range to the economic cycle. We remain well positioned to deploy capital effectively after executing multiple value-enhancing transactions, given our robust balance sheet and strong M&A pipeline. Overall, the financial results for the first 6 months have been extraordinary. Our base business is robust, and we believe there is a long runway for growth in the years ahead. We are focusing on creating value for our stakeholders and are continuing to build our world-class distribution network founded on operational excellence and delivering exceptional value to our customers. Let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.
Dave Flitman: Thanks Peter. In summary, demand in single-family housing remains exceptionally strong, and we continue to capitalize on this positive trend by ensuring we meet the needs of our customers, both today and in the future. The BMC integration continues to progress extraordinarily well, and our realization of cost synergies is a year ahead of schedule. Looking forward, we remain focused on executing our strategy of investing both organically and through M&A to continue to align our portfolio with high value and faster growth categories while simultaneously improving efficiencies, productivity and our digital capabilities in the value chain. Our future is bright, and our ability to execute and our hunger to innovate have never been stronger, and we will continue going above and beyond for our customers and partners to provide best-in-class homebuilding solutions. With that, Sarah, let’s open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Reuben Garner with The Benchmark Company.
Reuben Garner: Thank you. Good morning everybody.
Dave Flitman: Good morning, Reuben.
Reuben Garner: So first off, thanks for all the detail in the deck. I think that’s all going to be very helpful for folks seeing how much of your business is not really driven by this lumber market. So maybe if I could start, you mentioned your visibility into next year, how much visibility do you have? In other words, how much business do you think this year is going to be pushed out to next year for you guys? I mean you’re putting up big growth numbers in your manufactured business despite this. Any color into what’s going to get pushed out into 2022?
Dave Flitman: Yes. Reuben, as I mentioned in my comments, we’ve been in contact with our customers quite regularly. And almost without exception, you’ve seen them kind of slow the starts for this year with the intent of pushing demand into next year. And almost to a person, they said this is the strongest environment they have operated in many through their careers. Given the state of the demand which is much, much different than it’s been in a very, very long time, interest rates, we expect the continuation of what we’ve seen this year into next year. And I’d also point out, our focus on our value-added portions of our business are just continuing to gain momentum. And I said it in the script, and I’ll say it again, I’ve got confidence in our ability to continue to drive growth and take share in any market environment.
Reuben Garner: Perfect. Very helpful. And then secondly, on the free cash flow, Peter, it’s a little – I guess, maybe if you could help us out, what free cash flow have you generated thus far in the year? How much working capital investment is, I guess, embedded in that number? I am just trying to figure out, kind of, what’s left to go, what’s sort of the normalized number there and where your balance sheet will stand as we kind of enter 2022. Congrats on the results guys and thanks for your help.
Peter Jackson: Yes. Thanks, Reuben, and great question. It’s been a dynamic year for cash flow as you highlighted. We have seen an investment of over $1.1 billion year-to-date in our working capital space, right? We’re not yet – while the market is certainly turning, we’re not yet on burning through either the summer build of normal inventory or the higher prices that we bought through all year. So year-to-date, our free cash flow has been at use right around $300 million. We do expect to generate the remainder, so the – about $1.8 billion between now and the end of the year. We’ve already started to see that generation in the third quarter. Third quarter will be a very good year, as you would expect as the market turns, and still a significant amount of cash generation into the fourth quarter. So certainly see a clear line of sight of where that will take us. $1.8 billion of additional cash from now to the end of the year is certainly going to put us in a very strong position to deploy capital in ways that will benefit shareholders.
Reuben Garner: Perfect. Thanks again and good luck looking forward.
Dave Flitman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And next, we will move on to Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.
Mike Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Peter, I wanted to pick up on the cash flow and also the capital allocation, Dave. Peter, I think you have a more technical and colorful term for how much cash is coming in the next 6 months, a little restrained here, not even that. But if you look at that turn lever currently, that’s clearly going to come down when you kind of net out the cash in the second half versus the M&A, you still wind up close to zero net debt. So that kind of checks off the box on a maintained strong balance sheet. When you think about the three other priorities, I know it’s in order here from kind of a medium to longer-term standpoint. But when you’re thinking more near-term in nature, next couple of quarters, next few quarters, is there any bias across the three? I mean whether it’s reinvesting internally for their tuck-in M&A or returning capital? That last one hasn’t been a part of the pro forma company yet. So, just any color on kind of more near-term, how that balance shakes out?
Peter Jackson: So, a couple of comments, obviously, really excited about the strength of the balance sheet. Our action to put structural very favorable debt out there, the 2032 notes 4.25% unsecured is something we’re very proud of. One of the agencies gave our secured notes and investment-grade rating. We certainly are proud of what we’ve done on the balance sheet and excited about what that means. To your point, we’ve put our priorities out there. I think we are excited about what the pipeline looks like for opportunities to continue to grow in M&A, but we’re going to remain disciplined. We’re not going to get out over our skis on valuations. We’re very clear-eyed about what commodities do over time, that can’t be a driver. And we think that, that pathway will certainly yield opportunities. Your comment about not having done share buybacks as a pro forma entity is absolutely correct. Both prior entities have done share buybacks. So I don’t think anybody is necessarily opposed to the concept. It’s more a matter of making sure we’re looking at the situation each month, each quarter and making the absolute right decisions for the long term for our shareholders. So we’re going to stay committed to that, and we will continue to message as things develop.
Mike Dahl: Got it. That’s helpful. My second question is just on the manufactured products, I mean that is exceptional growth even in a – even against the strong market backdrop. And so clearly, there is some share gains there. I know it’s probably difficult, but is there any way that you could kind of talk to how much of that growth was effectively seeing increased adoption or conversion within your existing customer base, versus potentially the added capacity that you’ve brought on and/or just a higher customer count in your manufactured products segment? Thanks.
Dave Flitman: Mike, this is Dave. We had both legacy companies, as you know, had strong underlying momentum and a strong focus on manufactured components for a long time. And both of us, we’re continuing to gain share. When we put this team together, we knew, particularly in overlap markets, there will be increased opportunities for us to accelerate that growth, both internally based on what we were doing with our assets and where we saw opportunities to extend capacity, which has been very tight in some markets where we’ve had rapid adoption. But importantly, continuing to convert customers at a higher rate. Those new customers, what I would say more importantly and probably more impactfully, is accelerating growth with customers we’ve already had relationships in certain geographies and our merger helped them get more comfortable in accelerating and extending that across their footprint.
Mike Dahl: That’s good to hear. Thanks, Dave. Thanks Peter.
Dave Flitman: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And next we will take Matthew Bouley with Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: Good morning everyone. Hey, Dave, thank you for taking the questions. I echo…
Dave Flitman: Sure. Happy Birthday, Matt. We appreciate you spending your Birthday morning with us. I think, you ought to get a bigger size piece of cake for that.
Matthew Bouley: This is exactly what I imagine for my Birthday, so much appreciated. So, yes, well, you provided a gift here, so a lot of things to ask about. Let me ask about the digital opportunity, the $1 billion. Dave, you mentioned at the top that you’re going to – part of this is using, if I heard you correctly, Paradigm to accelerate value-add adoption. And you list on one of the slides that there is – look like four or five kind of drivers of the $1 billion. And what I’m wondering is kind of – if you could kind of bucket that out, how much comes from scaling the Paradigm software versus how much comes from that litany of internal drivers and across wallet share and driving value-add adoption? Thank you.
Dave Flitman: Well, the internal piece – I appreciate the question – the internal piece is something internally that we feel strongly about where we can gain some efficiencies, and just we are internally today have very manual processes as we go from design to estimating for our customers. And there are two key things that are going to help us accelerate towards that $1 billion. And obviously, these are early days, and we still have a lot to figure out. And, by the way, we haven’t closed the transaction yet. But in our early thinking, we see opportunities to extend their platform more broadly across our customer base, which Nathan and his team have done a great job to get the customers that they have gotten, but we just got a bigger platform in the ability to scale that. But if you think also about long-term, being able to automate our design and takeoffs and actually provide our customers with an estimate of our full capability, including our manufactured components and READY-FRAME and even further down our millwork capability, which is at the core of what Paradigm does today, we just see that ability and the ease with which we will be able to do that over the long-term, being a great value proposition for our customers and the ability to get our value-added products in front of them in a more seamless way.
Matthew Bouley: Wonderful. Okay. That’s helpful. And yes, we will look for that additional color upon the deal closure, but that is very helpful. Second one on the margin side. You made a comment at the top that the base business margin, the 10.1% this year is something that you see as sustainable, if not with the potential to further expand. If I’m doing the math right, with a little bit of rounding, it looks like your core base business incremental margin in the guide this year is right around 18% give or take. And correct me if I’m wrong. But – so high level, the question is, – is it that you can further expand structural gross margins? Or is it that you’re shifting to additional SG&A leverage? And I think one thing that would be helpful to address a common question we get from investors is if any of the base business margin, that 10%, if you think any of that may have also been temporarily benefited by extreme lumber prices and shortages there? So it’s a long question, but I would appreciate any color. Thank you.
Dave Flitman: Yes, there is a lot in that. Let me try to unpack it a little bit, and then I’ll have Peter come over the top with any further color. But I am confident in our ability to continue to expand that margin over the long haul. I think to your last question, no, I don’t think there was any outsized impact based on lumber in that. And as you think about our core business, and as Peter highlighted, 43% of that today roughly is our value-added areas. With the growth that we see, the continued improvement in mix, we just accelerated our synergy capability here. We’re going to capture that over the next 6 to 12 months. And in addition to that, you think about our ability to drive operational excellence in this combined company, which we’re just starting to think about and get after over the long haul. We see the ability to continue to improve our margins over time. So it’s a combination of growth and internal work that we see going on that will continue to enable us over the long haul to expand those margins.
Peter Jackson: Yes. So, just a little bit of color on that, Matt, we have seen a couple of, I’d call it, leakage of the impact and the acceleration of price in the marketplace into other buckets, we try to normalize for that in here. We try to look at the margins that we thought were sustainable over the long-term. We’ve talked in the past about sort of a normalized amount of gross margin. We try to account for that in this and allow the rest of it to slosh over into the commodity unusual pricing bucket. So I think that is an important one. And like I said, we have a lot of different ways to drive the performance of this business on a go-forward basis. And I think it’s all of the above. It’s that expanded value add, it’s the efficiency in that more gross margin line, it’s the efficiency in SG&A, a lot of operational excellence, a lot of improvements that we think we still have in front of us as we continue to solve problems for our customers and just grow.
Matthew Bouley: Wonderful. Well, that is very clear. Thank you, Peter and thank you, Dave and best of luck guys.
Dave Flitman: Appreciate, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we will take our next question from David Manthey with Baird.
David Manthey: Hi, thank you. Good morning everyone.
Dave Flitman: Good morning, Dave.
Peter Jackson: Good morning.
David Manthey: So lumber prices, they clearly have an impact on both the OpEx leverage in the P&L and the gross margin itself via mix. But as we look at the table in the appendix sort of top to bottom, are we to assume that behind that, you’re looking at SG&A dollars that are materially flat in every one of those states of being in that appendix table?
Peter Jackson: No. Our expectation is that about roughly 70% of SG&A remains variable. That’s the rule of thumb that we’ve used historically. I mean this is base only. So you have to sort of exclude that commodity price fluctuation component.
David Manthey: Okay. And then secondly, as it relates to the table as well, you note here that these are constant lumber prices for the full year. And just to level set, can you talk about the dynamics in real life as you move from tier-to-tier across this table, just what are some of the moving parts that we should look for as you sort of chase lumber prices up and down and the impact on the P&L?
Peter Jackson: Sure. Yes. I mean I think it’s consistent with what we have said in the past about commodities. We certainly want investors and view the analyst community to have a clear understanding of how our business works. As you deal with the increases and decreases in commodities, there are certain characteristics of certain parts of the country that are impactful on the results. When you have inflation, where you’ve got longer fixed-price contracts, whether it be 60 days and the smaller percentage that’s left that are the 90 days or 90 days plus, you inevitably will see a compression in the gross margin percentage as that inflation occurs. And then as it reverses, you’ll see an expansion in the gross margin percentage. Inversely, you will also see it in markets with very, very fast pricing turns where everything is very short. Sometimes you will see the exact opposite, where you will see expanding margins on the way up and declining margins on the way down as you’re pricing off a replacement in a very fast turnaround environment. By and large, we, of course, want to make sure we’re turning inventory quickly so that whatever those impacts are, they happen quickly, right? They pass through very quickly. We’re – and I’ll reemphasize this, we’re not in the game of predicting and betting on commodities. We’re in the game of distributing commodities to the advantage of our broader business. And I think that our demonstrated performance historically shows that we’re pretty good at it. We know how to make money in ups and downs. It’s a matter of making sure you’re running it in a disciplined and operationally excellent manner.
David Manthey: That’s perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we will move on to Keith Hughes with Truist.
Keith Hughes: Thank you. Question on the manufactured products number, I know that does get impacted by commodity inflation. So is there a way you can talk about units, how much units were up year-over-year?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So that’s the attempt. That 58% excludes what we believe to be the overlap from commodities. That’s actually a new note 48% in there, Keith, on Slide 5. In that footnote, you can see we sort of called out, it’s about 4% of that 22% that has some exposure to commodities, as you think about the commodities are included in what we manufacture.
Keith Hughes: Okay. So that gets closer we can get to a unit number, is that what you’re trying to say?
Peter Jackson: Yes. Well, we’ve communicated at close. Based on our analysis of price volume mix, that’s our best estimate, yes.
Keith Hughes: Okay. And second question on the guidance for the second half implies EBITDA up year-over-year, is that going to slant towards the third or fourth quarter given commodity impact or any sort of directional guidance there would be helpful?
Peter Jackson: Well, I wouldn’t hesitate to say third quarter is always higher than the fourth quarter just due to normal seasonality.
Dave Flitman: Normal seasonality.
Peter Jackson: And I think that the impact of commodity is as it occurs.
Keith Hughes: I’m talking about the gain year-over-year. Because the slant – is there going to be more of a gain in one quarter versus the other?
Peter Jackson: Based on a prior year comparison?
Keith Hughes: Yes.
Peter Jackson: I hope I know that off the top of my head.
Keith Hughes: Okay, you can get back on this one.
Peter Jackson: Yes. It’s probably a little more weighted to Q3. Just by nature of the seasonality, it’s a little bigger and the fall-through would be a little bigger in that quarter.
Keith Hughes: Okay, alright. Thank you.
Dave Flitman: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we will take our question from Steven Ramsey, Thompson Research Group.
Steven Ramsey: Hi, good morning. Maybe to start with on the divestiture of the gypsum operations, is that a meaningful impact to the incremental margins that are non-lumber?
Peter Jackson: No, it’s not. It’s a fairly small business in total, and the margins were below average.
Steven Ramsey: Great. And then thinking about product shortages, you referred to for windows, doors, millworks – millwork. Is that something – I am sure it’s embedded in the guidance for 2H, but in the second half, is that a major impact? And then – or is it a greater impact as you get into next year?
Peter Jackson: Well, I mean, it’s been an impact all year. I think if you – as you look at the other part of our business, right. The other part of our value-add business, windows, doors and millwork, it’s trailed a little bit in terms of growth. Still strong, but not where we think it should be. A couple of pieces of that, obviously, a chunk of that is the expansion in units under construction, and it’s just sort of how far along a lot of these homes are. But some of the cause of them being as – there being as many units under construction as there are, is that we have just struggled. Lead times are longer. They have been longer for, gosh, coming up on nine months plus. So, this is not new news. I think we just consistently fight it in the channel. I think it’s one of those areas where we would see faster completions and faster cycling of, sort of, the growth in our market if we could relieve that. I know they are trying, but it certainly continues – I would say, in a stable way. It may be a little bit less bad than it was, but still bad.
Dave Flitman: Yes. I would say we saw a little acceleration in our organic growth there from Q1 to Q2, which kind of reflects what Peter just highlighted. But our teams are just doing a tremendous job to get product for our customers. And as I mentioned, we have heard from our builders, they have slowed starts. It’s not a demand problem. The reason those starts have been slowed is exclusively because of the challenges that they have had around labor and materials. And we are doing our best to satisfy those needs on both fronts.
Steven Ramsey: Excellent. And then last thing, lumber pricing, clearly on randomly starts coming down, but some people we talk to in-channel checks have said that lumber transactions, the pricing is not coming down on the ground. Are you seeing that in your business?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I mean we do so much commodity across the country. I would say we probably see everything in one place or another. I think speculating on commodity prices and what it’s going to do is, in our world, something where – it’s a bit of a fool’s errand, as demonstrated by my forecast last quarter. So, I think we will just maybe leave that along.
Steven Ramsey: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And next, we will take our next question from Stanley Elliott.
Stanley Elliott: Hi, good morning everyone. Thank you all for taking the question and congratulations. Could you talk a little bit more about the Alliance acquisition? If I remember correctly, they didn’t do a whole lot of value-add millwork like you all do. What’s the opportunity set here for you all to put that through their channel and how quickly can you realize that?
Dave Flitman: Yes. We are excited about that. I made a couple of comments there in the script about that as an opportunity. We had a relatively small footprint in the states, as you know, half a dozen or so locations. They have got great capability on the component side, which we are excited about, but they have not had the millwork opportunity, and we are very strong in millwork, as you know. And so we will see how quickly we can get that ramped up. The team is excited about it, both the Alliance team as well as our team. And we will get after that one as quickly as we can. There is obviously a clear need in that market, given the growth that they are experiencing. And so we are excited about that.
Stanley Elliott: In M&A, you have always did a very nice job of rolling up markets. Does the shortage in some of the materials that you are seeing now, does that change your thought process on maybe moving into, maybe adding some capacity on the value-added side versus consolidating some of the smaller dealerships?
Dave Flitman: I don’t think it materially changes it. And we are doing both. We are investing quite heavily in capabilities on value added, both in the millwork side and the component side as we see a long runway there of adoption and growth in the markets. And we are still looking in the markets to understand where it makes sense for us to augment our capability through the right M&A, which may help us expand our geographic footprint in the local market. And so as we have talked about both on our capital allocation and just our overall strategy, we are going to continue to do both.
Peter Jackson: And just to add on to that, one thing that’s exciting in some of these opportunities is that we have got the efficiency, the skill sets to help them improve their performance to get more out of these businesses that they are managing. So, I think that adds to our ability to meet the capacity constraints in the market. And as far as being there for our customers, we certainly believe that increased scale and the partnerships that, that helps to create in the long run with vendors is certainly – it’s advantageous to us and puts us in a position to get, at least if not more than our fair share, as we deal with typical supply environment.
Stanley Elliott: Great guys. Thank you very much and best of luck.
Dave Flitman: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms: Hi. Thanks guys. And yes, I wanted to echo on the deck as well, super helpful. But my question, I guess first off, is the follow-up back on one of the earlier ones around the base business EBITDA margins. And clearly, the incrementals are running high-teens I think you did 10.4 this quarter. And like you said, David, obviously, there is potential for some upside here. But Dave, where do you see this base business margin opportunity over time as you look at all the moving pieces? Clearly, it’s higher. But with these types of incrementals, where could we see this going over time?
Dave Flitman: Yes. We are excited about it. We think both the top and the bottom line will continue to grow over time. We are not going to project that this morning, Trey. But I will promise you we are absolutely focused on it. That is the focus of this company right now, our base business our value-added capabilities. We are going to grow it. We are going to continue to improve profitability, and we are going to invest in it.
Trey Grooms: Alright. Fair enough. I thought it was worth a shot. And then – and then, Peter, a minute ago, you mentioned some of the dynamics that we have come to understand over the years with lumber price fluctuations, where this most recent spike in lumber, you guys had kind of bucked the trend. It hasn’t been your normal kind of reaction as far as the – to the gross margin percentage. So – and you mentioned that when things move widely – or wildly quickly, that the margin can react differently, almost the opposite of what we see in a more normal kind of lumber price movement kind of environment. So, with that said, is – so you guys have been really outperforming or actually seeing margins higher as a result of this spike up. So, is it the expectation per your comment earlier that it’s like a decremental on the way down that we should expect some kind of normalization of the gross margin just as these prices come down? Did I read that right? Excluding the core business, which obviously is the big focus in what we care about, but unfortunately, we still have to model the lumber piece, too. So – but is that kind of what you were pointing to there?
Peter Jackson: Well, I am not signaling a downturn. I guess what I want to be upfront about, and I think we have talked about a little bit on prior calls, is the nature of those extended terms, the mix of those extended terms have materially changed. So, where there was a more extreme impact on the way up and a pretty extreme impact on the way down, right. Headwind on the margin, percentage on the way up, strong tailwind on the market, percentage on the way down, I think both of those are diminished. I think they are diminished because of the reduction in average days of price lock in our mix of sales. I don’t think it’s signaling a downturn into the future. I think a lot of the fall-through that we are dialing out and this analytic comes from other parts of the business and commodities and the pricing volatility, the nature of some buying that we did, all of that, all glommed together in that number. I don’t think it’s going to be a real big headwind for us. Anytime you have fluctuations, especially as massively as they are now, there is always a little bit of uncertainty as to how it all filters through. But based on what we are seeing in the detail, inventory levels, pricing levels, we think we can manage through it very effectively. I just wanted to sort of signal that there – I don’t think there is going to be as big of a windfall as there have been in the last cycles.
Trey Grooms: Great. Thanks for the clarity there. It appears that was perfect. And thanks again for taking the question. Keep up the good work. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And next, we will move on to Ketan Mamtora, BMO Capital Markets.
Ketan Mamtora: Thanks for squeezing me in and let me add my congratulations. Coming back to the value-added side of the piece, obviously, really strong results, so I am just curious, are there any particular regions or areas of the country where you are seeing more growth or is it more-broad based?
Dave Flitman: Yes. The exciting part about it is we have seen that expansion and growth broadly across all the geographies. So, there is not one that I would point to that would be outpaced strong. Obviously, the strength that we have in the South and in Texas, a kind of leads the way, but as we have gained adoption and accelerated penetration, it’s really broad based.
Ketan Mamtora: Got it. That’s helpful. And then can you just remind us in terms of the capacity headroom that you have, both on the manufacturer side and the millwork side, particularly in light of the strong growth that you guys are seeing?
Dave Flitman: No, it’s a challenge. We were spending – as I mentioned earlier, we have been spending quite a bit of capital to increase our capacity in key markets. In addition to that, we are driving productivity and efficiencies to just gain any incremental capacity that we can. I think, given the strength of the market and the adoption rate of what we are seeing. We are going to fight that for a bit, but we are not losing sales today because we can’t supply. The challenge, as Peter talked about earlier, has been in some of the upfront supply chain challenges and just getting materials. We are not the bottleneck currently, but it’s something that we have got to be diligent about and stay on top of.
Ketan Mamtora: Got it. That’s helpful. Good luck in the back half of the year.
Dave Flitman: I appreciate it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.
Jay McCanless: Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
Dave Flitman: Good morning.
Jay McCanless: First – good morning. Given the velocity of the business now and the lower lumber prices, do you – do you think third quarter this year’s gross margin is trending more towards what we saw in the first quarter, or something closer to what we saw in the second quarter? Just wondering with all the turnover and what seems to be a better outlook for multi-family on Builders FirstSource part, just wondering how quickly that change in lumber prices is going to flow through to the gross margin.
Peter Jackson: Well, I think historically, we have talked about the timeline for the flow-through of changes in commodities, just being in that quarter-ish time line, one quarter to two quarters. So, I think that’s – it’s fair to say that there will be a bit of a fade. Obviously, Q2 had the lapping of the worst of COVID. We have gotten a lot of good benefits year-on-year. So, I think settling back as prices settle back over the next quarter or two quarters is still appropriate.
Jay McCanless: And then could you maybe talk about multi-family? It sounds like the demand from what’s coming in has changed and you have gone to positive growth there from, I think, negative growth before. A, what’s going on there? B, is this helping to offset maybe a little bit slower pace from single-family builders?
Peter Jackson: Yes. That’s been a nice, sort of surprise, a little ray of sunlight coming through in multi-family when we thought it would be pretty weak. Now just to clarify for those that maybe aren’t as familiar with us, our multi-family is a pretty market specific focused business on most of the country. It’s four-story and below wood structures, a couple of businesses that do quite well in the high-rise market, but they are fairly small. So, a lot of our work is project focused. I think what you see is the resurgence of a little bit of that multi-family housing market as people realize that the new homes aren’t going to come out of the ground as fast as people maybe would have hoped, as all of us maybe would have hoped. And those 3 million to 5 million underbuilt or underserved homebuyers are going to need some place to live until we are ready. So, I think what you are seeing is a little bit of a rebound there. It’s still pretty modest, but we are certainly pleased with it because it was, as you know, pretty grim there on the outlook for a while.
Jay McCanless: Perfect. And my compliments on the new deck as well. There is a lot of good detail there. Thanks for taking my questions.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we will move on to Collin Verron with Jefferies.
Collin Verron: Hi guys. Thank you for taking my question. Most of my questions have actually been answered already. But I guess I will touch on the new leverage target. You seem to be very bullish on demand for the next several years. So, can you just tie together your bullish commentary, maybe how many more years of growth you see in the cycle with that new 1x to 2x leverage range that you put out there today?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I mean I think that it’s exciting times to be in Builders FirstSource is what that blows down to. We have got we think a really strong positioning on the business in terms of what we have been able to do with the balance sheet, the long maturities, the low and declining interest rates. And we are doing it in a way that makes the business bulletproof. Our focus, our recognition is to make sure we have an incredibly strong balance sheet throughout the cycle. This is a great time in the cycle where we think that there is more runway and we are going to continue to generate cash. Our job is to put it to work and maximize the shareholder benefit, and benefit the business, make sure we are healthy and our stakeholders are satisfied and taking care of and provides a great return. And I think we are lining it up in a way that we have got a lot of firepower to do a bunch of different things. And we are going to be disciplined about how we put that to work. And the math we are doing around the return on investment for internal investments, for M&A and for potential returning of capital to shareholders is disciplined. And we are going to continue to work with the Board and management to make those decisions in the best possible way.
Collin Verron: Great. Thank you for the color.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next caller – question from Kurt Yinger.
Kurt Yinger: Great. Thanks and good morning everyone.
Dave Flitman: Good morning Kurt.
Kurt Yinger: Good morning. Just one quick one on the EBITDA incremental, it looks like in ‘21, on the commodities, that margin is about 20% or so. I guess the question is, as we look ahead to 2022 and make whatever assumption we want around lumber prices and the top line impact there, is that the same type of incremental margin we should be kind of looking for, presumably, on the way down or do you have any thoughts around anything you are doing internally around pricing or things like that, that could kind of dampen that impact?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So, I think the way down versus the way up comment is exactly why we did Slide 5. I think that was really our intent is to help people understand where it wants to be when commodity prices are at that $400. So, I think that’s a really healthy way to look at it. I just remind everybody how dynamic this year has been, how volatile. I mean these words coming from the guy who thought we were going to descend gently from our roughly $900 or $1,000 commodity levels back when the last time we met on this call. It’s been a heck of a ride since. And I think what you are seeing in these numbers is a lot of the impact of that volatility in one way, shape or form. So, that expectation of it going back to the 15.3 and the $1.6 billion number for ‘21, we really wanted you to have that just to give you a sense of what we think the base business really looks like. And hopefully, that answers your question appropriately.
Kurt Yinger: Yes. That’s helpful. And I guess just one higher level question. I mean you are still relatively early in the process of combining the business and a lot of things are going very well. I am just curious from a pure scale perspective and the relationships you have with your suppliers and your customers, which positive areas of the business that you are seeing right now, do you feel like have really been augmented by that increased scale, putting together BMC and BFS?
Dave Flitman: Yes. Now, I am thrilled about a lot of things, but the results that you are seeing in the value-added areas of the business. As I said earlier, were exactly what we envisioned and hope for, and it’s great to see that playing out. Our organization is focused on it. We are continuing to provide innovation. We are continuing to invest in that part of the business. And as I said, we have got a long, long runway ahead of us.
Peter Jackson: Yes, I don’t think any of us have that forecasted number of 58%...
Dave Flitman: In growth.
Peter Jackson: Right. So, the ability of the team to be put together like they have been and execute at that level, it’s really amazing, it’s awesome.
Dave Flitman: The cultural alignment has been fantastic.
Kurt Yinger: Okay, alright. Well, I appreciate all the color guys and good luck here in the back half.
Dave Flitman: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And lastly we will take Ryan Gilbert with BTIG.
Ryan Gilbert: Hi. Thanks guys.
Dave Flitman: Good morning.
Ryan Gilbert: First question is – good morning. First question on manufactured products, I think over the last couple of quarters, we have talked about the growth on – the core organic growth in the manufactured products segment being driven primarily by existing customer relationships. And I am wondering as we move into the peak building season here, and the really strong core organic growth you put up in 2Q, if you are seeing the customer base expand from the last couple of quarters. And then just – if that has been the case, your thoughts on the stickiness of that new customer base and how that influences your thoughts around normalized gross margin if we can do better than 26 to 26.5?
Dave Flitman: Yes. I mean, very good question. And as I have just said, that clearly is the focus of the organization in our value-add. We have seen great adoption. I think I commented earlier that we are seeing really good adoption with customers who have had experience with our value-added capabilities in one geography or another, or maybe a few and are gaining more confidence based on what they have seen in those markets around what our value-added capability can do – can do to help them both with labor challenges and drive outpaced efficiencies at the job site. So, we see a long runway here over time. And the other thing I would say and I think I said this in my prepared remarks, a disproportionate amount of the new homes being constructed are those starter homes, and that lends itself very well to the structural design work that we do in our components business. And so given all that backdrop and the focus that we have on it, we will continue to see the adoption increase.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay, great. Second question is on multi-family. I know legacy BMC had a really nice multi-family operation that flowed through – or complemented the millwork, doors and windows segment of their business. And as we see multi-family start to rebound, I am wondering the extent that you have been able to take the legacy BMC multi-family operation and expand it to the entire pro forma business?
Dave Flitman: Yes. Let me just comment and I will flip it over to Peter here for any additional color. You are right to portray the focus that we had at BMC being very strong. But I would highlight what Peter said earlier, even in the BMC legacy footprint, it was a very targeted approach to multi-family and key markets in the South, a little bit up in the East and somewhat out in California and the West Coast. It was not broad based. And I think that our targeted market focus is exactly why we had such success. We knew where those markets were going to be strong for some period of time, and that’s where we had the capability. And our team was just fantastic at driving growth.
Peter Jackson: Yes. And I think that the combined multi-family business has done well. I think they have partnered well and are seeing strong performance. What we consider to be taking market share, it’s a little hard to communicate that and we are talking about comparisons to national metrics. But we think we are doing really well with that business. Anybody who has the background in the multi-family recognizes the longer cycle times on those projects, cycle times that are particularly disrupted by extremely volatile commodity prices. So, there has been – it’s been – of all the markets they have been as active as anybody. But we certainly are still very pleased with the performance of that business, both top and bottom line.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude today’s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Michael Neese for any additional or closing remarks.
Michael Neese: Thank you, Sarah and thank you everyone for your time and interest in BFS. We are around all day to take your questions. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude today’s teleconference. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-09 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for joining Builders FirstSource First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Michael Neese, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource will now provide the company's opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Neese: Thank you, Brad. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter of 2021 earnings call. I hope you and your families continue to remain safe and well. With me on the call are Dave Flitman our CEO; and Peter Jackson, CFO. Today, we will provide an overview of a record first quarter results, discuss the integration highlight, and share how we are well-positioned for continued success in 2021 and beyond. We have provided GAAP results which include BMC in Q1 of 2021 and standalone BFS in Q1 of 2020. We also provide a pro forma result as if we own BMC in Q1 of 2020. A slide deck in this morning's press release are available on our website at investors.bldr.com. The results discussed during the call will include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes and they should not be considered in isolation from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they were useful to investors can be found at the back of the earnings press release and in the presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation, and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statement section in today's press release and our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements and projections. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Flitman: Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. The positive momentum in our business continued with our record first quarter results. I very much appreciate the efforts of our more than 26,000 team members who are working tirelessly to provide best-in-class service for our customers in these unprecedented market conditions. They continue to grow our business while meeting the needs of our customers in a highly constrained supply environment. We are working closely with our customers and suppliers to reduce cycle-times amid material availability constraints and capitalize on our nation's very strong demand for single-family residential housing. And in that context, the power of our platform is evident as we are seeing rapid growth across all product lines and I could not be more pleased with our team's results. I'll cover five important topics on today's call; first, the positive macro and residential housing environment; second, our record first quarter results and what drove our out-performance; third, our excitement about how we think about our core business and a brief word on commodities; fourth, an update on our latest acquisition and the strength of our M&A pipeline; and finally, an update on the integration of BMC, which is running ahead of our plan. I'd like to take just a minute and share why I remain bullish on our industry and our company. First, let's look at residential housing. According to Freddie Mac the US housing market is 3.8 million single-family homes short of what is needed to meet the country's demand, representing a 52% increase in the nation's home shortage compared with 2018. The gap has widened significantly over the past two years as builders have struggled to keep up with demand in part due to labor and material supply constraints. These challenges play to our strengths including our structural component and value-added offerings. In recent years we have seen accelerating success in these areas and we believe there remains a tremendous opportunity for demand and demographically fueled growth ahead of us. In terms of demand, according to the US Census Bureau, total housing starts jumped 19.4% in March to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.74 million. The National Association of Home Builders reported that this is the fastest pace for combined single-family and multifamily construction in 15 years. There were only about one million existing homes for sale at the end of February, a nearly 30% drop compared with February 2020. That is the largest annual decline ever and the lowest supply on record. This should bode well for a strong construction pace of new housing starts as we move into the summer season. Improving housing starts, historically low mortgage rates, and a shift towards single-family living are all positive trends that remain tailwinds for our products and services. We now operate in 47 of the top 50 and 86 of the top 100 MSAs. Many of which are not only among the largest, but also some of the fastest-growing MSAs in the country. Our ability to manufacture and assemble structural components at our offsite facilities provides an integrated one-stop solution that helps solve the most challenging needs for our customers; labor availability and job site productivity. As a result of this area of strength and innovation, we expect to continue to outpace market growth for many years to come. Now, let's turn to our record first quarter results. We delivered another very strong top and bottom-line quarter and importantly our organic growth again outpaced the market as we continue to gain market share. On slide three of our investor deck, on a combined basis for BFS and BMC, total sales grew 54% to $4.2 billion. Our core organic sales growth increased 22%. Gross profit increased more than 50% and adjusted EBITDA increased an impressive 187% to $455 million. These record results reflect the favorable housing market, our industry-leading position, our ability to deliver value, and a continuation of our disciplined approach to cost management. We firmly believe our core organic sales growth is sustainable for the long-term and we are positioned for outperformance through economic cycles. We have received questions from analysts and investors over the past quarter about commodities wondering what our underlying growth would look like in recent years if we normalized the commodity side of our business. Holding commodities flat at $400 per 1,000 board feet, our estimates show we have outpaced market growth by 20% from 2018 through 2020 resulting in a roughly 8% revenue CAGR. And that momentum continues to accelerate in the first quarter of this year. Yet another way we have consistently demonstrated our ability to far outperform the market and take advantage of our differentiated product platform.  Now, as a combined entity, we have the geographical presence and even stronger platform to further advance our strategy. Turning to M&A, we announced today that we closed on our most recent acquisition earlier this month, John's Lumber, a premier building materials supplier serving the largest housing market in Michigan. The acquisition provides enhanced scale that will benefit our existing 14 locations in the State. The company generated approximately $49 million in net sales for the trailing 12 months ended March 31st 2021. We're excited to welcome the John's Lumber team members to the BFS family. With our very strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow generation, we will continue to reinvest in our business while actively pursuing M&A opportunities. As you can see on slide 5, we have identified over 500 targets and we will continue to be a consolidator in this industry for a long time to come. Finally, I'd like to update you on the BMC integration. Our efforts are ahead of schedule and we remain highly confident in achieving three-year cost synergies of $130 million to $150 million. For 2021, we expect to meet or exceed $60 million to $70 million in realized savings. We saw merger-related cost savings begin to accumulate in the first quarter and are accelerating in the second quarter. We continue to drive our internal operating system, which will allow us to accelerate productivity, improve processes and continue to grow our margins, while servicing our customers more competitively. We believe we can continue to help offset cost escalation with our offsite manufacturing processes and other value-added products including trusses, millwork, wall panels and ready-frame. We are also seeing positive momentum in our growth efforts, as our teams work together to leverage our scale and product strengths. The early returns are reflected in our exceptional first quarter results. These are exciting times and we are continuing to build our world-class home building distribution platform that positions us as a partner of choice. Before I turn the call over to Peter, I would like to highlight one of our many value team members. May is military appreciation month. Throughout the month, Builders FirstSource is celebrating our many veterans and profiling several of their success stories. One such story focuses on Jason Bennett, the General Manager of our De Pere, Wisconsin lumber location. He joined BFS five years ago, after serving for 23 years in the US army. As a First Sergeant, Jason was responsible for 200 soldiers. He ensured their safety, welfare and training while on active duty roles. And he learned key management skills that would last long after his military career. When it was time to retire from the military, Jason looked for a company that shared the values instilled in him by the army. And he found that in Builders FirstSource. Jason joined BFS as a delivery manager in Colorado Springs and immediately fit right in. He worked his way up to operations manager and then general manager. He led his team in adopting new logistics technologies, specifically our delivery and dispatch management system and was able to increase delivery efficiency by 20%. Jason is now a general manager in Wisconsin where he focuses on the safety of his team members and customers. His location continued as accident-free street and recently hit four years without a single recordable incident. We are proud to be a place where veterans feel valued and where their skills and experience translate into a rewarding civilian career. We're grateful for veterans like Jason and how they've served our country and are pleased to have them as part of the BFS family. With that, let me turn the call over to Peter to go through a detailed look at our Q1 results and our 2021 updated financial guidance.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. I too would like to thank all of our team members for delivering fantastic results in this unprecedented environment. Your focus and execution is frankly, incredible. I'll cover three topics with you this morning. First, I'll review our combined first quarter results compared to the pro forma results from the prior year quarter. Then, I'll discuss our free cash flow and strong balance sheet. And finally, I'll provide updated guidance on the markets and our forecasted results for full year 2021. Net sales of $4.2 billion for the quarter increased 54.1% compared to the combined pro forma prior year period. Value added core organic sales increased by 22% led by 41.5% growth in our manufactured products category and 7% growth in our windows doors and millwork category. Commodity price inflation increased net sales by 31.3% and acquisitions contributed 2.4% to net sales growth. In Q1, we experienced stronger than expected demand in single-family starts across the country. And we are well positioned to support that demand. Our strong relationships with suppliers enable us to bridge product availability constraints and our value-added products and services provide relief from labor shortages. Our Q1 gross profit of $1.1 billion was an increase of 52.1% year-over-year. Gross margin of 25.6% was slightly better than expected but decreased 40 basis points compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a one-time purchase accounting adjustment. In light of the dramatic increase in costs this year, especially in commodities, I am pleased with our performance driven by the disciplined execution of our procurement and sales teams. SG&A increased 35.3% in the quarter, driven primarily by higher variable compensation related to the increase in profitability as well as depreciation and amortization and one-time charges, primarily related to the BMC merger. Excluding these variables, underlying SG&A decreased by 2.6%. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 270 basis points to 19.7% and it cost leverage on higher sales and continued strong expense controls, which more than offset higher variable costs. Adjusted EBITDA increased 187% to $455.2 million, driven by strong demand in single-family new constructions, commodity price inflation and cost leverage. Our adjusted EBITDA margin improved to a record 10.9%, which was up 500 basis points compared to 5.9% in the same combined pro forma period a year ago. Leverage on sales along with cost management and early synergies drove margin expansion. Core organic value-added product sales were especially impactful due to its rapid growth and higher average margins. We are in the early innings of our cost synergies and pricing opportunities. And we are accelerating our synergy capture and leveraging our combined capabilities. Let's turn to our first quarter cash flow, which was an outflow of $237 million due to our normal seasonal timing of working capital. In the quarter, we used $200.5 million in operating activities, primarily related to investments of over $500 million in networking capital. At the end of the first quarter, our pro forma net debt ratio was approximately 1.2 times our LTM adjusted EBITDA. We have no long-term debt maturities until 2027. And our total liquidity was approximately $1.1 million providing us with significant financial flexibility. Our strong first quarter results are a testament to our category-leading team and product portfolio, meeting the demands of the strong market momentum. While the impact of increased commodity costs is evident in our results, what is most important to us is that we continue to generate exceptional and sustained growth in our core business with a strong margin profile. The focus of our business is in higher margin, specialty and value-added products and services. Our portfolio of efficient problem solving products such as trusses and millwork continues to grow faster than the overall market. These specialty and value-added products and services have improved our margins over the years, as we help our customers solve labor availability, speed of construction and quality challenges on the job site. And as we have continued to consolidate the industry, we have created a consistent trend of improving operations and driving above market growth, while delivering accelerating EBITDA fall through. We have clearly created a competitively differentiated platform that can drive above-market growth, accelerate that growth with M&A and deliver fantastic bottom line results in any market environment. Let's turn to our 2021 full year outlook. We continue to see strong underlying demand in both new housing construction and remodeling. As we anticipated, builders are seeing such strong demand, that they are limiting sales in certain communities to keep from increasing backlogs due to material and labor availability constraints. Consistent with our first quarter results, our strong organic sales continued in April. Based on our Q1 performance, our positive conversations with customers, our realized synergies with the BMC acquisition and a better view of our pricing and cost environment, we are increasing our full year 2021 outlook. We expect full year net sales to grow to a range of $16 billion to $17 billion or approximately 25% to 33% over our 2020 pro forma net sales of 12.8 billion. This is driven by an increase in single-family starts as well as record commodity prices. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion or approximately 64% to 73% over our 2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $1.07 billion. Of the $500 million increase in adjusted EBITDA guidance from last quarter, roughly half is driven by poor organic growth and share gains, while the other half is driven by higher commodity prices. As a result of that outperformance, we are increasing the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance by $550 million to $1.4 billion. Our outlook is based on several assumptions which are outlined in the earnings release including low double-digit growth in single-family starts across our geographies. High single-digit to low double-digit decline in multi-family starts and low to mid-single-digit growth in R&R. Our commodity assumption provides a five to 15% lift to our top line growth. Commodity costs remain high with recent futures trading over $1600 per thousand. While levels remain elevated so far this year, we anticipate commodity prices to normalize by the fourth quarter. For some added context if commodity prices were to stay elevated at current levels through year-end we would expect to exceed our current guidance. Turning to capital allocation, we are committed to reinvesting in the business for maintenance and growth. We are focused on increasing our capacity through our list of internal CapEx projects and we have a solid pipeline of M&A candidates. As Dave mentioned, we have already executed one bolt-on acquisition this month and we are looking at several more. We continue to assess capital allocation options in light of our accelerating cash flow. Our local field teams are focused on delivering strong core organic growth and we continue to proactively manage expenses across our distribution footprint. We will meet or exceed our cost synergy goals of $60 million to $70 million this year and also deliver on our operational excellence initiatives. Overall, we are continuing to build a world-class distribution network to deliver exceptional value to our stakeholders. We have never been more excited about our strategy and our future. Let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing remarks.
Dave Flitman: Thanks, Peter. With underlying demand the strongest it's been in nearly 15 years coupled with the broad-based product supply constraints and our country's continued recovery from a horrific pandemic, these truly are unprecedented times. I couldn't be more pleased or proud of how our team has responded. We delivered core organic sales growth over 20%, while also successfully managing through one of the largest mergers this industry has ever seen. We have the right strategy, we have the best team on the field and we're executing at a very high level. Our future is bright, and I'm highly confident in our ability to continue to outpace industry growth while operating in a $120 billion addressable market. Thanks for joining us today. And with that Brad let's open the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question. This comes from Keith Hughes with Truist.
Keith Hughes: Thank you. Many good things in this release. I guess the one that jumps out are some of the success you've had in manufactured products. Could you talk about what went well during the quarter and what's your outlook for those products in light of this revenue guidance that you've given us?
Dave Flitman: Good morning, Keith. Thanks for the question. Yes, as you point out, we've had a lot of success in our manufacturing products and I think it goes back to the success that each company was having individually. It was part of our strategies. It was something that we focused on historically. And what we've seen over the last few years is increased penetration and adoption by the home builders, because it's solving those problems we've talked about. It helps them build the homes faster. It helps them manage the job site more effectively and just be overall more productive. And we're excited about it. As you pointed out, our organic growth and components was about double what our core organic growth was this quarter which was outstanding. We expect that will continue. We continue to see rapid adoption in these component categories. No one is better positioned than we are in terms of being able to supply the needs of our customers in this area across the country. And so, we're excited about it.
Peter Jackson: Yes, so we've added shifts, we've added facilities and we'll continue to go down that path absolutely.
Keith Hughes: Okay. And one other question, gross margin. You talk about the purchase accounting adjustment in the quarter, as you look within this guidance range gross margin, what would it look like for the year based on what we know today and the numbers?
Peter Jackson: Yes, I think we're feeling pretty good about being able to hold stable. Maybe even see a little bit of tailwind, depending on the trajectory. It's a dynamic market as you know. Price increases not just in commodities, but across the board have been very impactful, but in terms of our discipline and our structure around passing through those prices, we've done a good job. I'm very proud of the team and I think we can continue to perform at this level. I think it's something we're very proud of.
Keith Hughes: Okay. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Keith.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: Good morning. Well congrats on the results everyone. And I concur with the prior comments that there's a lot of good topics to discuss here. My first one will be on M&A. I think, it was notable that you included that M&A opportunities slide in your earnings presentation this morning, reminiscent of the slide you had at BMC, when you completed the acquisition of John's, which we actually thought that the integration may preclude some M&A at least further into 2021, so congrats on that as well. But my question is, how have you continued to cultivate this pipeline that you're now disclosing amidst the integration in terms of your own capacity to do so? And how does your -- does this commentary suggest potentially something more programmatic on the M&A side on the horizon? Thankl you.
Dave Flitman: Yes. Great question, Matt. Thanks for asking that one. So as you pointed out, it's been a part of our strategy in both legacy companies. And as I said on the last call and I'll say again here, this integration between VFS and BMC could not be going better. Our teams have come together extremely well. You heard our comments on the synergies. We're ramping those up. We're having great success. The teams have meshed together extremely well. And obviously, based on our first quarter results, we've stayed focused on our customers and meeting their needs, which is exactly what we needed to do. Importantly, the fourth pillar of our strategy is M&A, and we have an extremely strong balance sheet. As we've talked about, we have a relatively small overall share in a very large market. It's an important part of our strategy. We've got the wherewithal and the focus to continue to drive acquisitions and as you pointed out in my comments this morning, we're focused on it.
Matthew Bouley: Wonderful. Okay. Well, helpful color there. And then, the second one I wanted to ask on manufactured products again, because at a high level, you would say it's not a coincidence that with framing lumber prices this extreme in the near term that may foster adoption of prefab components. My question is, is that too simplistic, or have you found that into this spring that builders are actually coming to you even more so now looking for options to address this issue and what you can do for them on the component side? And really longer term does something like this you think impact the penetration of manufactured products going forward? Thank you.
Dave Flitman: Sure. I think, what you've seen is steady adoption of these component categories over the past several years in both legacy companies. Obviously, we've got a very strong team on it. As Peter has mentioned, we've added capacity in several locations across the country. You'll continue to see us invest not only in component manufacturing, but automation of those facilities to make sure that we're meeting the demands of the marketplace and we're providing as high quality and consistent product as possible. To your question, I think the adoption continues to accelerate. Some of it is probably related to what's going on with commodities near term, but more importantly, and I think more broadly, what we're seeing is the customers that have experienced the benefits of our component offerings are adopting those more rapidly across their geographic footprint. And that's probably the greater tailwind in what we're seeing here over the near term. I do believe it's sustainable. I believe we'll continue to convert the market this way and we'll continue to invest in this category of the business.
Matthew Bouley: Thanks, guys. Yes, that’s exactly what I was wondering. So thank you for those details Dave and congrats and good luck this year.
Dave Flitman: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.
Mike Dahl: Thanks for taking my questions. My first question -- I'll keep probing on manufacture and the tremendous results there. If you were to run rate or analyze the levels that you're seeing today, what utilization rate would you be at across your components footprint? And can you elaborate a little bit more? You talked about adding shifts and investments. Could you kind of just refresh us or outline some of the incremental steps that you're taking if possible any sort of quantification around additional investments and plants that may or may not have changed over the past few months in terms of plans for 2021?
Peter Jackson: Sure. Yes, for context, we've got well over a hundred facilities. We've opened between the combined entities around 13 over the last few years. We've continued to invest. In terms of the capacity utilization, a recent analytic on a single ship baseline would say, we were at about 75% capacity. And Mike, we've talked about this before, that's a tough description because that's not an average. So you've got some facilities that are below and some above that number, but we certainly have a really nice trajectory right now in terms of being able to leverage those new facilities, get them more fully ramped up, but also be able to do things like add second shifts which as you know, it doesn't quite double, but nearly doubles the capacity of any given facility. Also adding lines, also adding automation equipment to increase the productivity and capacity of any one of those lines, that's been the primary way that we've responded. More recently, our Riverside facility in California has come up and running. We've been able to add capacity, other facilities at a number of other facilities double-digit facilities around the country through new equipment. So certainly, it's an area that we've gotten pretty good at extracting more volumes, but at the end of the day, our forward look is absolutely adding footprint. New locations around the country, the adoption in certain markets in particular is very encouraging and we see that as a long runway of strength. Admittedly, the adoption is good, but the incremental share of how much of the home is built off site is continuing to grow and we think the trend continues to come our way with those labor costs going up, which inevitably happens in a market like this. But every time a cost goes up, those efficiency savings that we provide with manufactured products are magnified. We can save 10 board feet of waste on a particular truss. It's more meaningful at 1,600 than it is at 400.
Dave Flitman: Yeah, Peter's right on and just add an exclamation point to that. We talk about our number one priority for uses of capital would be reinvesting in our company. The first portion of that goes to maintaining our facilities and making sure our people have what they need to get our products to the customers. The second order of priority is this area our value-added capabilities and continuing to invest heavily in that area of the business.
Mike Dahl: That's great, very helpful. Second question much as I'm tempted to push you on some of your conservatism around commodities I'll switch over to the capital allocation question to your point Dave. There's, obviously, first and foremost investments for organic growth. You talked about the M&A pipeline a bit, also but if we look at your cash flow and your leverage profile you're on track to be zero-net leverage by year-end if not in a net cash position barring future M&A. And so when you look at that pipeline as impressive as it is, it seems like there's going to be plenty of excess cash flow available beyond your organic investments, beyond M&A. As you think about priorities for that use of cash and comfort level in terms of then actually implementing a plan whether it's buybacks, dividends, can you just give us a little more color or an update on how you're thinking about that? There just seems to be an awful lot of dry powder.
Dave Flitman: You're right Mike. We have a very strong position right now. Our cash flow is tremendous. We've talked in the past about wanting to maintain a fortress a bulletproof balance sheet. I think we have every reason to be confident in that right now based on what we've done and we'll continue to stay vigilant. Dave mentioned our priorities around capital allocation with regard to internal investment and expansion internally and organically but also the inorganic opportunities are certainly out there. I think it's a fair question, right. We are going to generate a tremendous amount of cash and I'm very specific when I say going to because as you see in our results now we've borrowed money this quarter so we're not sitting on cash. This is not a burning platform. We are absolutely looking at if we continue to work with our board, come up with strategies that we want to put to work in terms of putting all of our capital to work in an efficient way. We've talked in the past about being committed to retaining some level of leverage in order to maximize shareholder return. We will stay committed to that. We just don't have any new announcements today.
Mike Dahl: Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks for the color.
Dave Flitman: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question. This comes from David Manthey with Baird Capital.
David Manthey: Yeah. Hey, good morning everyone.
Dave Flitman: Hi Dave.
Peter Jackson: Hi Dave.
David Manthey: Clearly you raised your guidance for single-family housing from high single digits to low double-digit growth and it's safe to say that you're not seeing any signs of demand destruction because of the high lumber prices I should say. And then what I'm wondering is, are there any changes in tone of the business in any other way? I'm thinking like what you're seeing in size of homes or stress on custom home to other balance sheets, or anything that's beyond the obvious here, sort of, a tangent something else we should think about as it relates to these unusually high lumber prices? 
Peter Jackson: Yeah, that's a great question. We are keeping our ear to the ground on that, because obviously we're making sure that our optimism at this point isn't misplaced. The short answer is no, the demand is tremendously strong. One of the things we said in the last call that I think was met with a little bit of skepticism is this idea that there's going to be a limit on how many homes builders can build even though there's virtually unlimited demand for those same homes. The level of announcements I don't remember, which analyst had put it out there, but 54% of home builders have announced constraining sales in some number of communities around the country. They're recognizing an inability to deliver homes at that high level. That again is really a sign of that strong demand and is far less about suppression of that demand by the level of prices as we see today. Some of these prices will normalize on their own and that's definitely a theme of ours in terms of commodities that we do expect it to normalize over time. But in the meantime, it is certainly a matter of responding to that, continuing strong demand, keeping up with those shortages around the country and staying disciplined in our management of both the flow-through to maintain our position as a premier supplier but also to maintain our management over prices and make sure we're fairly compensated for the work we're doing but strength across the board.
David Manthey: Okay. And then when you noted that you're adding shifts, some other companies we talked to are saying that they're competing for talent with the X-Box right now, what are your views on labor? Not so much your customers' labor situation, but your own labor in terms of your access to adding people today?
Peter Jackson: Yeah, I think that's pretty consistent over the years. It's regional. We haven't seen widespread inability to get people the usual pockets of demand drivers, certain members of the truss manufacturing world challenging in certain areas. Now there's things you can do. Certainly we're doing well. Our profit sharing and bonuses are motivational to folks. We like our driver pay models in a lot of markets and we're continuing to enhance that certainly looking at shift differential. So there are things you can do to react in a measured way that allows you to evolve and respond depending on how the market is doing. If things pull-back, we could pull-back. But we haven't had any massive issues to date pockets here and there.
David Manthey: It seems like these trends are playing to your favor, which sounds good. So thank you. Best of luck guys.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our next question. This comes from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.
Ketan Mamtora: Thank you for the question. I want to come back to also of the value-added products that you'll have, as you look out over the next three to five years and clearly it seems like the housing backdrop is supportive, how do you think -- how do you see that mix evolving from these currents are up 42% that you have right now, and within that where do you see the most opportunity? And just related to that how does it shift your margin profile?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. So it's a great question. This is a dynamic time. This whole commodity pricing being at record levels certainly has thrown us a curveball. I would say that the mix of the business just because of the mathematical change has shifted towards commodities. It's probably roughly 50% at this point, based on the increased prices. On the long-term though, the way we see the dynamic is very similar to where we were 12 months ago. And that's that, value add continues to be an increasing part of the business over the last couple of years, at least it's been the biggest component of the business with value in specialty making up 60 plus percent of what we sold in an average year. We think that continues. We think the trend of the broader product portfolio as well as the emphasis and the dependence of the greater homebuilding market on this offsite approach, given its efficiencies, given its ability to be safer and cost less in total, we think that continues to grow. There kind of is no topside to that. We talk about BFS back, as we came out of the great recession before the Probuild merger was about 50% value add, certainly think that's an achievable goal in the long-run. But again, this is a long game we're playing.
Dave Flitman: I think what you've seen overtime is both, legacy companies had a strong emphasis on pricing, models and getting more efficient at, how we take price to the marketplace. And then, secondly, that margin profile as Peter pointed out will continue to improve, based on our penetration of value-added products which we see no end to.
Ketan Mamtora: Got it. That's very helpful. And then, just one other clarification, between your prepared remarks, you kind of referenced your expectation of lumber prices kind of normalizing by the fourth quarter of 2021. Is it fair to say, kind of normalized, you're looking at something sort of in the historical average range of 400? Is that the right way to think about it? And I understand kind of, prices are very volatile, but I'm just curious at a high-level.
Peter Jackson: Yeah. That's how we think about it. That long-term average feels like the reference point that we need to continue to communicate against, recognizing that there's a displacement right now in prices, displacement in demand and supply, probably the primary issue being supply. But eventually, it'll likely go back to a more normalized long-term average that 400 range. It's really just a matter of, when. Are we right on that? We know we're not right. That's the nature of commodity forecasting. So we figured we'd give you a sustainable, consistent target to head towards, when you think about our numbers and you can adjust as you see fit in terms of your expectations of, lumber prices.
Ketan Mamtora: Got it. That's very helpful. I understand it so well. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Reuben Garner with The Benchmark Company.
Reuben Garner: Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the results and the outlook guys, very impressive.
Peter Jackson: Thanks Reuben.
Reuben Garner: Let's see. So question, manufactured products has been hit pretty, pretty hard so far question-wise, the 40 plus percent growth that you saw in the quarter versus the I think you said 7% and windows, doors and millwork. Is that just a function of, timing of, when those products are used in the job cycle? Is that just kind of showing you, how maybe there's an acceleration in use of your manufactured products or is there going to be a backlog of activity that you're going to see, kind of an acceleration in the windows and doors as you move through the year?
Dave Flitman: Yeah. Good question. I think it's twofold. I think the whole build-cycle, as we've seen completions get extended out here, because has just been extended. So it's just changed the point at which our millwork is brought into the home. And then secondly, we've talked a lot about this Reuben, the supply constraints have been hit pretty hard in the windows and door piece of the business. And we're getting what we need, but it certainly has had an impact on our growth for the near-term. We expect that it will correct here through the course of the year.
Reuben Garner: Perfect. And then, I love the comment about, kind of normalizing lumber and you guys are growing at an 8% CAGR in the last few years. What did the flow through look like on kind of a normalized basis? Is there a good way to think about that?
Peter Jackson: Yeah -- no that's a great question. In looking at that, analysis historically, we did get kind of a better sense. And you've heard us Reuben talk about, how we've got 12% to 15% fall through is sort of our standard incremental around sales. What we've noticed in these numbers is that, the inclusion of the value add mix, the inclusion of the operational excellence has actually driven that a little better. So we're in that kind of high-teens range for the fall through related to our incrementals, when you include all of those components the growth of the business. And then specifically to point out right now, the nature of commodities and the way that the market is changed, the constraint, the velocity of everything that fall through is actually a little higher. That's probably right around 20% right now. So, pros and cons of that, certainly taking advantage of it right now, but something to think about in the long-run.
Reuben Garner: Wow. That's very helpful. Thanks guys, and congrats again on the quarter. Good luck as we move through the year.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Reuben.
Dave Flitman: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.
Steven Ramsey: Hi. Good morning. Wanted to, dig into synergies a little bit, since you're ahead of target, which is great. But maybe can you describe if that was, maybe some conservatism going in, what areas you're ahead on? And what is causing that? And then lastly there, do you see this as getting to your target synergy faster or potentially raising the total synergy target, as you make more progress?
Dave Flitman: Yeah, good question. I don't think we went into this intending to be conservative that $130 to $150 million range is solid. And we're executing very well. And as you heard me say, the teams have come together extremely well. And what I think is benefiting us or two things one is, the cultural alignment of these two legacy companies very, very similar. And then secondly, and perhaps to your question a little more importantly, is the experience that our teams have had in executing large mergers in the past. Our teams knew what to expect. We had very strong leadership that's been through this before. And we just got on with business. And so I think that's reflective of the early ramp-up that we've seen here, over the first quarter of work. We're excited about it. We can deliver more. We certainly will. But I would say, at this point, we're ahead of our plan and feeling good about the momentum.
Steven Ramsey: Okay great. And then, last one on kind of a networking capital investment cash outflow there, would this have been a greater cash outflow without material constraints that you guys have seen and relative to the cash outflow, can't remember, if you discussed, how much of this was due to investment to get the synergies.
Peter Jackson: Yes. From a cash outflow perspective, the investment for synergies is pretty modest. We had talked about it being in the similar 130 to 150 range for expenses that, I certainly don't think, we're going to outspend that forecast either. Yes, the investment is really just in the incremental value of the inventory that we're maintaining, the normal increase in the amount of inventory that we would maintain at our yards in order to carry the increased level of business just seasonally. And then, probably, most importantly, at the end of the day, the incremental accounts receivable that ends up on the books at these higher price levels across the board. Would we otherwise have had more, if not for the material availability constraints? I think, the answer is, unequivocally, yes. I don't know how much more. I haven't really run the math on that but certainly, there are areas around the country where it's quite difficult to get the level of inventory that we would normally have, specialty products like OSB, for example, just extremely difficult to make sure you have what you need. And while we feel like we get more than our fair share, we'd sure like more. 
Steven Ramsey: Great. Thanks for the color.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Noah Merkousko: Thanks. This is actually Noah Merkousko for Trey and just want to say -- 
Peter Jackson: Hi, Noah.
Noah Merkousko:  -- again congrats on the really strong results. 
Peter Jackson: Thank you. 
Noah Merkousko: So first, following up on, I guess, the answer to that last question. There's been a lot of talk of material constraints across the industry, but overall they don't really seem to be holding you back. So maybe if you could just speak to your outlook for lumber and other product availability with everything being so short and just how you're able to manage through that.
Dave Flitman: Yes. I think, to a large extent you're seeing two or three things happening right now. First of all, I think you're seeing the power and the strength of the platform that we've put together here with our unmatched geographic presence and the strength of our team. Secondly, I think, you're seeing the power of the strong relationships that we've built through both legacy companies with our suppliers. And they're doing their very best job to meet the needs that we have. And then third, I think, we have seen a shift in the marketplace where the builders, just given the significance and the broad breadth of the supply constraints, have been a little bit more brand agnostic, I think, to what they're putting into their homes, just driven in large part by the need. And then, given the access that we have to the broad base of suppliers and products, we've been able to meet those needs probably better than most. And we'd expect that to continue.
Peter Jackson: From a forecast perspective, we've talked about the inability of the broader industry to meet the massive amounts of demand. Noah, I know you know this, but for the broader group, we've talked about the seasonal capacity availability, that the shoulder seasons, by nature, offer more opportunity for rapid percent growth. We always would have expected a far higher year-over-year percent growth in Q1, candidly Q2 because of the COVID lapping and Q4, just because summer months always are max capacity every year. So we fully expect the ability to grow on a year-over-year basis to be suppressed as we get through those summer months. But that's already accounted for in our numbers. It's nothing new, but I think it's just important to keep in mind that those off season, if you will, shoulder season type of quarters will naturally lend themselves to eye-popping percent increases.
Noah Merkousko: Yes. That makes sense. And then, just for my follow-up, on the pre cash flow guide, how much is expected from lower commodity prices flowing through to working capital?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So, I actually feel pretty good about that forecast, regardless of whether or not prices for commodities come down or not, just because of the way the math works. If prices come down, I’d spin off cash and if prices stay up I make more EBITDA. So that's a good number for us.
Noah Merkousko: All right. Perfect. Thanks and good luck going forward.
Peter Jackson: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.
Jay McCanless: Hey. Good morning, everyone. So my first question, I know you all gave the growth rate on value add but what -- as a percentage of net sales for this year and last year, what was the value add percentage?
Peter Jackson: The value add percentage for the prior year? I'm not sure I -- 
Jay McCanless: Well, for this year and for the prior year.
Peter Jackson: Yes. So value-add a year ago, I want to say, was right around 40%, 41%. This year it drops to 30%. Is it in the presentation? 36%?
Dave Flitman: 36% or 37%.
Peter Jackson: 36%, 37%. So you lose a few bits. It grew fast, but that windows, doors and millwork pulls down the average. Where you saw the shrinking of the mix was really in the R&R. Like you'd expect, right? The R&R, the multi-family, some of those other areas that just don't keep pace right now with the single-family starts businesses or products.
Jay McCanless: Got it. And then I just wanted to clarify, the builders may be slowing down some of their sales, but they're not slowing down on the backlogs, correct? It's because what we've heard is that cancellation rates are way down and that the builders still have in general a pretty heavy backlog to fill out. Is that still the case? 
Dave Flitman: No question about it. They're full steam ahead.
Peter Jackson: Yeah, those guys are full up. They're not pushing out sales because they need them. They're pushing out sales because they're full to the brim. 
Jay McCanless: Okay. All right. That's all I had. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Jay.
Dave Flitman: Thank you, Jay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. 
Kurt Yinger: Great. Good morning everyone.
Peter Jackson: Good morning.
Dave Flitman: Hey, Kurt.
Kurt Yinger: I just wanted to start on commodities. How has this volatility in the current environment changed, how your customers kind of purchase a framing package? And what type of risk are you willing to take in terms of locking prices for a certain period of time?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. I don't think it's fundamentally changed how people think about purchasing. I think there's certainly a bigger emphasis on making sure that they're staying efficient, which I think lends itself to some of this offsite manufacturing product model that we sell. I think there's also a willingness to consider substitution species and material substitution. We've certainly heard a lot more about that. It's an availability game, right? You're trying to make sure as -- well as a home buyer trying to make sure you get a house. But as a home builder, you want to make sure you're able to stay on some sort of a schedule. So the expectations, the ordering ahead for us it's making sure that we have a significant percentage of our buys that's on a contractual basis. So we make sure we're getting our place in line if you will. Historically, and I know you know this Kurt is that we've maintained a goal to keep a steady flow. We are going to be in the market consistently over time at our scale and our size and our demand around the country. We don't just sit on the sidelines for any meaningful period of time. That is true now that will continue to be true. I think that maintains our relationships with the mills in a very positive way. And we will continue to make sure we're building up inventory. You've got to be in this game for the better or for worse. We've talked about it in the past in terms of the fixed-price contracts. Certainly, those contracts have shrunk in recent months and year as a percentage of our total sales, but it's still I think it's representative of the type of commitment we have to our customers that we've got the balance sheet, we've got the credit, we've got the relationships. We're your partner that you want to rely on to be able to get to what you need for you to be successful and we're committed to having inventory to do that.
Kurt Yinger: Okay. Okay. So to the extent that we were to see commodity prices roll over, you would still expect some kind of short-term benefit just from the trend in prices. Is that fair?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. But certainly less than it used to be, right. With a reduction in the amount of fixed-price contracts, you'll see less suppression on the way up and less expansion in the way down of the gross market percent. 
Kurt Yinger: Okay. Got it. All right. 
Peter Jackson: Just mathematically, it gets smaller.
Kurt Yinger: Right, right. Okay. And then just my second one. It sounds like you're pretty confident in the year one synergies. Could you just talk a little bit more about some of the other focus areas in terms of operational excellence and any examples of wins as far as shared best practices since the business has come together over the last couple of months?
Dave Flitman: Yeah. I think this is a great area of what I mentioned earlier around cultural alignment, because if you recall both legacy companies had a strong focus on operational excellence and we just carried that through. We've merged the teams together and I've already started to focus on that in addition to the synergies. And some of the early things are just how do we most effectively get our products to the customers given the footprint that has come together? And we have seen a lot of benefit in taking miles out of the system in terms of how we've executed that shifted some customer demand from one location to another. And we're seeing that benefit in the bottom lines. So things like that where and how much inventory that we keep these are some of the early wins that the teams are already executing on.
Kurt Yinger: Got it. Appreciate the color. And good luck here in Q2 guys.
Dave Flitman: Really appreciate it.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. 
Stanley Elliott: Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you all for squeezing me in.
Dave Flitman: Good morning.
Stanley Elliott: When you think about the MA business I mean, obviously you've got a very strong platform for it, are you seeing some of these smaller operators come to you looking as an exit strategy for them in lieu or ahead of potential tax changes or any changes or any issues they may have from a capacity standpoint given the credit line increases I imagine for a lot of the lumber and et cetera?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. I mean every day, right? I mean, M&A being the big dog means everybody calls us. So we absolutely are everybody's exit strategy which we love.
Dave Flitman: The phones have been ringing. I can say that. Yes, yes, yes.
Peter Jackson: And what is important though in that dynamic, right, is you have to keep in mind as a buyer the reality of what is a sustainable business, what is a mid-cycle business, right. You can't pay the same multiples on a peak business, but there are tremendous opportunities out there to buy at reasonable multiples really tremendous assets. So it's good times.
Stanley Elliott: Yep. No exciting for sure. And then in terms of the footprint expansion and the focus on the manufacturing side are you at all having any problems finding real estate? Are supply chains constrained in terms of getting the machinery in? Anything like that that will keep you from executing on that part of your strategy right now? 
Dave Flitman: I would say less on the real estate side certainly on the equipment side. The lead times on equipment have expanded over the last 18 months or so, but our teams were ahead of that and taking that into account and we're already ordering things that we don't expect to put in the ground for quite some time. So we've got a pretty strong forward look on that. Again the teams have come together well, we've got experts around things like press manufacturing. They know what they need and how to get ahead of it. 
Stanley Elliott: Perfect guys. Thank you very much. Congratulations best of luck. 
Dave Flitman: Thanks Stan.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our next question. This comes from Collin Verron with Jefferies. 
Collin Verron: Great quarter. Thank you for taking my question. It looks like your guidance implies a full year EBITDA margin in line with your 1Q almost 11%. Just given once you typically to seasonally lowest EBITDA margin quarter, can you just talk about the cadence of your expected margin performance for the rest of the year and then just how you're thinking about EBITDA margin over the long term? 
Peter Jackson: Yes. So I'm mean, I won't break out the quarters, but yes there's certainly an expectation that our even margins are going to be higher this year. Our flow-through has been great. Our demand obviously has been very high. There is certainly a seasonal nature to what we do. So inevitably you'll see some nice quarters during the summer when we reach our peak utilization and peak leverage. The nature of our long term, I think we've consistently talked about believing we could get the 9%, 10% EBITDA. We're certainly working on that internally every day in regards to what Dave was talking about on operational excellence the efficiencies that we think we can bring into this business this industry through technology through operational improvements through process. So certainly committed to that and believe that in the long run. The dynamics around any given quarter obviously are a little bit unique but for this year it is going to be an exceptionally strong year given the combination of high demand and record prices and certain products. 
Collin Verron: Great. Thanks for taking my question.
Peter Jackson: Thank you. 
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG. 
Peter Jackson: Good morning.
Ryan Gilbert: Good morning. First question more on manufactured products. I'm wondering if you're seeing any builders or an increased percentage of builders either going deeper into manufactured products offsite manufacturing or exploring opportunities to do so more than just buying a roof truss or a wall package? Like maybe what Raney has been doing in Florida? 
Peter Jackson: Well certainly Raney has done exceptionally well in a market like this. They're a great provider and I think very valued by their home building customers. I think Dave alluded to it before, it's really been consistent. It's not as if we ever had a lull in the demand for increased utilization. There are absolutely markets around the country and I think we've alluded to this before or talked about this before where historically you would not have expected to see a lot of demand for that offsite fabrication type of work. A state like Texas is a good example. Historically very low labor rates precluded the need for the labor overdrive that comes from the offsite fabrication. Those days are gone. There is absolutely strong demand in Texas. It's strong demand across the country. It's just kind of hard to tell the difference. Carrying 500 pounds or carrying 550 pounds I'm not sure I could tell you what the difference feels like. It's a lot. 
Ryan Gilbert: Okay. Got it. You're adding capacity on the manufacturer product side. Are you seeing your suppliers either in lumber or in millwork doors and windows also add capacity, or has it been pretty consistent? 
Peter Jackson: We are. 
Dave Flitman: Yes. Yes we've heard Peter mentioned earlier about the tightness in OSB. We've hear there were a couple of mills up in Canada that are coming back online the same in the US particularly in the south on the lumber side. So we're expecting that hopefully will help from a capacity standpoint. And obviously the window and door manufacturers are making similar investments here to try to capture as much of this demand as possible. 
Ryan Gilbert: Okay. Thanks very much.
Dave Flitman: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Michael Neese for closing remarks. 
Michael Neese: Thank you for your time today and for your interest in Builder's FirstSource. We're around all day to take your questions. Take care and stay safe. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's call. We thank you for your attendance and participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-26 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for joining Builders FirstSource Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call.  Michael Neese, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Builders FirstSource will now provide the company's opening remarks.
Michael Neese: Thank you, Keith. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. I hope you and your families continue to remain safe and well. With me on the call are Chad Crow, CEO; Dave Flitman, President; and Peter Jackson, our CFO. Today, we will provide an overview of our record fourth quarter results and full year performance, discuss merger and integration highlights as Builders FirstSource and BMC come together as one culture and company and how we are positioning the company for continued success in 2021 and beyond. Since we closed the BMC merger on January 1, 2021, the results reported today reflect standalone BFS' record results for both the fourth quarter and full year. On the last page of the earnings release, we have provided select pro forma financial information to show the record results for the combined company as though they operated as one entity in 2020. A slide deck and this morning's press release are all available on our website at investors.bldr.com. The results discussed during the call will include GAAP and non-GAAP results adjusted for certain items. We provide these non-GAAP results for informational purposes, and they should not be considered in isolation for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures where applicable and a discussion of why we believe they are useful to investors can be found at the back of the press release and in the slide presentation. Our remarks in the press release, presentation and on this call contain forward-looking and cautionary statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking statements section in today's press release and in our SEC filings for various factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements and projections. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Chad.
Chad Crow: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I wanted to start by saying our thoughts remain with all those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain diligent in keeping our associates, suppliers, customers and community safe. Safety will continue to guide our operating strategy. Our thoughts are also with our fellow Texans. It has been a challenging time over the past 2 weeks, and we wish everyone a fast recovery. BFS and BMC together had an incredible and transformational year in 2020. We cannot have done it without all our dedicated team members. They are a true testament of excellence to driving growth while still meeting the needs of our customers in an unprecedented environment. I want to congratulate and thank them for everything they accomplished last year. We closed our merger on January 1 and have formed the nation's premier supplier of building materials and services with tremendous opportunity for continued growth. The transaction allows us to expand our footprint and enhance our local relationships in many of the nation's largest and fastest-growing markets. We are well positioned for long-term growth underpinned by a resilient and expanding housing environment as well as a significant capital base for M&A.  We expect to deliver above-market growth through our shared commitment to growing our value-add offerings which allow us to closely partner and integrate with customers to streamline the construction process. In addition, this larger platform strengthens our ability to create and invest in best-in-class innovative solutions that deliver significant benefits to our customers. Our increased scale, combined with substantial synergies will help drive EPS accretion and robust cash generation, providing even greater resources to invest in innovation, technology and operational excellence. We expect this housing environment to fuel profitable growth and value creation for all stakeholders for the years to come. Over the past several months, Dave and I have traveled in many regions of the country to meet with team members while adhering to our safety protocols. We also held a socially distance town hall in our Dallas office and shared the video with all our team members. The feedback has been very positive. We are seeing firsthand that our former stand-alone organizations share a passion for partnering together to serve our customers, and now we share an excitement about our future opportunities as the new Builders FirstSource. Dave and Peter will discuss the merger, integration and specifics of the quarter and full year performance shortly. However, I would like to highlight the fact that legacy Builders FirstSource achieved top and bottom line results for the full year 2020. Net sales were $8.6 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $700 million, up 18% and 36% from the prior year, respectively. Before I turn the call over to Dave, I would like to thank everyone who supported me during my more than 20 years at Builders FirstSource. When I joined BFS in 1999, it was, of course, much smaller, having only made a few acquisitions at that time. I couldn't have dreamed that this company would be where it is today, an industry leader, but more importantly, such a special place to work, filled with incredible people and where I have developed lifelong friendships. To all our shareholders and analysts, thank you for supporting our team. I've enjoyed the time with you and hearing your perspectives. Builders FirstSource is in a very strong position, and it's the right time to pass it on. I have total confidence in Dave, Peter and the entire senior management team to leave this company into the next phase of growth and drive even stronger relationships with our valued customers. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Flitman: Thank you, Chad, and good morning, everyone. This is truly a very exciting time for our combined company. And I want to start by thanking Chad for his dedication, guidance and support during this transition. It's been a real pleasure working with you, Chad. Although you'll be around for a few more weeks, I wish you all the best as you enter retirement and embark on your next journey. I will, however, keep your number handy. As Chad said, we continue to keep those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in our thoughts. The safety of our team members, suppliers and customers is our number 1 priority, and we remain vigilant in this regard. As a combined company, we started the year with strong momentum, closing out 2020 with record fourth quarter and full year results at both BFS and BMC. I want to personally thank all of our team members for their hard work and relentless determination during this unprecedented year, which led to those outstanding results. I'll cover 3 important topics on today's call that we believe will ensure that our already very strong performance continues well into the future. First, I'll provide an update on why we remain bullish on the macro backdrop in our industry and our even stronger position in the industry following the completion of our merger. Second, I'll share our new mission, vision and values, which are critical ingredients to our strong culture and I'll unveil the updated strategy of our combined company. Finally, I'll bring you up to speed on our integration efforts as well as the value capture opportunities we are seeing across the combined organization. The homebuilding market remains strong, resilient and growing. And an improved economic outlook for 2021 bodes well for our customers. We are bullish on the pent-up demand for housing amid what has been a long-term shortage of housing supply. Our analysis suggests coming into 2020, the industry has underbuilt since the last downturn by 2 million to 2.5 million units. In addition, the U.S. added roughly 950,000 households in 2020. We believe there continues to be a long runway of underbuilt and demographically fueled growth in front of us. Improving housing starts, historically low mortgage rates and a shift towards single family suburban living are all positive trends that continue to support demand for our products and services. Together, as a bigger, stronger competitor, we are well positioned to capture a greater share of the increased demand in the single family home market. As was the case with both legacy companies, we will remain disciplined in our pricing processes, and we will strike the right balance between profitability and volume growth, especially considering this highly constrained supply environment. We believe the strategic combination of our 2 great organizations is a transformational step forward for our teams, our customers and our suppliers. Together, we have more than $12 billion in revenues and in excess of $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Even with our combined size and scale, we estimate our share in core product categories is only about 10%, paving a long runway of organic and inorganic growth opportunities for us in our $120 billion addressable market.  We will benefit from our leading network of 550 distribution and manufacturing locations that span 40 states. That network includes 46 of the top 50 and 85 of the top 100 MSAs, covering most of the nation's fastest growing regions. We have significantly enhanced our ability to service key high-growth markets in our South, Southeast and West regions, which represent over 3/4 of U.S. single family housing starts and approximately 80% of our current combined revenues. We will leverage the power of both companies' operating systems to extend our competitive advantage of the market.  We expect our scale will yield continued productivity opportunities this year in addition to our deal synergies. We are still in the early innings of this important work in both legacy companies and we have meaningful opportunities to drive productivity and efficiency across the combined company. For those who don't know me, I am relentless when it comes to ensuring the safety of our team members. We have put many processes in place to protect our associates during the pandemic. And I'm also encouraged by the 12% reduction in recordable injury rates for the pro forma combined company in 2020. But to be clear, our goal is 0 reportable injuries, and we have more work ahead of us to accelerate our progress towards achieving that goal. For my second topic, I'd like to take a few minutes to talk with you about our updated mission, vision, values and strategy. A core team of leaders from both legacy companies work together to finalize the mission, vision, values and strategic pillars that will serve as our guidepost as we continue to grow our share of customers in the specialty building materials production and distribution space. On Page 8 of the investor deck, you can see that our mission is to be the best supplier of building materials and services by having a people-first culture that delivers exceptional customer service and innovative solutions to help build more efficiently while at the same time, creating superior value for our stakeholders. Also shown on Page 8 is our vision, which is to make the dream of homeownership more achievable for everyone, making Builders FirstSource the most valuable partner in the industry. And we rely on our values to guide our behaviors in achieving our mission and vision: safety, people, integrity, customers and excellence, or as we like to say internally spice, a blend of ingredients to produce a better outcome. Next, I'm excited to introduce the combined company strategy, which consists of 4 key pillars. The first is to expand our market penetration by leveraging and growing our portfolio of value-added products and services. Second, drive operational excellence to improve our profitability, invest in innovation and provide outstanding service to our customers. Our third strategic priority is to cultivate, build and empower a high performing culture. And the fourth, we will continue to pursue a disciplined approach to strategic acquisitions with many opportunities in our pipeline and one of the strongest balance sheets in our industry. The investor deck has a slide that highlights the details of our strategy on Page 9. Importantly, you should recognize that this strategic framework is similar to one shared by both legacy companies over the past several years, which just underscores my confidence that executing it well will result in strong and sustainable future comp and bottom line growth. We will leverage our significant free cash flow generation to drive growth while preserving a strong balance sheet, enhance our double-digit return on invested capital and return capital to shareholders. We have brought together 2 very strong companies with complementary capabilities and cultures. As we look ahead, I have no doubt that together, we will be able to accelerate profitable growth through our customer-centric service model. Finally, I'd like to briefly share with you how our important work on integration is proceeding. Back in September, we officially launched our integration management office, or IMO, a cross-functional team comprised of strong leaders from both organizations who are responsible for leading our integration efforts. In addition, executive sponsors were assigned to lead the 9 functional work streams responsible for developing detailed initiatives to integrate, optimize and transform the combined company once the merger was finalized. Back in October, we launched an organizational survey for both companies to better understand any culture related issues that might affect our success as a combined company. Encouragingly, the survey showed that the cultures of the 2 companies are remarkably similar. This, along with the fact that most of our associates have been through the integration process before, has given us a high level of confidence that our integration plan will be implemented successfully and on schedule. On day 1 post close, the teams came together to discuss growth opportunities and the many ways our combined company will create value from the merger.  As I said before and firmly believe at the heart of this merger is growth, expanding our geographic reach in a highly fragmented industry, enhancing and growing our suite of value-added offerings and our market position, pursuing strategic acquisitions and giving our people the resources needed to deliver results and grow their careers. Since we closed the transaction early last month, we have been seamlessly executing our plan. The integration is on track, and I feel even better today about our prospects for the future than I did in August when we announced the transaction. Over the next 3 years, I have complete confidence in our ability to deliver $130 million to $150 million of run rate cost synergies and we are on track to realize $60 million to $70 million of those cost synergies in our 2021 results. Before I turn the call over to Peter, I would like to highlight one of our many valued team members. [Beto Valdovinos], a trust production manager at our Colorado Springs location. [Beto] joined the company out of high school. And 19 years later, he is a top operator and a respected mentor. Thanks to his leadership, [Beto's] location earned one of the highest efficiency ratings of any trust plant at our company last year. [Beto] truly grew up in the trust world. His colleagues praise his success through his hard work, dedication and incredible attitude. He is also a leader in safety, taking great pains to ensure facilities are clean and that everyone is well versed in proper protocol. In large part, due to his guidance, the Colorado Springs location has been accident-free for nearly 10 months. Thank you, [Beto], and the many incredible associates who have made the first several weeks of our integration so smooth while continuing to maintain the superior quality of service that our customers expect from us.  It's an exciting time at Builders FirstSource as we execute our strategy and remain focused on serving our customers, growing our share, capturing synergies associated with our merger and driving shareholder value. With that, let me turn the call over to Peter to highlight our financial performance and our outlook for the year.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. I would like to start by thanking our team for the incredible results and focused execution during this unprecedented time. I will cover 3 topics with you today. First, I'll review BFS' stand-alone fourth quarter results, then I'll discuss free cash flow, provide you with an update on our upsized revolving credit facility and discuss our pro forma leverage. And finally, I'll give you the roadmap for how we see the market and our outlook for 2021. Standalone Builders FirstSource had $2.5 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter, a 43.5% increase compared to a year ago. Core organic sales increased by 15%, while commodity price inflation added 26.5% to net sales. Our latest acquisitions completed during the year contributed to a net sales growth of 2%. Value-added core organic sales grew by an estimated 10.8%, led by 16.9% growth in our manufactured products category and 5.3% growth in our windows, doors and millwork category. We continued to experience accelerated and stronger-than-expected demand across the country throughout the fourth quarter.  As a reminder, the fourth quarter is typically a slower part of the homebuilding season. Our gross profit of $669.2 million was an increase of 40% year-over-year. Gross margin of 26.4%, while slightly better than expected, decreased 60 basis points compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an inflation driven shift in product mix towards our lower-margin commodity products. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 480 basis points to 18% amidst cost leverage on commodity price inflation, higher core organic sales and continued strong expense control, which more than offset higher variable costs related to the increase in net sales. Adjusted EBITDA grew $147.8 million to a quarterly record of $257.1 million, an increase of 135%. The increase was primarily driven by organic sales growth across all 3 of our customer end markets and commodity inflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 10.2% of net sales compared to 6.2% in the same period a year ago. I'm extremely proud of our team for delivering these very strong results. Our continued focus on and efforts to improve our mix and carefully managed pricing levels supported our record gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income for the fourth quarter. Let's turn to our cash flow. For the full year, we generated operating cash flow of $260 million, while investing over $260 million in working capital. We also invested $104 million in capital expenditures, including 2 new greenfield trust manufacturing facilities among several growth initiatives. As well as refreshing vehicles and equipment and investing in technology and automation to support operational excellence and increased sales volume. On a pro forma basis, the combined company's operating cash flow was $468 million, less CapEx of $181 million. Last month, we amended and extended the maturity of our existing $900 million revolving credit facility. The amendment increased total commitments by $500 million, up to $1.4 billion in total, while extending the maturity by an additional 26 months. The increase and extension of this facility provides us with an improved capital base that better represents our larger reach and scale going forward. Earlier this month, we gave notice that on March 3, 2021, $82.5 million of the 2027 notes will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. At the end of the fourth quarter, our pro forma net debt was approximately 1.3x our LTM adjusted EBITDA. In addition, we have no long-term debt maturities due until 2027. Our strong stand-alone and combined results in 2020 demonstrate positive momentum for the new Builders FirstSource and the broader homebuilding industry where demand continues to outstrip supply. Turning to our outlook. We continue to see robust underlying demand in the single family and remodeling sectors. Most builders are seeing increased buyer traffic and new home orders. Our business momentum continued in January, reflecting another month of double-digit sales and organic growth as compared to prior year period on a pro forma basis. Although housing starts were strong in the fourth quarter of 2020, homebuilders continue to experience an extended construction cycle. This shifts the timing of a new start to our sales, as evidenced by houses under construction growth of approximately 17%. We expect this dynamic to continue throughout 2021 until homebuilders work through their elevated backlogs as we see these backlogs providing a strong foundation for our business and the industry throughout 2021 and into 2022. We, therefore, expect net sales for the full year 2021 to be in the range of $13.9 to $14.6 billion or an approximate 9% to 14% increase from our 2020 pro forma net sales of $12.8 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow 20% to 25% over our 2020 pro forma adjusted EBITDA.  As Dave mentioned, we expect to realize $60 million to $70 million of the cost synergies this year. The dimensional lumber index averaged 676 -- $676 per thousand in the fourth quarter and hit 2 quarterly all-time highs during 2020. We have seen commodity costs to remain at elevated levels in January and February, and futures have even reached new all-time highs. Despite elevated levels in 2021, we do anticipate commodity prices to normalize in the back half of the year. As in the past, we remain highly confident that we will successfully manage through the inflationary and deflationary environments and will exceed the guidance if commodity prices stay at elevated levels. Our outlook is based on several assumptions, which are outlined in the earnings release, including growth in single family starts across our geographies in the high single digits. While demand for single family starts remains extremely high, we believe actual starts will be constrained by material and labor availability. Multifamily starts declined in the low single-digits and R&R growth in the low single-digits. Our free cash flow is projected to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million this year. Our significant cash generation and low leverage gives us the ability to invest in growth initiatives and deploy value-creating capital.  Our capital allocation plan includes reinvesting in the business in both growth and maintenance capital expenditures. We also have a solid pipeline of M&A candidates. As you heard from Dave, we believe the long-term underlying industry fundamentals remain very healthy, as evidenced by strong homebuyer demand and continued adoption of value-added products. The factors under our control further support our ability to drive results in this environment. These include continued expense management, delivering deal driven cost synergies and ongoing operational excellence initiatives. With our strong flexible balance sheet position, we have a significant opportunity ahead of us to continue to be a consolidator within our $120 billion addressable market. Overall, the new Builders FirstSource entered 2021 on exceptionally strong footing, and we are excited to deliver another year of record results. So with that, operator, let's open the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Dahl: First question is really around -- I am thinking through capital allocation, just given -- it sounds like the integration so far progressing smoothly albeit early days between the combined balance sheet, already having relatively low leverage and then the cash flow guide you're providing, from the slides in here your commentary make it seem like, yes, there's obviously still a long runway for growth via M&A. And in some ways, maybe even more programmatic than it has been in the past. So I guess I'm just thinking about how we should view kind of cadence of tuck-in M&A while you're integrating these 2 companies and then also, given the excess cash flow, how you think about returning capital to shareholders?
Dave Flitman: Great question, Mike. This is Dave. We're excited about the balance sheet, as you point out. And as you heard Peter say, we have a lot of opportunities to invest capital inside the company to support our growth. I love a lot of things about the culture of the 2 companies. The millwork business that we have combined, the trust and offsite component manufacturing. Both companies were investing heavily in those. We will continue to do that, including automation of our facilities. You'd heard me talk at BMC about that over time. Chad and Peter had also talked about that. So a very good alignment around that. And as you think about just from a legacy BMC standpoint, the 150 locations, which are now 550, I get excited about that. I get excited about things like READY-FRAME penetration. And the opportunity to take that across the country and 3 times the number of facilities that we have. So a lot of exciting internal investment opportunities. To your point around M&A, we've got one of the strongest balance sheet here inside the industry. And that wasn't by accident, as you know, from both legacy companies' perspective. And you heard me say in my comments, as excited as I am about our platform and our growth potential, we still have a relatively small share. And this, this industry remains highly fragmented. As Peter said, we've got a strong M&A pipeline. And we're 57 days into the integration. So we've got a lot of work ahead of us here. But you will see us continue to be an aggregator in this industry over time because there's a lot of opportunities to do so, and we're well positioned for that.
Michael Dahl: Okay. And the second question or kind of a two parter on the lumber environment. First, I guess I'm curious, your margin performance, the margin guide, it's very strong and clearly a number of things playing into that. But I'm wondering, just given the tightness in the lumber supply chain as well as the backlog that these builders are trying to work through. Has the relationship between commodity inflation and margin changed in a way that even in a more inflationary environment, you're able to achieve higher margins than you'd normally expect just given the bottlenecks and kind of the urgency from the customers to get product on the job sites. The second part is just a clarification when you talked about normalization. I think there's a lot of different views on what normal may or may not be, given what's transpired. So any sense of just when you say normal, is that true long-term trend line price? Or how do you think about what that normalization looks like in the second half?
Dave Flitman: Yes. Another great question, Mike. I'll put it to Peter here in a minute, but let me just say, as you've watched both legacy companies execute in what was a high inflationary environment and in '18 and then that deflation in '19 and just unprecedented inflation and supply constraints in 2020. We're -- we've got a lot of expertise around that. And I have the utmost confidence that whatever the market brings our way in terms of the inflation and deflation that we're going to do a great job of managing through that. And I think because of those challenges in the market over the past couple of years, I think we've sharpened our toolkit, and we've got even better at doing that, which is what you see represented in the way we've executed on a margin basis here over the last couple of years. Peter?
Peter Jackson: And exactly right, the work that we've been talking about over the past few years on pricing management and training within the organization. I think it was true in BMC, just like it was for BFS. It really has come into play as you've seen such dramatic increases in the price of commodities, right? Our ability to react has gotten better. Our disciplines around the management of that has gotten better. And I think you've seen that in the gross margin results. I would also say that there's some truth to the idea that a move that dramatic has forced everyone in the industry to take stock of pricing more aggressively, right? I mean you're -- this isn't something you could ever hope to protect your customer from when you're up 100-plus percent in some products. So certainly a respect for the need to change pricing quickly and we participated in that. And I think we did, as you mentioned, far better than usual as a combination of those 2 factors. As for the long-term estimate, you're right on. We did revert to a long-term average. There's certainly a lot of debate about whether or not there's going to be a new normal. I think that's fair. There are some legitimate questions out there. But at the end of the day, the game of prognosticating commodity prices is not one we really like to participate in. We've proven an ability to make money on the way up. We've proven an ability to make money on the way down. And for us, we think, a modest forecast on normalization in the back half of the year is just a smart and prudent way to communicate the business. And we're just excited about the core, but we think we've got a great platform here and the growth we have for the year looks really fantastic.
Operator: So we'll take our next question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: I'd like to offer my congratulations to everyone. And to Chad as well in retirement. So I guess, first question, the -- I guess, on the guide, the core organic outlook. It seems like based on all the pieces you've given, you're implying kind of mid- single-digit organic growth within the 9% to 14% total. Peter, you mentioned completions and units under construction, really ramping. I think you said 17%. And you even gave a little bit of view into '22, just in terms of confidence of having some builder backlogs driving that. So I'm just trying to reconcile that versus the mid-single-digits. And is the expectation, I guess, cadence wise that the growth should be sort of flat or even down into the second half of the year?
Dave Flitman: Great question, Matt. And I'll just say to Peter's comments earlier during the prepared remarks, there's been an increasing challenge here to go from start to completion based on what's been going on in the supply chain. As you look at lumber, we just talked about lumber, OSB is as tight as it's ever been, even getting windows and doors, and we've all talked about a lot of those challenges in the past. And the result of that has been just extension of the time from start to completion of the home.  Now having said that, we're projecting starts in the mid upper single-digits. We are going to capture absolutely as much of the core organic growth that can possibly be had here. We're well positioned for it. Our customers have large backlogs, which underscores the confidence that Peter outlined in terms of our performance throughout 2021 and even into 2022, given the reality of where we are in the market. And many of these product categories not improving from a capacity standpoint anytime soon. So we've got a lot of confidence in our performance. As you've seen, you heard Peter talk about double-digit core organic growth here to start 2021. And we're going to outperform the market regardless of what's going on.
Peter Jackson: And like you said, the comps do get more challenging in the back half of the year, but I just want to reiterate, our assumptions around both commodities and single family starts are but our attempt to give you a modest and reasonable, a thoughtful look at what we think the market can do, given the dynamics at play. If the market does better than that, we're going to do better than that. No hesitation in saying that. We're just trying to give you what we think is a thoughtful view. We're certainly very bullish on the overall strength of demand. This is not a demand commentary. We think consumers are strong. Trends are solid. We like what we're seeing, and that's sort of the hint you saw for 2022. The inability to deliver on the products that demand is asking for. Is really just an extension of the build cycle, and we think that bodes very well for us and for the industry.
Matthew Bouley: Perfect. No. And I appreciate the assumption there around normalization and commodity and even the market as well as potentially leaving some room for upside if things stay elevated. So that is helpful. I guess the second question is on value-added and manufactured products, in particular, you talked about the really strong organic results there. It did accelerate after the past couple of quarters. And then Dave, you even just mentioned the expansion of READY-FRAME across the BLDR footprint. So I guess the question is just kind of linking those together. What's -- what are you seeing in manufactured products today? And then now that you've hit the gas pedal on the integration, what are some of the things we should look for in terms of expanding products nationally?
Dave Flitman: A great question. I'm excited about it. As you watch both legacy companies performed here over the last couple of years, you saw continued penetration in leading the market down the value-added path. And I think in large part, driven by the needs of our customers. They're continuing to look for ways to get more efficient and productive, and that plays perfectly into our value-added offerings. And I think that was only exasperated here in the past 6 to 9 months based on the strength of the market, some of the supply chain challenges. So these builders need to get more effective of what they do, and we're pleased to have the offerings that we do. So we expect continued strong organic growth and penetration of the markets and especially in markets that haven't historically been a component market. We think the time is right now, labor constraints are still very real, and I think we'll continue to fight those sort of challenges. And to your question around what to expect going forward, I think we've talked about our first priority here going forward is to invest in the strong growth opportunities that we have inside the company. And I'm not any more excited about any of that than on our value-added offerings, including READY-FRAME. And so that's what I think you can expect going forward, which is a lot more of the same and the wherewithal to continue to accelerate that growth.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.
Ketan Mamtora: Congrats on a strong start. Maybe just coming back to READY-FRAME. Is there a way to kind of -- and I'm not looking for exact numbers, but is there a way to kind of size what kind of opportunity you have there to grow. And would that require any additional investments from your side to be able to capture that growth?
Dave Flitman: Yes, great question. And I can talk about READY-FRAME for a long time because in legacy BMC we were continuing to invest in it, and we're excited about the growth, which, as we've talked about over the past couple of years have been from a house penetration standpoint in the double-digit growth arena. I would just tell you, in legacy BMC in the fourth quarter, that house penetration was nearly 20% as we continue to grow strength and momentum. And really exciting part about READY-FRAME and that investment to your question is it's a relatively minor investment. We're talking about saws and some computer aided design and capability. But it's a relatively minor investment to extend that across the markets. And it is in large part driven by the know-how of our people, right, to not only design the homes and put that in a READY-FRAME model, but also how we deliver it to job sites and unload it in a way that's very effective for the framer, so they can do their work most efficiently. So a minor investment as we expanded to new markets, and we will continue to be aggressive at doing that.
Ketan Mamtora: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe can you talk about sort of any disruptions from some of the recent storms that you've had in Texas? How you are kind of managing, given what has happened?
Peter Jackson: Yes. No, that's a great question. It's been a difficult time, obviously, not just for us, for the whole state. We had some interruption. As you might imagine, we had some shutdowns. The initial read is that it's probably around $40 million in sales that were delayed as a result of those shutdowns. We'll see how it plays out through the rest of the quarter. For a company of our scale, obviously, that's not material, but it's impactful to the folks in the state. So we've done some work with our employees to make sure we're supporting them and those that were impacted, and we're continuing to bring all of our facilities back up and candidly, they're running quite well. Now as you can imagine, there's a lot of pent-up demand. There was any way in a very, very busy market and they're rolling hot right now. It's fun.
Ketan Mamtora: Got it. Understood. I'll turn it over. Good luck through 2021.
Dave Flitman: Do we think it's going to last through 2021? Is that your question?
Ketan Mamtora: All I said was good luck as we move through the year.
Dave Flitman: Oh, good luck. I apologize. Yes, thank you so much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Manthey with Baird.
David Manthey: So we are guiding to approximately $135 million in total quarterly depreciation and amortization. I assume that most of that resides in SG&A in your combined P&L. Is there a piece of that depreciation that resides in cost of goods sold first off?
Peter Jackson: There is a little bit, yes, attributable to the manufacturing facilities.
David Manthey: And breaking their bread box, less than 10% of it?
Peter Jackson: That's a great question. I don't know we've ever broken that out before. I don't have it handy on me.
David Manthey: Okay. And what I'm getting at here is, I'm thinking about total SG&A with or without D&A as a fixed component of your operating expenses, could you remind us what percent of the combined company SG&A is fixed versus variable in the very short-term?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I mean we generally talk about it is about 70% variable. So most of that cost moves with the increasing and decreasing volumes. It's a bit less than that when we talk about the commodity influence component of growth, but certainly, the bulk of what we do is moved by the volumes.
David Manthey: Okay. And D&A would be a portion of that 30%?
Peter Jackson: Yes, yes. And as we finish the purchase accounting, we'll have some updates for you on sort of what the dollars are going to be in those buckets. But as it stands, that's still a work in progress.
David Manthey: Okay. We're just trying to work through the pro forma this year. And then in terms of working capital, is your goal still to remain in that 12% to 13% of sales range? And here, too, just to be clear, could you give us how you define working capital for that calculation?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So that 12% to 13% is not familiar to me. Maybe that was on the BMC side. The number we've used in the past is closer to 8% to 9%. That's a number that includes the receivables, inventory and payables amounts. Now obviously, that's gone down over time. And we'll move as we look at the valuation of commodities in the current numbers. But just as a rule of thumb, that 8% to 9% as an incremental percentage vis-à-vis sales is the right way to think about it.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Collin Verron with Jefferies.
Collin Verron: So I just wanted to start on the EBITDA margin expansion. The guidance implies about 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. I was just hoping you can walk us through how this might show up on your P&L, gross profit or SG&A? And just given where lumber is now and the capturing of synergies, can you just talk about the cadence of this improvement throughout the year?
Peter Jackson: Sure. Yes. So the -- generally speaking, we talk about the fall-through on our incremental sales in that 12% to 15% range. Obviously, you'll see certain movements that will go above or below that. But there's a good rule of thumb for how our business grows over time. So that fall through, as you see the expansion, both in the underlying volume and in the commodities throughout the year, this year will fall through, and you'll see that gross margin then translate as we talk about the volume -- impact on SG&A will translate down into that EBITDA number. So to think about it more broadly, we like high prices. As a distributor, this is certainly a very good season for us, if you will, in terms of the prices we're seeing and the growth, the leverage of our business is quite strong, as you can imagine. So that's the reason that's driving that fall-through to those very high numbers. We also do expect to see an increasing generation of synergies throughout the year as well as an increase in generation of productivity savings and improvements throughout the year. I don't know if I would say it's a straight-line increase, but for the purposes of this discussion, that's a reasonable way to look at it.
Collin Verron: Okay. Great. And just on the lumber prices being at all-time highs, there's been a lot of headlines just about the impact on home prices and the ability of buyers to get appraisals. It doesn't seem to have an impact in the near term, but have you heard from any of your customers that things could slow down as we start to look out like 6 months to a year if lumber prices don't normalize? Or do they just think that the low interest rates and the underlying fundamentals in the industry from a demographic standpoint can really sustain this even in this high lumber price environment?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I think it's far more the latter. The demand is so strong. The problem is our ability to build the homes that people want as an industry. So while there could be on the edges, some headwinds, but framing really isn't anywhere near an important part -- an important part of the cost of the home as many other factors. So sure, there's a component there is inflation in a couple of other areas that in the long term, may drive demand down. But at this stage, I'm not sure we're going to be able to see it and as time passes, I think we'll be able to fix some of the constraints in the industry that will normalize that as well, which I think will then feed back into a stronger demand profile as well.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Keith Hughes with Truist.
Keith Hughes: On the D&A estimate you have for the year, the $540 million to $550 million, how much of that is deal amortization? How much of it is just more traditional depreciation?
Peter Jackson: Yes. Well, I mean, like I mentioned, it's still a work in progress, but a pretty substantial step-up on the purchase accounting, as you can imagine, right? That will burn off over a few years. But as it relates to the valuations that we'll do as part of that purchase accounting, we'll see a pretty substantial step up.
Keith Hughes: Okay. And the -- this was sorted out earlier, but I just wanted to bear down a little bit more. With the EBITDA expansion you have versus the pro forma numbers projected here for '21. Do you expect to see EBITDA margins up in every quarter? Or were there -- the comp in the fourth quarter so tough that we might see some degradation there?
Peter Jackson: Yes. You know what, that's a fair question. We do anticipate seeing increasingly difficult comparisons as you get through the year, right? You're looking at the beginning of the year last year, pretty modest numbers across the board. And by the end of the year, looking at record commodities, record starts, a lot of records in there, which have been pretty fun, I could admit. But yes, the comps will get harder in the back half of the year. The real question is what happens with commodities and starts. There's the numbers that we've got laid out here would indicate some tough comps, but if things stay elevated, it will stay good. But overall, the year looks great, a lot of confidence in both the overall industry and our performance.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms: And congrats to everybody on getting the deal done and Chad, on your retirement and best of -- best of luck to you. So on the first question that I have is, I know your guidance hasn't included, historically hasn't included any sales synergies between the 2 companies. But like the rollout of READY-FRAME to more branches, more of the Builders FirstSource branches. Examples like that, where do you see potential opportunity for some benefits to the top line, sales synergies or whatever you want to call them, where you can benefit from the combined company. Just areas. If I like to say, I know it doesn't -- you're not including it in the guide or in the synergy guide, but it seems like there could be some opportunities. If you could just maybe update us on where you think there might be some low-hanging fruit?
Dave Flitman: Yes. Thanks, Keith. And as I mentioned, we've got -- -- Trey, sorry about that. We've got 9 work streams on our transaction here focused on integration. And one of those is growth, as you might expect. And we talked about READY-FRAME, that we're seeing a lot of opportunities. And as we talked about when we announced the deal, one of the exciting parts about the deal is the fact that we will have a broader offering. And even in the local markets where we're individually very strong, one of the other legacy companies might have been stronger in millwork versus components. And as we brought this thing together, we're very excited about half in that full breadth of offering across the footprint. So we're seeing a lot of opportunities like that in terms of growth potential across our value-added segments with several others. But it's early days. The team is working hard on it, and we're very excited about it.
Trey Grooms: Thanks, Dave. And then last one for me is there's -- you mentioned earlier in the comments that there could be some inflation in some other areas. And of course, there's tightness in a lot of the different products out there outside of lumber. And a lot of manufacturers of these products are out with price increases from wallboard to interior doors and roofing and insulation. How are you guys looking at the inflation outside of lumber for this year relative to what we've seen in the last couple -- do you expect that to accelerate? Just what are you baking in there?
Dave Flitman: Yes, we do. There's certainly been enough increases across the board from different vendors that I think to think otherwise would be misinformed. There are a lot of reasons for it. Some of it is inputs. Some of it is cost of doing business. The other is, I think, just the recognition that we're chasing a nice strong number and capacity in the market is struggling to keep up, so people are trying to balance that price capacity, that price volume metric. But it's certainly something that we -- I won't say we're happy about, it's part of what we do. We perform well in markets with strong pricing. So we are participating in that. We're making sure we stay disciplined about it, communicating with our vendors where we think it's maybe out of line. But for the most part, trying to be supportive to make sure we have an industry that can grow and continue to respond to the demand.
Trey Grooms: And then last one. Sorry, I said last one earlier, but actually did want to sneak one more in. You guys talk about commodity normalizing in the back half. And you've got a range here with your EBITDA range with the margins there. How would that look? This commodity has surprised everybody, I’d say, well, maybe not everybody, but most folks, the way that it's as resilient stayed up as high as it has through the winter and then has accelerated. So if we don't see -- if the commodity doesn't normalize in the back half, how does that change your outlook?
Dave Flitman: Hey, Trey, good and important question. Let me start, and then I'll flip it over to Peter. But I think for a number of reasons, I think the lumber questions here are starting to become less and less important, especially in our combined company. First of all, as we've talked about, we're both expert in managing through this cycle. And as you heard us say earlier, we're real confident in our ability to do that regardless of what the market throws at us. And a lot of the things that we talked about that we're excited about here being -- having the largest footprint in our industry. Here a broadest portfolio of products. The geographical reach with 550 locations, 85 of the top 100 MSAs and importantly, as you look at our millwork and components business, that's more than $5 billion of the combined company revenues right now, and they're the fastest-growing in the company. So linked back to our strategy, growing those value-added components will be an important part of how we grow the company and how we continue to improve profitability, not that lumber won't be an important part of what we do, and it always will be. But it's going to have less and less of an impact than what we do over time, right? And so I just want to get everybody's head calibrated. That's one of the most exciting parts about this merger. And I would just say, we've got to stop thinking about what we're building here as a lumber distributor, right? We are a growth company and a fast-growing one at that. And I think time will prove that out as we go forward and drive this growth in areas that are non-commodity related. But Peter, go ahead.
Peter Jackson: Yes, no, great point. And we're -- we do pretty well at lumber too which is, I think the right way to think about it, right, maybe will be the core of where we're headed, but we do well at it. And the short answer to your question, Trey, is you're right on. It is going to be a really nice tailwind if it stays high, based on the guide that you would get because the math will show, right? You got a first half growth, second half headwind. If you look at just the math of the commodities, I mean, you take away the second half headwind, that's a great story. We'll look forward to enjoy that business, if you're right.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Reuben Garner with Benchmark Company.
Reuben Garner: Most of my questions have been answered. I guess just one kind of more macro level picture. In the past, BMC has been one to highlight the kind of falling footprint and the size of homes that are being built whether it's because of new entry homes or just smaller homes in general. And I think there have been some signs, but that might be reversing. Are you guys seeing anything there? What's kind of baked in your guidance if I missed it, apologies, but any color you could give on that, that would be great?
Dave Flitman: Yes, we can tag the team. I mean as you point out, that Reuben, I mean the average square foot of the home has continued to fall. And I think that's accelerated over the past couple of years just based on the entry-level or first time step up buyers. I think we're somewhere around 2,300 square feet at this point for the average home size. But as you've heard me say in legacy BMC, I don't really get concerned about the size of the home as long as it continues to fuel growth, right, in the industry. And I haven't met a start. I don't like yet at this point. So as long as that holds up and continues to fuel growth, we're going to continue to penetrate with our value-added offerings.
Peter Jackson: Yes. And I think what you might be alluding to is the rumor and the rumblings that people are -- that might turn, right? We're seeing folks that are more committed to the homes that they're sort of stuck in, right. So they like it a little bit bigger, they want that office where they can close the door, for example. So there's, I think, reason to believe that we may see the end of that shrinking of the home. I've seen no data yet, but I think it's reasonable to think that's a real thing. And that will just sort of take away one of the little headwinds we were seeing in the industry and be a stabilizing factor. To Dave's point, though, we could still see an average decline just because I think the growth of the single-family starter home has been so strong, which is great for us, right? It's just a win for everybody.
Reuben Garner: Perfect. And then actually, I might sneak one more in. The cash flow that you're generating is obviously very strong, and the balance sheet is in great shape. I think you kind of touched on this earlier, but can you just maybe emphasize what -- if you're not able to get enough deals done, I guess, as a use of cash, what you might do with the excess as you move forward, do you continue to build a fortress? Or do you think you'll get more aggressive in other ways to either return cash to shareholders or invest in the business?
Peter Jackson: Yes. We've got a really nice position, like you said. Our debt, as the leverage ratio based metric is quite low. We feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and tend to maintain that as a priority. Moving into the investment opportunities, Dave alluded to it, and I think we all feel good about it. As we get to the cash generation point in our year we’ll have gotten through a lot of the initial stress of the integration and be in a stronger position to really be aggressive on some of those M&A opportunities that are out there, we really like the portfolio. I think we have a lot of runway in front of us to consolidate the industry. And the short answer, if for whatever reason, all of those things don't use up the cash. Sure, the options are open, right? You've seen both companies buy back shares in the past, and we'll look at it. But right now, we feel like we've got -- the sites are full with great targets.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.
Jay McCanless : And Chad, all the best, enjoy your retirement. Peter, on the lumber guidance. I'm just wondering, are you guys thinking that revenues -- total revenues first half may actually be a little bit higher this year than revenues in the second half as lumber prices start to fall back down? And then also, are you hearing or seeing capacity increases or, I guess, capacity utilization getting better at your suppliers to have that kind of confidence for lumber just to be up 0% to 10% this year?
Peter Jackson: Yes, I don't think the commodity is strong enough to skew sales from second half to first half. I think, I mean, second half is historically stronger, so I think we should continue to see that. I mean the answer on the commodity capacity question, it's a good one. I mean, I'm up 2 minds, right? On one hand, some capacity coming online doesn't appear to be enough to pull the rug out from under it. But the counter to that argument of sort of bullishness on prices is that historically, this is not an industry that's held price. Just isn't. So I don't know that I want to be the guy to put my foot down and say, yes, this time, it's different. I haven't seen any evidence to prove that. So we're going to continue to put that sort of modest sort of reasonable number out there. And if it's better, then it will be good.
Jay McCanless: Got it. And then another question I had, very strong results in multifamily in the fourth quarter, but then you're calling for multifamily to be down in '21. Is what we saw this quarter, just kind of finishing out some of those larger projects that were started in '19, and that project activity is going to flow from here?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I mean, in context, multifamily is about 6% of our business. So it's pretty specifically focused on certain geographies and certain projects. There is a bit of exactly what you described, projects that sort of are concluding, and the pipeline will still good. Looks to be maybe not as much of a positive a contributor as it was last year where the team really sort of did a really nice job of expanding our capacity, that gets a little harder in this environment. I think we've all seen multifamily struggle a bit. We feel good about the business. We think there's still a growth opportunity there, but just sort of line of sight thinking it’s going to moderate a bit.
Operator: We'll go next to Alex Rygiel with B. Riley.
Alex Rygiel: Real quick question. As it relates to your free cash flow forecast, which is fantastic, how should we think about working capital changes relative to the anticipation of commodity prices coming back down to sort of normalized levels. I guess the question here is, how much did that free cash flow forecast vary depending on commodity prices?
Peter Jackson: Yes. You nailed it, that's a great question. The short answer is our business being distribution based is going to generate a tremendous amount of cash as sales decline, and that includes the value of commodities and any sales decline associated with that. So certainly do expect, given our stated belief or stated forecast, rather, that the commodity prices are going to come down. There is a component in there. It's unfortunately, it's a little bit hard to put your finger on it. But to put it in context, we talked about the increase in working capital usage in 2020. And being about $260 million in our prepared remarks. So just to kind of put it in context that, that's directionally the types of numbers you'd expect to see when extrapolating that to the larger entity for a full switch back to sort of historical.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.
Kurt Yinger: Just one quick one on the capital spending side. Could you talk about any kind of notable projects you have slated for 2021 here? And as you think about your capacity at present, particularly on the manufactured product side, how do you feel about your ability to supply increasing levels of demand as the market grows and perhaps those products continue to gain adoption?
Peter Jackson: Yes. You -- I think you've been peaking into my ops reviews. So that's a good one there. We've got obviously a lot of facilities around the country right now that are focused on meeting the increased demand. A couple of factors there, obviously, hiring, being an important one, making sure we're running all the ships we can, utilizing equipment fully and in markets where even that's not enough, making sure we're bringing in the increased capacity on the equipment side that we need. So we talked a little bit earlier about the ability and the willingness and the desire to invest in organic growth for the company. That's the sort of tip of the spear, right? It's how do you react to make sure you've got the right trust equipment, door machines, saws, computer equipment to be able to chase that expanding use of value-add while continuing to invest in the trucks and the core operations that we need. But you're absolutely right. We're focused on making sure we're reacting in those markets that are white hot to have the capacity that we need. And it's a high-quality challenge, right, a high quality problem.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.
Steven Ramsey: Quick question on the margin guide, maybe a misunderstanding. It looks like the high end implies margins not stepping up with increased sales. If we're matching the high end of both sales and EBITDA guidance, new to lumber, are there any other factors there driving that?
Peter Jackson: I don't know if I can point to a specific driver. I think you might be just seeing the impact of multiple variables and low end of the range. Commodity is absolutely growth in various regions and the variables we put around that. So I don't know that I have a hard answer for you.
Steven Ramsey: Okay. Great. And then one other thing. Not trying to get into specific guidance, but just qualitatively, starts time extending between starts to completion. Is it factored into revenue generation for 2021, but maybe help support demand out into 2022 if this dynamic continues through the year?
Peter Jackson: That's right. Yes. We generally tell everyone that the best proxy for our long-term growth is that single-family starts metric, and it's true. The challenges with an extension of that build cycle, you start to get a little bit of wiggle, right, that look is coming and it’s a little harder to draw the line. So we just wanted to point that out everybody to say it's still the right number, but it will extend the time that we'll be able to enjoy the upside if that expansion of homes under construction continues out for a while, we think that that’s going to happen. So '21 into '22 and then as things -- as we expect, continue to be strong, that gives us a nice runway. So yes, you're right.
Operator: Our final questions from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG.
Ryan Gilbert: First question, Dave, I really appreciate your comments earlier about, over time, lumber being no less important component of BFS' story as the value-add piece of the business grows. But for the -- I think for the time being, it's still a relatively important piece of the story. So my first question is on lumber. And just given the strength of demand that we've seen from homebuilders as you're writing fixed-price contracts with the builders, are you noticing the length of time, that you're fixing lumber prices compressing in the fourth quarter and so far in '21?
Peter Jackson: So one of the things that has been a discussion in both fixed-price contracts and the appropriateness of them in light of the market and the market dynamics. Our observation is those appear to be falling as a percentage of the total, just given the way the market has evolved over the years. There's certainly something that, as you can imagine, we manage very closely to make sure people are living up to their commitments. We live up to ours as a partner in this industry. We've got the financial wherewithal to do what is right, no matter what, but also making sure that both sides are living up to it. So that's something we're careful with. But more broadly, it's about the relationship with the customer and working with them in a way that's obviously good for the end customer and mutually beneficial and watching the evolution of the industry, it appears that, that is something that's declining overall, but still an important material part of our business.
Ryan Gilbert: Second question is just digging into sales synergies a little more. I guess, one dynamic that I've noticed in the field is that a builder would buy like a wall package from BMC or BLDR and buy trusses from a different distributor. And with the combined company, have you seen an ability, are you able to take advantage of, or are you going after I guess, your new ability to sell both framing packages and trusses to homebuilders? Or do you think that's a future opportunity for the combined company?
Dave Flitman: Well, as you rightfully point out, I mean it's early days, right? But as we talk about that growth work stream earlier, we're excited about it. We see nothing as a deterrent in that. We've not had pushback. And in fact, our customers are equally excited about our combined offering in a lot of these markets. And so time will play out. But we're excited, see no roadblocks, and we think the future is very bright to continue to penetrate those markets with our offerings.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Chad Crow for any additional or closing remarks.
Chad Crow: Thank you. We appreciate everyone joining the call today and for the continued support of our company. I'm personally looking forward to watching what this new management team and all of our incredible team members will accomplish in the years ahead. As you heard throughout the call today, there is a lot of excitement around the future of our company. I certainly share that excitement and truly believe BFS is in the strongest position it has ever been. I am proud to have been a part of this amazing journey over the past 2 decades. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Peter or Mike. Thank you. Stay safe, and adios.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and will be available at www.bldr.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Binit Sanghvi, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Binit Sanghvi: Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call today are Chad Crow, Chief Executive Officer; and Peter Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. A copy of the slide presentation referenced on this call is available on the Investor Relations section of the Builders FirstSource website at bldr.com. Before we begin, let me note that during the course of this conference call, we may make statements concerning the company's future prospects, financial results, business strategies and industry trends. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Please refer to our most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other reports filed with the SEC for more information on those risks. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. The company will discuss adjusted results on this call. We have provided reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalent in our earnings press release and detailed explanations of non-GAAP financial measures in our Form K, Form 8-K filed yesterday, both of which are available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Chad Crow.
Chad Crow: Thank you, Binit. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. As the pandemic continues, I hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy. Our thoughts continue to be with those affected, and I would like to again recognize our dedicated team members for their commitment to excellence during the challenges of the past several quarters. The safety of our team members and of the surrounding communities where we operate, remain our top priority. Safety will continue to guide our operating strategy. Before diving into our results, I will start on Slide three and spend a moment discussing our recently announced merger with BMC Stock Holdings. This merger is on track to create the nation's premier supplier of building materials and services with combined adjusted EBITDA of approximately $950 million, including run rate synergies. Together, we will have an expansive geographic footprint and enhanced local relationships in attractive high-growth markets. The combined company will benefit from greater geographic reach and diversity within what is still a very fragmented industry. We will have a strong footprint in many of the nation's largest and fastest-growing regions and will be exceptionally well positioned for long-term growth, supported by a resilient housing environment. We expect to continue to deliver above-market growth through our shared commitment to value-added product offerings, which allow us to closely partner with customers to streamline the construction process. In addition, a larger platform will strengthen our ability to invest in best-in-class innovative solutions that deliver significant benefits to our customers. During the past 1.5 months, Dave Flitman and I have traveled to many regions of the country, including Texas, the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and Mountain states and the West Coast, among others. In many of these cities, we have held town hall meetings to hear directly from our team members about their local market strengths. It was extremely beneficial to observe both of our company's capabilities in real time and envision all the ways we will be able to complement each other to do some truly exceptional things for our customers. It brought both of us great pride to see our hard-working team members across the country whose efforts are directly responsible for putting us in the successful position we are in today. Both Dave and I enjoyed getting to interact with so many team members and seeing their excitement for future opportunities as we take our combined business to new heights. In terms of timing, thus far, the deal is progressing as expected. The merger planning work that is happening in the background right now continues to be very positive. In October, we filed a 30-day extension under the HSR review process with the DoJ. Also in October, we filed our Form S-4 with the SEC. We are working diligently with both agencies. Once we have completed these two regulatory milestones, there will be a required 20 working day notice before Builders FirstSource and BMC request their respective shareholder approvals. This keeps us on track to close the merger in late 2020 or early 2021. At this point, I could not be more pleased with our significant strides towards winning together as one, which is our merger tagline, while continuing to stay focused on customers and delivering exceptional operational performance. Moving to our results on Slide 4, I will outline the key factors underpinning our excitement about what we accomplished during the quarter. First, the momentum we carried into the third quarter continued with performance ultimately being better than we had anticipated. The homebuilding markets have been resilient. Improving housing starts, record low mortgage rates and a shift towards suburban living are all positive fundamentals that continue to support demand for our products and services. Since mid-year, activity in our end markets continued to trend positively, resulting in demand improving throughout the quarter. During the quarter, we experienced a steady recovery in sales as we have seen a broad-based improvement across geographies and end markets. We are back to work in all of our locations around the country and are able to safely and effectively deliver critical products and services to customers, while keeping up with the robust demand in much of the country. Our team delivered strong results all around. For the first 9 months of the year, sales increased by over 9% to a record $6 billion. Approximately 3% of growth was from core organic performance, and our five tuck-in acquisitions completed over the past year added more than two percentage points to growth. While housing demand has accelerated rapidly, we have also seen commodity prices reach record heights. Commodity inflation contributed approximately 3% to sales and 1 additional selling day contributed about 1%, which led to the increase in reported net sales of over 9% year-to-date. This brings us to our second theme. Through our focused execution, we have remained appropriately resourced to capture rising demand in a disciplined manner. This has produced record adjusted EBITDA of $443 million for the first 9 months of 2020. The gross margin just shy of 26% year-to-date is a direct result of our ability to react quickly and effectively to rapidly evolving market dynamics since midyear. In addition, our operational excellence initiatives remain core to our strategy. Alongside the momentum in our markets are - and our business right now, this set of best practices is being implemented throughout the organization and making our company more agile and easier to do business with. Key initiatives in process include investments in distribution and logistics software, pricing and margin management tools, back-office process efficiencies and information system enhancements. We launched these initiatives in 2018 and have made significant progress laying the groundwork for what will no doubt prove to be efficiency enhancing investments as we move into our next generation of growth. And finally, amongst the many [indiscernible] planned merger of BMC to our team members, customers and shareholders, we will continue to expand our network of value-added offsite component manufacturing facilities, which are core to our collective strategy. Post combination, that will continue to be a focus of our combined growth. With a portion of the cash we intend to generate, we will continue investing in value-added growth through both organic and inorganic opportunities. As an example, in October, we commissioned a state-of-the-art greenfield truss plant in Riverside, California, extending our industry-leading position to 66 manufacturing facilities. Whether through new facilities, new truss lines in existing plants, door facility expansions or other system enhancements, these differentiated offerings offer industry-leading value-add capacity and will remain key to enhancing our geographic footprint, technological capabilities and integrated partnerships with customers. The favorable market conditions we see today should provide growing opportunities for the bigger and better Builders FirstSource. We know customers value our commitment to high-quality service and in particular, our ability to continually invest in our service capabilities throughout the housing cycles. This is a differentiator for Builders FirstSource within our industry. It has been an element of our success in 2020 and will continue to be a core focus after we complete our transformational merger with BMC. I will now turn the call over to Peter, who will review our third quarter results in more detail.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. I would like to start by also recognizing our team's focused execution, including the quick reaction to the sharp rise in both demand and lumber costs. I will review our third quarter results, provide an update on the merger and in the guidance on how we see the market going forward. We had $2.3 billion in net sales in the third quarter with core organic sales increasing 6.7%. Core organic excludes acquisitions and commodity impacts from net sales to give an indication of the underlying performance of the business. We experienced accelerating demand across the country as demand continued to be stronger than expected throughout the home buying season. Our five tuck-in acquisitions completed over the past year added 2% to net sales. Commodity price inflation added another 7.2%. As a result, net sales in total increased by 15.9%. Our value-added product categories continue to perform well within our respective markets. I will note, however, that the impacts of both commodity inflation and COVID-19 in the hardest hit regions of the country has had a disproportionate impact on our value-added products despite higher underlying demand in most of the country. Gross margin of $570.7 million in the third quarter of 2020 increased by over $29.5 million over the third quarter of 2019. Our gross margin percentage was 24.9%, which was well ahead of our expectations, though down 240 basis points from the third quarter of 2019. The margin percent decrease on a year-over-year basis was attributable to sharp increases in commodity prices. The commodity inflation and lumber cost we have experienced since may continued throughout the quarter. So please keep in mind the mechanics of our margins as we have discussed on prior calls. Over the long term, higher prices benefit our business, however, price fluctuations, especially in commodities, can cause significant swings in our results. Commodity cost inflation causes short-term gross margin percentage headwinds when prices spike relative to our short-term pricing commitments that we provide customers. Additionally, higher prices in commodity products have a negative mix impact on gross margin percentages. As mentioned, I’m pleased with our team's ability to mitigate unfavorable impacts this quarter through a combination of focused execution and disciplined pricing. As we neared the end of the quarter, commodity prices started to ease, albeit at a very high level. Although we expect our gross margin percentage to continue to be pressured in the fourth quarter, we do expect to benefit from higher gross margin dollars generated from the higher commodity prices. Interest expense increased by $300,000 to $28 million compared to the same period last year. Excluding the net impact of onetime items related to debt issuance and extinguishments in the prior year period, interest expense increased by $3.4 million due to a higher outstanding balance as we proactively increased our liquidity and financial flexibility. Third quarter EBITDA increased $24 million from a year ago to $184.3 million, an increase of 15%. This is the highest quarterly EBITDA in our history, driven by the top line growth, combined with the reduction in variable expenses related to commissions as well as lower travel and fuel costs. EBITDA margin held steady at 8% compared to the prior year period. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $96.7 million or $0.82 per diluted share compared to $84 million or $0.72 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase of $12.7 million or $0.10 per share was primarily driven by improved operating results. On Slide 6, the strength of our business was evident again in the third quarter. Our team grew net sales across 4 of five product categories, led by lumber, given the dramatic escalation in costs. Value-added core organic sales showed healthy growth, increasing by approximately 2% despite continuing to be disproportionately impacted by geographies slower to recover from the pandemic, largely in the Northeast. Excluding this region, value-added product sales grew by mid-single digits in the rest of the nation. With the continuing labor challenges faced by our customers, demand for our labor-saving products is expected to continue to rise. To meet this growth, we plan to invest approximately 25% of our total 2020 capital expenditures in our value-added growth initiatives and expanding of our production capacity. Core organic sales grew by an estimated 6% in our single-family customer end market compared to the prior year, helped by accelerating demand in the majority of our regions. Market tailwinds and underlying economic conditions continue to be very supportive of demand. Builders are ramping up activity in response to that demand as evidenced by double-digit year-on-year increases in single-family starts. We expect these starts to provide a long runway for growth as they translate into increasing units under construction and ultimately, completions. Organic growth in the R&R and other end market grew by 7% as we continue to see relative strength in the Western part of the country. Multifamily core organic increased by 18%, largely due to the timing of large projects. Turning to our outlook on Slide 8. Our results in the first 9 months demonstrate a positive homebuilding environment that is supporting rising demand across our footprint, which continued into October. Year-to-date results reflect our team's focused execution and ability to stay on top of the extremely dynamic commodities market from both a price and cost management perspective. Our success is in large part attributable to our team's experience in managing through all types of market environments and the trust customers place in us to be their partner of choice. During 2020, the housing market has proven to be resilient with annualized single-family housing starts rising 17% in the third quarter and up 6% year-to-date. A number of tailwinds point to further strength in the fourth quarter and beyond. The builder confidence index reached an all-time high of E5 in October. We estimate significant pent-up demand from increased household creation and significant underbuilding of single-family homes over the past decade. Mortgage applications continue to decline with mortgage rates also near all-time lows, and existing home inventories also near all-time lows of three-month supply. We are seeing the benefit of residential construction catalysts in nearly all localities where we operate, outside of the Northeast. With this backdrop, we are introducing our outlook for the fourth quarter. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. We anticipate fourth quarter core organic sales to be in the mid- to high single-digit percent range year-over-year. While we are undoubtedly optimistic, we continue to manage our business with a prudent growth assumption, which accounts for the lag before housing starts translate into units under construction and ultimately, completions. In recent months, factors such as tight labor and material scarcity has extended builder construction cycles. To put that in perspective, over time, completions will approximate roughly 100% of starts, but at the moment, completions represent only approximately 80% of the current level of housing starts. Keep in mind, our core organic growth outlook reflects our core sales performance and excludes the sales contribution from acquisitions as well as the significant commodity inflation that we expect in the coming quarter. We estimate our fourth quarter gross margin percentages to be consistent with Q3 at around 25%. For the full year 2020, we continue to expect our cash interest will be in the $110 million to $115 million range. With our growth projects underway again, we reiterate our expectation for capital expenditures to be in the $100 million to $110 million range for the full year. Since 2018, we have generated nearly $1 billion of operating cash flow, and we fully expect to build upon that cash generation through year-end 2020. I will now turn the call back to Chad for his closing remarks.
Chad Crow: Thank you, Peter. This is an exciting time for Builders First Source. We are on path to close out a record year with 2020 adjusted EBITDA expected to be approximately $640 million or 25% above last year at the midpoint of our guidance. This outperformance to prior year comes as we reap the benefits of the structural enhancements we have made as we implement operational excellence initiatives, deepen our presence in high-performing value-added businesses and empower our sales teams to compete wisely in the commodity product market. I’m incredibly proud of the Builders FirstSource team and thank each member for their dedication to our company, customers and communities. Looking ahead, we are all very pleased to welcome the BMC team to the Builders FirstSource family. Our accomplishments to this point have only strengthened my conviction in the merits of this merger. This merger will allow us to deliver solutions that make our customers more productive and efficient through deeper and more integrated relationships than ever before. Value-added offerings will continue to represent the largest portion of our business and the focus of our investments. With our expanded capital resources, we believe we will be uniquely positioned to accelerate our profitable growth through underlying market expansion, supplemented by targeted acquisitions and operational excellence initiatives. This merger aligns with our shared growth strategies and occurs at an optimal time for both companies to create significant value to a much larger and more efficient platform. We look forward to completing this merger and working closely together with a unified leadership team that has a proven record of successful integrations. I’m confident that with the two outstanding organizations coming together, we will be better positioned than ever to be the supplier of choice for building materials and value-added products and services in the years to come. With that, thank you again for joining us today, and we will now open the call up for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: Congrats on the results. So I wanted to start out maybe pressing on the value-add product performance a little bit. The organic is still a little lighter than the rest of the business. And it sounded like you are attributing disproportionate impacts from the Northeast, and I think you said, Peter, mid-single-digit growth elsewhere, if I heard you right. But I think last quarter, there was some underperformance, which you talked about, related more to the West than to Florida. So I guess if you could just kind of unpack sort of what is going on there and maybe how value-add is expected to perform within that Q4 revenue outlook?
Peter Jackson: Sure. Yes. So there are a couple of layers to this. This has been a pretty dynamic year. So as we talked about, the beginnings of COVID's impact on our business, the parts of the country where we were hardest hit, the Northwest, the Northeast and Florida, were those areas, for the most part, that were seeing government shutdowns. So everything was shut down or significant parts of the business were shut down. So a lot of exposure to value add in those businesses. So we saw the greater-than-normal or greater-than-average negative impacts on value-add. As we got into this summer and through the back half of the year, the geography impact still true from the perspective that I would say the Northeast has been the slowest to recover. The Northwest bounced back pretty quickly after the COVID reopening hit. The entire Northeast corridor has been much more, I would say, gradual in the recovery back to normal, I would say, still below normal in those markets. And again, that exposure in commodities and - is different - I'm sorry, the exposure to value add is different in those markets than it is in the rest of the country. Another way to look at it is, if you think about those parts of the country that have grown the most and have the best performance, if you think about the South, Texas is a great example, in many ways, electing not to participate in the downturns related to COVID, that is a market that doesn't have as much exposure to that value-added product. There are some other factors at play. We talked a little bit about the extended build times. We think that the homebuilder cycle, despite the rapid increase in starts, is extending. We have heard that comment from a few folks, whether it be due to product availability or labor availability. We think that has also shown a bit of an impact, particularly on products that we see towards the back half of the build cycle that is included in value add for us. All in all, we are not concerned about it. We continue to monitor it. I think it is important, obviously, to our strategic vision of the company. But all of our data says we have reason to be confident. We are positive about our backlogs. We think that the overall environment is very, very positive, and we see it picking up again. But certainly, there have been some speed bumps. We all know how hard it is to run a manufacturing operation in general. And during the age of the COVID, that is certainly a challenge for us. So we will continue to keep an eye on it and manage it, but certainly optimistic about what we see coming. Backlogs look good. Demand looks good. I haven't seen people moving away from manufactured product. So we think it is just some unevenness in the business.
Matthew Bouley: Okay. Makes sense. I appreciate the thoughts there, Peter. And secondly, I wanted to ask just on the merger. It sounds like the time line is on track, but you have continued to obviously progress with the merger planning. So I guess I'm just curious if there is any sort of operational updates around how you are thinking about that, some of the things we talked about like overlapping locations in a few markets, maybe any finer points on the synergy potential. Just as you have continued to dig deeper, just curious what kind of the latest is on the operations.
Chad Crow: Yes. I would kind of sum it up as expected. Clearly, we are still two separate companies, and so we are doing as much of the planning as we can in the interim. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, Dave and I visited a lot of locations. There is a lot of excitement out there amongst our team members on the opportunities that we are going to have as a go-forward company. But no real surprises good or bad so far. It is just as expected, which is good. Still feel good about the synergy ranges we have given. One thing that is clear, we are all very busy. So there is not a whole lot of excess capacity sitting around at the moment, which is a high-class problem to have. So yes, it is going as expected, which is a good thing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Dahl: Tremendous results, guys. Good way to end the year. First question, just around margins, and this is more thinking towards 2021. So as you noted, lumber has started to move lower and given your lag, would you think about 2021 as being back in that normal 26% to 26.5% range at this point? And I guess, similarly, any thoughts on - there is always moving pieces around SG&A, but you guys have done a great job keeping costs under control and leveraging the top line. So any thoughts on kind of where we should be thinking on normal SG&A?
Peter Jackson: Yes. That is a great question. And you have heard me make this half joking comment before, if you can tell me what commodities are going to be, I will tell you what my margins are going to be. It is a really big question, Mark. That run up that we saw this year in commodities is unprecedented. And while it is turned, it is certainly not back to historical norms. We are quite elevated, and I think the market in some ways is still digesting it. It is certainly still passing through in our pricing. We have [indiscernible] some of the materials that the homebuilders have put out there about what they are doing with their pricing. Some people have maybe tried to play the game a little bit from what we are reading into their comments that they have tried to slow down or speed up their build cycles. Personally, I think they are missing out in terms of the opportunity and the demand that is out there. We are motivated to build whatever we can and get it out. And I think that dynamic, as it evolves over the next 6 months, will be impactful on us, no doubt. But the core of the business is where all of our effort is going in terms of being ready to deliver on that demand. The likelihood that we are going to see a return to those really high lumber prices is low. So I think it is fair to say that we will see some tailwinds associated with the deflation for a bit of time. But it is so volatile and so dynamic in different in different parts of the country. I would say at this point, I'm not comfortable putting a normal out there for you. What you are saying doesn't sound unreasonable, but I couldn't point you to a real number at this stage just until things normalize and sort of settle out a little bit. The other big factor is putting our two businesses together and seeing what our - what the combined entity starts to perform at, that will be a critical piece to that as well.
Chad Crow: Yes. I would just add nothing has structurally changed with our business, obviously, but it is a very volatile time. And as Peter mentioned, lumber prices has dropped significantly in the past month, but they are still well above any sort of historical averages. The framing lumber composite, the print right now is still 50% higher than a five-year average, and you go all the way up to OSB, which is still over 100% higher. So still a very healthy environment for us. As you know, we love high lumber prices. So if they do stay elevated into next year, that is a wonderful environment for us. Could margins be a tick lower? Maybe, but we will still be reaping the benefit of higher-margin dollars, which we know at the end of the day is the name of the game. So feel good about the business. And the short answer is there is nothing structurally that is changed in our business in the past few quarters that would cause, in my opinion, our margins to vary from what they have historically in a more normal commodity environment.
Michael Dahl: Right. Okay. I appreciate that, Chad and Peter. I guess, I will ask a slightly different way, and this has been more of a hypothetical. But let's say obviously, going into next year, there is still going to be some carryover tailwinds from inflation based on what we are still saying. In an environment where we gradually normalize down to, call it, a 450 to 500 lumber, which would still be above normal and OSB kind of normalizes lower. Based on what you are seeing in demand, you guys have the $750 million target out for 2022, but you are exiting 2020 at a really strong rate. Is it possible that you hit the $750 million, actually a year early in 2021?
Chad Crow: I guarantee you, we will. We will have BMC's results under us so...
Michael Dahl: I mean on a core basis.
Peter Jackson: There is, I mean, a couple of factors here, right? I mean, as far as I'm concerned, the day we close, that $750 million is sort of in the rearview mirror, and we will be working on putting a new number out there for everybody. The reality of the impact of commodity prices on that is undeniable, right? Of course, we are going to be able to deliver sooner if we got that tailwind. But again, our goal is really to focus on the core of the business, which is strong and is growing, and we are going to continue to refine and commodities are going to be what they are going to be. I think if we spend all of our time talking about commodity prices and its impact on the bottom line, we will have lost the real value in this business. But yes, I do think that could get us there sooner if they stay on it.
Michael Dahl: Sure. And certainly, didn't mean to focus too much on commodities. Part of the point there was just the underlying strength of the business giving you a path there as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms: Congrats on the great results. So first off, of course, I guess, sticking with lumber, one more question there. It is been pretty tight up until now. And of course, there is been some extended lead times out there. First, did that impact you at all in the quarter? Have you seen that improve at all? And then kind of second to that is how you are thinking about inventory positioning as we enter kind of the slower - seasonally slower winter months where maybe some supply might loosen up?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So I will try and answer those in order. We certainly did see certain markets, certain products, particularly certain species and lengths, get very, very tight during parts of the year. We, like everybody else, struggled at certain times to get everything that we wanted. I think we feel pretty good about getting what we needed. I think the numbers support that. We have seen, as the fall has started to set in, that some of that product has absolutely become available. And I think that is what you are seeing in the reflection of the prices in the spot for the random lengths coming back down. I would say it is not back to normal yet. But I would say that we are still running our business based on what we believe to be the right disciplines, meaning we are going to limit our inventory, we are going to keep our inventory tied to our days demand, we are going to bring it down seasonally. And then plan to bring it back up as we need to coming into next year. But right now you have seen a pretty good - this may come up later in the conversation, you have seen a pretty big increase in the value of our working capital. I will point to the fact that is basically all driven by the value of the product rather than the quantity of product we have on hand. We intend to stay lean.
Chad Crow: Yes. Trey, I will just add, there is definitely been some - not just in products, we deliver just across the board. As you know, there is been some product shortages and those continue. I have heard instances in the Dallas market where bricks are out 12 weeks, and I know people personally building homes that are waiting on doors and windows. And if you look at the data the last couple of months, this may be the first time it is ever happened and definitely in recent years where new home sales have outpaced starts, it is usually the other way around. So the backlog is very strong, but I do think, as Peter mentioned in the opening comments, the cycle times are going to be extended because of tightness of product and labor. And it is a high-class problem to have, right? And it will extend this backlog and this favorable environment into next year, which isn't a bad thing. But I do think it is important as you think about our business and the industry in general that we will likely see cycle types extended in the coming quarters.
Trey Grooms: Sure. Makes sense. And then kind of on that, with product shortages you are calling out here, outside of lumber, there have been some pretty sizable price increases announced by some of the manufacturers across most of your product lines. You mentioned doors, but also gypsum wallboard and some of the others. So with that in mind, what kind of inflation outside of lumber are you expecting? As we go into next year, do you think it will be higher than normal given the demand and some of the product shortages out there? Or just any color on other types of inflation outside of lumber.
Peter Jackson: You are right. There have been some price increases announced. You will have to forgive me if I wait to believe the gypsum guys. The impact is certainly inflationary right now. The nature of the demand, the interruptions to the supply, the additional costs required for manufacturers to have to address the whole COVID environment. I certainly think there is an inflationary environment. The reality, though, is what we have seen in the past in many of these business lines is that the cure for high prices is high prices, and they generally will slow themselves down or they will begin to add capacity in order to normalize it. I don't think it will get carried away. But at the end of the day, as a distributor, we will pass along those price increases, and we think that makes our business healthier as we better leverage the flow-through.
Trey Grooms: Great. One last one for me is on the 25% of CapEx that you are kind of earmarking this year for expansion of the value-added capacity this year. How much should that add to your capacity going forward? I mean, how much does that $25 million or so, whatever the exact number shakes out to, what does that translate into as far as capacity? And is that 25 kind of a good bogey going forward? I know with the combined company, there is still maybe some questions. But is that a pretty decent bogey for that going forward even with the combined company with the outlook that we have for housing?
Peter Jackson: You know what, that is a great question. I think that the mix of what we are investing in at any given time, I mean we talked about Riverside and the new truss facility, those are pretty significant investments, sort of onetime. The nature of the capacity expansion related to individual machine lines and expansion of existing facilities is generally a little bit different. So it is kind of hard to give you a hard number, but it certainly has been supportive of the expansion in value add that we have talked about. That 25% in terms of a future investment, that is an interesting question because on one hand, I would say, yes, I think that is reasonable based on what we have seen over the past couple of years. But I will also admit that the demand does seem to be increasing in that value-add space, and we may decide to accelerate our investments in that area just because it is got such a great return. And in certain markets, particularly as we combine these two businesses, I think it is going to really unleash our capabilities to sell a broad swath of the market on value add, and I could see that increasing over time. A little early yet, to be honest, but I certainly I wouldn't be shy about putting more money into that, given our investment performance, our returns to date.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Keith Hughes with Truist Securities.
Keith Hughes: I had some questions on the guidance for fourth quarter, some eye-popping growth there. And given some of the variables, I'm struggling to get to the number. Is there a substantial change coming in SG&A from third to fourth? Or is there anything else you can tell me on how you are getting the number?
Peter Jackson: Well, the fourth quarter results for SG&A are always a little dynamic as we true-up all of our year-end reserves and sort of do our final cleanup. So there is always a bit of that. Yes, I mean, I think the big story is not a surprise to anybody, it is the impact of commodities and what that does. As you look at our business, 30% to 40% of our products are exposed to that commodity fluctuation. And with those currently being up basically double where they were last year, you have got a pretty significant impact to the business. And that, of course, is going to reflect in the nature of your SG&A fall through, your percentages. There is an impact, right, the nature of what we have seen in the commission rates going up and down. The leverage has certainly benefited, but you also have the required reserves in the business and the increased commission dollars associated with those sales. So a little bit of flexing rather in those numbers, but nothing material has changed or there some area of concern.
Keith Hughes: Okay. The price, 7-ish percent in the quarter, I assume it is going to be substantially higher commodity price in the fourth quarter is playing a role, is that correct?
Peter Jackson: Yes, yes.
Keith Hughes: Yes. Okay.
Peter Jackson: Double underline the yes.
Keith Hughes: Double underline the yes, there you go. Second question, looking at it a little bit longer term. You have highlighted in several answers the backlog, and we are seeing that all throughout my coverage. Do you think this is going to be a continued, as you said, high-class problem to deal with all through next year? Is that how long it is going to take to clear this up? Or is that something we could - early spring, the lead times could come down?
Chad Crow: No. I would say it should certainly carry us to midyear. You get beyond that, it gets a little fuzzy. A lot can happen, election year, et cetera. But I would say all in all, it is shaping up to be a - should be pretty good demand for 2021 first half. I wouldn't say it is in the bank, but it is looking really good. But it is just really hard to predict this business when you get beyond 6 or 8 months.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.
Steven Ramsey: On value add, maybe some questions on - are the supply chain disruptions in the industry, are they pushing more builders to use value-add products? And as you try to expand your value-add product business, are there any supply issues in getting the equipment that would maybe slow down your investment plans to grow that business and maybe slowing CapEx maybe - than you would like to grow faster?
Peter Jackson: Well, I think the opportunity for expanding value add and increasing demand in value add is usually around the labor side, right? I mean, in most cases, the supply of the product has not been the big issue. It certainly does limit their ability to sort of do it themselves when they can't get access. We have very good relationships with our vendors. We partner very closely with both the sell-through product vendors, but also the machine vendors. And being the size that we are, I think they see us as a good customer. And so we work with them to make sure our orders for the equipment that we need are in early and that we have a pipeline that we are ordering each year. So less concerned about our access. Although let's face it, all manufacturing has been pretty disrupted. So that is something that we are going to continue to stay well ahead of in order to make sure we don't have issues in that regard. But value add, it is been a problem this year. Windows and doors, in particular, have struggled. And not to throw stones at them, it is been a very difficult time. But that is certainly an area where we are hoping for a good, solid recovery because we believe in the demand story.
Steven Ramsey: Great. And a follow-up on that. In the areas of the country that are doing well, high demand, high start activity, but you don't have as much value-add exposure in those areas, do you plan in the next 6 to 12 months to greenfield or open more - or expand value-add capacity in those areas? Or does the acquisition of BMC gets you into those areas to maybe a degree that you would like?
Peter Jackson: Yes. It is a mix. Some markets, it absolutely helps us, and we are excited about what we are going to be able to do together and we will be able to add capacity. I mean the reality is if capacity in the market is constrained, it is because all of us are already constrained. So that will be a different challenge. Those markets where we don't play as much, there may be opportunities to do some of that. There is a lot to say grace over right now.
Steven Ramsey: Great. And then last quick one. Multifamily activity and timing helped Q3. Is it a benefit in Q4 and early 2021?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So multifamily, we think, will settle down a little bit. We certainly were benefited by some projects that came through. The multifamily team has done a really nice job for us. We think it will slow down a bit, but continue to be a good area for us. And we are not anticipating - I know that there have been some market forecasts out there that are pretty depressing. We don't think it will be that bad for us. But it is certainly an area of the market - as you get closer to commercial, those larger scale projects have been more impacted by COVID and the dynamics of the marketplace than some of the smaller areas where we tend to focus for multifamily. So we are feeling pretty good about it. A pretty small part of our business overall, but we think it will be a tailwind.
Operator: Our next question comes from Reuben Gardner with The Benchmark Company.
Reuben Garner: I wanted to harp on the commodity question, but I do have a clarification. I don't know if concern is the right word, but questions around how much of your EBITDA strength in the back half of this year was driven by lumber. Normally, you guys have a profit pressure during these rising price environments. Has the increase been so dramatic that even though you have got that gross profit margin drag, the net of higher commodity prices has been a positive for you on a year-over-year basis in a substantial way? And if so, could you quantify how much net benefit to EBITDA is in your fourth quarter and third quarter results?
Peter Jackson: So two halves to your question. I would say the first part to your question is around kind of the performance of the business in terms of pricing. We certainly did better than we had done in the past. I think there are a couple of main reasons for that. The first of which I have tremendous gratitude and admiration for our team in terms of being able to execute, utilizing some of the tools we have been working on, utilizing all the experience that our teams have been very, very proactive, very aggressive in terms of responding to the marketplace. Getting those prices changed quickly, managing the costs and the inbound ordering, doing it in a very disciplined and quick reacting way, I think, was the biggest impact. I will also say that we certainly benefited from the headline nature of those commodity price increases. There wasn't anyone who didn't know. There wasn't anyone who could say, well, I'm not going to buy from you because it is expensive. And I was like, okay, well, you are not buying it from anybody else either because we have got a good position. We can get you the product that you want. If you would like it, this is what it costs. So I think that those combination of factors certainly was a huge benefit and the reason why we performed as well as we did. We generally don't try and break out for you the exact impact of commodities from an EBITDA perspective. We have talked about how much we felt was impacting for the third quarter in that 7.2% range. We think the fourth quarter, just to be explicit, we will be in the - 25% to 35% of our growth will be attributed to commodity inflation in the fourth quarter. Just as a general rule of thumb, we have talked about our fall through in that 12% to 15% range being roughly true for the impact of commodities up or down as well. So if you want to use some rough numbers, that is a good way to think about it, although I will tell you the exact math is a bit more painful.
Chad Crow: Yes. Just to clarify, the 25% to 35% is Q4 over Q4 sales growth we expect to come from commodity inflation. It is a big number.
Reuben Garner: Got it. yes. Okay. Yes, that was very helpful. And then shifting gears away from commodities, I'm sure you are tired of hearing about it, I am, too. Next year, something that is been a drag for the whole industry over the last several years has been the size of homes shrinking. I think it is been kind of a low single-digit volume drag for everybody, and I think you guys have seen that as well. Are you seeing or hearing an opportunity for things to go the other way? How big of an opportunity from a volume benefit for your products do you think you could get out of out of some of the bigger - the return of the bigger luxury houses in some of the suburban markets?
Chad Crow: Well, a couple of things. Yes, I do think homes have gotten smaller. It feels like maybe that is starting to bottom out now. But I don't worry about that a whole lot. I have said many times over the years, the only way you get back to a normal building environment of 1 million, 1.1 million single-family houses is you have got to have that mix of smaller homes. And that is what we have been missing really since this recovery started. And so to us, it is a good thing. It gets you to that higher flow through. It gets you to that throughput on the homes coming through the system. And yes, there is a higher mix of smaller ones. But again, the only way you get to those historical average is to have that proper balance, and we have just been missing that.
Peter Jackson: I have read the articles that people are now nesting and wanting a bigger home after being trapped. And I think we will have to see. I think there is maybe hope that things level out. I'm not sure it turns into a tailwind because of what Chad was talking about. We need those smaller homes, and we will get them. I think that expansion of that starter and move-up home part of the industry is great news, long overdue.
Reuben Garner: Got it. Congrats on the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seldon Clarke with Deutsche Bank.
Seldon Clarke: So you saw 7% organic sales growth in the third quarter and call it, 9% to 10% growth, including M&A. But total SG&A was only up about 3%, and it looks like it is going to be down in the fourth quarter just based on your guidance. I know you talked about some true-up there stating that it is not the best way to think about it. But moving forward, if you can continue to generate the sort of mid- to high single-digit organic growth rate, ignoring commodities for a second, how should we think about the relationship in that scenario between SG&A and volume growth?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So we have historically talked about SG&A being about 70% variable, about 30% fixed. Now the unique dynamic that you alluded to is this idea, that is based on real volume and not the sort of vagarities of commodities, if you will. So that is the only adjustment I would advise you to make sure you are keeping track of. But yes, we certainly have seen great leverage as a result of the expansion of commodities as well as great leverage off of the core, the core organic growth.
Chad Crow: And I think you commented that SG&A was going to be down in the fourth quarter, and I don't think that is correct. I think when you layer in the sales growth, the top line growth, including the inflation, you will see that it is probably not.
Seldon Clarke: Okay. That is helpful. Yes, I think I was understanding the commodity impact. And then kind of a just higher-level question, but Chad, you talked about going into some of your more local markets and hosting these town halls. And you mentioned just briefly that you were excited about some of the capabilities and complementary aspects of the merger. So could you just give us a little bit more color on maybe what you learned throughout this process? And whether you are thinking about the potential top line synergies any differently now that you are kind of a couple more months into the process and you have had these experiences meeting with some of the local teams and things like that?
Chad Crow: Sure. Yes. What was really good to see is as you go into some of these and we were visiting primarily the markets where we overlap and mainly major markets. But really good to see the geographic footprint. So just top of mind there, you can see the potential in logistics savings, where our footprint might be more focused on the South end of town and their footprint might be more focused on the North end. It certainly is going to give us some ways to optimize our delivery. From a product selection standpoint, we would see a facility where they are very big. They have a very big ready-frame operation, for example, and we are very big in components. And they may also have a large millwork facility. And so when you look at in these major markets where we overlap, just the completeness of the product and service offering we can offer our customers and then how much better we will be positioned from a geographic standpoint to deliver it, that is what you are after, right. You want to be able to serve your customers with the full breadth of offerings, but also in the most efficient way you can. And so we saw a lot of examples of that. And then not to mention just the enthusiasm. And in many cases, there was almost a little mini family reunions going on when we saw some people that we have traded employees over the years. And they have got a lot of talented people, we have got talented people. And it is really great to think about really we will be the A team when we put these two companies together.
Seldon Clarke: Got it. And in that example, where you have got a facility in the North end and they have one in the South that have slightly different product categories, historically, has that changed the market share or pricing dynamics in those sort of specific areas?
Chad Crow: Well, if you are a builder, clearly, you typically are going to have - want to have more than one supplier, right, just to make sure you are keeping everyone honest. But the advantage there is by offering that full breadth of products - so builders - we want to position the company where we can make the builders' life as easy as possible and make it easier to do business with us than any of our competitors. And so the more we can offer that as I said, that broad expansion of products and services, the more likely they are going to want to do business with us. Will that tend to lead to additional share of wallet? Yes, it should. Price? Maybe. There is still going to be other competitors in the market. They are still going to keep you honest. But it is more about being that go-to supplier for the builder and making their life as easy as possible and easy to do business with us versus any of our competitors. That is what you are after, and that is why these two businesses will complement each other so much and help us achieve that in a lot of these overlap markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG.
Ryan Gilbert: Just to ask the 2021 EBITDA commodity price impact, maybe a different way. Looking back to the last period of rapid commodity price inflation and then subsequent deflation in 2018, 2019, I thought what was interesting about 2019 is that even though you experienced a commodity price headwind on revenue, you were still able to grow adjusted EBITDA throughout the year. So looking at third quarter and fourth quarter gross margins, even less impact from commodity prices than what you experienced in 2018. Just wondering what your confidence level is that you can continue to grow adjusted EBITDA if you know this commodity price tailwind turns into a headwind in the quarters coming.
Peter Jackson: Yes. I mean it is a great question. I think that each cycle is a bit different. The extreme nature of this one has certainly impacted the industry differently. We are going to be in a different demand profile, I would say, going into next year. So that could potentially change things as well. I think we have got to wait and see how it plays out. I do feel really good about the underlying core though, right. Our ability to manage pricing, our ability to get good leverage off of the business, our ability to continue to grow the underlying operations in the strong demand environment and the movement toward value add, I think are all very positive tailwinds or data points for that discussion. But we just have to wait and see.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay. Got it. And then second question on structural components. I mean we have heard from you and from many homebuilders that cycle times are extending. It seems like builders should be looking for opportunities to improve their cycle times or their productivity, and it seems like, at least in theory, structural component should offer that. So I'm wondering if your builder customers are more - or if you are getting more inbounds from homebuilders about using structural components to kind of speed up the framing process or if homebuilders are more receptive to your sales teams who are selling structural components.
Chad Crow: Yes. As we said all along, shortages in labor create the perfect environment to drive builders who aren't currently using components to consider them, and that is certainly in an environment we are still in. And combine that with just the overall demand, the existing customers that are using components and just the incremental number of homes, they are wanting us to run through our component plants. As Peter said earlier, the backlogs are very strong right now. So it should be a very value-add-conducive environment for the next few quarters.
Ryan Gilbert: And do you think that the recent surge in demand and extension of cycle line has had some noticeable impact in builder demand for structural components?
Chad Crow: Yes. I wouldn't say it is off the charts. As you can imagine, we have got customers that have traditionally used components, and they are keeping us very busy right now with the increase in starts that we have seen in recent months. But yes, certainly, there is been an uptick in incoming inquiries and demand. And as I said, I don't see the labor issue getting better anytime soon, especially with the strong surge in starts. So as I said, I think that is going to continue to be a pretty favorable environment for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.
Kurt Yinger: I just want to start off. I mean, with two pretty remarkable periods of volatility in commodities over the last three years, is there anything internally or that your customers are pushing to do to maybe change some of the backward-looking price locks? And I realize it is not completely standardized, but is there anything creative or something that people are trying to do to maybe smooth it out a bit?
Peter Jackson: Well, there is certainly been a lot of conversation about it, no question. I think there are some ebbs and flows and some customers have gone away from the price locks or tried to. I think some of us in the industry in the distribution space have looked for ways to create a bit more stability in terms of the way we buy, whether it be directly from the mills or contractual relationships. Unfortunately, I'm not sure the options markets are really all that helpful just based on the way that they work right now. So there have even been discussions about how that might change in the future. I'm optimistic that in our new structure as the combined entity with BMC, that might be something we could even continue to follow down that path. Our ability to be a positive influence and a stabilizing influence in this industry, I think, is enhanced with our scale and with our ability to act in a coordinated way. So we will absolutely continue to look at that. And certainly, some interesting models based on some folks have done out there.
Kurt Yinger: Okay. Okay. That is interesting. And just my second one. An earlier question touched on the $750 million EBITDA target. Could you just remind us within your own control as far as the operational excellent targets, kind of where you stand as far as putting those in place and the biggest buckets of opportunity that remain?
Peter Jackson: Sure. Yes. I mean we had talked about a roughly $65 million target out there for ourselves. I think we are probably about halfway based on what we talked through up until prior year. Continuing to make progress in that space. We certainly see the best opportunities, the biggest opportunities for ourselves in a couple of key areas. I think that, that pricing management and pricing discipline, sort of taking the inconsistencies and inefficiencies out of our process is still being a potential forward-looking benefit for our business. Excited to see what we can do partnered together with BMC in that way as well. And then I think our ability to continue to enhance our internal operations using digital tools, processes, whether that be as we interact with our customers, but even back office. We certainly still see tremendous value going forward, leveraging best practices, leveraging technology and then a combination of those two things, we think will be really impactful. So certainly feel very good about our ability to deliver and go beyond those targets we would issued back in 2018. So certainly expecting that to be an important part of the way the business is going to run post merger as well.
Operator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to now turn the conference back to Mr. Chad Crow for any closing remarks.
Chad Crow: Thank you once again for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you on our future results and the progress on our merger with BMC. If you have any follow-up questions, don't hesitate to reach out to Binit or peter. Have a good day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Builders FirstSource’s Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Today’s call is being recorded and will be available at www.bldr.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Binit Sanghvi, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Binit Sanghvi: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call today are Chad Crow, Chief Executive Officer; and Peter Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. A copy of the slide presentation referenced on this call is available on the Investor Relations section of the Builders FirstSource website at bldr.com. Before we begin, let me note that during the course of this conference call, we may make statements concerning the company’s future prospects, financial results, business strategies and industry trends. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Please refer to our most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other reports filed with the SEC for more information on those risks. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. The company will discuss adjusted results on this call. We have provided reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents in our earnings press release and detailed explanations of non-GAAP financial measures in our Form 8-K filed yesterday, both of which are available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Chad Crow.
Chad Crow: Thank you, Binit. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We are incredibly proud of our team’s hardwork and dedication to excellence over the past several months. A significant portion of our senior leadership as well as our regional and local managers have been with us for well over a decade, giving us a collective understanding of how to effectively manage during crisis. Last quarter, we outlined our preparedness to address the unprecedented environment from a safety, operational and financial perspective. Our team rose to the occasion and delivered strong results all around. We proactively managed our business at the local level to quickly rightsize our operations where necessary to ensure that we continue to safely and effectively deliver critical products and services to our customers, all the while adjusting to a ever changing market landscape and keeping as many of our team members as possible working through the pandemic. Our focus execution allowed us to take advantage of strong housing fundamentals to produce the highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA in our history. Order volumes recovered as we moved through the quarter and we are pleased we were able to bring back almost all of our furloughed employees. Many states in the Northeast, Northwest and Midwest, initially placed restrictions on homebuilding. Those limitations have now been lifted, so we are back to work in all of our locations around the country. The homebuilding markets have been resilient, improving housing starts, record low mortgage rates, and the shift towards suburban living are all positive fundamentals that continue to support demand for our products and services. In June, we experienced a sharp sequential rebound in sales, and we were appropriately resourced to capture that demand. The dramatic improvement as we ended the quarter gives us momentum as we enter the second half of the year. We acknowledge macroeconomic uncertainties remain with high unemployment, and COVID hotspots slowing the recovery in certain regions. However, as we look across our national footprint, we believe we are exceptionally well situated to take advantage of the homebuilding tailwinds, that continued into July. We remain in our ability to outperform within our industry, through organic and inorganic growth opportunities that enhance our ability to partner with our customers. We have the balance sheet to support our growth ambitions ending the quarter with total liquidity of 1.2 billion, up to 200 million since our last update in May. Our strong cash flow continued to strengthen our balance sheet, at the same time provide dry powder for future M&A. We were especially pleased to surpass the low end of our long term targeted ratio of net financial debt to adjusted EBITDA up of 2.5 times achieving 2.3 times as of the end of the quarter. Moving on to our year-to-date update on slide four. It is important to note that we have been able to demonstrate the particular strengths of our strategy, team and platform during this period of fluctuating demand. Our ability to deliver record adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2020 is a direct result of our national footprint, unmatched scale and manufacturing capability and exceptional sales force. The breadth of our product portfolio also supported higher demand in all three of our end markets. For the first six months of the year, sales volume grew by nearly 4%, of which approximately 3% was from our five tuck-in acquisitions completed over the past year. Value-added product categories increased in sales volume by an estimated 4% in the first six months, as we continue to realize the benefits from our years of strategic investment. Commodity inflation and one additional selling day each contributed approximately 1% of sales, which led to an increase in reported net sales of 6%. Despite the market volatility we grew adjusted EBITDA by 5% compared to the same year-to-date period last year. Thanks again to our team's disciplined execution and quick reaction to the dynamic local market conditions. Our operational excellence initiatives remain on track. As we mentioned on previous calls, these best practices are being implemented throughout the organization and are making our company more agile and easier to do business with. Key initiatives in process include investments in distribution and logistics software, pricing and margin management tools, back office process efficiencies, and Information System enhancements. The rollout of our pricing optimization has been particularly successful now covering 15 of our major markets. Where implemented, we have provided our associates with faster and more accurate pricing information, along with customized marketing tools and analytics, enabling us to execute our strategy on a local level. Our delivery optimization system covers approximately 70% of our sales and has measurably improved our distribution network in terms of speed, uptime and reliability. Our innovative customer portal, My BFS Builder is designed to complement our first class face-to-face customer service and continues to see higher adoption rates. Our expanding network of high margin value added offsite component manufacturing facilities remain core to our strategy. We intend to use a portion of our cash flow to continue investing in value added growth capacity through both organic and acquisition opportunities. This includes our investment plans related to Greenfield facilities, new trust lines and existing plants, store facility expansions and machinery and systems and dozens of our value-added operations, such as our newly commissioned state of-the-art truss plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Through consistent execution of our long range strategic plan, we will continue to add our differentiated offering of industry leading value added capacity that enhanced our geographic footprint, technological capabilities and integrated partnerships with our customers. Our customers value our commitment to high caliber service and in particular, our ability to continually invest in service capabilities throughout the cycle, which we believe is a differentiator for Builders FirstSource. During the first half of the year, we tightened cash discipline to enhance our financial flexibility and liquidity. In the second half, we are focused on disciplined cash deployment to advance our growth strategy with a focus on value-added acquisitions that further strengthens our position within the industry. Before I turn the call over to Peter, I wanted to take a moment and reflect on the fact that today marks the five-year anniversary of our ProBuild. When I think back on what we have accomplished and the great company we've become as a result of that acquisition there is much to be proud of. But I almost hate even using the word acquisition, because we accomplished, what we accomplished was only possible because thousands of our team members from both companies chose to forget which jersey they were wearing prior to July 31 2015, rolled up their sleeves and said, let's get this thing done. And we did. I think what I am most proud of, is the fact that we did what we said we were going to do from the start. If you recall, we were over six times levered when the deal closed, and a lot of people thought we were crazy, and that we would never survive. From the start, we said our top priorities were to delever, integrate and achieve our synergy targets. And we did plain and simple. So to all our team members, thank you for what we accomplished over the past five years. And to all those who have invested in us five years ago to make the transaction possible, thank you as well. Now, time for reflection is over. Everyone back to work. All yours Peter.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by also recognizing our team's work to quickly adjust cost, adapt to local market conditions and executed actively to deliver a record quarter. I will quickly review our second quarter results, and then provide you an overview of how we intend to manage going forward. We had $1.9 billion in net sales in the second quarter with core organic sales declining 2.1%. Core organic excludes the acquisitions and commodity impacts from that sale to give an indication of the underlying performance of the business. As previously disclosed, during the month of April, we experienced a core organic sales decline in the high single-digit percent range. However, as the quarter progressed order activity showed a smaller drop and a stronger recovery than we initially expected. In June, core organic growth rebounded up low single-digits, reflecting what we believe to be a release in pent up demand. For the quarter, our five tuck-in acquisitions completed over the past year added 2.5% to net sale. Commodity price inflation added another 1.8%. As a result, net sales in total increased by 2.2%. Demand for our value added product categories continued to outperform within our respective markets. Although higher demand in most parts of the country was disproportionately offset by the impact of COVID-19 in the hardest hit areas. Our gross margin percentage was 26.6%, just over the high end of our previously communicated expectation of 26% to 26.5%, due to the disciplined execution and rapid adjustments by our team as the quarter progressed. The 60 basis point decline compared to the prior year period was a result of the expected normalization we had discussed in our calls, mainly in our lumber and lumber sheet goods products categories. Since May, we have experienced sharp commodity inflation in lumber and panel costs. So please keep in mind the mechanics of our margins as we have discussed on prior calls. Commodity cost inflation causes short term gross margin percentage headwinds, and prices spike relative to our short term pricing commitments that we provide customers. It usually takes one to two quarters for the margins to normalize at the new prices. As a result of the speed and magnitude of this temporary headwinds, we expect our gross margin percentage to be pressured in the third quarter before recovering to more normalized levels over the typical one to two quarter lag. Ultimately, we will benefit from higher gross margin dollars generated from the inflationary impact on that sale. Interest expense decreased by $2.6 million to $26.8 million compared to the same period last year. Excluding the net impact of one-time items related to debt instruments and extinguishment in the prior year period, Interest expense increased by $1.7 million due to a higher outstanding debt balance as we proactively increased our liquidity and financial flexibility in light of COVID uncertainty. Second quarter EBITDA increased $16.3 million from a year ago to $161.9 million, and 11% improvement. As Chad mentioned, this is the highest quarterly EBITDA in our history, driven by our cost management measures both at the corporate and local levels, combined with the improving demand through the quarter. The reduction in variable expenses related to compensation, travel and entertainment and fuel costs contributed to an 8.3% EBITDA margin compared to a 7.1% margin in the prior year period. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $79.2 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, compared with $71.4 million, or $0.63 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase of $5.1 million share was primarily driven by the improved operating results, partially offset by higher adjusted interest expense. On slide six, I would like to highlight the strength of our business, driven this quarter by the focused execution of our team, allowing us to partner with customers to supply critical products and services as demand recovered. Economic slowdowns mainly in the northeast, Northwest, Midwest and Florida significantly impacted demand across our product categories, partially offset by growth in the remainder of our footprint. This was especially true on our manufactured product category, which was disproportionately impacted by the geographies for most by the pandemic. Excluding those impacted regions, our manufactured products sales increased in the quarter. Overall value added for organic sales declined by approximately 3% offset by the contribution of our strategic acquisition. We are committed to continuing the expansion of our network of manufacturing components facility strategically located across the country. As Chad mentioned, we are pleased to have added a state-of-the art manufacturing facility in Spartanburg South Carolina during the quarter, extending our industry leading position to 65 manufacturing facilities. We expect that approximately 25% of our total 2020 capital expenditures will be invested in our value-add growth initiatives and expansion of our production capacity. Our second quarter core organic sales declined by an estimated 4% in the single-family new construction end market compared to a decrease of 13% in overall U.S. single-family starts. Although we performed better than expected in the majority of our market, the growth was limited by the impact of COVID in certain parts of the country. Core organic growth in the R&R and other end market grew 4% as we saw relative strength in the western part of the country and began to lap the unfavorable tariff impact in the upper Midwest in the prior year period. Multifamily core organic declined by 2%, largely due to the timing of some large projects impacted by the shutdown. Turning to our financial flexibility on page eight, a key factor driving our value creation in recent years has been our strong cash generation. During the first half of 2020, we produced free cash flow of approximately $115 million. The aggressive actions we discussed last quarter to preserve cash, including an initial reduction in discretionary CapEx spending and increased vigilance around working capital or key drivers in our year-to-date performance. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow continued to represent more than 90% of adjusted EBITDA. It just had a clear impact on net leverage, which improved by about half a churn versus prior year to 2.3 times representing it to lowest levels since the 2015 ProBuild acquisition. Since our last call, our liquidity improved by an additional $200 million to $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting our positive free cash flow. At the onset of the pandemic in April, our primary objective was to preserve cash. With better clarity around the market, and without ample liquidity, we are resuming our investment in capital priorities, including acquisitions, and growth CapEx primarily focused on value-added growth initiatives. Our deal pipeline remains robust and we are focused on investing for the long term. Turning to our outlet on slide nine, our first half results reflect our experience managing through cycles and the resilience of our business to generate growth. Our first half results also demonstrate a positive overall homebuilding environment, supported by a positive tailwind and rising demand across our diverse national footprint, which continued into July. Based on this backdrop, we are introducing an outlook for the third quarter. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be flat year-over-year at approximately $160 million. We anticipate core organic sales growth to be in the mid-single digit range year-over-year for the third quarter. New housing demand has proven to be resilient in nearly all localities where we operate, which provides the basis for our outlook. Amid all of the macro uncertainties, we are guiding to a balanced growth assumption while positioning our business to take advantage of potential upside opportunities. Keep in mind, our core organic growth outlook reflects our core sales performance and excludes the sales contribution from acquisitions as well as specific commodity inflation in the coming quarters. Over the past few months, we have been managing the rapid commodity inflation incurring in our industry. As I mentioned earlier, we expect our third quarter gross margin percentages to be below our normalized levels due to that inflation. We anticipate our gross margin percentage to be in the low 24% range for the third quarter compared to our normalized levels of over 26% when commodities are at more stable prices. This margin decline is a temporary headwind as we have demonstrated in the past. We will see a quarter or two of margin pressure during the inflationary period along with increasing gross margin dollars. I'll note that we experienced a similar pressure on gross margins in mid-2018 when inflation spiked. As the inflation subsided, we recovered that margin with above normal margins during the deflationary period. Back since the beginning of 2018, through the second quarter of 2020, our gross margins tend to average approximately 26%, which is in line with our normalised level and is consistent with how we manage our business through commodity swing. Since 2018, we have generated nearly $1 billion of operating cash flow, and we fully expect to build upon that cash generation through year end 2020. We continue to expect our cash interest will be in the $110 million to $115 million range for the full year of 2020. With our growth projects underway again, we now expect capital expenditures to be in the $100 million to $110 million range for the full year. Looking beyond 2020, the structural advantages of our business remain intact. We delivered solutions that make our customers more productive and efficient. We have deeper and more integrated relationships with our customers than ever before. We are much more than a supplier of commodity lumber. We are a highly valued partner to many very sophisticated builders, delivering labor savings and just in time delivery of critical building materials, helping them maintain a streamlined supply chain. These higher margin value-added offerings represent the largest portion of our business and the focus of our growth. With our solid financial position, we believe, we are uniquely positioned to accelerate our profitable growth through underlying market expansion, supplemented by targeted acquisitions, and operational excellence initiatives to accomplish our long term objectives and capture underlying market growth. We therefore affirm our previously communicated long range plan targets, which remain on track to be achieved by 2022. We have full confidence in our business to be the supplier of choice for building materials and value added products in the months and years to come. Our strong financial position, coast-to-coast geographically diversified product offerings, national manufacturing capabilities and strong partnerships with customers are unmatched competitive advantages in any market environment. I would especially like to thank our Builders FirstSource team for their dedication to our company, our customers and our communities. Operator, we can now open up the call for Q&A
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We can now go to our first question, that comes from Matthew Bouley of Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: Morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the results. Start off with a question on the guide for Q3. You're saying, I guess core organic growth in the mid-single digit range and I think I mentioned Peter, that June was up low single digit, just any color I got from how July organic is trended, and sort of just what are the underlying housing start expectations that are that are informing that guide?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I’m start off and let Chad finish up. The performance in June, July is obviously not done yet. But looking like it'll be right in that same range maybe a little bit better. We had talked earlier about the potential for an air pocket, wondering what the recovery might look like if there were some pent up demand from the sort of timeframe when everything was pretty much shut down. Things have been not telling you anything you don't already know, surprisingly resilient. And we're very pleased with sort of the overall sustainability of the trend that things have come back. And as you've heard, as we have heard, from many of the builders around the country, there is a tremendous amount of optimism. There's no strength in that homebuilding market. So that's really the rationale that we're giving ourselves for that mid-single digits third quarter growth number in that single family space. It's still, a little bit open, in terms of where it will land could be better. As always, there's enough volatility in COVID land where it could be worse, but we were feeling pretty good about it on balance and the order rates to what we're seeing.
Chad Crow: Yes, and I'll just add. You've seen the commentary from the builders and in recent weeks, very, very positive. The traffic is up, new orders are up. Just a little bit surprisingly, it's been so resilient, and there still seems to be a lot of tailwind. Rates are low. I think with everything going on in our country right now, people desire more space. In many cases commutes are becoming less of a factor for people, which allows them to move further from downtown areas. I think there's probably a lot of people with aging parents looking to create space for them, as opposed to, looking to put them in long term care facilities. So there's just a lot of tailwind right now, people aren't traveling as much. A lot of -- I think they've given more thought to their living condition with the dynamic that are going on right now. So as Peter said, with any guide or forecast, there's potential for upside or downside we always try to be pretty measured about our guidance and leave ourselves a little legroom and then this quarter is no different and we're feeling really good about how things are shaping up right now.
Matthew Bouley: Perfect. Thank you for that. And then I guess on the gross margin side, you can clearly see the progress over the years. The Q3 guide it's better than where margins bottomed in the second quarter of 2018 And you mentioned this one to two quarter lag, back to normalization. And so my question is, with all the progress you've made, is there any reason that you think that, the pace of margin recovery might not be any might not be faster than what we saw at that time? Or should we think that hey, look, it is what it is, lumbers inflating and let's not get too ahead of ourselves on this. So, really just asking about how we should think about that pace of normalization? Thanks, guys.
Chad Crow: Well, I'll start out Peter can add a few lines but. We've seen this movie before, right? 2018 was one of the most recent example. We get compressed for a period of time and then when things flatten out or we start to see deflation, we get paid back, and then so Q3 is going to be a quarter of margin compression, but with the tailwinds we are seeing in housing and, and the higher prices once we get our pricing got up, it could set up to be some really nice quarter just like we saw it.
Peter Jackson: And we're certainly pushing ourselves to get better and better about managing price and doing so efficiently as possible quite ready to sign up for faster than our one two quarters. So I think that's probably the right way to think about it for now. But certainly internally, that's our goal for ourself.
Matthew Bouley: Okay, thank you both.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.
Mike Dahl: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Echo the commentary around best results here in a challenging time. The first question I had is on manufactured products, I think, Peter, you made a comment about how some of the impact on the optics around growth there where we're potentially mixed related, but I think if we if we look at that – I mean we’re not off on acquisition contribution. I think the volume and manufactured products may have been down high single digits ish, which would have lagged the rest of the business. So good. Just want to clarify that. And then if you could provide some additional color on those mix impacts, but also just then on the relative growth trends you've seen over the course of June and July in manufactured products?
Peter Jackson: Yes, absolutely. You heard it right, that the nature of the decline in manufactured products is sort of that, mid-single digit in that organic components. So yes, we did see a decline. The biggest reason for that and we dug into the numbers was around the fact that the other was a higher amount of, on a mixed basis, a higher mix of that manufactured product in the markets where we got hit the hardest. So was unfortunate it's I think, representative of opportunity delays in front of us as those markets were covered. But, an area like, the Northwest, specific northwest of Florida for example, that's a manufactured products business is a great business for us. We've great partnerships. We've sort of proven the value proposition, and it's a higher percent -- a much higher percentage of the mix in those markets. So then when we work hard in those markets, disproportionately, that's why it shows up in that organic number. But still feel very good about the business. It's not a structural issue, it continues to grow. In other parts of the country, it continues to be just as successful or more so in every market where we sell it versus the core and overall business.
Chad Crow: Yes, and I'll just add. I agree with what Peter said, part of it was geographical We were shut down in areas where we have a very strong component presence. But you've also got to consider when builders hit the brakes? Like homes that were already under construction, we kept shipping to new home started, dropped and the first thing we lose there is the component business, right. So that's part of it as well. I'll tell you that moving into the pandemic, so around the first week of March, to the depths of the pandemic, as far as new truck orders coming in, we dropped over 50%. Our orders coming into the truss plants now are back to a level equivalent to where they were at the beginning of March before the pandemic, and a solid double digit higher than where they were a year ago. So I have -- I have zero concerns about our components.
Mike Dahl: That's great to hear. Thanks for that color. My second question is really around the reinstated long term guidance, and it's nice to see that reinstated. On the other hand, I think prior on admission, there's still some uncertainty there. So the question is really if we look at the two key results through Q2 guide, it seems like you're tracking towards like 525 to 550 million in EBITDA this year. And that still takes 40% plus growth over the next two years to get that to get that long term EBITDA goal of 750. So has your high level framework changed at all around kind of based business? What kind of market growth was internal initiatives and then what component would potentially be M&A included in that?
Peter Jackson: First of all, exciting. And then I’m looking forward to it, and now it's fundamental structure of what we thought about earlier this year is not changed. We are -- when we go back there – and I know as you have not talked about this in the past, when we're going through and looking at the variety of models that we pull together to look at this business over time. We certainly have a number of different levers that we can pull, in addition to what I would describe as sort of a core underlying mark. Right. Of course, we're going to be heavily influenced by single family. Of course, we're going to be impacted by a commodity, sort of core to who we are. But we also have the ability to really control our own fate in a lot of ways. Investments that we're making in the core business that’s value-add strategy that we've been executing on has been very effective. Now with our being even below our targeted leverage ratio, we have tremendous liquidity and terms of this opportunity to go after what we believe to be a very, very healthy pipe of M&A opportunities. And operational excellence continues to perform. We continue to make progress. We continue to see an operation that knows how to and wants to get better and to have better results each quarter. So, really, while we were -- I think, prudently conservative by pulling the 2020 guidance last quarter as we run our numbers and looked at where we're at and where we can be, what things are sort of coming together for us. We feel very good about 2022. We think that is just the area is absolutely attainable and we have line of sight to how we're going to get there. And as I mentioned, it doesn't -- everything doesn't have to work together perfectly for us to hit that number. We have to continue working and doing what we're good at.
Mike Dahl: That's great. Thank you.
Chad Crow: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes of SunTrust. Keith, perhaps you're on mute.
Keith Hughes: Yes. Can you hear me now? Sorry, I had to connection problem.
Operator: Yes. Please go ahead .
Keith Hughes: Okay, sorry. Miss you again. On acquisitions, you talk about for some time doing tuck-ins, if you could talk about what regions, what products, things of that nature, you would look to do acquisitions? And what you, at this point in cycle, be open to something larger than a tuck-ins?
Chad Crow: We're always open to that. In many ways, one large one can be easier than 20 or 30. small ones, and we've seen both clearly. But yes, that's certainly always something we're open to. At this point in the cycle we do have a lot of liquidity. It may be using more equity at this point in the cycle would be proven. But sure, that's something we've always been open to.
Keith Hughes: Second question, on these smaller tuck-ins. Is there a region that you try [Indiscernible]?
Chad Crow: You sort of broke up there for a second, Keith. It sounds like you were asking what regions might we think about tuck-ins for?
Keith Hughes: Yes, what regions. That's correct.
Chad Crow: Well, you can look at the map and see whether there's holes in our footprint. So, part of our motivation is regional. But I think just as importantly as product mix. We're much more inclined to go after the company with a high mix of value add. So it's kind of a combination of those two factors. In general, we're under penetrated in my view in the western part of the country versus the east. But as I said, value add is just as critical on my mind.
Keith Hughes: Okay. Thank you.
Chad Crow: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc.
Trey Grooms: Hey, good morning.
Chad Crow: Good morning, Trey.
Trey Grooms: So geographically, just kind of wondering, I think that definitely held in better clearly. During the earlier days of the pandemic, there was things vary pretty widely, as you mentioned. And your value added products, it sounds like, when you do see some geographic changes in demand that can have an impact there just giving your exposure. So I guess, my question is, can you touch on kind of the geographic areas now that things are starting to kind of move again. Where you're seeing relative strength or weakness now and geographically and what that means for that value-added mix?
Peter Jackson: Sure. Yes. So, just to recap what we were saying in the script, right, the Northeast, obviously, kind of the upper Midwest, the Michigan area, in particular, the Pacific Northwest and then later on as we got past the initial impact, we also saw slowdown in Florida. Those were all I would say the areas that were highlighted and I think truly saw the biggest impact for us as a company. When it comes to recovery, I would say, in Pacific Northwest has bounce back very quickly. I would say, the Michigan and upper Midwest area has definitely stabilized and started to march back. Northeast is still suffering quite a bit. I mean, there's no way around it. They continue to have very strict controls. I think the population in general has suffered more and has states slower. So that recovery is underway, but certainly not back to normal levels up there yet. In Florida, I think they're still perhaps in the middle of some of the uncertainty, given the exposure to tourism, they've certainly seen a lot of concern, a lot of the declines for their core businesses. And so they are still, again, they're on the road back, but haven't been far to get go. When looking at the relative exposure in those areas for manufactured products, obviously, Florida is important to us. But so it's the Northeast. There are some corridors of real good strength there for us. So it will be a recovery that you'll see and we're confident in that sort of growth over time in the manufactured products. But those couple of markets will be a more of a progression back to normal rather than a quick snap back. But I think it's important to know that, if you can look at the overall value-added products. If you exclude those target regions, we were up low single digit. So the rest of the country is still even with the suppressed starts numbers and some of the concerns still growing as we would expect it to be in overtime.
Trey Grooms: Got it. All right. Thanks for all the color. Appreciate it. And I guess as a follow up. So on the SG&A line, it was lower as a percent of sales then what we would have thought, especially given that strong top line you guys put up and just everything that we've done. But we'd be kind of understand some of the tailwinds may abate. But with that said, I know, you guys have a culture of focusing on lower cost and running a tight ship. So I guess, is there any levers that you guys had pulled up in SG&A through this pandemic, and over the last several months that you could continue to see or continue to benefit from in the coming quarters?
Peter Jackson: I'm glad you highlight that, Trey. I would say this is really just a testament to the discipline that our teams live and breathe each day. We went out with some messaging, sort of just some reminders and some playbooks to folks. When we saw that sort of a concern in the shutdown setting, just coaching people on how to manage through it, right, and what our team just did a great job resizing the business when it was appropriate, making sure that we were cutting costs, being disciplined. And obviously, some of the things we did to give ourselves a little extra flexibility more broadly as a company we talked about that, delaying wages, salary cuts for executives. Sorry, delaying wage increases and salary cuts for executives. Those were things that we thought were necessary just to give ourselves that flexibility. Clearly we did very, very well as we went through that sort of pause period. Since then, with the recovery that we've seen, we've reinstituted, the merit increases, we restored all those cuts that we made. And the nature of the resizing of the business is very specific to the locations. So we try to retain the staffing, making sure we weren't hurting ourselves strategically. Our ability to compete, our ability to win, we didn't want to undermine that by being too aggressive, because we don't believe that we've allowed ourselves to get fat in these markets. There wasn't a ton of a cut. So what you saw at the end of the day was I think some real flexibility in the core around comm that some of that will come back, obviously in terms of expenses. You saw about a third of our overall benefit being TBD. Now that ones bit more time to play out. The question remains, will it ever get back to normal? Will we ever travel like we used to? TBD, but certainly that we anticipate will come back to some degree over time. Then third, that was really the fuel expense. And obviously, there's been some volatility in the cost of fuel. So that will normalize to wherever it's going to normalize to over time, maybe not right away on that one either. But we didn't go back through this organization and make any real structural changes or massive cuts. Our focus was on making sure we were responding and being ready to move forward. At this point that seems things played out pretty well.
Trey Grooms: Great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. And best of luck.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Trey.
Operator: Our next question comes from Seldon Clarke of Deutsche Bank.
Seldon Clarke: Hey, good morning. Thanks. Can you give us some lineups what your longer term guidance assumes in terms of starts? Understand there -- you mentioned there are numbers of way you can get there. But just from a high level, can you give us some more detail around what type of support you will need from the macro?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So, when we first brought out that $750 million EBITDA target we were referring to before. We were pretty explicit about putting a $1.1 million single family start number on there. However, earlier this year, we've come back and said, we have enough levers where we think we can get to that number even with just a healthy single family starts environment. It doesn't have to get to that million one number. So way we think about it is really those opportunities to control our own fate will be very, very impactful and perhaps as much as what we anticipate the continued recovery and starts today. So we talked about that, obviously, the M&A opportunities, what we are committed to staying within our stated range. We've got quite a bit of room there, where we have opportunities to grow our value-added with both greenfield and capacity work. Certainly that's a strong growth opportunity for us. And the operational excellence initiatives we've talked about right, whether it would be getting better and more disciplined. The pricing getting better and more effective in our distribution and logistics management, or even just opportunities to reduce costs and become more efficient in the back office. We think there are certainly ways that it can get us to that. We're not 100% dependent on that single family starts.
Seldon Clarke: Okay. So on the M&A side, are you seeing -- have you've identified more opportunities? Are you seeing an increased willingness or valuations that come down. What's really driving the sort of increased optimism there?
Chad Crow: Well, the pipeline is full. It's been pretty full for the last few quarters. Obviously, there was a bit of a pause and in what type of diligence work we were doing, when things were shut down. But we brought that back up. There's just a lot of good businesses out there right now. And we clearly have a strong balance sheet to go after them. And so that's why we've got -- we are a little more optimistic. Now we've got a more optimistic tone on what we think we'll be able to do in the coming years from an acquisition standpoint.
Seldon Clarke: Anyway, you could just expand a little bit on what's driving that optimism?
Peter Jackson: So I guess, I'll give you an example without naming any names, where you are -- our internal model for valuations that we've been using and refining over the years certainly requires us to understand our weighted average cost of capital and make sure that the returns that we're seeing are making sense, but even risk we're taking in one of those deals. And what we're experiencing right now is that we are consistently bringing, seeing deals brought to pass by our regional management teams that look at really nice businesses that we think would be a great fit for us around the country. They're tuck-ins, right? So you may not be very excited about it at the top level, but we're seeing an accumulation of these deals and when we put them through our models and start speaking with the leadership teams of these targets, we thing there's a -- there are great opportunities. The valuations make sense. The return are great. The teams fit together and we think that it will continue to sort of accumulate into competitive advantages. We bring together sort of that model of our product portfolio, the capabilities that we bring with our national footprint, opportunities to introduce value-add or expanded value-add market. That's -- I would say, the accumulation of those factors is where that optimism comes from the list and the way that list is being sort of vetted through our processes as we continue to accelerate our M&A focus. We're ready to go.
Seldon Clarke: Yes. Okay. That sounds good. Appreciate it.
Peter Jackson: Sure.
Operator: Next question comes from Jay McCanless of Wedbush.
Jay McCanless: Good morning everyone.
Peter Jackson: Hey, Jay.
Jay McCanless: Hey, good morning. So I got a two-part question on lumber and then one as a follow-up. I guess, could you talk about what benefit you're seeing on the top line from commodity inflation thus far in the quarter? And then also maybe talk about when we think about your input costs for lumber? What's the spread between two before framing lumber versus sheet goods?
Chad Crow: So, maybe I can start. I would tell you that our Q2 results, the commodity is a slight tailwind. Keep in mind that dynamics, you saw a pretty good fall at the beginning of the quarter in prices and then a pretty good run out towards the end. So net-net it sort of averaged out, not a lot of impact and really started to accumulate if you've got into May. That's where the [Indiscernible] really starting to hit on May through today. Now the split of our exposure and we talked about commodities being right around 40% of our sales and prior quarters obviously now increase a bit as those increase prices start to change the mix in our business. But if you look at that 40% of our overall sales being commodity exposed and internally its 70/30 mix between lumber and panels. Again, anytime you got a highly commoditized component of your business that can be the most pressure probably in that space, the most commoditized and its probably [Indiscernible] of the panels. But that's sort of a broad-brush response.
Jay McCanless: Got it. That's helpful. And then my follow-up question, just wondering --I guess, did you guys quantify how much in one time savings you saw from some the cost actions during 2Q that are probably going to come back in 3Q?
Peter Jackson: Most of the $14 million beat in the second quarter, I would say were based on actions that are going to come back over time. I would say maybe further that will come back right away based on things people already done that are attributable to TV will take some time to phase back and unlikely they bounce back in the third quarter. Although I starting to eat away at it as things start to losing up in certain markets. And then, you'll -- I think you could probably estimate that better than I can. And those are the major components.
Chad Crow: Hey, Jay, I just want to add a little follow up to your commodity question. When we look at Q3, and it's kind of difficult to estimate, but right now our best guess is Q3 sales will be positively impacted due to inflation somewhere between 5% and 7%. And then, of course, we'll probably have another 2% or so year-over-year growth due to acquisition. So I just wanted to make sure you have those components.
Jay McCanless: Appreciated. Thank you. Thank you guys for taking my questions.
Chad Crow: Thanks Jay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Yinger of D.A Davidson.
Kurt Yinger: Yes. Good morning everyone, and appreciate you taking my questions.
Chad Crow: Good morning, Kurt.
Kurt Yinger: I just want to start off - yes, good morning. On the gross margin front, you guys came into the year 26% to 26.5% kind of normalized. And I think lumber was maybe 400 bucks per thousand. Obviously, it’s a moving target. But if we were to think about just structurally higher lumber price and maybe $500, what type of impact would that have on the normalized gross margin outlook, just with commodities naturally being arger percentage of sales?
Chad Crow: Yes. No, great question. As you know, we modeled that one quite a bit. It's about half to three quarters of a point based on current spot. It's been a meaningful move this year. There's no question. We'll have to see how long it lasts and how it plays out. But it's certainly an important change and one that we're we welcome. We just hope it sticks around this time.
Kurt Yinger: Well, it wasn't too bad on the other side of 2018 either so.
Chad Crow: Not bad at all.
Kurt Yinger: And my second one, it seems like over the past couple quarters you guys have start to see some real tangible benefits from some of those pricing tools. And I'm wondering how much opportunity you feel is left there. And relatedly, could you talk about which product categories or what previous shortfalls these tools really address?
Chad Crow: Sure. Yes. And I guess I just want to reiterate the fact that this pricing effort we're making is really just around being thoughtful, being organized, being efficient internally. I was describing areas where we're sort of closing the gaps. It's those moments when price change will come through the good or bad from a vendor and it's not being filtered all the way through the system to the quotation we're giving our customers. And while I'm sure the academics might prefer the fact that you need to increase prices and also decrease in prices, that's important as well, because you need to stay competitive and make sure you're winning the business. We want our salespeople to have the best information so they can compete and win in the marketplace. And when you're slow, you can put yourself in a position to fit out in profitability and in sales. So that's probably the biggest component. Being systematic always helps. You don't want to put yourself in a position where you've taken an approach that somehow harms a market or distorts the pricing. So that systematic approach we think it's absolutely beneficial. As we look at it, it's been a difficult process to adapt all of the tools, the system, the architecture to the way that we want to approach it going forward. I'm very, very impressed with both our operations and our IT teams for what they've been doing to pull that together. We've seen some very good progress with a couple more phases to come over the back half of this year. The markets where we've implemented so far have been pretty manual. So thus I can changes over time. It is a fairly modest percentage of the overall company. I think the new pricing structure is put in place. So we do expect it to continue to accumulate for us over the next year as we get some of those permanent changes to the It structure and allow the business to accelerate the use of that more broadly.
Peter Jackson: And I'll just add, even just 50 basis points of margin improvement, that's real money. And part of it is, to some degree breaking old habits. I've always sold this with a 24% margins as well. Why can't it be 24.5. What can the market bear? So give them more tools to understand that. And then also knowing, bucketing your customers and knowing which customers are more expensive to serve and making sure you're getting proper margin and a net return on those customers. So a lot of it's just giving them the tools and the information to make those decisions much more quickly.
Kurt Yinger: Right. Makes a lot of sense. All right. Thank you guys. I'll turn it over.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Kurt.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Gilbert of BTIG.
Ryan Gilbert: Hey, thanks, guys. First question is on the third quarter guide. So, I guess, looking back to prior years and there's been commodity inflation. We've seen that pressure on the gross margin. Operating margin has typically been flat or even improved on the year-over-year basis. But then just looking at that markets trying to kind of triangulate to operating margins and adjusted EBITDA and gross margin guide. It looks like you're expecting some pretty meaningful operating margin compression in the third quarter. And I'm just wondering why you think you can be flat or higher in 3G 2020 on an operating margin basis?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I think the -- probably the most direct answer to your question is the velocity of the change in commodities. The nature of those short term fixed price contracts certainly put us through a certain amount of exposure for a window of time. And these are unprecedented increases. You're up 20, 30 points a month. That's a very, very difficult thing to compensate for. So we're just recognizing that in the third quarter. Your point is right on there is some nice leverage that comes when the value of those commodities gets higher. And to the bottom line it's a no question of positive and one that we absolutely expect to flow through our P&L over time, but that's a short answer.
Chad Crow: Yes. I know. We could be looking at about 300 basis points decline in gross margin Q3 this year over last year. That's pretty hard to overcome from an operating margin standpoint. But as Peter said, we usually more than make that up in the following quarters.
Ryan Gilbert: Right. Completely understand. Okay. And then second question on structural components. Definitely good to hear that, you're up double digits on the year-over-year basis on trusses. I'm wondering just how the conversations with builders have been progressing in the third quarter, given that negotiating that backlogs are pretty full. cycle times are extending. I'm wondering if you're seeing more builders coming to you, interested in using components to get those cycle times back up?
Chad Crow: Yes, for sure. I mean, anytime labor's tied, as you mentioned, they've got all of a sudden the surge and their backlogs are bigger than normal. They're looking for ways to get those houses in the ground as quickly as possible. And so that just plays right into our strategy on the component side of the business. So that's why I said earlier, I have no concerns about our component business, very optimistic about what the future holds for that.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And just lastly, if I could. I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on what's going on in Florida. I think most of the commentary we've heard from the builders has been that, and the demands pretty positive down there. So has there been a change to that competitive landscape or anything in particular, you want to call out other than what you could earlier?
Peter Jackson: I guess, I want to be a little bit thoughtful about how I answer this. There were certain important customers who acted more aggressively and less aggressively during the downturn than others. And the nature of some of those decisions certainly gave us some pause there. Back in this certain markets, they were particularly impacted, at least out of the gate or some of the more tourism impacted markets. All those markets have absolutely come back to the degree. There is a recovery underway. And I don't see that as a long term issue. But I do think there is a bit of a progression back to normal that is required for us to kind of see full help there. But we have a very strong footprint. Very good businesses. Our folks are doing a great job down there. It's certainly not a concern about the operation. It's just a matter of how quickly it ramps back to where we would consider to be strong again.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Ramsay of Thompson Research Group.
Steven Ramsay: Good morning. I guess, question on Greenfield openings. How many have you done year to date? Do you have plans for more this year? Or is it still more of a focus on M&A?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So year to-date, I think we did just the one -- we had one that open sort of provided year end timelines, so its somewhere one or two. We have a couple more that are being built out. As far as timing and when they will open. So probably one to two more that will fall into this year. Again, kind of that year end timeline. It's a great time to kind of get that work done and get them starting to ramp up, because it's a bit of a slow season for us generally, but we do continue to focus on looking for areas for retail facilities and we expect to continue that going forward.
Steven Ramsay: Okay. And then on repair and remodel volumes, I know you guys have some unique geographic exposure that drives that a little differently than the broader market. But our trends have been more resilient, maybe even didn't see quite the dip that new single family saw. Maybe just share the specific drivers for you guys in the quarter and if you have any visibility over Q3 into Q4?
Peter Jackson: Sure. Yes. So the one thing I'll let you know. I'm sure you already know this. But just for the other listeners that our R&R and other includes kind of the commercial business as well. So I can tell you that we have sort of a tale of two cities there that where core R&R retail and remodel businesses is far stronger, more than doubled at 4% rate. And then the commercial businesses where we see some downturn and that's definitely offset. So we've got that retail footprint. Southern California is a great example, business is doing wonderfully, really performing well, ready and responding to the homeowner needs. And those markets are doing very, very well. As we mentioned in the script, the Midwest market is sort of leveled out. We've seen a bit of a headwind there in past years and it's been healthier. Certainly also seeing that tailwind from the overall trends nationally in the R&R space. Even Alaska's R&R market has done well. But that commercial part of our business where we do have projects. Again, that's got some pretty solid Alaska explorer. That has been part of it, as some of those projects have been either delayed or paused for whatever reason.
Steven Ramsay: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Reuben Garner of the Benchmark Company.
Reuben Garner: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question.
Peter Jackson: Good morning, Reuben.
Reuben Garner: Most of them have been answered. So I just have one quick one and if I missed it, sorry, we had some technical difficulties. But have you had any -- most of the cycle, the only -- the main driver of a slower recovery has been labor availability. Have you noticed any changes on the labor front? And then, I guess, in a related way, have you had any difficulty in getting any specific products? Do you see commodity availability or any other building products availability and issue in limiting growth or limiting and acceleration in growth in the coming quarters if the demand is there?
Chad Crow: Yes. Good questions. Haven't really noticed any changes in labor availability. Although I would not be surprised with the recent surge in new home orders that may get a little tighter and it may extend cycle times out a little more. We talked about that a little bit earlier on the call. From a product availability standpoint, most folks like us were running pretty lean as the pandemic hit, and we've stayed lean, prices have run and that kind of incentivizes you to remain lean, because you don't want to jump back in when prices are running if you don't have to. So that -- there has been some spotty supply issues, the bills cut back on their production when the pandemic hit and kind of got us in a situation we are right now where demand is strong and supplies limited. But nothing that I would say is disruptive. It's just something we're having to keep a closer eye on and be little more aggressive on the buying side in some markets where we're having trouble with some extended lead times, but nothing I would call significant at this point.
Reuben Garner: Great. Thanks again and congrats on the quarter. And good luck navigating through everything.
Chad Crow: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Crow for any additional or closing remarks.
Chad Crow: Thank you again for joining our call today. And we look forward to updating you on our future results. If you have any follow up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Peter or Binit. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-01 10:00:00) =====

Chad Crow: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I’d first like to say that our thoughts are with those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We express our gratitude to the first responders, health care workers, and all those on the frontline who have worked tirelessly to help us get through this situation. I am also incredibly proud of how the Builders FirstSource team has responded to take care of each other, our customers and our communities by upholding our core values to protect the well-being of all. For several years leading up to 2020, we have taken significant actions to expand our business, optimize our operations, pay down debt, improve cash flow and more closely partner with our customers through an integrated product offering. While the U.S. economy has transformed in an unprecedented way since our last update in February, our business entered the COVID-19 pandemic at the strongest point in our company’s history. This has allowed us to effectively power through to the initial phases of the pandemic, as demonstrated by our solid first quarter performance, while also taking additional steps to fortify our business for the uncertain period ahead. Last quarter and before the pandemic began to impact the economy, I announced my planned retirement in 2020 at the commencement – in the commencement of asserts from our replacement. Given the rapidly evolving market landscape along with the economic uncertainty of the coming months, I have notified the Board of my intention to stay until the virus situation stabilizes, and the company has resumed more normal operations. We are all completely focused on emerging from this crisis a stronger company. Before we discuss results, I’ll provide an update on the current market landscape and some actions we have taken. As I mentioned, we entered this pandemic at the strongest point in our company’s history. As an essential business, we continue to supply critical products to customers with a paramount focus on health and safety. We are prioritizing the well-being of our team members, channel partners, and the communities where we operate. Fortunately, we have the ability to do so while maintaining operational continuity. Nearly all of our locations have remained open, except in the few states or counties where construction activities were suspended, but that list of states is shrinking. We have dedicated teams in place to monitor best practices, ensure compliance with shifting local orders, and implement swift action as needed. In addition to the many safety protocols and social distancing measures that we have put in place, our investments in technology are helping us maintain our connections with customers and our overall effectiveness. This includes My BFS Builder where we complement our first-class face-to-face customer service with an innovative customer portal. Customers can quickly access details regarding their account, receive automatic notifications of delivery, download statements and make payments, all with the goal of making it easier for customers to do business with us and for the time being, minimize physical contact. Our business performed well in the first quarter, even during the month of March. We met our financial expectations and finished the quarter strong, and our value-add products were once again a major contributor to our success. Looking ahead, there are several factors I would like to call out for the coming months. During the quarter, many of our customers worked vigorously to complete existing units under construction. As a valued partner to many builders, I am proud that our teams were able to provide customers with the critical products they needed to keep projects moving. However, as the quarter ended and the economic conditions softened in April, home sales declined and new projects coming into the pipeline have not fully replaced completed projects. As a result, we have taken actions to address the softer market conditions in what we expect will be an air pocket in construction activity. Last month, we announced proactive steps to enhance our financial flexibility, liquidity, and cash flow. At the end of March, we had $672 million of total liquidity. Out of an abundance of caution, we recently tapped the debt markets to end the month of April with $1 billion of total liquidity, including $193 million of cash and no significant debt maturities for the next seven years. On the operational side, we are taking a balanced approach to mitigate the impact of reduced demand on our profitability While protecting as many existing jobs as we can, as we believe the worst of the downturn will be short-lived. Recall that in 2019, we added $25 million in EBITDA through an operational excellence initiative to optimize process and control costs in a growing market. In response to COVID-19, we are enhancing our efforts to include: resizing locations where needed; minimizing discretionary capital expenditures; optimizing working capital; limiting and delaying operating expenses; tightly managing corporate spend; and reducing Board and senior management pay. These actions, while difficult, are helping to preserve cash and profitability while maintaining our ability to efficiently respond as demand recovers. We will continue to take prudent actions to maintain a strong liquidity position and operate our business with a safety-first emphasis across our nationwide footprint. While the extent and duration of the current economic crisis remains unclear, we are well prepared to navigate through it and keep our company positioned to succeed as the economy begins to improve. I will now turn the call over to Peter, who will review our first quarter results and balance sheet in more detail.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Chad. Good morning everyone. I’m proud of our team’s work in delivering another quarter of strong results and supporting our customers during this dynamic time. I will streamline our first quarter review, given it is in the rearview mirror at this point. I will also highlight the structural elements that we see as important near-term considerations to help communicate our confidence in the business. We had $1.8 billion in net sales in the first quarter with core organic growth of 3.9%. You heard me use a new term right there, as we are introducing a new core organic growth metric this quarter. We believe it is an efficient way to discuss the underlying performance of our business by excluding acquisitions, commodity impacts, and differences in selling days from net sales. Net sales in total increased 9.5%. Core organic growth as I mentioned was 3.9%. Our five tuck-in acquisitions completed over the past year added 3.5% and one additional selling day contributed 1.7%. Commodity price inflation was minimal and added 0.4% to net sales. Our value added product categories again led the way on a per day and core organic basis reflecting the continued execution of our strategic plan and the emphasis of those businesses on those key products. Our gross margin percentage was 26% and in line with our expectations for the quarter. The 110 basis points decline compared to the prior year period was a result of the previously communicated normalization in our lumber and lumber sheet goods product margin. Last year, we experienced a strong tailwind due to commodity deflation, which did not recur in 2020. Amid all of the expected noise related to COVID, please continue to keep in mind the mechanics of our margins as we have discussed on prior calls. Commodity cost deflation causes short-term gross margin percentage expansion when price has dropped rapidly relative to our short-term price and commitments that we provide customers. We experienced this benefit during the first quarter of 2019, and this benefit did not recur in the first quarter of 2020. Commodity costs increased markedly in February of 2020 before retreating to prior levels in the face of COVID-related interruptions. At this point, we expect we will see a modest impact from commodity inflation in our Q2 results. Interest expense increased by $27 million to $51.9 million compared to the same period last year. Excluding the net impact of one-time items related to debt extinguishments, interest expense was down by $1 million on a lower outstanding debt balance year-over-year. First quarter EBITDA decreased $3.9 million to $97 million representing the higher end of our expectations. The year-over-year decline was largely driven by the previously discussed normalization in our gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2020. On Slide 4, you can see that the strength of our business driven by our national scale and strong local customer relationships was again evident as our customers push to complete units under construction. Higher margin value-added products remained at 42% of total sales in the quarter with estimated volume growth of 9% in combined manufacturing – manufactured products and windows, doors, and millwork product categories. On Slide 5, our first quarter organic growth with an estimated 3% in the single family new construction end market with broad-based growth across the country. A common thread is that we grew value-added products in the single family market in all of our regions. Core organic growth in R&R and other end other was 2% on broad growth as well. Multifamily core organic improved by 19% largely due to the timing of projects started earlier in 2019 when we implemented organizational improvements. Turning to our front-end liquidity and de-risk balance sheet on Page 6, let me first address cash flow. During the quarter, we had an outflow of free cash of approximately $79 million. The first quarter is seasonally our low point for cash flow as we typically use cash in the first half of the year and build up cash in the second half. This year is clearly shaping up to be unprecedented in nature and as Chad discussed, we have taken aggressive action to preserve cash including a significant reduction in CapEx spending and an increased vigilance around working capital. Looking at our net leverage, we ended the quarter down 0.2 times compared to prior year and up 0.3 times from December 31st. The sequential increase is partly due to the funding of prior acquisitions, which are not yet fully reflected in EBITDA, as well as the normal seasonal buildup and working capital. On a pro forma basis, our net leverage was closer to the low end of our two and a half to three and a half times targeted range. With that backdrop, let’s focus on the structure of our capital resources for the current environment. We have already discussed our spending in cash preservation measures, so I’ll address the recent debt financing transactions that are provided, significant additional liquidity in recent months. Since the beginning of the year, we have made several moves to push out maturities and improve our access to cash. First in February, we issued $550 million of senior unsecured notes that mature 10 years from now in 2030. We use the proceeds to pay off $504 million of existing debt that matured in 2024, plus a portion of our 2027 notes. This transaction was opportunistic in nature and unfortunate timing ahead of COVID’s impact on the economy. In April, 2020, in response to the pandemic, we raised an additional $350 million in 2027 senior notes. We use those proceeds to repay the funds drawn under our revolving credit facility and left the remainder in cash. Following these transactions, we have approximately $1 million – $1 billion of total liquidity, including $193 million of cash representing a greater than 50% increase in liquidity since the end of the first quarter. We have a term loan in the amount of $52 million due in 2024, but beyond that, we have no maturities until 2027 and a weighted average maturity schedule of eight years. That represents an almost three-year extension in our weighted average maturity schedule since the beginning of the year. Including our recent bond offering, we expect our cash interest to be in the $100 to $110 million range for the full year of 2020. We believe our balance sheet is appropriately structured to face the challenges ahead. We have no covenants worth discussing and we have over $800 million available to us on our revolver. We are prepared to draw down additional capital is needed, but do not see a reason to do so at this time based on our free cash flow expectations. In terms of capital allocation, our primary objective at this time is to preserve cash. We have put numerous investment plans on hold including acquisitions and growth CapEx. If you recall, we had originally anticipated to invest around one-third of our total 2020 capital expenditures in value-add growth initiatives. While some of those – some of that has already been spent with the deferral of growth projects, we now expect capital expenditures to be in the $75 to $85 million range for the full year. In summary, we ended the quarter with a strong capital position, have further fortified our balance sheet and have ample coverage to effectively navigate the developing economic environment. I will now turn the call back to Chad for his closing comments.
Chad Crow: Thank you, Peter. We have managed through prior downturns, and our business is much stronger today than it was a decade ago. Our national scale vast product portfolio and our local market density across 77 of the top 100 MSAs are just a few of the reasons. Today, high-margin value added products, which make our customers more productive and efficient, are the largest portion of our business. Our net leverage is at the low end of our long-term target and we have a much deeper and more integrated relationship with our customers than ever before. We are much more than a supplier of lumber. We are a highly valued partner to many very sophisticated builders delivering labor savings and just-in-time delivery of critical building materials, helping them maintain a streamlined supply chain. As I’ve mentioned several times today, we are better prepared than at any point in our history to address the rapidly evolving and unprecedented economic environment. In early April, we withdrew our full year guidance due to the uncertainty in the current homebuilding market. Our prior outlook did not contemplate the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, in regards to our previous week communicated long-range plan, despite our confidence in long-term financial goals, we are also putting our targeted 2022 timing under review until we have a better view of the economic impact of COVID. The uncertainty regarding the duration of the COBIT crisis, the pace of recovery and the lingering impacts on the economy remain unclear. As I mentioned earlier, the hurried pace by customers to complete projects during March tapered off as we move through April. This resulted in a high single-digit percent decline in core organic net sales for the month of April compared to the prior year period. We believe this was due to a combination of factors including some builders shutting down certain other construction sites due to strict shelter in place, orders conflicting local mandate and for obvious health reasons. Our teams have also noted understaffing at some critical government offices delaying, permitting and production schedules. At construction sites that are operational, the logistics have become more complex to accommodate precautions to limit the spread of the virus. And as many public builders have reported the pace of new home orders has weakened in recent months due to social distancing guidelines, stay at home recommendations and general economic uncertainty, deferring some near-term home buying activity. We believe these factors make it likely that the market environment will weaken further in the coming months at the backlog of projects that started prior to the pandemic are completed and before new starts begin to ramp up again. That said, we still believe there will be a significant base level of demand for our essential products and services. We are encouraged by the reported uptake and uptick in new home sales in the past two weeks and have seen similar trends in orders coming into our trust and panel plants. From an operational and financial perspective, we are well positioned for a challenging second order, and we’ll continue to adjust our business as needed. Given the limited visibility on a length and severity of the economic impact, we have a range of internal forecast depending on many sets of future assumptions. While we are not publicly disclosing our scenario analysis based on our cost position, our capital structure, our operational excellence initiatives, and a lot of contingency planning, we believe that our business will be able to produce positive free cash flow for the remainder of the full year 2020. We remain ready to make operational adjustments and react quickly. We will continue to align our costs with the evolving demand environment and will work to preserve our strong liquidity and balance sheet flexibility. We have full confidence in our business to be the supplier of choice for building materials and value-added products in the months and years to come. Our enhanced geographic reach, diversified product offerings, national manufacturing capabilities, and strong partnerships with customers are unmatched, competitive advantage –competitive advantages in any market environment. I would especially like to thank the Builders FirstSource team for their unwavering dedication to our company, customers and communities during this volatile time and into the recovery. Operator, we can now open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: Yes, sir. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll now take a question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and hope everyone’s doing well. I wanted to ask a sort of a bigger-picture question on the value-added products and prefab components, particularly in this environment. Are you guys thinking that sort of where construction labor could potentially become more available for several reasons here over these next several months. Do you think prefab can continue to take share? I know it’s – we’ve talked about this before, but it varies by market where it’s been more or less adopted. What have you seen so far in those categories and how are you thinking about the dynamic whether prefab can continue to take share? Thank you.
Chad Crow: Personally, I don’t think that’s a trend that’s going to reverse. It’s been taking share. I think it will continue to take share. I think builders see the value in it. They see the efficiency it creates on their job sites. It requires – it can require less people and less time on the job sites. I guess there could be a few instances where builders could revert back. But in general, I don’t see that trend reversing.
Peter Jackson: I agree. We grew through the last cycle in value add. I think that there was – there’s an argument to be made, there was a far more labor availability during the last cycle than there is or will be during this one. So I think there’s every reason for confidence. This is a product that the homebuilders like and use and rely on.
Matthew Bouley: Got it. Okay. That’s helpful. And then secondly, I wanted to ask about – the comment you just made, Chad around sort of pushing out that the timing of thinking about some of your operational excellence, understandably so, but I guess my question is, what can you actually continue in this environment in terms of those operational excellence initiatives? What are you taking a pause on? I kind of just want to hear the big-picture thoughts, but then also what that could mean for cost savings in 2020? Thank you.
Chad Crow: Yes. Maybe I wasn’t clear. Right now, we have no intention to pausing on operational excellence initiatives. The pausing is more on some of the growth initiatives and M&A activity. But right now, we’re full speed ahead on our operational excellence initiatives.
Matthew Bouley: Okay, perfect. Thanks for clarifying that. Appreciated. Thanks guys.
Chad Crow: You bet.
Operator: We’ll now take our next question from Trey Morrish with Evercore ISI.
Trey Morrish: Thanks very much guys. Chad, it’s nice to hear that you’re going to be sticking around for a little bit given all the sudden uncertainty, so we could talk a little bit more. But you are also around last cycle as well during the downswing. How much of what you’re doing today is related to the playbook that you’ve all pulled out last cycle? And just how do you view the current challenging environment compared to the financial crisis downswing?
Chad Crow: Yes, that’s a great question. First of all, it wasn’t just me that it was around. I bet, gosh, 75% of our team has probably been around, and that includes the guys out in the field. And one thing they are very good about is adjusting their operations for demand to changes in demand. That’s not just in situations like this, but from a seasonal perspective across a given year, especially in the upper – the Northern markets where seasonality is a huge factor. That’s just a way of life for them. And so, the good news is we have an experienced team that knows how to deal with it. Right now, we have the playbook ready. And to be honest, we haven’t initiated all those plays yet because we haven’t needed to. Our sales have held up remarkably well. Now in states where we were required to close for a period of time, we did some temporary layoffs and things like that and adjusted our cost structure, but as we’ve opened back up, we’ve been able to bring most of those folks back. Now that being said, we do anticipate a slowdown in the coming months, and we will be prepared to adjust our cost structure accordingly. I don’t have the crystal ball of what this is going to look like. Personally, I think it’s not going to be anything like the last crisis. I think it’s going to be much shorter lived than that. I think the underpinnings are much different right now. We’re not in an overbuilt position like we were 10 years ago. In fact, you could argue we were still in an underbuilt position now. Now, there will be some bumps along the way. There’s a high level of unemployment that we’ll have to work through, but there’s still a lot of positive things that give me hope that this is going to be relatively short-lived. I think the pandemic could drive some people out of big cities and wanting some space of their own. That could drive some additional homebuilding. Mortgage rates are still low. So, there’s the demographics. There’s a lot of things that give me hope that this will be relatively short-lived and nothing like 10 years ago. If it gets as bad as 10 years ago, we’ve got a boatload of liquidity, and we’ll be ready to react. So right now, I, look, we’ve got an experienced team, we’ve got a balance sheet that’s got $1 billion of liquidity, and we will manage through whatever the current economic environment presents to us. But when you compare what I see coming in the next few months and few quarters to what we went through in 2008, I don’t think it’s going to be anything like that. Will there be a couple of rough quarters? Yes, I think there will be, but – and we’ll be able – we’ll be ready to pull the playbook out again. But right now, as I said, we’ve been very fortunate being deemed as an essential business, and our business has held up remarkably well thus far.
Trey Morrish: Okay, thanks for that. And then you talked about April being down high single digits in your core organic growth. I’m just wondering if you could kind of talk about that, at least qualitatively. Any difference in that you’re seeing value-add, I guess, with different customer types whether it’s public or private builders acting differently? Whether they got for on the spectrum and versus build-to-order or acting differently, any type of color you can you can provide there?
Chad Crow: It’s more regional based. As you would expect, up in the Northeast, they’ve been hit the hardest. They’re probably down more than any other region. The opposite of that is, gosh, down around Georgia and Florida, you wouldn’t know there was anything going on. Our results so far are on plan and up first prior year. And so those are the two bookings that we’re seeing and all the other reasons are kind of fallen in between that. So, we haven’t really seen a difference by builder type. It’s really more a geographical difference and, how much the pandemic is really shut down operations in those regions.
Trey Morrish: Okay. Thanks very much guys.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from John Baugh with Stifel.
John Baugh: Thank you. Welcome back, Chad. It’s like you never left.
Chad Crow: Yes, it’s great.
John Baugh: I was wondering sort building on the last question a little bit. If it’s a way, obviously in States where construction is closed, I would assume the results are materially weaker and then they might actually rebound a little from where they’ve been in the last few weeks. Do I have that right first? And then secondly, in those areas where you’ve remained open, you sort of mentioned that the pipeline is filling on the front end. I was curious as to whether you felt that was sort of cancellations or deferrals, if you have any sort of read through on those – on that. Thank you.
Chad Crow: Well, I think your assumption is correct. In states where we were closed, there is a little bit of pent-up demand there as we reopened. We see a little bit of a surge, but we still think the worst is yet to come in the next couple of months. That’s a tough question on, whether it’s deferrals or cancellations. Honestly I think it’s got to be some of both. You’ve got 30 million people that are filing for unemployment now. How many of those were potential homeowners in the near-term? I don’t know. But I can say in the southeast, where our results are still pretty strong. We’re seeing the still a pretty solid pipeline of new starts and new construction. But I think time will tell. I wish I had the answer, but I think time will tell on whether these are deferrals or cancellations. But my guess is it’s going to be some of both.
John Baugh: And then obviously you’re not going to do M&A now. I fully understand. But curious as to how you think the competitive landscape is positioned going into this downturn. Whether there might be even more opportunities and if correct, where you’d sort of pull the trigger? What would it take timing-wise or what you’re seeing to sort of change your stance?
Chad Crow: Yes, I do think this will create opportunities that otherwise wouldn’t have been there. What those will look like. I don’t know. But clearly, as we’ve discussed, we took out a lot of incremental debt. Liquidity – in uncertain times, liquidity is king. In uncertain times, liquidity is a lot like a concealed weapon. I’d rather have it and not need it, than need it and not have it. So consider us armed and daters once this thing levels out and there’s acquisition opportunities out there because personally, I don’t think we’re going to need that incremental liquidity, but I’ve learned is coming through the last downturn, it’s better to have it. And so if things turn out like, I think they will, we will have ample liquidity to be able to take advantage of some these situations that will come out.
John Baugh: Okay. Thank you and good luck.
Chad Crow: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll now take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC.
Chris Carril: Hi, this is Chris on for Mike. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is just on unlocked pricing. Is there any way you could help us flush out the timing of when you’re going to start seeing the impact of the lower prices on results? Just given your – if you could just give us an update on your inventory and net you have going forward in the – in light of the lower-demand backdrop?
Peter Jackson: Sure. Yes. I mean the nature of our commodities is pretty consistent. We saw that run-up in pricing, sort of the middle of the first quarter, generally takes about one quarter to two quarters but that will flush through the P&L in terms of the impact on gross margins, resetting pricing. Now in this case, because it went up and then came back down again, it has the potential to be a little quicker, but you still got to work through that inventory. As far as inventory levels, our days of inventory is less than it was a year ago. We’ve been very disciplined about the amount of inventory we brought on to make sure that we didn’t get cost behind any material changes in demand. But that said, we’re still the distributor. So we have inventory on the ground. We will continue to have inventory on the ground. But I think that our performance to date has been sort of continuing the progress that we made last year in keeping that we made last year in keeping our days well managed. I think that the overall lumber and commodity pricing, both OSB and lumber ran up a bit, but it settled back down. I don’t know that there’s much room for it to go much lower. I would say that manufacturers have done a good job of taking capacity offline to manage. So, it’s really a matter of seeing when things start to ramp back up again from a homebuilding and demand perspective as to when, if at all, the prices move.
Chris Carril: Got it. Thanks. That’s helpful. And then just for my second question, I was hoping you can drill a little deeper into the trends you saw in April, specifically by product category. Is there any way you could you could break out, I mean, how the value-added parts of your business performed relative to the company average?
Peter Jackson: So, we definitely don’t want to go down into the weaves on April. I think that the overall trends have been largely consistent what you expect from us. It’s a lot of question mark about where that goes into the future as things start to transition to digest this air pocket or whatever it is we’re going to call it of the shelter in place. We’re already starting to see the improvement in starts – sorry, in orders through our customers. But really, we’re going to have to watch our homebuilder communication, permits and starts, the normal characteristics that you’d expect us to monitor from our homebuilding customers to know when we’ll expect the things to turn around. But like Chad said, there’ll be a window here where it’s going to get harder.
Chris Carril: Got it. Appreciate the color. Stay safe.
Peter Jackson: Thanks. You too.
Chad Crow: Thank you. You too.
Operator: We’ll now take our next question from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.
Keith Hughes: Thank you. I have two questions. One, once homebuilder orders start to bottom and tick up in the right direction, how long will it take for us to see that in your sales, where your inventories are right now?
Chad Crow: Yes. I don’t know that there’s a hard and fast answer to that, Keith. I think that it’s a good question. It’s really dependent on the customer, in the region, a couple of weeks or a couple of months. It could be a range like that. But I think one of the interesting aspects of this and we look at, at least the recent past, there is a little bit of a buffering that happens as homebuilders continue to build through a little bit of their backlog. You have sort of this ability to expand and contract the under construction. I think we’ve seen a little bit of that. We’ve already started to see some of the green shoots or initial indications that we bounced off the bottom on orders. It’s a question of how long it lasts. And does it continue that trajectory? Are there multiple dips? And when it gets a little bit back to normal, what does that normal look like.
Keith Hughes: Okay. Second question, lumber prices. It sequentially fell off pretty hard once this whole mess started. Typically, you tend to get, for a period of time, a little bit of extra margin from that. Is that going to be the case in the second quarter? Or will this just get competed away because the environment is so difficult?
Peter Jackson: Given how fast it went up and back down again, I expect it’s probably the latter this time.
Keith Hughes: Okay.
Peter Jackson: Because it was a month or two.
Keith Hughes: Yes.
Chad Crow: And I’ll just add, as we expect to see business slow in the quarter, there may be opportunities where we get a little more aggressive on price to just keep the volume coming through our facilities and keep our folks working. So that could offset some of the – any advantage we would have gotten from the fluctuation in commodity prices this time around.
Keith Hughes: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.
Kurt Yinger: Yes. Good morning, everyone and thanks for all the details. I just wanted to start on gross margin and maybe trying to think about the variability there kind of associated with volume declines and maybe trying to create some goalposts on how you might think about the downside there. And then just on decremental EBITDA margins, I think you guys typically target a low double-digit range. Do you think that’s still a reasonable benchmark? Or is there anything we should be thinking about that might kind of change that in the current environment?
Peter Jackson: Hey, Kurt. Yes. You’re right on, that’s a great question. I don’t know that I have a lot of particularly useful detail other than we maybe recap a couple of things that we’ve talked about in the past. Yes. We will expect to see deleveraging, to a small degree, in gross margin as demand declines. The extent of the demand will correlate to the size of the impact on margins. We certainly see the variability in SG&A as a rule of thumb being around 70% variable. The tricky part in this particular situation is that we know it’s temporary. The downturn in volume is temporary. So, we may keep a few more folks around to make sure that we’re ready to go on the back end. There are some critical roles in this business that are extremely hard to recruit and retain and you don’t want to let them slip away because you have a 30 or a 60-day window in which you lost some volume. So that’s a good question mark for us to see how bad it goes down and how much do we want to protect versus how much do we just get down the business and rescale the business as appropriate. That fall through is a good question overall for the year. Do I think it’s likely to be in that range? Sure. I don’t think that net directionally is wrong. But for a window of time, could it be better or worse? Yes. No, it could be.
Kurt Yinger: Okay, that’s helpful. You touched on something that kind of leads into my next question. It’s really around how do you balance taking more kind of permanent actions from a facility or even headcount perspective relative to the potential for a short-lived downturn. I mean, is there a certain timeframe where you kind of defer maybe some of these decisions, but at which point, you say, “All right, we got to start kind of protecting the margin and the profitability of the business. Is there any kind of way to think about when that might be?
Chad Crow: Well, that’s also a great question and probably, the things we’re struggling with the most right now. As I said earlier, thus far, we’ve been very fortunate in our business has held up really well. We expect to see that decline. We also still currently expect it to be a relatively short-lived. When I say, relatively short-lived, months, not years, decline. And so as long as we believe that, I am certainly willing to keep investing in, as Peter said, our key employees. Many, many folks. We’ve got a lot of talented team members and to let some of them go just to ride out a fairly brief downturn in our business would be – would not be the right thing to do. We want to keep these people employed, and we want to be ready for things to – when things do recover. And so that’s the tough question. Every day, we learn a little more. And as we continue over the next few weeks and months, if it becomes clear that our assumptions may be off and this may be a little longer downturn, then we’ll adjust accordingly. But right now, we’re working under the assumption that’s going to be relatively short-lived. And so there will be – anytime our business flows, there’s a reduction in overtime, there’s a reduction in temp labor, there’s a reduction in hours worked. But as far as permanently letting people go, we want to defer that as long as we can and keep buying time in order to get some more clarity on what this thing is going to look like.
Kurt Yinger: All right. Okay, yes. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you. And then just lastly, on the competitive front, how do you think about – or are you seeing any potential benefits kind of in a more challenging backdrop associated with your relative scale and liquidity compared to some of your smaller competitors? And is that something that might benefit more on the customer side from an order perspective or maybe how suppliers approach, who is retaining your product? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: So, I think that the real obvious one, I guess, with $1 billion in liquidity, there is a clear understanding in the marketplace that we are not going anywhere and you can count on us. I think that is a desirable position to be in when you’re talking with customers about how to make sure you’re supporting them and working with them. It’s always a dynamic environment when you’re trying to react. And again, it kind of reiterated an earlier point, and some parts of the countries that are killing it that are doing great. And other parts of the country that are really suffering and happen to hunker down a big way because their customers are. Being able to partner in every one of those situations continuing to invest in our business from an operational excellence perspective, continuing to invest in the portal, continuing to be able to offer services that others can’t, we think that – it’s that continuity. It’s that reliability and that strength that in this moment and over time, continues to give us a competitive advantage. Will it – I think the area where it may offer better opportunities are those that having come through this cycle as owners of their own smaller business decide maybe this isn’t such a horrible time to pass the reins. And boy, Builders FirstSource seems like a good group to work with. Maybe we’ll sell to them. So there are opportunities. It’s a little too early to say because we don’t know what it’s really going to look like. At this point, it hasn’t looked like much.
Kurt Yinger: All right. Great, appreciate that color and good luck in the coming quarters.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Kurt. Take care.
Operator: We’ll now take our next question from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.
Steven Ramsey: Good morning. I guess I wanted to start with the Southeast. Is that the only region of strength, albeit a big region? I guess also with that, what was the percentage of sales coming from the Southeast maybe in 2019? And then thinking about the strength of it, is it on all fronts, both current activity and new orders?
Chad Crow: No. It’s not – it’s the strongest region of the country right now for us. But there’s other markets that you can see they’ve been impacted, but they haven’t been near – as impacted nearly as much as you might have thought they would have been. And yes, the strength we’re seeing in the Southeast is a combination of both existing orders and new orders. I don’t have the percentage of sales breakout with me now, but that’s probably something that maybe you could discuss with Binit later, but it’s not the only region. I was just pointing out the kind of the book ends of the strongest and the most impacted when I made that comment earlier.
Steven Ramsey: Great. And then on customer speeding up work in March, can you maybe explain how this played out? And do you see – is that what’s driving some of – is that continuing into April or is that – does that taper off in Q1?
Chad Crow: Well, when we were talking about the customers, they’re basically finishing homes that had already been started. So units under construction. They were really making sure they got those homes completed. But we did see many builders start to tap the brakes on spec homes, on new lot development and of course, traffic and new buyer activity slowed given the restraints created by the pandemic. So yes, we mentioned the April results and how they trailed off. Still all in all, a pretty strong April, in my opinion, given what’s going on. But as I mentioned earlier, we are still concerned that there’s kind of an air pocket of demand coming that we’ll have to work through in the coming months.
Steven Ramsey: Right. And then last question, you talked about the geographical differences being kind of the biggest diverging trend. But maybe can you talk to the difference in health of smaller builders versus large builders? And is cash collection challenged in one or both groups right now?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I think Chad alluded to it a little bit, the difference between the large and small is less pronounced than the difference between hard-hit regions and those regions not seeing nearly the impact. It’s – I think that’s – it’s substantial. It’s kind of hard to overstate how different those two regional indicators are. Now, as far as the cash flow and the collections, as you can imagine, we have been paying particularly close attention to that. The good news is our days are better this year than they were last year. So we have not seen a decay in our performance today. We are certainly being thoughtful about it and being conservative and staying close to our customers whenever there are any delays or indicators of stress that we are staying close. But I think at this point, based on the relatively modest decline in what has happened so far in terms of sales, we certainly have not seen any issues there.
Steven Ramsey: Great. Thank you for the color.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.
Jay McCanless: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Chad Crow: Good morning, Jay.
Jay McCanless: So Chad, I just want to go back to what you were talking about in terms of being willing to push price if you need to keep volume up whenever this air pocket is. Are you seeing some of your competitors already making that decision and being more aggressive on price?
Chad Crow: No, I really haven’t seen that yet. It’s just something we would anticipate seeing if we see a significant drop-off in demand.
Jay McCanless: And then I was wondering if you all could quantify the high single-digit decline in April. How much of that is related to whether it’s percentage points, or something along those lines, how much of it is related to areas where you still can’t ship product, whether it’s Michigan or the Northeast, something like that?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I don’t know if we have an exact estimate. It’s a substantial – they’re – I don’t like in the same drum again. There’s a massive difference between those regions, right? Pacific Northwest, where they shut down Washington; the Northeast, where they’ve been most deeply impacted, Michigan, as you described. Those numbers are materially different than what you’re seeing in the rest of the country. So, I think it’s fair to say, yes.
Chad Crow: I think we can safely say it’s around half of that number.
Jay McCanless: Great color. Thanks for taking my questions.
Chad Crow: Thanks, Jay.
Operator: Our next question will come from Seldon Clarke with Deutsche Bank.
Seldon Clarke: Hey, thank you for questions. So, I heard there’s a lot of moving pieces here in the more medium-term far from the situation is still a little bit unclear. But you sound as fairly optimistic about the resiliency and more of a short-term impact to housing than anything else. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what gives you so much confidence here just given where unemployment is trending? Maybe just a little bit more color on where you actually think starts could seek out under various scenarios. Obviously, there’s a lot of in between with where we were before this was pandemic and where we were in the financial crisis. So just any color on where you think starts might take out would be helpful.
Chad Crow: I don’t know that I’m ready to give a starts number yet. But look, as I said earlier, this crisis just looks a lot different than what we went through last time. I won’t rehash those. But I do think there’s going to be incremental demand created down the road. And you’ve seen some articles on it recently of renters fleeing apartments and deciding now is the time to get a bit of space of our own if – I know for our company, in particular, I’m shocked at how well this whole telecommuting thing is working. And thankfully, we have ways in place to monitor what folks are doing at home and metrics and very, very pleased with the productivity that we’ve seen with folks. And so if this whole telecommuting thing sticks, that’s probably going to create a group of people that say, “You know what, I don’t have to live near downtown anymore where it’s more expensive. If I’m working from home, maybe we go out to the suburbs, where it’s cheaper and we have a little space of our own. So, I think that could provide a boost down the road. And we just don’t have the excess inventory in homes that we had a decade ago. Now to your point, there’s a lot of unemployed people right now, and we’ve got to get folks back to work. And the longer we don’t go back to work, that obviously, the more of this thing is going to drag out. But I just think there’s a lot of still underlying strength that if we can get folks back to work that we’re going to be able to flush through this. And again, I’m not talking weeks and work everything’s back to normal. It very well could be – it’s likely going to be months. I’m just saying it’s not going to be four or five years like we saw with the last financial crisis. That’s my opinion anyway.
Seldon Clarke: Okay. That’s helpful. And I guess just under different scenarios and given your kind of willingness to sort of ride this out in the short term, like how do you think about decremental margins over the next couple of quarters versus how they might shape out if this is a little bit of a longer-term weakness – where weakness persists for a little bit longer than you would expect.
Peter Jackson: We certainly don’t want to imply guidance on the margins. I think that when we’ve talked about incrementals and decrementals in the past as sort of the curvature has alluded to. We’re talking low double digits, so 12% to 15% is sort of a rule of thumb. And to reiterate, I guess, a little bit about the comment about the – if we hold on – if the worst-case scenario happens and we hold on to people a little longer than we should, then it does turn out to be down more. Of course, that’s going to make that a little bit worse on the downside. But it would recover over time because we’ll see that stabilized at a lower level. We’ll take the appropriate actions to reset margins and cost levels to where they need to be.
Seldon Clarke: Okay, got it. Appreciate the time.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Reuben Garner with Benchmark.
Reuben Garner: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
Peter Jackson: Good morning, Reuben.
Reuben Garner: So, I know R&R is not a huge part of your business, but – and I’m sorry if I missed it, I got kicked out of the call briefly. But have you seen any uptick in R&R activity or any trends to call out in that part of your business?
Peter Jackson: Yes. Definitely, some green shoots are good news. Not all good because there are some offsetting headwinds. So, the short answer is some of our more retail-focused businesses have seen a nice little uptick. As you know, we own the 50 Line San Lorenzo brands in California. They’re doing quite well in the retail. Some other parts of the country doing well also. Unfortunately, there’s – we also have our brand – our retail brand up in Alaska, and the Alaska market has really been hit hard. They’ve gotten a double whammy of oil as well as COVID. So, they’re certainly being hurt by all this. So, I think we’re doing well in that space, a couple of weaker pockets geographically, but certainly happy with our performance there overall.
Reuben Garner: Thanks. That’s helpful. And then second one for me. I know working capital was brought up. The normal rule of thumb, I think, is 9% to 10% of every incremental or detrimental dollar of revenue. Is there anything about the current environment that would mix that drastically different over the next, I don’t know, the duration of 2020? Thanks guys, and good luck navigating through this.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Chad Crow: Yes. No real difference. Based on our recent performance, we might come in a little towards the lower end of the 9% to 10%. But I think things have been fairly consistent. Thanks, Reuben.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG.
Ryan Gilbert: Hey, thanks, guys.
Chad Crow: Hi, Ryan.
Ryan Gilbert: The first question from me is it’s a little backward-looking, but the 3% core organic growth in single-family in the first quarter, a little slower than what we were seeing in large single family starts. Is that – do you think that’s impacted by COVID? Or did you lose some share as competitors got – or to the extent that competitor has got more aggressive in the market in the first quarter? Has that trended? Or has that trend continued in April so far?
Peter Jackson: Yes. As you can imagine, that caught our attention. We pay pretty close attention to the single-family numbers. The tricky part, and we talked a little bit about it at the end of last quarter is that we had a really strong end of 2018 and beginning of 2019. I think it’s fair to say we took a boat load of share and so you’re looking at some tough comps. I would also argue the numbers are a little bit odd. I personally have a hard time believing that there isn’t some mathematical anomaly in that February starts number. It just doesn’t ring true to what the market is doing. I think that if you smooth that out a little bit, for us, if you look at it over the last year, we netted a tremendous amount of share. Is there a little bit of pushback from our competitors and people trying to take some of that share back? Sure, yes, no doubt. But I think that we feel good about our share position about having net taken share. And I think we felt really good coming into the year. I mean it’s – I know we blew by Q1, but it’s a little tough to swallow just how well we were doing in Q1 and how the momentum of the business and the demand was building only to sort of be snuffed out by the COVID dynamics, and now we’re just going to – we’ll navigate through this bit, but I think we’re starting from a position of strength.
Ryan Gilbert: Yes, totally understand. And can you comment on just pricing and then margins for structural components through late March and April?
Peter Jackson: We generally don’t get into the granularity of the individual product categories. I would say, on a year-over-year basis, we certainly had some tailwind within those manufactured products, but the component of it that has a good aspect of it in 2019. So, on a year-over-year basis, it would have trended a little. But I think it’s a very healthy part of our business. Margins have been strong and we’re continuing to stay disciplined on pricing and particularly in that category where we think we bring a lot of value to the table.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today’s question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Chad Crow: Well, thank you, once again for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our second quarter results. And if you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Binit or Peter. Thank you.
Operator: And once again, that does conclude today’s conference call. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-21 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Builders FirstSource Fourth Quarter and Full Year Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded and will be available at www.bldr.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Binit Sanghvi, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Binit Sanghvi: Thank you, Kerry. Good morning, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call today are Chad Crow, Chief Executive Officer; and Peter Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. A copy of the slide presentation referenced on this call is available on the Investor Relations section of the Builders FirstSource website at bldr.com.  Before we begin, let me note that during the course of this conference call, we may make statements concerning the company's future prospects, financial results, business strategies and industry trends. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Please refer to our most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other reports filed with the SEC for more information on those risks. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.  The company will discuss adjusted results on this call. We have provided reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents in our earnings press release and detailed explanations of non-GAAP financial measures in our Form 8-K filed yesterday, both of which are available on our website.  I will now turn the call over to Chad Crow.
Chad Crow: Thank you, Binit. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. In January, we announced my planned retirement. This was a very tough personal decision after 20 years of serving Builders FirstSource alongside such an extremely talented team.  On the heels of record 2019 results, I fully expect this team to continue delivering exceptional performance for many years to come, and I'm confident that the combination of our talented employees and value-creation initiatives will elevate the company to even greater heights. I also want you to know that I am assisting the Board in the search for my replacement. And while the Board is making great progress, there is nothing significant to report as of yet. But we will keep you updated as appropriate.  Moving to full year highlights. We delivered another strong financial performance and further built on our record of success. Our 16,000 team members once again executed on our strategy and delivered value to our customers while also generating value for our shareholders. Our gross margin percentage improved 230 basis points, allowing us to achieve record annual EBITDA of $516 million, up 3% year-over-year. Our unrivaled platform showed its strength throughout the year, as value-added sales volume grew by an impressive 9%.  We continue to make strategic investments in our growth capacity and align our services with customers to streamline their construction processes. Our exceptional team accomplished these results while implementing working capital initiatives that helped generate a record $391 million of free cash flow for the full year. We were especially pleased to have funded our acquisitions while reducing our net leverage by more than 0.5 turn to 2.5x as of year-end. We completed 5 tuck-in acquisitions in key growth markets, including Las Vegas, Phoenix, Florida and the Carolinas, which have added approximately $240 million in annual value-added revenue to our business.  Turning to Slide 3. I would like to spend a few minutes highlighting several of our strategic achievements in 2019. We continue to leverage the strength of the platform we created in 2015. Our national scale and strong local customer relationships allowed us to grow sales volume in all 3 customer segments and in every region in excess of growth in housing starts.  Total sales volume grew by 7%, which was more than twice the rate of U.S. housing starts as we increasingly partnered with our customers to deliver value. We continue to realize the growth and margin expansion benefits of our strategic investments and value-added products capacity and services by helping our customers solve challenges, like increasing cost, labor constraints and waste management. We are committed to the expansion of our component manufacturing network, which is strategically located across the country.  In addition to greenfield investments, the 5 tuck-in acquisitions completed since midyear 2019 have brought 6 additional truss manufacturing and millwork facilities to the Builders FirstSource family for a total of 64. In addition, we are investing in door facility expansions as well as new machinery and systems in a dozen more of our value-added operations. The continued ramp-up of these facilities will enable us to capture a higher share of the expanding offsite fabrication end market.  Our ongoing operational excellence initiatives continued to gain momentum, contributing $25 million to adjusted EBITDA in 2019 alone, which was well ahead of our $14 million to $16 million target. These best practices are being implemented throughout the organization to make our company more agile and easier to do business with while generating strong financial returns. Key initiatives in process include investments in distribution and logistics software, pricing and margin management tools, back-office processes, process efficiencies and information system enhancements. The rollout of our pricing optimization has been particularly successful and is showing tangible results. Where implemented, we have provided our associates with faster and more accurate pricing information, along with customized market tools and analytics, enabling us to execute our strategy on a local level.  Our 16,000 associates are key to our success. Ensuring that we hire, train and retain the best people continues to be a top priority. We added or promoted 250 new sales team members in 2019 and invested in leadership and succession planning programs to ensure a pipeline of future leaders. We also rolled out sales training tools to every region to systematically drive productivity in our high-caliber sales culture. We are committed to growing and developing talent throughout our organization.  I will now turn the call over to Peter, who will review our fourth quarter financial results in more detail.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. I'm proud of our team's work in delivering another quarter of strong results and focusing on the controllable aspects of our business, stellar fourth quarter performance built on our year's -- full year's work to produce above-market growth and expand margins and generate outstanding cash flow, all in line or ahead of our expectations.  We had a $1.8 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter, down 2.9% due to anticipated commodity deflation with decreased sales -- which decreased sales by 10.6%. The commodity headwind offset estimated sales volume growth of 7.7%. Our value-added product categories again led the way with a 9% increase over the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting the execution of our strategic plan and the emphasis of our business on those key products.  Gross margins of $476.6 million decreased by $16.2 million or down 3.3% due to the impact of lower year-over-year commodity prices on net sales. Our gross margin percentage remained strong at 27% as a direct result of an improved product mix, driven by our team's continued focus on delivering higher-margin, value-added solutions to our customers.  Year-over-year pricing and commodity cost dynamics impacting the fourth quarter were consistent with what we have discussed on our prior calls. Commodity cost deflation causes short-term gross margin percentage expansion when prices drop rapidly relative to our short-term pricing commitments that we provide customers. We experienced this benefit during the fourth quarter of 2018. In the second half of 2019, this benefit did not recur. Commodity prices remained essentially stable relative to our fixed-price contracts in the fourth quarter of 2019, producing a gross margin percentage closer to our long-term normalized levels.  Our SG&A as a percentage of sales increased by 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis, driven largely by the impact of the aforementioned deflation on sales. In addition, strong volume growth and higher gross margins led to a higher variable compensation in the quarter. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, our incentives increase as our sales team achieves higher margins. This has created a favorable alignment between our sales team and overall operational goals. Accordingly, our strong gross margin percentage gains more than funded the higher commission expenditures in the quarter.  Interest expense for the quarter was $27.5 million compared to $23.4 million in the prior year, an increase of $4.1 million. Excluding the net impact of one-time items related to debt extinguishments, interest expense was down by $2.6 million on a lower outstanding debt balance year-over-year. Fourth quarter EBITDA declined by $15.7 million to $109.3 million, representing the higher end of our guidance. Our strong sales volume growth, particularly in the value-added product categories, partially offset the adverse factors mentioned previously.  Turning to Slide 4. The strength of our business, driven by our national scale and strong local customer relationships, was again evident in the fourth quarter result as U.S. housing starts continued to improve. Higher-margin, value-added products improved to 42% of total sales in the quarter, led by an estimated volume growth of 11% in manufactured products, followed by the estimated volume growth of 7% in windows, doors and millwork. Excluding deflation, our lumber and lumber sheet goods product category also achieved solid growth of 11% in estimated sales volume.  On Slide 6, our fourth quarter sales volume grew an estimated 7.5% in a single family new construction end market. A common thread throughout all parts of the country is that we grew value-added products in the single family market. Our sales volume in R&R and other end markets grew by 6.8% on broad growth. And multifamily sales volume improved by 13.3%, largely due to the timing of projects started earlier in 2019.  Turning to Page 6. For the full year of 2019, we generated $391 million in free cash flow, representing well over 100% of adjusted net income. The exceptionally strong cash flow performance in 2019 was attributable to the added benefit of commodities deflation on inventory and the impact of our operational excellence initiatives, driving working capital improvements. We continue to allocate our capital to strategic priorities, which include organically growing our value-add capacity, funding strategic acquisitions and maintaining the strength of our balance sheet to generate shareholder value.  For the year, we invested approximately 25% of our capital expenditures in our value-added growth initiatives. In addition, we deployed $93 million of cash on acquisitions. We were especially pleased to make these investments while, at the same time, preserving ample liquidity and improving our net leverage ratio. At quarter end, our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio was at the low end of our target range at 2.5x. This represents a 0.6x reduction from the prior year quarter. We ended the year with exceptional capacity and flexibility for future business developments and M&A.  In 2020, we plan to expand our manufacturing and value-added capacity. We're adding 2 new truss and millwork plants, several new truss lines in existing plants and new machinery and systems in a dozen more locations. In total, we expect to again invest around 1/3 of our total 2020 capital expenditures in our value-added growth initiatives and the expansion of our production capacity.  In 2019, we successfully added tuck-in acquisitions as another avenue to advance our growth strategy. The acquisition landscape for our company is very attractive right now, and we have a framework dedicated to accelerating our next-generation of growth. For those of you who have listened to our prior calls, you have heard us speak about the ways in which our value-added products help builders manage labor constraints, construction costs, waste and quality.  As our customers accelerate their adoption of these labor-saving, high-efficiency products, we intend to accelerate our growth plans by supplementing modest organic growth with a focused acquisition strategy. We are scaling our geographic reach, primarily through additional value-add product capacity while taking advantage of technological advancements to best serve our increasingly sophisticated customers.  All of our acquisitions directly align with this strategy. A prime example is our acquisition of Raney Components in December. For more than 20 years, Raney has been pioneering a vertically integrated manufacturing and installation model, which significantly improves productivity and speed for customers. Raney supplies value-added products and then partners with subcontractors to install these products through its professional production builder customers across Florida. Raney's holistic view of the construction process, from design, manufacturing, logistics to trades management and material handling, has leveraged technology to improve cycle times by nearly 1/3 by effectively combining offsite and onsite work. We look forward to taking this model to the next level. Fortunately, we have a very strong balance sheet and an active pipeline of acquisition opportunities to further scale up our success in many markets while remaining mindful of our long-term leverage targets.  Speaking of the long term, let's turn to Slide 9 and look at our long-range plan. During 2019, we executed on our priorities through ongoing initiatives while overcoming adverse market factors to further extend our record of EBITDA growth. As a backdrop for core business growth, the fundamentals of homebuyer demand remain intact, and we continue to see steady -- steadily improving buyer activity. Due in large part to the execution of our team, we were able to generate approximately $35 million of EBITDA in 2019 from what we call our core business and fairly modest growth in single family housing starts. This improvement was more than offset by roughly $100 million of deflationary and fixed cost headwinds.  Within the more controllable aspects of our business, our team's strategic focus was demonstrably successful. Our estimated sales volume within the value-added products categories grew 9%, substantially faster than the market, and contributed approximately $55 million of incremental EBITDA above the 2019 core market growth. This amount is well in excess of the long-term target, and we continue to see significant ongoing opportunities to increase the market penetration of our higher-margin products.  Operational excellence contributed an additional $25 million in EBITDA in 2019, led by the successful rollout of our pricing initiative and the results from our delivery optimization initiative. Our measurable progress proves that we can create substantial strategic and economic value for the organization through efficiencies and through customer service advancements. Overall, we were pleased to record another year of progress against our long-range plan and influence the trajectory of our bottom line amid significant commodity-related headwinds.  Looking forward, we are confident we can continue to deliver additional value through our initiatives, particularly through the more controllable aspects of our business. While we continue to believe that the housing starts will march towards historical averages, we have moderated our dependence on underlying market growth to fully accomplish our long-range plans. With our overall focus on controlling the trajectory of our EBITDA growth, we intend to further supplement organic growth with targeted acquisition -- with the targeted acquisition strategy that we discussed earlier. Our emphasis remains on value-added products as a key driver for core business growth and for outperformance versus the market as well as our acquisition strategy.  With this in mind, we have combined the expected contributions to EBITDA from core business growth and value-added product performance to better align with how we view our business and the central role that value-added products hold in our core value creation. Accordingly, our target framework now calls for capturing an incremental $190 million to $210 million in EBITDA from these 2 categories. Additionally, our operational excellence initiatives are also on track. When fully rolled out across our 400 locations, we expect these initiatives to deliver an additional $30 million to $40 million in cost benefits while further differentiating our service levels and strengthening our value proposition with customers.  The enhancements to our long-term value creation plan, combined with a supportive macro backdrop, not only gives us confidence that we will achieve our goals, but also puts us on track to deliver $750 million in EBITDA in 2022. This translates to EPS between $3 and $3.50. Cash flow remains a priority. And we intend to achieve greater than 85% conversion of our adjusted net income to free cash flow over time. We expect to use the substantial cash that we generate to both fund our high-return investments and to maintain our long-term target net leverage ratio between 2.5 and 3.5x.  Moving to Slide 11 and looking forward to our first quarter and full year 2020 expectations. We remain confident in our team's ability to execute on market opportunities, mitigate commodity cost dynamics and deliver the initiatives within our control. We will have 1 additional selling day in the first quarter of 2020 versus the prior year, so our guidance will be provided on a sales per day basis.  We expect first quarter net sales per day to increase between 6% and 10% over the prior year quarter, led by value-added products. This includes the impact of commodity inflation of approximately 2%. Gross margin is anticipated to decline 80 to 100 basis points sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2019 as we return to our normalized margin range of 26% to 26.5%. First quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $90 million and $100 million, supported by continued focus on cost discipline and efficiency improvements. We expect an effective tax rate in the first quarter slightly below our long-term rate of 23%.  For the full year of 2020, we expect the single family customer segment growth in the mid-single-digits range; R&R growth in the low single-digits range; and the multifamily end market to remain flattish. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $550 million to $580 million. Similar to prior years, we expect the first quarter to be our smallest EBITDA quarter, followed by our seasonally stronger second and third quarters, which are deeper into the homebuilding season. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately 1.5% of full year sales.  Regarding cash taxes, we expect to have cash taxes in the $50 million to $55 million range, commensurate with our 23% long-term effective guide. Cash interest is expected to be approximately $90 million to $95 million. Interest expense is also expected to be around $90 million to $95 million plus approximately $25 million in call premiums and fees related to the redemption of debt transacted in the first quarter for a total interest expense of approximately $110 million to $115 million.  The continued execution of our strategic plan amid a firm macroeconomic environment puts us on firm footing to achieve our full year 2020 goals while moving us ever closer to delivering on our long-range objectives in the coming years. Our company is well positioned to be the building supply company of choice for builders, thanks to our enhanced geographic reach, diversified product offerings, national manufacturing capabilities and strong partnerships with our customers.  Our market-leading investments in value-added products and ongoing growth initiatives enable us to provide productivity solutions to help our customers meet the changing demands of homebuyers. We are excited about our plans to deliver greater value through our operational excellence initiatives as well as capitalizing on a stronger economy and our accretive acquisition pipeline. We are growing in the right markets, emphasizing the right products in our portfolio and upgrading our capabilities to accelerate our next-generation growth strategy.  I would especially like to thank our 16,000 team members across the country for their hard work and the part they each play in achieving our record results. Our entire team is excited to continue creating consistent value for our customers and delivering strong results for our shareholders in 2020 and beyond.  Operator, we can now open up the call for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will be from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.
Christina Chiu: This is actually Christina Chiu on for Matt this morning. My first question is on kind of the outlook for value-added product sales growth in the first quarter. I know you've mentioned 6% to 10% net sales per day growth. But how much of this is going to be from the value-added segment?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So we don't generally break that out on the guide. But we do expect to see continued outperformance. It's an area that we've committed to. We certainly see it growing faster than market. And it's an area where we will continue to benefit from both the market growth as well as the additional capacity that we've added.
Christina Chiu: Okay, makes sense. And then just on the future pipeline for kind of more tuck-in acquisitions in 2020, I know you'd mentioned a framework. Can you provide any more details in terms of how those acquisitions are expected to track throughout the year and then geographically, if there are any markets that you're targeting specifically?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So I won't get too specific, to be honest. I mean I want to be able to keep a little bit of surprise factor for the future and for obvious competitive reasons. But we certainly have talked a lot about where tuck-ins are going to be an advantage for us in the growth of our value add, particularly in markets where maybe we either haven't played at all or haven't played as much in the past. Around the country, we're in 77 of the top 100 MSAs, but clearly some MSAs where we don't play. There are certainly markets where we are, but we believe that we could be a better competitor, a better provider for our homebuilding customers. And frequently, tuck-in acquisitions are a good way to execute growth in those markets, particularly when you're balancing the desire to grow with the available capacity in the market.  We're not interested in coming in and adding a bunch of unneeded capacity. We don't think that's healthy for us or the market. So like we've talked about in the past, we certainly like markets where there are a lot of starts. We've engaged in Florida, Phoenix, Las Vegas. I think those are healthy markets, but we're certainly not limited to those. Unfortunately, the timing is pretty tricky. We -- they sort of come as the opportunity presents itself. And the desire to be thorough in our due diligence and thoughtful in our valuation sort of spreads those out to a degree. But we certainly have a significant pipeline. We're very pleased with the opportunities that are being presented at this point. And we're continuing to hunt those down.
Operator: Your next question will be from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Dahl: My first question is on SG&A. So based on the 1Q guide, it still looks like you may not be leveraging SG&A year-on-year. And just wanted to get a sense of how we should think about the moving pieces. It seems like there's a lot going on between the new acquisitions layering in, maybe the commodity-based gross margin incentive being a little lower this year, some of your underlying initiatives kind of blended all up. How should we think about SG&A leverage for the year in those pieces?
Peter Jackson: Yes. No, fair question. I think that probably the most important thing to point out is that, that fourth quarter number, I know it -- from a percentage basis, shows a deleveraging. But if you look at it on a year-over-year expenditure basis, we did quite well. It's a flat number and going into Q1, certainly another healthy performance. It will move, of course, year-over-year. We'll see increases in terms of wages and inflation that you would expect to see. But our performance is far more steady and attributable to volume from a pure spending perspective. What we're still working through, and what I think as everyone is seeing, is the lapping of the deflationary tailwind that we experienced in the fourth quarter of '18 and then in the first quarter off '19. I'd say that's the biggest part of the story.  Core business, running great, excited about the growth. I think we're in a position to continue our outperformance. But that outperformance, that exceptional margin from the benefit of that deflation in Q1 of '19 will be lapped. There's no way around it. It was good news then, certainly pleased we got it, but it's gone. The good news, I would say, is that it will be pretty much the last of it. In our estimation, that will be in the rearview mirror after Q1. So going Q2 forward, we're looking at more normalized performance.
Michael Dahl: Okay. And I assume that last comment related to gross margin. But I guess just back to the SG&A for a second. So should we still think about this then with everything normalizing out that you're still roughly 70% variable, 30% fixed?
Chad Crow: Yes. That's a fair estimate.
Peter Jackson: Yes. That's a good look-forward.
Michael Dahl: All right. My other question, you mentioned taking Raney to the next level. And so just wanted to get a little more color on that about how much is expanding Raney within Florida versus rolling out some of that vertical integration framework to some of your other existing markets and businesses there and a sense of kind of what we should expect from a timing perspective there.
Chad Crow: I would say we're still kind of in the learning phase on the Raney acquisition. As you know, we already had a pretty healthy footprint in the Orlando area. And so right now, we're still kind of in the integration phase and talking with customers that we both served and making sure that all that's going to work out smoothly. But the longer-term plan, as you mentioned, is certainly to continue to evaluate, whether it's expanding the Raney model or through other tuck-in acquisitions, adding to the -- to our value-add product and services offering, which will likely include some sort of vertical integration, like we saw with Raney.  I would say the next step with Raney would be to expand it just to a broader geographical area within Florida. He doesn't reach up towards Jacksonville a whole lot, for example. And clearly, we have a nice footprint there. And so I think there's going to be opportunities to expand that model into Jacksonville in the near term. But it's not something that's going to happen overnight, and we want to make sure we're thoughtful about it.
Michael Dahl: Okay. And Chad, enjoy the retirement.
Chad Crow: Yes, thanks.
Operator: Our next question will be from Trey Morrish with Evercore.
James Morrish: I guess the first place I want to start is back into your 1Q organic volume guide. It seems like it's a number like around 2.5% or so at the midpoint of your range, which seems a bit low considering all the housing tailwinds we're seeing from a macro front, from build-to-order front. So I'm just wondering, is there something going on in 1Q that makes that number seemed a little or bit low? Or just how to, in general, think about all the high demand we're seeing elsewhere and you putting out a number that seems a little bit light.
Peter Jackson: Yes. I guess I'm a little bit off. I mean our guide of mid-single digits is, I think, the right underlying number. There is some offsetting impact there. We do account for the shrinking size of the home, a couple of points on deflation for commodities -- or sorry, inflation for commodities. So I think there's many puts and takes there. What I'll tell you though is at this stage, we are absolutely excited about what the market is indicating. We're confident that we're going to be able to take our fair share and then some in terms of our performance versus the market.  So I guess my takeaway on that is whatever the market brings, we're going to be -- we'll be participating in it fully and then some. Our, I would say, rollout of guidance for Q1 is certainly focused on kind of the preliminary numbers that we saw coming into the year, which I think is fairly modest, it's one of the smaller obviously quarters of the year. So we're going to start with a reasonable point and then we'll grow from there as the market shows itself.
Chad Crow: And then clearly, it was a pretty easy comp year-over-year on the housing starts number, Q4 '19 versus '18, and a bit of a head scratcher. To me, there seems to be a little bit of noise in those numbers. And as Peter indicated, as these starts, assuming they are real rollover into units under construction, I fully expect we're going to get our fair share of that. There's no reason we wouldn't. But I think this time of year, especially as the slower time as far as the pace of construction, given the typical weather delays. So I would expect that, as Peter said, that's a great indicator of things to come. And we'll get our fair share when those do become units in construction.
James Morrish: Okay. Well, I'll try and follow up more on that on a later call. On the gross margin front, clearly a big -- another big benefit this quarter from lumber. And you ended up 40 bps above the high end of your previous guide. So I'm just wondering, what kind of drove that improved delta in 4Q? And is the entire step-down from 4Q to 1Q entirely due to lumber -- the lumber deflation falling away?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So I want to be careful about sort of breaking this into two pieces. On a year-over-year basis, the EBITDA dollars and the margin change is certainly because of that deflation tailwind we had last year and not seeing this year. In terms of the level of margins where we are today, I think that, that has a lot more to do with the mix that we've seen and sort of the pricing disciplines that we've experienced. But I think we've been pretty open about our expectation that there's a certain amount of normalization that's still happening in the marketplace as it comes to -- when it comes to certain categories of product and prices. And we do see it returning to a more normalized level.  That's why we keep talking about this sort of 26% to 26.5% being a more normalized level, assuming commodities don't move in a material way. Now we've seen some indications that there could be some pretty interesting moves in terms of commodities going up, saw that over the past few weeks. Just to reiterate, we like higher prices in commodities. We think that's a benefit to us. We will pass those along as appropriate. So while there might be a near-term pinch on some of our gross margin percentages, we certainly are pleased with the general trajectory in what commodities have been doing lately. Assuming they sort of keep on a reasonable pace, we think we'll do well with it.
Operator: Our next question will be from Trey Grooms from Stephens Inc.
Trey Grooms: And first off, Chad, I want to congratulate you on your retirement as well.
Chad Crow: Appreciate it, Trey. I'm not out here yet, you may not be done with me just yet.
Trey Grooms: Okay. Well, so first off, I want to touch first on that comment, Peter, that you just made. So you've been saying over the last several quarters, you've seen some pricing disciplines. And I guess the question I have is you just mentioned something about things kind of returning to more normal, not sure if you were kind of pointing to those -- the market maybe not being as disciplined on some of these things as it had been before. I guess is the -- has that pricing discipline continued? Or has it kind of gotten to reverting back to a little bit more competitive market out there?
Peter Jackson: I would say it's uneven, depending on where you are in the country. But there have been certain markets that have gotten more aggressive again and more competitive again. I would say it's -- the question has never been what is the market likely to do, it's when is the market likely to do it. And so in our mind, in the fourth quarter, it hung on a little longer than we thought. So we felt good about it, and I think our guidance in the first quarter indicates what we've seen. As we've moved into the 2020 bids, people have tried to make sure they got their fair share. I know it's not a shock to anybody on this call that when you take as much share as we did in 2019, people fight back. And we're in the trenches every day bidding it out. And it's a competitive market out there. And I'm proud of our team. I think we're doing a great job. And I also think that our guide for Q1 in terms of margins is a fair one.
Chad Crow: Not lose sight of the fact that 26% to 26.5% is well above our long-term average margin. And as you know, Trey, that has a lot to do with our investment and value-add products and services. So I think we guided pretty well along the way. But this is where we were going to bottom out. And I think it took a little longer than we thought to bottom out, which was nice, but still a very healthy spot to be right now.
Trey Grooms: Absolutely. And I guess that kind of leads to the next question. And I don't know if you may have kind of answered this earlier. But the new kind of normal of 26% to 26.5%, as you mentioned, still well above what we've seen historically as a normal. But the 1Q guide kind of puts you towards the lower end of that range of 26% to 26.5%, not by much. But just as we look through the rest of the year with the guidance that you've given, the EBITDA guidance you've given us, should we see opportunity to see that kind of creep up a little bit towards maybe the mid- or higher end of that range? Or is the kind of lower end of the range the place we should be thinking about for the full year?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So I think it's fair to say that, as we get into the busier months, our leverage and our capacity utilization increases, which is a good result for us on that gross profit margin line. So I think it's fair to say there is some seasonality to that number with the winter months being the lowest capacity and the lowest margins as a result. And I think the other question is just working through the commodities, we'll have to wait and see what that does.
Trey Grooms: Right, absolutely. Okay. And then last one for me. I know there's been some -- outside of lumber, there's been increases announced with other products that you guys sell. I know gypsum is not a big piece for you guys. But wallboard had an announcement out there. The door industry and players there, looks like they're pushing for increases as well. Can you give us an idea of kind of what you're seeing out there for kind of other products outside of lumber and what your kind of expectation is for inflation there and how you expect to kind of push that through or how that's going to work out?
Chad Crow: Well, certainly on the high end of the spectrum would be the price increases on doors. I do think all or substantially all of that is going to stick. You mentioned wallboard, who knows, that's always a bit of a wildcard, and as you said, not a big part of our business. In between there, it's really just been kind of normal price increases that we've come to expect and our customers have come to expect. And you get a bit of an advanced notice when those are coming and you communicate them and pass them on to your customers, and they're typically a nonevent.
Operator: Our next question will be from John Baugh with Stifel.
John Baugh: And my congrats as well, Chad, well deserved.
Chad Crow: Thank you, sir.
John Baugh: I think you mentioned, Chad, I don't know whether there's more attractive acquisition opportunity. I know you, as a company, are in a better position with your balance sheet. I was curious, are you seeing something from the potential targets that's making you more excited? Or is it more just your internal capacity?
Chad Crow: Well, certainly we're in a better place now than we have been in recent years just from a balance sheet flexibility standpoint. So that's encouraging. We've always been an acquirer. And so I'd lie if I'd say we weren't getting a little antsy over the years to -- we've seen a lot of stuff in the pipeline that we really just couldn't even take the time to evaluate because we were busy finalizing the ProBuild integration and getting our balance sheet back in order. So that part is exciting.  Just as far as the pipeline though, there's a lot of companies out there, but I will say most of them are very small. You're talking $50 million in revenue and less, typically. But nonetheless, there's some good value-add opportunities out there. And so we've always got a handful of them we're looking at. Some are going to work out, some won't. But I think just in general, we're really pleased with the deleveraging we've accomplished in the past few years. And it's fun just to be able to look at the pipeline again and take some of these serious.
John Baugh: Yes, for sure. I guess what I was trying to get at a little bit is, are you seeing, in some cases, targets you're approaching recently or maybe approached them a long time ago, where they're may be a little more willing to acquiesce because of what you've been able to do with the ones you buy? Or do they view you as an increasing threat if they don't partner up with you? Is there any kind of examples of that?
Chad Crow: Well, there's a handful of those. A decent chunk of the ones we did in '19, we had been kind of cultivating those relationships for a while. And clearly, we had to wait until our balance sheet was in order. And those worked out. And so we have a few of those. But no, beyond that, I wouldn't say the landscape has changed all that much.
Peter Jackson: The one thing we've noticed is that it appears that there was some pretty frothy valuations out there for a period of time. And I think people were quite excited about what they might potentially get for their business, even small tuck-ins. And that seems to have settled down a little bit. I think there seems to be a little bit more rationality in terms of valuation. So that part is exciting for me, at least.
John Baugh: And you mentioned some noise in the latest housing numbers. And of course, we're in a seasonally low period and we're going up against some year-over-year easy compares, as you mentioned. I wonder if you could -- I'm a little worried that some investors just look at these percentages -- and of course, some of the units are smaller, as you've talked about. I just wondered if you could put into a real context of what -- you mentioned single -- I think, mid-single-digit increase for single family. So I guess we're going to see completions up pretty nice year-over-year in the first half of the year, then I guess the back half is a little bit unknown. But wonder if you could put any little more color around the housing data and the macro backdrop for '20.
Chad Crow: For me, it's a bit of a head scratcher because at the end of '18, we saw some year-over-year decreases. And to be honest, we really didn't feel it in our business. Our volumes held up and we just kind of powered right through it. And now you're coming off that and you've got an easy comp this year and, as we said earlier, business feels good. I don't -- right now, I don't see a 15% surge in volume coming because of the starts numbers we saw in Q4. So this -- to me, it just feels like there is a little noise in there. And of course, you've always got the lag you have to deal with. We don't sell to a start. We sell to a unit under construction. And so there's just different ebbs and flows throughout the year. We try not to get too hung up on it. I mean to me, the bigger picture is we beat considerably for the full year '19. And I think looking over a broader period tells a better story. When you try to isolate it down to a couple of months or a quarter, you'll just drive yourself crazy.
Operator: Our next question will be from Keith Hughes with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Keith Hughes: I've got a couple of questions. First, a clarification, there was some discussion of gross margin beyond the first quarter, which you've given us discrete guidance on. What rough range are we looking for in this guidance for 2020, I think, are 26% to 26.5%?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I mean I would say for the broad guidance for us is, yes, that's the best range at this point.
Keith Hughes: Somewhere in that range would be the number for the year?
Peter Jackson: Yes.
Keith Hughes: Okay. And if we look specifically in the first quarter, with -- we've seen frame and lumber move up here in the last really couple of months, although at a fairly orderly pace. Is there any kind of pass-through lag that you've assumed in the first quarter guidance?
Peter Jackson: Yes. Well, I mean I'd say always, the nature of the business is we don't -- the prices don't move the day that the random blank quote changes. So I think what we said in the past is it takes about a quarter or 2 for those prices to work through, depending on the market. Some markets, it's within 30 days. Other markets, it might take to the end of the second quarter out, depending on the price locks. So it will take time to work through. Like you said, it's been fairly orderly, which we like. But any time you have a run-up in commodities, we'll perform like we have, right? We'll continue to increase prices. We'll get that gross margin dollars. And during that intervening exposure period, we'll have a little bit of pinch on a gross margin percentage line.
Keith Hughes: Okay. And then switching a little bit longer term on the guidance or the numbers you talked about on Slide 10, we've seen those for a while now. If you look at 2020, you've done some acquisitions. Do you -- I assume you expect value-added to grow faster than the rest of the business as was the case in '19. Do you think that's going to accelerate in '20 to an even faster number? Or will it be more orderly in '20 and beyond?
Chad Crow: Is the question, will the rate of acceleration or the rate at which value-added is outperforming?
Keith Hughes: Yes. It's really like a tipping point, where you hit where you can all of a sudden grow that even faster as you -- particularly given all the capacity you're adding and things of that nature, is that just a little too much to expect?
Chad Crow: My gut would say it's going to grow as fast or slightly faster. It should grow a little faster, given the investments we're making in both our internal capacity and the acquisitions that we've made. So that's where I'd put my bet as faster or slightly faster. I don't see it shrinking at this point.
Operator: Our next question will be from Seldon Clarke with Deutsche Bank.
Seldon Clarke: So you guys saw some pretty impressive market share wins in 2019. I understand some of that government data may have been unreliable from earlier in the year. But how are you thinking about market share wins relative to starts on a go-forward basis? And if starts wind up exceeding your mid-single-digit outlook, how comfortable are you from a capacity and labor standpoint that you could efficiently scale alongside this type of growth?
Peter Jackson: Yes, I think we feel really good about it. Looking at the capacity numbers internally, aligning that with the investments we're making and the CapEx investments in the year as well as the new facilities and the acquisitions, I think we're lined up very well to take advantage of the market growth. I think our teams have been doing a good job competitively. I think there's every reason to believe that the product offering, the product portfolio, combined with the quality of our team, means that we're going to keep gaining share. I'm not going to go out of limb and give you a point prediction on it. But we feel good about it. I think there's every reason to believe we're going to be able to grow with the market in 2020. And so like I said, we've got a mid-single-digits number there in starts and happy to have the market prove us wrong. I think we've been pretty well served at taking a rational and reasonable forecasting approach on starts. It's been a slow grind to get back. So we think we can do quite well in that market and even better if it accelerates more quickly.
Seldon Clarke: Okay. That's helpful. And then you talked a lot about just the shrinking footprint of homes and how that impacts. I guess could you talk about how that impacts your volume growth across the various product groups? So I would imagine the relationship for things like doors and windows isn't as linear as something like lumber. So could you just give a little bit of color on the relationship there?
Peter Jackson: Sure. Yes. I mean the way we've talked about it in the past is really around the sort of the obvious variables. I think you hit the nail on the head. If the Census department says we're down 1% in the average square footage of the home, you'll have a mix of impacts, depending on what it is that you're selling. Generally speaking, there is a fairly linear number and when it comes to linear board feet of lumber. However, there is -- there are oftentimes offsets in terms of the amount of value add used, the amount of prefabricated or offsite components used. There are some step function changes. I mean I think you hit the nail on the head again. It's that windows and doors, depending on -- it's more dependent on rooms rather than necessarily the square footage. So it's a little inconsistent in that regard.  And in many cases, a movement to a starter home, they make a few things, a few components in the home simpler or indicate that the economics are changing. So you may have a bit less millwork, obviously some of the finishings may be a bit less high end. But generally, for us, we feel pretty good about it. I mean we want more starts. We are firm believers that, that's the leg of this recovery that is still lagged. We certainly don't see the expansion or the increase in single family starter homes as being somehow detrimental to the rest of the market. We think it's certainly an addition, so feeling good about it overall.
Chad Crow: Yes. That's just a natural progression to get back to the historical building averages, in my opinion. You're going to have smaller homes in order to get back over that 1 million single family start number.
Operator: Our next question will come from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group.
Steven Ramsey: I wanted to think about the long-term plan, just about how much of the plan depends on overall sales growth? How much of it depends on stronger value-added growth? And does it contemplate acquisitions?
Peter Jackson: So yes, there you go, question answered. The reality is as we look at the business, it's become so integrated in terms of the impact of value add and the opportunity is sort of represented by the acquisitions. And any time you do these acquisitions, clearly there's a focus on the value add. But almost inevitably, you end up with a stand-alone business. So you may have some lumber in there. You may have some ancillary parts of the product portfolio that you've added when you've done this addition. And you think about the growth of the overall market and the relative expansion of value add, just in general, faster than starts, it becomes really, really difficult to carve it out and to give you discrete categories.  And so the logic of putting those together is not to be somehow opaque or to hide from you. I just don't think I'd serve you well by trying to give you those buckets independently. I think that what we've done here by calling out 2022 is that we've given you some confidence that this $750 million number is real. We have a line of sight to it. And candidly, there are a couple of different pathways we can take to get there. And we feel good about whichever way we get to that, that's a number that we feel good about putting out there for you to anchor us on.
Steven Ramsey: Great. And then thinking about a goal to penetrate deeper into existing markets and expand the product portfolio, maybe thinking about the product portfolio, does that mean you would contemplate making acquisitions of distributors that focus on more specific product categories outside of your more broad product category focus? Maybe just go into a little deeper color on that initiative.
Chad Crow: I would say we're -- that's not an assumption we have baked into our long-range model. Could it happen? Sure. But that's not kind of the underpinnings of our longer-range model. It's more, hey, where there are markets where we may have already have a presence, but we don't offer our full offering of products and services, it's enhancing that. It's picking up additional truss capacity or additional millwork capacity. So again, not to say it couldn't happen, but that's not part of that growth strategy that we've outlined.
Operator: Our next question will be from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG.
Ryan Gilbert: First question, just a point of clarification on the first quarter '20 guidance. I understand that the 6% to 10% sales growth is a sales per day number, so excluding the impact of the extra sales day that you're getting. Is that $90 million to $100 million of adjusted EBITDA inclusive of the extra sales per day? Or is that also excluding the extra day you're getting?
Peter Jackson: Yes. That is all-in.
Ryan Gilbert: That's all-in. Okay, great. And then I hear what you're saying about the housing starts grow through in the fourth quarter. But we did see new home sales accelerate in the fourth quarter and public builder orders were good as well. And I think in particular, December, January, the strength of demand for housing caught a lot of people by surprise. And maybe the production capacity hadn't ramped up to meet that demand yet. Are you -- as you look at the quarter, so January, February, we're 2/3 of the way done with the quarter here, are you seeing builder production ramp in the field? Or is that something you think it's still to come in the months ahead?
Peter Jackson: Well, I mean this time of year, you're always starting to see the ramp in the markets where you can. The problem is you're not building houses where there's snow on the ground. And the reality is while there's been healthy performance, and I would say all the markets have been very positive, I think the mood is good, it's just too soon to say.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay. I understand. And then last one for me. We saw a large public homebuilder vertically integrate into offsite manufacturing earlier this year. Can you talk about just what that means for your business in Florida? And are other builders considering vertical integration versus buying offsite components directly from you?
Chad Crow: I'll answer that a couple of ways. One, I think it validates our thesis that investing in offsite manufacturing is something that should pay off and something our customers are looking for. We've seen this before. As a matter of fact, gosh, 21 years ago or so, the first acquisition BFS ever made was a spinoff of a similar situation with Pulte Homes back in 1998 or so. The challenge you see there, when it's one homebuilder getting into, say, truss manufacturing, for example, at some point, it's hard to sustain that long term because at some point, if that plan is dependent on only one builder's production needs, at some point, the market gets saturated or built out and all of a sudden, you're delivering these trusses a really long way and it makes it become less economical. So we'll see how it plays out. It doesn't surprise me. And again, it's -- I think that's where the industry is heading, to more vertical integration, offsite manufacturing. And if it doesn't work out for them, then maybe we buy that business in a couple of years from them. I guess we'll see.
Operator: Our next question will be from Reuben Garner with The Benchmark Company.
Reuben Garner: And congrats, Chad. Good luck in retirement if we don't hear from you again.
Chad Crow: Appreciate it.
Reuben Garner: So most of my questions have been answered, just a quick clarification for me and then a question. So clarification on Q1, going back to that question about your volume embedded in that guidance is -- the way I'm reading it is more of a -- it looks like 2% at the midpoint for inflation and then it would be 6% volume growth embedded in the first quarter. Is that -- am I seeing that correctly? Or did I miss another piece?
Peter Jackson: No. I think you've got the gist of it. Yes.
Reuben Garner: Okay. And so your outlook for the full year, I know you didn't guide specifically, but it looks like somewhere in the low to mid-single digits is kind of what you're expecting from a volume standpoint just given your end markets, maybe a little bit better than that with your outperformance. But is the way to think about that seasonally that you guys may do a little better than that in the first half if your comparisons are a little easier, but as we move into the back half, barring some sort of acceleration in the end markets that it might slow a little bit just because you're up against such difficult comps, you guys had a great second half of this year?
Peter Jackson: That's a good question. I think that the performance throughout all of 2019 was pretty solid. I think that once we lap past the last of the deflation, things are going to stabilize obviously depending -- assuming commodities doesn't do anything kooky. But the overall performance and the results of the starts coming through this year, I think there's reason to believe we see pretty stable performance as we get through the back half of the year as well. I don't think we anticipate a significant tail-off because our -- I think our performance in '19 was pretty solid throughout the year as well.
Reuben Garner: Okay, great. And then I'll sneak one more in. That Slide 9, where you guys break down the 2019 EBITDA kind of contributors, I know you're combining 2 of them. But can you give us any color on what's kind of embedded in your full year guidance from an OpEx perspective -- operational excellence or savings perspective versus what you're including from just core growth and value-added business growth...
Peter Jackson: For '20?
Reuben Garner: Yes, for '20.
Peter Jackson: Yes. We're in that 14% to 16% band again. That's what, I think, is the right number for '20, had a great year in '19.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, Mr. Crow, I'll turn it back to you for closing remarks.
Chad Crow: Thank you. Really appreciate everyone joining our call today, and we look forward to updating you on our first quarter results. And if you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Binit or Peter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Builders FirstSource's Third Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Following the company's remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be available at www.bldr.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Binit Sanghvi, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Binit Sanghvi: Thank you. Chantelle. Good morning and welcome to Builders FirstSource third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me on the call today are Chad Crow, Chief Executive Officer and Peter Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. A copy of the slide presentation referenced on this call is available on the Investor Relations section of the Builders FirstSource website at bldr.com.

I will now turn the call over to Chad Crow.
Chad Crow: Good morning and thank you for joining us. I will start on slide two. Our team delivered an impressive performance in the third quarter, building on our year-to-date progress to produce above market growth, expand margins and generate outstanding cash flow. I'm proud to say that we recorded the 13th straight quarter of year-over-year increases in adjusted EBITDA and achieved an EBITDA margin of 8.1% of sales, our highest quarterly percentage since our 2015 acquisition of ProBuild. Our ongoing strategic investments in market leading value-added products capacity has provided the targeted growth, margin and customer value benefits we anticipated. Our operational excellence initiatives also continued to gain momentum and are contributing to our results. And notably our strong cash flow and working capital management continue to fund our investments, which included an acquisition of three strategic truss manufacturing plants and further pay down of debt. We were especially pleased to achieve the low end of our long-term targeted ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.5 times as of the end of the quarter. We believe our success is a direct result of our commitment to our strategic initiatives. Our momentum in sales volume during the quarter continued from the strong first half of 2019, supported by an improvement in our -- in all of our end markets. For the first nine months of the year, sales volume, excluding commodity deflation, grew by more than 6%. Once again, our value-added product categories led the volume growth, increasing its sales volume by an estimated 9% in the first nine months, as we continue to realize the benefit from years of strategic investments. Commodity deflation negatively impacted sales by nearly 13%, which led to an overall decline in reported sales of 7%. Despite the headwinds, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 8% compared to the same year-to-date period last year, thanks largely to our team's focus on executing our growth strategy that drove a 300 basis point improvement in gross margin percentage. Our operational excellence initiatives continue to have a positive impact on our results. As mentioned on our previous calls, we are executing upon key initiatives with specific action plans in four key areas; enhanced business analytics, pricing management tools, our My BFS Builder customer portal and delivery optimization technology. During the first nine months, we saw the benefit of these initiatives, especially with our pricing tool implementation and delivery optimization platform, which has improved our distribution network in terms of speed, uptime and reliability. At the same time, we have laid the groundwork to enhance efficiency and other areas such as on-time delivery and inventory management, which Peter will discuss in more detail. We remain on track and expect a benefit of between $14 million and $16 million to our adjusted EBITDA in 2019 from these initiatives. Our market leading network of value-added, offsite component manufacturing facilities has positioned us well to meet the growing demand from homebuilders for productivity and efficiency in the face of ongoing increases to labor cost and scarcity. In July 2019, we expanded our presence to the Las Vegas and Phoenix markets by purchasing three truss manufacturing facilities. Our ongoing organic investments also continued during the quarter and we are on track to have two new Greenfield truss plants and approximately eight new truss lines in existing plants by year-end. In addition, we are investing indoor facility expansions, as well as, new machinery and systems and a dozen more of our value-added operations. We will continue to invest in expanding our industry leading production capacity, sales force and distribution network. Our commitment to broadening this competitive advantage has what has led to our above market growth and outstanding track record of performance. I will now turn the call over to Peter, who will share our third quarter financial results in more detail.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. I'm especially proud of our team's work in delivering another quarter of improvement in the controllable aspects of our business. We achieved $2 billion in net sales in the third quarter, down 6.5% versus the prior year period. We have one additional sales day in the third quarter of 2019, compared to the prior year quarter. So, I will speak to our sales drivers on a sales per day basis for better comparability. Net sales per day declined by 8% due to commodity deflation, which decreased sales by an estimated 17.4%. The commodity headwind mass robust sales volume growth of 9.4%, a rate significantly above the overall U.S. starts market. The largest contributor to this growth was once again our value-added product categories, which increased 11% over the third quarter of 2018, reflecting the ongoing execution of our strategic plan. Gross margin of $541.1 million increased by $18.4 million or 3.5% over the prior year. Our gross margin percentage increased to its historical high at 27.3%, representing a 260 basis point improvement compared to the same period a year ago. The margin percentage increase was attributable to several factors, including an improved product mix, as our team continued to maintain focus on delivering higher margin value-added solutions to our customers. Additionally, the decline in the cost of commodities along with our team's continued focus on pricing discipline contributed favorably to gross margin. In regards to pricing and commodity costs, as we have discussed on prior calls, market cost inflation causes short-term gross margin percentage compression when prices rise rapidly, relative to the short-term pricing commitments we provide to customers. We experienced this temporary contraction during the third quarter of 2018. Conversely, gross margin percentage expansion occurs when costs rapidly decline. This quarter, commodity prices dipped a bit lower before recovering to levels in line with the beginning of the quarter. As a result, we believe the tailwind that we have experienced for most of 2019 has concluded as commodity prices remain stable, which we expect will return gross margin percentages to more normalized levels in the fourth quarter. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales increased by 190 basis points on a year-over-year basis, driven largely by the impact of deflation on sales. In addition, strong volume growth and higher gross margin led to higher variable compensation in the quarter. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, our incentives increase as our sales team achieves higher margins. Accordingly, our strong gross margin percentage gains more than funded the higher commission expenditures in the quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $27.8 million compared to $29.1 billion in the prior year, a decrease of $1.3 million, excluding a $3.1 million charge related to a debt financing transaction executed in the third quarter of 2019. Interest expense declined by $4.4 million, largely due to lower outstanding debt balances. During the quarter, we issued an additional $75 million in notes that mature in 2027. The net proceeds were used to repay a portion of our 2024 notes. This is another step in prudently managing our by extending existing maturities, while simultaneously reducing our overall leverage ratio. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $84 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared to $77.8 million or $0.67 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase of $6.2 million or $0.05 per share was primarily driven by the improved operating results, combined with lower adjusted interest expense. Third quarter EBITDA grew by $5.5 million or 3.5% to $160.3 million, the highest in our history, driven by the growth in gross margin mentioned previously. Turning to slide four, the strength of our business, driven by our national scale and strong local customer relationships was again evident in the third quarter results, as U.S. housing starts improved. Our team grew net sales across our value-added and non-commodity related product categories. Excluding deflation, our lumber and lumber sheet goods product category also achieved solid growth in estimated sales volume. We are committed to the expansion of our component manufacturing network, strategically located across the country. We continue to build upon the strength of our existing network and as Chad mentioned, we are pleased to have added Sun State Components to the Builders FirstSource family along with its three additional truss manufacturing facilities, bringing our total to 61. Turning to Page five, our third quarter sales volume per day grew over 9% in the single-family new construction end market compared to an increase of 4% in overall U.S. single family starts. Regional strength in parts of the East and improvement in Texas, as well as, the Pacific Northwest contributed to our outperformance. A common thread throughout all parts of the country is that we grew value-added products across our footprint. Our sales volume in R&R and other end markets, increased by 11%, driven by solid home improvement activity in Southern California. Multi-family sales volume improved by 5.8% largely due to the timing of projects compared to the prior year. Turning to Page six, I'll first point out that we now define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment or CapEx. This quarter, we have updated the metric to exclude acquisitions and other cash investments for better comparability to peers and to more clearly delineate between our discretionary free cash flow and our strategic capital allocation priorities. For the first nine months of 2019, we have generated $282 million in free cash flow, representing well over 100% of adjusted net income. Although our business typically uses cash in the first half of the year and generates cash in the second half due to seasonal working capital needs. The exceptionally strong cash flow performance so far in 2019 is due to the impact of commodity deflation and our operational excellence initiatives driving working capital improvements. We continue to allocate our capital to strategic priorities, which include growing our value add capacity, funding strategic acquisitions and further improving our balance sheet to generate shareholder value. We remain on track to invest approximately 25% of our total 2019 capital expenditures in our value-added growth initiatives and expansion of our production capacity. During the third quarter, we funded our acquisition with approximately $34 million in cash. We were especially pleased to make these investments, while at the same time preserving ample liquidity and further improving our net leverage ratio. At quarter-end, our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.5 times. This represented a 1.4 times reduction from the prior year quarter and at the low end of our target range of 2.5 times to 3.5 times improving the strength of our balance sheet and providing capacity and flexibility for future business developments and M&A. Moving to slide seven, the roll-out of our operational excellence initiatives is driving greater working capital efficiencies through our disciplined framework, designed around systems, tools and processes that are directly aligned with our cash flow performance objectives. A key catalyst here is that these initiatives are not only a benefit to Builders FirstSource, but also significantly benefit our customers. For example, the implementation of our delivery optimization systems improves the reliability and efficiency of our outbound logistics network, while minimizing transport and storage costs. By ensuring efficiency throughout the distribution process, we improve inventory days through higher turns and reduced cycle times. Our customer also benefits from increased on-time delivery, which in turn drives higher satisfaction rates. Similarly, adoption of our customer portal My BFS Builder is supporting increased online payments, allowing for faster and more efficient cash collections. While this achieves faster cash collections for us, customers also receive the benefit of having 24/7 access to key business information like orders, deliveries invoices and statements. The speed, benefit and convenience of the portal are perfectly aligned with the dual-goal of efficient capital management and enhanced value to the customer. Our approach is systematic and plans to achieve these improvements are measurable. Implementation is rooted in changing the process routines and tools used across our 400 locations. We have regular progress checks to ensure successful execution and that the improvements are sustainable. This includes annual targets, monthly follow-ups, training and corrective action plans as needed. Above all, performance toward achieving the desired results are directly tied to compensation at the local level, in order to provide a proper alignment of incentives. Approximately 60% of our locations have working capital improvements this year and we expect working capital as a percentage of sales to improve by approximately 1.4 percentage points in 2019 contributing to incremental free cash flow. We are demonstrating success at implementing structural changes throughout our organization, consistent with our long-range plans to achieve sustainable cash conversion improvement as we grow net income. Moving to slide eight. Looking forward to our fourth quarter and full year 2019 expectations, we remain confident in our team's ability to execute on market opportunities, mitigate commodity cost dynamics and deliver on the initiatives within our control. We expect fourth quarter net sales per day to decrease between 2% to 5% over the prior year, driven predominantly by the impact of commodity price deflation of between 7% and 10%. Gross margin is anticipated to be down 50 basis points to 70 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2018, as we return to a more normalized margin. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $100 million to $110 million supported by continued focus on cost discipline and efficiency improvements. We expect an effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, slightly below our long-term guidance of 24%. For the full year, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $507 million to $517 million. Capital expenditures are on plan and expected to total approximately 1.5% of full year sales. Regarding cash taxes, we expect to be a federal cash taxpayer again in the fourth quarter of 2019. Cash interest and interest expense are both expected to be approximately $100 million. As we complete our systems integrator work to support our operational initiatives we expect one-time costs of $15 million to $20 million for the year. Consistent with our previously discussed definition, we expect our full year free cash flow to be in the $300 million to $320 million range. Now Chad will provide an update regarding our strategic priorities and outlook.
Chad Crow: Thank you, Peter. As we enter the end of the home buying season, the overall market outlook continues to improve. Homebuilders are increasingly catering to demands of buyers with a more affordable and right size product. Our market leading investments in value-added products and ongoing growth initiatives enable us to provide productivity solutions to help our customers meet the changing demands of homebuyers. In this environment, we are confident that we can continue to -- continue our positive momentum to generate growth in our fourth quarter sales volume in the mid-single digit range, led by single-family activity. Moving to slide nine, based on our meaningful progress to-date against our longer-term targets, we remain confident that our unmatched scale, market diversity and value-added product leadership provides us with substantial opportunities to generate strong returns in our business. Our value creation framework begins with capturing incremental benefits from core business growth as the fundamentals of homebuyer demand remain intact and starts to continue to move toward historical averages. In addition, customers are accelerating the adoption of our labor -- labor saving, high efficiency value-added products, providing significant ongoing opportunities to increase our market share. To meet this demand we will continue to invest in value-added product facilities, the execution of this plan can be seen in our results with the five additions, we are making this year. We see the market opportunity for these higher margin products only increasing as customers recognize the value of these -- the value these products provide and accelerate their adoption. As we discussed today, our value creation plan also includes a set of operational excellence initiatives that are well under way. This includes the roll-out of our distribution and logistics software, pricing and margin management tools, back-office process efficiencies and information system enhancements. When fully rolled out across our roughly 400 locations these initiatives and operational excellence and value-added products are designed to deliver cost benefits and margin expansion. Equally important, we will further differentiate our service levels and strengthen our connectivity and overall value proposition with our customers. The execution of our long-term value creation plan combined with favorable demand tailwinds puts us on track to achieve our goal of $200 million to $270 million in incremental EBITDA, representing a 50% increase as compared to full year 2018, as housing start reach historical averages, this translates to EPS between $3 and $3.50. Our focus on cash will remain a key to delivering shareholder value and we intend to sustain greater than 85% conversion of our adjusted net income to free cash flow. The substantial cash we generate will be used to fund both our high return growth investments and to further improve our financial flexibility. Our national footprint, unmatched manufacturing, scale and exceptional sales force provides us with a platform to capture a larger share of the growth tailwinds in the coming quarters and years. Together, with our ongoing investments in operational excellence and value-added capabilities, these strategic initiatives continue to give me confidence that we will achieve our goal. More broadly, I am confident that our disciplined strategic execution and implementation of the systems, tools and processes has curated a durable platform that will allow us to consistently create value for our customers and shareholders. I would especially like to thank our 15,000 team members across the country for their hard work and the part, they each played in achieving our record profitability. Operator, we can now open the call for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Trey Grooms, Stephens Inc.
Trey Grooms: Hey, good morning. Congrats on a good quarter.
Chad Crow: Thank you. Good morning.
Trey Grooms: And the outlook here for the 4Q also equally impressive and looking at the gross margin guide that you've given us here 26.4% to 26.6%, I think Peter, you mentioned that a lot of the tailwind from commodity -- commodity price deflation has concluded and you expect it to normalize in the 4Q. So, is this 26.4% to 26.6% is that kind of the -- I'm sure it's a lot closer, but is that the normalized gross margin we should be targeting there? Is there any anything else going in there that might be helping it out?
Peter Jackson: Well, we certainly have seen very stable commodity prices over the last few quarters. So, it'd be -- it'd be disingenuous to talk about the near-term impact of deflation as it relates to our pricing commitments. What we have seen that I think is important to note is this -- this sense that there is value in the delivery of the product and the commodity side and that is paid off with slightly higher margins as the value has declined. So I think there has been some stickiness to a little bit of those higher margins, probably a bit more than we anticipated. We think we'll still stay above 26%. But I think there is room for that to drift down a little bit as we go into the upcoming year and years, but we certainly feel good about Q4.
Chad Crow: And I'll just add, Trey, we've seen a little bit better expected result in our pricing initiatives that are part of the operational excellence initiatives. So, that's been really good to see as well and it is contributing to some of that.
Trey Grooms: Great. Great. Okay and then just -- just for clarity. I think you changed how you calculate free cash flow, I think you made a mention of that. But the free cash flow that you're guiding to for full year, the $300 million to $320 million, is that -- how does that compare to the prior goals that you had set may be in the kind of -- I think it was $180 million to $210 million. How does that compare relative to the prior number?
Peter Jackson: Yes, so…
Trey Grooms: I mean, is it your information, I guess how does the calculation compare, is the same or is it different?
Peter Jackson: It is clearly an increase. When we talked about it last time we were around that $200 million range, accounting for the money that we were -- that we were anticipating or that we had announced we were going to invest in Sun State Components. So, there were $34 million of M&A, plus the $200 million, we were about $234 million, pretty substantial increase obviously from that point. We've continued to see strong results in our working capital initiative and we've not seen a bit of the recovery in the pricing of lumber commodities that we thought would happen. So, I think for the year, we're absolutely calling up cash.
Trey Grooms: Got it. Okay. So, that's -- that's kind of the comparable number the $234 million roughly, is kind of the comparable number to the $300 million to $320 million.
Peter Jackson: Yes.
Trey Grooms: Okay, perfect. Well, that's pretty awesome. So, looking at last thing for me before I pass it on, you've got the leverage now at 2.5times the low end of the range, so does is -- what should we expect maybe a pickup in M&A since you're kind of at the low-end or a pickup in pushing and accelerate a little harder in Greenfields and maybe the outlook for Greenfields in 2020 is kind of a lead on to that too?
Peter Jackson: Well, I'll answer the M&A side, there is a -- there is a lot of opportunities we're seeing out there right now. So, I guess, the answer would be, yes, it does clearly, give us more financial flexibility to do M&A. We are still going to be very disciplined about it and make sure that we do deals that make sense strategically from a long-term perspective. But yes, you could see a pickup, like I said, there are a lot of deals out there, we're looking at some. We'll see how they shake out, but we're not going to go crazy. We're going to be disciplined about what we're doing. But it's nice to have that flexibility again.
Chad Crow: As far as the Greenfield, we're looking at two to three Greenfields for next year that we think will come on line. In addition, we'll do, of course, our continued investments in expanding and enhancing the capacity of the existing facilities.
Trey Grooms: Got it. All right. Well, thanks for taking my questions. I'll pass it on. And good luck with the current quarter.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Trey.
Chad Crow: Thanks, Trey.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Matthew Bouley, Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions, and congrats again on the quarter. I wanted to ask a bit about the pricing tools, obviously, lumber prices perhaps creeping back a bit, I guess, around the better single-family market. So, can you kind of discuss what you've seen over the past few weeks with lumber bottoming and moving higher a bit, if that kind of provides a bit of a test. If you guys can kind of point to any tangible improvements you've seen as a result of your pricing initiatives perhaps relative to past years reflecting these efforts. Thank you.
Chad Crow: Yes, lumber has moved a little bit, it hasn't moved significantly. Most of the -- most of the pricing initiatives we've done to date are really focused more outside of the lumber products. And really what we're doing there is creating a lot more structure on a market level basis and more of a market level pricing concept and making it easier on our operators at the local level to do pricing more accurately and quicker, just taking some of the manual process out of it. So, no, I wouldn't say the little bump we've seen in lumber has been as you described a test on our -- on our initiatives because most of those are focused on the categories outside of lumber to-date.
Matthew Bouley: Okay, got it. Thank you for clarifying that. And then I just wanted to ask about the Q4 guide looking at the revenues. I guess, number one, is there -- I didn't hear if there's anything we need to be aware of around selling days there, and then just looking at the implied volume numbers relative to the third quarter. If I'm doing the math right, it would seem you're guiding to a bit of a deceleration and correct me if I'm wrong there. Did you see anything in October, if that's driving that or are you guys just kind of layering in some conservatism, any detail there? Thank you.
Chad Crow: Yes, so look in the fourth quarter forecast is always tricky given the weather patterns, the normal seasonality. It's a challenging quarter as teams really focused on preparing themselves for the lean months and preparing for the upcoming year. Well, we will have one less selling day in the quarter, so that's a factor as well. But we certainly feel good about the performance coming out of the fourth quarter. We -- but we're certainly not pessimistic at this stage where we are seeing the expected increases as the customers are seeing healthy orders coming in. So, we feel good about that and feel pretty optimistic about how things are shaping up for both fourth quarter, but also for 2020.
Matthew Bouley: All right. Got it. Thanks a bunch. And congrats again on the quarter.
Chad Crow: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Mike Dahl, RBC Capital Markets.
Mike Dahl: Good morning, thanks for taking my questions.
Chad Crow: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Dahl: I wanted to ask a question about OSB. So, OSB prices have -- have started to move higher and I think the industry has taken off about 10% capacity over the recent weeks. So, there's an expectation from some of the analysts covering those stocks that you're going to see a material move higher in OSB pricing. Can you remind us how much or what percentage of that -- of your business would OSB represents either in the lumber and sheet goods category or also, if it's part of manufactured products. And just any color around what you're seeing, hearing and how you -- how you think you can manage that?
Peter Jackson: Sure, I can base line it and let Chad, maybe talk about his sense of the market, but the commodities broadly speaking represents right around 40%, just about the same as the value-add of our total sales. Within that category OSB is roughly 30%. So, overall, maybe 12% of sales, OSB is not a substantial part of the manufacturing components, obviously lumber is, but not a substantial part. It only comes into play when we've got wall panels with applied sheeting.
Chad Crow: Yes. And I'll just I'll just comment on some of the curtailments that have been announced. Long-term, as we've talked about over the years as we prefer higher prices and so if it does -- if some of these curtailments does lift prices that's a good thing. As you know, we will see a little bit of margin compression in the interim, but longer term that's a good thing for us. We view some of the curtailments more as taken off some of the incremental capacity that's come online in the last year or two. So, our view is, yes, it will help firm prices, but I think a lot of it is still going to depend on the demand that we see, especially going into the spring building season next year. But in my mind curtailment is a good thing because we prefer the higher prices. And as far as managing through it, I'm not worried about that. My gosh look what we managed through back in 2018 and I think we did an outstanding job doing that. So as far as managing through the fluctuations that doesn't concern me.
Mike Dahl: Okay, that's helpful color. Thanks for that. And I guess maybe just to follow-on, if we're thinking out into 2020 and obviously the results this year has been excellent. Is there a way to ballpark kind of from the 2019 guide how much of that was, I don't want to say totally non-recurring benefits, but effectively just the benefits of the favorable price costs. And then from a baseline standpoint, it seems like volume growth should be sufficient to offset whatever you lose there. But just any preliminary thoughts on how you're thinking about EBITDA, the EBITDA dollar growth potential next year, given you likely lose some of that tailwind from price cost?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So, no question. You're absolutely correct that we received some of the benefits from the tailwind as the deflation hit; we were pretty open about that as we went through the year. There'll be some of that next year. We agree growth will be obviously a tailwind for us next year. We feel good about both the markets and our competitive position. So, I think those are positives, not ready to give a specific guide on that, but we do anticipate having that for our next call as we roll-out our 2020 numbers for the Q4 call. So, absolutely intend to break that down for you.
Mike Dahl: Okay, thanks for that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Alex Rygiel, B. Riley FBR.
Alex Rygiel: Thank you. Good morning. Your organic growth in the quarter was very, very strong, particularly with the regards to your value-added products. The homebuilders are seeing incredible demand over the last three months and in the month of October. Can you talk a little bit about your ability to keep up with their demand in the coming months, talk a little bit about your ability to add labor and maybe highlight what your utilization rate of your facilities is right now?
Chad Crow: Keeping up with demand, maybe labor is a challenge. It has been for years. Especially in areas -- drivers has gotten a little better, but still yard personnel and folks working in our manufacturing facilities, labor is tough. But I'm confident that our facilities can handle the demand, whatever the Builders throw at us. We could struggle at times with employees, but we've got a lot of temp agencies that we use and we call on them when we need to. So, from my standpoint bring on -- bring on the demand because we've got -- we've got the footprint to handle it. I'm not too worried about our capacity.
Alex Rygiel: That's great. And as you reengage in M&A, can you comment on seller price expectations these days and what kind of competition you're seeing out there.
Chad Crow: Some of the deals we look at are our auctions. Some of them aren't. Some of them come from relationships that we've kind of been cultivating over the years. Those are our preferred, right. So you're not in the bidding process, but overall I would say sellers' expectations are pretty much in line with what buyers want to pay these days. The last, I would say over the last couple of years they seem to have come down a little bit, the seller's expectations. So it's -- in my opinion, a pretty good time to be a buyer out there.
Alex Rygiel: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Keith Hughes, SunTrust.
Keith Hughes: Thank you. Some of the commentary on the call here on the good order growth from the Builders fair amount that's coming toward the low end of the market. I would assume that would be a positive for you on -- given your push into truss manufacturing, but would love to kind of hear your opinion on that, and any other impacts that would have either positive or negative on your business.
Chad Crow: Well, you're right, a lot of the incremental demand we're seeing is in some smaller homes and really to meet some of the affordability issues that's facing homebuyers. In my opinion as always the more houses, we build the better. We're distribution company to a large degree and we need volume. And my belief is that where we're going to get back to that normal $1 million to $1.1 million in single-family houses, you got to have a higher contribution from the lower end homes. So to me, it's just all about let’s build homes. And to your comment on it playing to our advantage, yes, we obviously have a very large manufacturing footprint and when you're building some of these column starter homes, a lot of the -- especially, the national builders will use repeat home designs. And so, we can be very efficient in our truss plants when we're building those houses. There's just not as many changes to the truss line set up. So, yes, there are some incremental efficiencies for us there. But clearly as homes get smaller, you lose another parts of the home. You may have a few more or few less windows, a few less doors. But again, net-net, it's all about building more homes for us.
Keith Hughes: Okay, thank you.
Chad Crow: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Trey Morrish, Evercore.
Trey Morrish: Thanks guys. I just want to add my great job on the quarter.
Chad Crow: Thank you.
Trey Morrish: I want to talk about the -- the value-added products a little bit. You highlighted how they're definitely a tailwind and definitely something that -- it seems like builders are looking to more and more. But could you just talk about how you think builders are going to continue to shift more toward the use of those value-added products over time, given labor constraints and given your abilities to continue to make more as you either acquire or build out Greenfield locations for those?
Chad Crow: Yes, well I look at it -- this is cyclical business, right, and there's times when labor is tight and there's times when housing slows and labor is readily available. This has been the longest streak I can ever remember of -- of tight labor and there's many reasons for that, but I just don't see it solving itself anytime soon. And I think as the years tick by the builders are starting to see that as well. And so a big driver for them is the labor shortage, the cost of framing labor and they're looking for ways to mitigate that and improve their cycle times, especially the National Builders, they're under earnings pressure, just like every other public company out there. And so they're continually looking for ways to build houses quicker and more efficiently. And in my opinion, that's what's driven a lot of them to the product and then history has also proven that as they switch to these products, very seldom will they switch away from it, because they realize the benefits in the -- in the cycle time and the cost savings. So it's just overall an environment that's -- that's pushing more and more builders in that direction.
Trey Morrish: And do you see anything that would -- that would accelerate that -- that move to more value-added products. Do you think it's more of a -- a gradual shift in that direction.
Chad Crow: Well, typically, it's been a slow to change industry, so, my gut would say it's going to be gradual. Now, if we see a really big surge in housing demand for example, next year that could push more and more builders to that because obviously labor -- framing labor would become even more scarce. But in general, I would say gradual barring some unexpected increase in demand.
Trey Morrish: And then just thinking about about your volume growth that you've done this year. Clearly, very well in a challenging housing environment to say the least. But just thinking out to next year, is there any reason to think why in a better housing market, your volume improvement should be lower than what you've done so far this year?
Chad Crow: Now everything else being equal, I don't -- I wouldn't anticipate it changing significantly. I'm a pretty conservative guy. So our volume gains have been pretty damn impressive this year. So I'm always a little hesitant to say we're going to keep doing that, but generally speaking, no, if everything else stays the same and -- and demand is better than expected next year. Yeah, I think it's certainly possible that we can hang on to those volume gains.
Trey Morrish: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Megan McGrath, Buckingham Research.
Megan McGrath: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on that conversation around lumber prices, in the sense of, if we think about a time when that commodity deflation reverses or at least stabilizes as we get some topline revenue growth. How do we think about two things; your ability to sort of get or for us to see more clearly SG&A leverage from your operational initiatives, as well as, you mentioned, cash flow benefiting from the lower lumber prices. So, how do you feel about your ability to kind of continue to generate strong cash flow, if and when that lumber reverses?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So the thinking around SG&A, we certainly do expect to get. SG&A leverage, as the sales increase. We saw some delever this year. We generally think about our SG&A as being 70% variable. So, some leverage associated with that. We do have internal initiatives that relate to -- that relate to the operational excellence initiatives. We will call those out to give you a chance to get a clearer understanding about what we're up to. But certainly we'll see that in there as far as the overall growth of the business, we certainly think that the increases in -- the increases in lumber and commodities given where prices are more likely, then decreases from here. We think that our ability to -- to grow the business until leverage off of those is consistent, and obviously we've gotten through an up and down cycle in commodities. So, we feel like we've, as Chad mentioned, feel very good about our ability to manage through it and to be able to leverage that kind of both directions. I'm not sure if I hit both of your questions. If any --
Megan McGrath: Any thoughts on cash flow?
Peter Jackson: Yes, I mean, I think the cash flow side of it is -- is there is no question that as the values of commodities increase for both in the -- well for the value of both lumber and OSB, we will see correlating increases in the values of AR inventory and AP on our side. So no question that a fair share of the benefit both at the end of last year and through the first half of this year from a cash flow perspective has been because of that deflation, we'll absolutely be investing cash as we go the other direction. That said, there is a component of this that really is attributable to, I would say, enhanced focus and discipline, enhanced processes and procedures internally. So, we feel good about holding on to that, but yeah, I'd be crazy to tell you if it wasn't going to cost us some money, if things reinflate.
Megan McGrath: All right. Okay and then just a quick follow-up on the repair, remodel and multi-family segments. You pointed to some improvements in I think Southern California for repair remodel and it sounded like may be some pent-up demand in multi-family running through. So any more color on that? And whether that was sort of one-time in the quarter or if you think it's going to last another quarter or two, that would be helpful.
Peter Jackson: Yes, it's a great question. I think that when it comes to the R&R component of R&R and other, we've seen some stabilizing, we've seen -- while still down more stable on a year-over-year comp basis in the Midwest. For example, we've seen some stabilization and even some modest improvement in Alaska and some improvement in Southern California. The area that's probably the more volatile component is the other. So, we do a fair amount of commercial and industrial. As you called out, we have a multi-family business that's well, but that other is a lot of project driven business, been very good to us this quarter. Some parts of the country that have competed very well, taken advantage of -- of stumbled competitors. So, I think we feel good about that. For the quarter it's a -- it's obviously a win. I don't think I'd want to extrapolate that forward. But we do feel good about at least lapping the negatives from the prior year. In terms of the impact of tariffs and really the hard turn in that Southern California market.
Megan McGrath: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt McCall, Seaport Global Securities.
Matt McCall: Thanks, good morning everybody. So the -- I just want to better understand a couple of things. So if I try to look at volume by product category, I think you said value-add overall was up 11%. I know there's -- I think there 17 points of commodity pressure. But if I just look at the -- I'm trying to better understand the impact on manufactured products, from the commodity moves. And I guess I'll tell you the way I thought about it is, did you see revenue pressure, but maybe there is a profitability benefit from a lower input cost. Am I thinking about the directional nature of those two items, the right way?
Peter Jackson: I'm not entirely sure, I understood. I think what I can say is that we did see growth both in volume and in margins. Certainly of the unadjusted growth for -- for manufactured components is less because of the substantial headwind that we've seen from commodities, but manufactured products grew solidly in the double digits. Some of the other value-add grew, I would say high singles to get that average about 11% in the total value-add component. Did that helped?
Matt McCall: Yes, it helps. I'm just trying to make sure I think about. I don't know what percent of that 360 -- $360 million impacted your lumber and lumber sheet goods versus manufactured products or maybe I should, but I don't -- have you ever broken that out or is it easily easy to calculate.
Peter Jackson: I don't think we have.
Matt McCall: Okay. All right, no, you don't have that much time Peter. So the next question, I want to go back to the technology. And I definitely understand the benefits that you discussed. But can you put any numbers to that. I know that is there a way to look at market share margin impact you talked about cash collection and some of the improvements there. Can you put any numbers to that and maybe quantify any benefit that you're seeing and what would be some of the expected benefits from a numbers perspective as we move out in the 2020?
Peter Jackson: Yes, so I mean a couple of factors. So I guess if we look at our total working capital metrics. We got some pretty substantial improvements, there are two components to that obviously in different -- the two different drivers operational versus deflation where you will see the benefit is in reduced inventory. You'll see it in, so -- lower DIO or days inventory on hand, lower DSO, and day sales on hand in the AR metric. You'd see it in a lower SG&A as a percent of sales as we go through the -- the aspect of the efficiency generated by utilizing online tools, having automated interfaces that allow us to be more efficient from the administrative side. And there is -- there is an efficiency also associated with anytime you're applying cash and trying to work with a customer, you're utilizing labor resources to do that. The customers doing it themselves, obviously, it's always right because they're doing it themselves. So, we haven't called out a dollar amount. We're planning to roll that into the operational excellence update as we get into the full year we'll update the full year. But we'll definitely, we call that out now. I think it's fair to say that we're not looking at doing this as a -- as a labor cut basis for restructuring like some companies do. I think what we're really focused on is filling in for attrition and really looking at how do we continue to grow the business and leveraging the resources we already have on hand because it's hard to get good people and we want to make sure we -- we take advantage of the ones we have on staff.
Chad Crow: Yes. And I'll just add real quick, some of the operational excellence initiatives are easier to measure than others like customer engagement on our website kind of hard to -- to pin down $1 benefit to that. But -- but some of them are little easier than the margin expansion and the logistics initiatives. Those are much more tangible and easier to measure. We've guided to $14 million to $16 million of benefit. In 2019, I think we have a chance to do a little better than that. But if it helps that's a pretty even split between margin and SG&A right now those savings and the SG&A portion really is -- shows itself more efficient yard labor and more efficient -- or more efficient running of our trucks and less fuel costs. But if that helps that's a pretty even split between margin and SG&A on those two items.
Matt McCall: And then you will give an update on the 2020 expectations next call?
Chad Crow: Yes.
Matt McCall: Okay, thank you all.
Chad Crow: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John Baugh, Stifel.
John Baugh: Thank you. Good morning. And my congratulations as well. Great execution.
Chad Crow: Thanks, John.
John Baugh: Could you remind us of your long-term goal on the percentage value-add, number one. And does the timing to get there change with some of these acquisitions, adding to the Greenfield strategy. And -- and does that long-term goal may be rise a little bit from your original thinking seeing what's your -- the labor shortage and the success and seemingly the demand pull you're getting from your customers. Thank you.
Chad Crow: Yes, well from my standpoint, the higher our value-add mix is the better. And clearly, the acquisitions we're making could help get us there sooner or should help get us there sooner. I guess, our kind of our near-term goal is more of a 50/50 mix between lumber and -- our distributed product and value-added product. But I certainly would not be -- wouldn't be heartbroken if we hit that number and continue to blow past it. It's clearly the -- the most profitable part of our business. I think it helps differentiate our company versus some of our peers. And so yes, the near-term is 50 but longer term, if we can -- if we can get past that will -- I'll certainly shoot for it.
Peter Jackson: I think it's worth pointing out that this quarter our value-add business is a greater percentage of our total sales in our commodities
John Baugh: Got it, got it. And then thanks for that, Peter. And then maybe a high level, how should we think -- maybe a reflection several years post ProBuild, it seems from might that one successful. I know it's a lot of work, how do we think about where we are in the housing cycle where your balance sheet is and what your appetite may or may not be to entertain of other big deal in the next several years. Thank you.
Chad Crow: Always open to entertaining, a larger deal maybe something could happen if it was a combination of debt and equity, depending on the size maybe, an all-cash deal, we never try to be closed-minded. We're certainly open to opportunities that make sense and our strategic from a long-term perspective. But right now, I don't see any of those on the near-term horizon, most of the deals we're seeing now are smaller to mid-sized deals, but could fit in nicely from a strategic standpoint as well.
John Baugh: Okay. Great. Congrats. Good luck. Q4 and beyond. Thank you.
Chad Crow: Thank you, sir.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Kurt Yinger, D.A. Davidson.
Kurt Yinger: Yes, good morning everyone. And I appreciate all the details. I just wanted to go back to volumes and maybe take it in a bit of a different direction. Obviously really positive trends on the value-add side, but the other categories have grown pretty well too. And so, I'm wondering whether you think you can a share taker going forward in those non-value add categories? And if so, what do you think is really separating kind of Builders FirstSource versus your competitors?
Chad Crow: Yes, we can be a share taker in other categories, but to me it's -- a lot of it boils down to pricing in margin expectations and return on investment. We've always said, over the years, you take all the share you want if you're prepared to drop your drawers and lower prices, but we tend not to do that. We try to be very, very thoughtful about how we allocate our capital and return on investment. And so, yes, if the returns are adequate, we're more than happy to grow share there as well. But the -- I'll call it the distributed side of our business is the most competitive and so clearly that results in lower margins on average. So, most of our focus over the years has been on the value-add side of the business, better margins, better ROIC and that's where we will continue to focus our efforts.
Peter Jackson: There's no question that the portfolio that we're able to offer based on our scale and our product breadth has been mutually beneficial. I mean, as we do a really good job with our -- with our customers and we partner with them on value-add really makes a lot of sense, just ease of doing business to work with us on the other products that they purchase as well, as long as it's a fair price. It's -- it's been a fun way for us to continue to grow the business.
Kurt Yinger: Great, thanks for the color and good luck in the fourth quarter.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, there appear to be no further questions. So, Mr. Crow, I will turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.
Chad Crow: Yes. Thank you again for joining our call today and we look forward to updating you on our quarter and our full year results in February. And if you have any follow-up questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Binit or Peter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time this now concludes our conference. You may disconnect your phone lines and have a great rest of the week. Thank you.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Second Quarter Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the Company's remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and will be available at bldr.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Binit Sanghvi, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Binit Sanghvi: Thank you, Cathy. Good morning and welcome to the Builders FirstSource second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Chad Crow, Chief Executive Officer; and Peter Jackson, Chief Financial Officer. A copy of the slide presentation reference on this call is available on the Investor Relations section of the Builders FirstSource website at www.bldr.com. Before we begin, let me know that during the course of this conference call. We may make statements concerning the Company's future prospects, financial results, business strategies and industry trends. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Please refer to our most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other reports filed with the SEC for more information on those risks. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. The Company will discuss adjusted results on this call. We have provided reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalent in our earnings press release and detailed explanations of non-GAAP financial measures in our Form 8-K filed yesterday both of which are available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Chad Crow.
Chad Crow: Thank you, Binit. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I will start on Slide 3. I'm very pleased to share with you another outstanding quarter of execution and results delivered by the 15,000 team members of Builders FirstSource. During the second quarter of 2019, we made significant progress in the execution of our strategic plan and again delivered above market growth, expanded margins, and exceptional free cash flow generation. We continued our strategic investments in market leading value added products and solutions while realizing the gross margin and customer value benefits from these investments made over the last several years. Our operational excellence initiatives also continued to gain momentum and are delivering measurable results, and of course, our strong cash flow and working capital management continue to underpin our investments while at the same time enabling the reduction of our ratio of net financial debt to adjusted EBITDA to 2.7 times at the end of the quarter Our second quarter results and performance built on a strong starts in 2019 providing momentum as we enter the strength of the selling season. In the first half of 2019, we grew our estimated sales volume excluding commodity deflation by more than 4% well above overall housing starts, which actually declined during the period. In the first 6 months of the year, net sales declined by 7% as sales volume growth was offset by commodity price deflation of more than 10%. Consistent with our strategic plan value added products led the growth increasing and estimated sales volume by 7% in the first half, as we continue to realize the benefits of our investments. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 11% compared to the first half of last year, as our team delivered on our objectives, demonstrating strong margin management and overall execution. Our operational excellence initiatives are gaining momentum and remain on track. As mentioned on previous calls, our primary initiatives consist of specific action plans underway in four key areas; enhanced business analytics, pricing management tools, our My BFS Builder customer portal and delivery optimization technology. During the first half, we completed the rollout of our delivery optimization system to approximately 200 locations, measurably improving the speed, uptime and reliability of our distribution network and continue to realize the benefits of our pricing tool implementation as well. We continue to expect a benefit between $14 million and $16 million to our EBITDA in 2019 from these initiatives. As our customers continue to face increased labor cost and scarcity, they increasingly look to partner with us for solutions. Our market leading manufacturing in value added capacity and capabilities have positioned as well to meet this growing opportunity. In July of 2019, we purchased three manufacturing facilities in Arizona and Nevada, expanding our presence to 40 states and 77 of the top 100 MSAs. During the balance of 2019, we also have plans to add three new truss plants, approximately eight new truss lines in existing plants as well as door facility expansions and new machinery and a dozen more of our value added operations. Our industry leading production capacity, sales force and distribution networks are key to our competitive advantage. And we will continue to invest in expanding our leading position. Later in the call, I will talk more about the competitive advantage that we are further leveraging through a combination of our national scale, local management focus, and network market density. I'll now turn the call over to Peter, who will review our second quarter results in more detail.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Chad. Good morning everyone. As a reminder, we have included adjusted figures to normalize for onetime costs related to our integration work and other nonrecurring items. We had $1.9 billion in net sales in the second quarter down 8.9% due to commodity inflate, the inflation which decreases sales by 11.3%. The commodity headwind offset estimated sales volume growth of 2.4%, well above the overall U.S. starts market. Our value-added product categories again led the way with a 5% increase over Q2 of 2018, reflecting the execution of our strategic plan; gross margin of $517.2 million increased by $21 million or 4.2% over the prior year; sequential gross margin percentage remained at a high level, increased slightly to 27.2%; and an exceptionally strong improvement of 350 basis points over the second quarter of 2018. The margin percentage increase was attributable to an improved product mix, the decline and the cost of commodities relative to our customer pricing commitments and our teams continued focus on pricing discipline. Commodity prices moved lower during the quarter, framing longer and sheet good prices declined by approximately 10% and 6% respectively, compared to the beginning of the second quarter. As a result our gross margin percentage increased as cost decline relative to our customer pricing agreement. As we have discussed in prior calls, market price inflation causes short-term gross margin percentage compression when prices rapidly rise, and similarly causes gross margin percentage expansion when prices rapidly decline relative to the short-term pricing commitments that we provide customers. In addition, our team again demonstrated its ability to manage through commodity price volatility, and at the same time, maintain a focus on delivering value add solutions to our customers. The result is a favorable sales mix towards higher margin products and another strong quarterly gross margin. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales increased by 240 basis points on a year-over-year basis similar to the first quarter of 2019, the largest component was the impact of deflation on sale. On spending side, variable compensation was higher due to higher commission expenditures. As we mentioned in prior quarters, we pay higher incentives for higher margin sales. Accordingly, our outside gross margin percentage led to higher commission expenditures in the quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $29.4 million, compared to $29 billion in the prior year, an increase of $400,000. The increase was due to $4.3 million in charges related to debt financing transactions during the quarter. Excluding these one-time charges adjusted interest expense decreased by $3.9 million, largely due to lower outstanding debt levels compared to a year ago. During the quarter, we issued $400 million in notes that mature in 2027. The net proceeds were used to repay $300 million of our term loan and to purchase $97 million in 2024 notes. This refinancing further demonstrates our commitment to prudently manage our balance sheet by layering in attractive long-term fixed rate debt. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $113.9 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, compared to $90.2 million, or $0.77 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increases $23.7 million, or 26.3% was primarily driven by the improved operating results combined with lower interest expense. Second quarter EBITDA grew by $24.7 million, or 7% to $246.5 million. The improvement was primarily driven by the aforementioned growth in gross margin dollars. Turning to Slide 5, the strength of our business including our national scale, demonstrate itself again in the second quarter. Housing starts remain so often commodity prices continue to decline. Our team managed growth in 4 of 5 non-commodity related product categories and excluding deflation even our lumber and lumber sheet goods product category achieve positive estimated sales volume growth. As we build further upon the success, we are committed to continuing the expansion of our network of manufacturing facilities strategically located across the country. As Chad mentioned, we are pleased to have added 3 additional truss manufacturing facilities. After the quarter ended, bringing our total to 61, approximately 25% of our totals 2019 capital expenditures will be invested in our value added growth initiatives and expansion of our production capacity. Turning to Page 6. Our second quarter sales volume grew by an estimated 2.4% in the single family new construction end market compared to an overall decline of 6% in overall U.S. single family start. Regional strength particularly in parts of the East contributed to the outperformance. Our sales volume in R&R and other end markets decline by 2.2% as week activity in the agricultural sector continues in the Midwest, related to the ongoing trade dispute with China. Multifamily sales volume improved by 3.2%, largely due to the timing of projects started in 2018. Turning to Page 7. Although, our business typically uses cash in the first half of the year and generates cash in the second half due to seasonal working capital, the Company generated cash in operation and investment of $138 million in the first half of 2019. The improvement is largely due to the effects of continued commodity deflation on the value of working capital compared to the prior year period. Total liquidity as of June 30, 2019 was an ample $755.3 million comprise the borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a trailing 12 month basis as of June 30, 2019 was 2.7 times a 1.8 times reduction from the prior year and due to lower end of our target range of 2.5 times to 3.5 times. Looking forward to the second half of 2019, we remain confident in our team's ability to execute on market opportunities, mitigate challenges and deliver the initiatives within our control. We provide some details on the third quarter and full year of 2019. Net sales are expected to be down 11% to 14% in the third quarter, driven by a commodity price deflation impact in the range of 14% to 17%. Gross margin percentage is expected to remain relatively steady sequentially from the second quarter of 2019. As a result, third quarter EBITDA is expected to be between $140 million and $150 million. For the full year 2019, we expect our single family sales volume to grow in the range of 3% to 6%, R&R market growth in the low single digits and flat to low single digit growth in the multifamily market. At this point, we anticipate full year commodity deflation similar to the 10% to 13% we saw in the second quarter. From a gross margin perspective, we expect gross margins to normalize above 26% in the fourth quarter. We also remain confident in our operational excellence initiatives which we expect to contribute $14 million to $16 million for the full year of 2019 in EBITDA. Overall we expect EBITDA to be in the $475 million to $490 million range for the full year of 2019. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the balance of 2019. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately 1.5% of full year sales. And regarding cash taxes, we expect to fully utilize our federal NOL tax assets and credits to become the federal cash taxpayer again in the fourth quarter of the year. Cash interest and cash interest expense are both expected to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million. As we continue our systems integration work, we expect onetime costs related to that of approximately $15 million to $20 million for the year. We now expect to generate $180 million to $210 million in free cash flow for the full year 2019. After funding, our capital expenditure plans have approximately 1.5% of net sales and our recent acquisition in the amount of $43 million. I would highlight that the new guidance is actually an increase relative to the first quarter free cash flow guidance. Now Chad will provide an update regarding our strategic priorities and outlook.
Chad Crow: Thank you, Peter. Moving to Slide 8, I'd like to build upon some of the last points that Peter just shared about our strengths from a financial perspective and dive a bit into some of the day-to-day operational underpinnings of our advantages and execution as well. If you've been listening to our prior calls, we are very proud of the growth platform that we have built, and often speak about our national scale and industry leading footprint. The acquisition of ProBuild in 2015 enabled us to create the largest professional supplier in the space, leading to more than 400 locations across 40 states and an unmatched depth and breadth of resources. Our manufacturing and distribution capabilities are coast to coast. And while not in every MSA, our presence in 77 at the top 100 provides a highly attractive geographic balance and a solid foundation for growth. Today, I would like to take a moment to highlight how we also go about building highly efficient and effective local market networks to create competitive strength and deliver a truly differentiated customer value proposition. First, within each of our local and regional markets, we are intensely focused on local customer relationships, connectivity and demands and dynamics all of which differ from Market to Market. Within each market, we seek to build a reasonable density of operational capabilities to support exceptionally strong trust and reliability. In addition, we develop I had a high caliber distribution, competency and exceed our customers' expectations with deep and talented management. We have found that our run it like you own a culture empowers local management to deliver high levels of service and responsiveness. This leads to relationships often spanning decades built on trust. That positions our team members as extensions of our customers' teams. Our designers are able to closely partner in the build process and become a trusted advisor on specific products and services, the best suit job. Equally important, however, is how we created a density of operations in key markets. Take the Atlanta metro area, for example, where we view and manage inventory across a network of locations in order to service customers quickly, efficiently and reliably from multiple delivery points within the market. By combining our knowledge of local homebuilder needs and activity across an optimized network, we benefit from cost and asset efficiency and become a supplier of choice to our customers. Our teams generate and share local market intelligence by intelligence by utilizing in depth analysis across locations, customers and projects to ensure that products are shipped from the optimal location. Dedicated specialist move products between locations to minimize working capital, eliminate redundant inventory and less rapidly restock while ensuring the customer needs are reliably met with efficiency and precision. We have also aligned our compensation structure to incentivize local managers to work together across shipping lines and locations, ensuring seamless coordination and execution. The result is that we have the right products at the right place and consistently do what is best for our customer. Our on timedelivery rate is over 90% across the Atlanta market. And it's just one example of better customer service at a lower cost to serve while delivering financial performance to our shareholders. This aspect of our competitive advantage is difficult for smaller competitors to achieve as allies in the power powerful combination of balance of our national scale with intense local management and regional network density. Moving to Page 9. Although U.S. housing starts have shown year-over-year over the last few quarters, the fundamentals of homebuyer demand remain intact, and we have seen increasing signs of stabilizing buyer activity as a second quarter progress. It is important to note that we have been able to demonstrate the particular strengths of our strategy team and platform during this period of fluctuating demand. Our national footprint, unmatched scale and manufacturing capability and exceptional sales force provides us with a platform well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing opportunities for core growth coming quarters and years. Together with our ongoing investments in operational excellence and value added capabilities. These strategic advantages continue to give me confidence that we will achieve our goals. Our target framework begins with capturing and incremental 130 million to 160 million in EBITDA as compared to the full year 2018 from what we call core business growth as housing starts returns historical averages. In addition to this core growth, our plans continue to call for investing in approximately 20 new value added product facilities, including 3 additions this year, plus the 3 that we recently acquired. We are seeing significant ongoing opportunities to increase our market share and increase the penetration of our higher margin products, as our customers also accelerate their adoption of these labor saving high efficiency products. As I mentioned earlier in the call, our value creation plan also includes a set of operational excellence initiatives already well under way including investments and distribution and logistics software, pricing and margin management tools, back office process efficiencies and information system enhancements. When fully rolled out across our roughly 400 locations, these initiatives and operational excellence and value added products are designed to deliver cost benefits and margin expansion, which total 90 million to 110 million in incremental EBITDA and they will further differentiate our service levels and strengthen our connectivity and overall value proposition with our customers. Our overall plan remains on track to generate EBITDA 50% higher than last year or roughly 750 million as we reach historic norms and housing. We expect to deliver EPS between $3 and $3.50 and achieve greater than 85% conversion of our adjusted net income to free cash flow. The substantial cash, we generate will be used to fund both are high return growth investments and to further improve our financial flexibility. Moving to Slide 10. Housing market fundamentals and demand drivers remained fundamentally supportive as we enter the prime selling season. As home builders that continue their pivot toward home formats and price points that are increasingly in demand by home buyers in the market. We have seen stabilizing sentiment and activity and we are more confident than ever that our network scale, market diversity and value added product leadership provides us with distinctive competitive advantages and a long runway of growth opportunities. Despite the anticipation of ongoing commodity deflation headwinds, I remain confident that our consistent strategic investments and execution by our talented and motivated team will continue to deliver strong results as we build an efficient and agile organization and implement our operational excellence programs. As always, I would like to thank our 15,000 team members across the country for their hard work and delivery of excellent service to our customers. As we drive value creation in the quarters in the years ahead. Operator, we can now open the call for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Matthew Bouley of Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: So, the truss plans that you guys acquired in July, obviously at the same time, you guys are investing in your own plans and the new greenfield. Can you take us or help us think about how you're going to balance that going forward? Perhaps of what you're looking for in a given market where you might choose the M&A route instead of a greenfield? And, is this something that we should expect to see more of? Thank you.
Chad Crow: Yes, if don't believe we've said on prior calls. I look at a lot of these opportunities as a build versus buy decision. And at the right multiple, it makes more sense in my mind to go the M&A route, it gets you into the market quicker plus you're not adding capacity into a market which can be difficult and create some real pricing war. So, it'll be a balanced approach though, like I said, we're going to be -- we're going to be pretty busy. And it's got to make sense from a financial perspective and from a multiple perspective, but I like the fact that we have the flexibility to do either now, now that we've gotten our leverage ratio down, we can make those decisions and be, a little more opportunistic when it comes to grow in value as part of our business.
Matthew Bouley: And then secondly, you guys again, reported a pretty significant outgrowth in your single family volumes relative to the single family housing starts. I would just be curious if you guys have any final thoughts points on that? Just, how do you think you're actually comparing versus your own markets? You could look at different data points of completion data probably held up a little better in Q2. So, what do you guys see as a sustainable share gain at this point, as the market recovers? And what kind of metrics are you looking at to kind of determine your market outperformance?
Peter Jackson: So, I'll let Chad comment more broadly, but specifically to some of the details, I think we do see share gains for the business. We mentioned that we have some particular strength on the east coast. I think we were also advantage of this by some of the markets that were most negatively impacted with starts being areas where we don't play a ton of big chunks California for example. But even in the markets where there has been some decay, we have still seen some sharp growth. And I think that Chad hit on a couple of the points as to why, I mean we are a reliable provider, we are a trusted partner for our home builder and customers, and we performed well. But more broadly, I would say that, that east of the Mississippi for us this year has definitely been going to strength where we've seen the biggest share gains and the biggest successes.
Chad Crow: Yes, I think a lot of it goes back to the multiyear investments in value added and components manufacturing them. I'm still a, my firm believer that that is not going to go away, the labor shortage is not going to go away, the cost of labor is not going to go away. And I think it's a trend that will continue and that's why we were focused on developing that part of our business and that's where we've seen some definite out growth when it comes to our volume for starts.
Operator: We will now go to a question from Trey Morrish of Evercore.
Trey Morrish: Hey, Chad and Peter, thanks for the time and yes, great quarter. I want to first touch on the gross margin. I'm wondering, if you could just put in buckets of the year-over-year improvement of try and dimensionalize new improvement in mix, the decline from lumber costs relative to pricing, and then your price disappointed that that you highlighted?
Peter Jackson: Sure, yes, as you can imagine, we spend a lot of time making sure we understand that. From our analysis, we would say more than 50% of is an direct result of both the decline in commodities and the -- in the period as well as compared to prior year, so there's sort of two components. One is last year at this time we were seeing pretty significant headwinds, obviously from the rapid inflation. So with that normalizing there's clearly a normal tail in there. In addition is as we pointed out there was a modest decline during the quarter in the value of commodities. So those components together leading to a little more than half of the total change, probably about 20% to 30% of the remainder of the total changes is attributable to mix and that goes to the investments that we've made and the sort of continued growth and our performance of the value at portion of the business. And the balance is really across the rest of the business, but with a focus on the work that we've done in operational excellence. So pricing discipline, special order margin, those areas of the business where we feel like we can refine our ability to manage price effectively is the bounce.
Trey Morrish: Thanks. And then I want to go back to a something in your guidance that you said. You said that gross margin to normalize above 26% in fourth quarter. I wonder what do you mean by normalize you're talking about in for Q4 are you talking about more of a longer term run or you think you you're going to stay above it that 26% level?
Peter Jackson: Yes, both of those. So, we've talked about in the past, people have frequently asked us what is normal. You guys talk about gross margin impacts due to commodity fluctuations, but what's at app our current and then based on the current prices, which is important part of the equation always but we think it's about 26. We were a little cautious as we bond throughout the year that to snap that line, because we wanted to see where things have settled. But as we work through the year, we think that's a good guide for everyone that based on current commodity prices, it's not 25 as normal in the fourth quarter and going forward we think normal is over 26.
Operator: And now, we will take a question from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.
Mike Dahl: Thanks for taking my questions. Nice job of getting a lot of cross currents right now. My first question, I just wanted to get a little more detail on the acquisitions if we could. Can you give us a sense for from a revenue and EBITDA or margin standpoint, how we should think about contribution both for the second half and on a run rate basis?
Peter Jackson: It's pretty modest acquisition. I'm not sure that you're going to be able to decipher it out into details. Truss facilities we've talked quite a bit about what an incremental value would be provided by a truss facility and that will question about how we allocate capital. We feel pretty good about our ability to balance between debt pay down, stock repurchases and M&A. But I think it's fair to say that we're only buying when we think we're getting a good deal. We think it's a deal that makes sense for us. And, that $43 million represents a relatively modest investment for the three class, they're already up and running in a market where we haven't heard before.
Chad Crow: Yes, I like the fact that it gets us into a couple of new MSAs and if we so choose to expand the product offering in those in MSAs. We do have facilities already north of north of Phoenix. So we now have the opportunity to serve the customers up there as well with truss and panel.
Mike Dahl: Okay. I guess quickly on that then, should we think about these as being similar in nature whether it's size or otherwise to your existing plants? Or is there anything different about these plants that we should be aware of?
Chad Crow: No, they're generally similar.
Mike Dahl: My second question is around sticking with the theme on manufactured products. Obviously, the markets had some headwinds in terms of starts and your volume has continued to well outpace that. But it has decelerated over the past quarter. And so, I want to get a sense of just when you think about that 6% on manufactured products volume, you're putting in a lot of investment organically you've bolted on with these couple of plants. How are you thinking about within your guidance potential for reacceleration? Or just what level of growth in volumes should we be thinking about for manufactured products going forward?
Peter Jackson: Yes, that's a tough forecast. I mean, obviously, you're going to have correlation with starts. We've talked about that single-family starts over the long-term with the best indicator of our underlying demand-. We do think we're taking shares so obviously that's another component and this is part of our ability to do that, because we think the macro trend is coming towards Builders FirstSource as it pertains to our ability to invest in our skill set in that truss manufacturing. Or I would say that maybe the best answer to your question? We're going to continue to invest in this space, because we believe that the growth, there is always going to be better than starts.
Mike Dahl: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: And this is going to be better than starts. It's kind of tough to correlate, but I think that's the summary.
Operator: And now, we will go to Alex Rygiel of B. Riley.
Alex Rygiel: Could you add some color on your thoughts as to the weakness in the R&R market?
Chad Crow: Well, it's unfortunately a trend we've been talking about for a few quarters, it's just largely, where we do most of our R&R is in the upper Midwest, which is still being hit from the tariff issues. Alaska, which is still struggling with the lower oil prices and into a lesser degree on the West Coast is our three pockets of R&R and really the hardest hit has been the upper Midwest for us.
Alex Rygiel: And any comments on progress through July, as it relates to 2Q results?
Peter Jackson: You mean, our business going in July?
Alex Rygiel: Exactly.
Peter Jackson: Good. Yes. We're happy.
Chad Crow: It's good. And I think our guidance for Q3 reflects that.
Operator: And now, we will go to Matt McCall of Seaport Global Securities.
Matt McCall: So back to value add. Give us an idea where you see that go and say next year, next three years, next five years. I'm going back to the comment you made when asked about gross margin, you said normalizing above 26% at the current mix. I assume the goal is not to keep the current mix. So what I'm trying to get at is where do you see the mix going overtime? And where do you see the margin going overtime as a result of that mix shift?
Peter Jackson: Yes, it does move and I think we can kind of talk about the fact that since the merger, when we were about 36% value add, were' up over 40% value add. So there's clearly a trajectory there that the footprint and the investment in capacity has enabled us to track with broader industry transition towards that type of off-site manufacturing. So we feel good about it, pretty tough to predict in any given period, what the growth rate is going to be, and what the impact on mixes. And candidly, it's almost impossible if you want me to forecast commodities because the problem with that 26% and with the value-add percentage is that is dependent on the value of commodities, because it will change our relative mix just from $1 perspective. So it's a little tough to extrapolate. I mean, I would say, if you're talking a 0.25 to a 0.5 point of growth on an ongoing basis, assuming that things continue to trajectory, that's probably a reasonable basis, unfortunately, as soon as a stable commodity price, which I wouldn't be foolish enough to promise you.
Matt McCall: So yes, I understand that. So 0.25 to 0.5 point of next shift as soon as what you're saying here. So is it still, remind me that the gross margin delta that we should assume value add versus commodity?
Peter Jackson: Yes, so with current level, it might be a little bit lower, but it's still in that, there to a 1000 basis points of trade up when you go from traditional stick to a trust manufacturing environment.
Matt McCall: Okay. Chad, you just had a question about the R&R environment. I think in the guidance, there was an assumption of, did I hear low to mid single digit growth for the year after being down Q2, what's, if I heard that right, what's, what's got you comfortable that it's going to improve?
Chad Crow: Well, after the tariff moves yesterday maybe a little tougher to get there, but we are seeing some strengthening in Alaska and the West Coast is holding in well. So I'm optimistic we can see an overall improvement there, but again the real key is going to be the mood that on the tariff issue and how it's impacting the farmers in the upper Midwest.
Matt McCall: Okay, there are days here right here, there's an assumption of growth for the year.
Peter Jackson: Yes, low singles.
Matt McCall: Okay, and then I did not hear the outlook for multifamily. Could you just repeat that one? Yes, low singles.
Peter Jackson: I'm sorry, you broke up there. Could you repeat the question?
Matt McCall: The multifamily growth assumed in the form that I didn't I didn't catch that.
Peter Jackson: Yes, low single digit, throughout low single digits. We get some pretty momentum as of late, we feel good about the progress we've got coming. So that'll be a small growth area.
Operator: We will now go to Megan McGrath of Buckingham Research.
Megan McGrath: Good morning. Just a quick follow up on multifamily comment. You're not the first to talk about maybe a working through a little bit of backlog in multifamily in the second quarter. So just curious where you see that backlog now? Will we see a bit of a payback in future quarters or do feel like it's stabilized a little bit?
Peter Jackson: I would say for us we're seeing stabilization. We think our backlog looks pretty good, growing in some parts of the country. So we feel pretty good about it.
Chad Crow: Yes. Yes, I would say in particular in the in the northeast, we're seeing some nice projects coming our way in the northeast part of the country.
Megan McGrath: And just a bigger picture question, on some of your initiatives, you've talked about specifically, pricing and efficiency initiative. I'm just curious in this kind of an environment when you have really aggressive lumber price deflation. Does that make the pricing initiatives are more or less important as you're seeing such large deflation? And has the priority in those initiatives shifted at all in this current environment?
Chad Crow: I would say if anything, our focus on pricing has increased over the course of the year, the more we The more we dig, the more I feel there's incremental opportunities there, regardless of what commodities are doing. Clearly, commodities, is the toughest, most competitive part of our business and it kind of is what it is. But two thirds of our business is not commodity related and I still feel like there's really nice opportunities there no matter what we have to deal with from a commodity inflation standpoint.
Peter Jackson: And just sort of recap some of the some of that price, the work that we're doing is really focused on discipline process, right? Is it this is in out to gouge the customer type of dynamic. This is a, how do we make sure we're updating our prices effectively. We're giving people tools to use so that they understand the cost benefit of the relationship with individual customers. It's just, I would say fundamentals that we can get and have been getting better at. So it is very, I would say long-term good practice that we think is going to help us regardless. And it's a great is a great project and a high priority.
Operator: Our next question will come from Kurt Yinger of Davidson.
Kurt Yinger: Yes, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. First, just on the pricing tools, are the benefits from those accruing to all categories more so on the commodity side? How should we kind of think about that?
Peter Jackson: We think it's pretty broad. Yes. I mean, we're our approach has been very market oriented. So market by market and we see it across the board. I mean, obviously commodities by very nature is more competitive, but we see it everywhere.
Kurt Yinger: Okay and you've highlighted the east as kind of an area of strength, which is I believe, where you offer more kind of turnkey framing services there's a lot of talks about the products that you're offering filters to drive efficiencies. But how do you think about some of those services that kind of help you win share as well.
Peter Jackson: Services are a big part of it in installation services to customer stickiness, optimizing bringing packages on the design I inside as a service. So anytime, you can add more services to your offering, you're just that much more of a partner with the home builder, and as I said a minute ago, a much more much stickier relationship, much less likely to price you to save a nickel on a two by four. And so anything we can do to be that partner that the builder relies upon to help them build that house most efficiently, whether its products or services or some definitely we're focusing on.
Operator: And we'll move next to John Baugh with Stifel.
John Baugh: Thank you, Good morning to Peter and team congrats. And I just wanted to get a sense. As we think about modeling longer term. You mentioned I believe that you started to see, your, I don't know backlog of orders or what you're looking at an incoming business, settling out a little bit with homes that people want to buy. I take that as code language for smaller homes. If I'm wrong on that, correct me. But my question is, as we think about we've always modeled units of single family housing start. And obviously, we couldn't be looking at a smaller unit. If you have enough data or input color near order book, how we would take about a delta when we model revenue versus starts and units as we go out of time with what you're saying? Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Yes. So John, I wish I could tell you, yes. The short answer is I don't think we have a good rule of thumb for you. You see in the census information like we have, we've done some analysis internally. But it doesn't give us a sense that you can really forecast or predict the impact on volumes due to the size of the homes. Obviously, they'll have an impact, but we haven't seen a material change in volumes or what we sell yet, as a result of.
John Baugh: Okay. So for near-term modeling purposes don't, units are still a pretty good predictor?
Peter Jackson: I mean, we've talked about, if you want to use a pointer to as a volume adjustment attributable to that, we don't think that sound reasonable, but it's tough to say that's the right number that we've got a lot of statistics for analytics to support that.
Chad Crow: And I think the homes are a little smaller. But I also believe that the demand, the home buyers demanding the smaller homes still want a nice home. So they still want nice doors, nice windows and so to a large degree, if you're just taking out a little bit of square footage, it could just be a little bit dollar framing packets, but you're still getting some nice sales and margin on a lot of the other pieces of them.
John Baugh: And you're having a nice year. You mentioned commissions influencing the SG&A. I'm just wondering on the compensations number for corporate? Is that influencing the number in any way? You should have an increase in dollars, as I said, but how would that manifest itself in SG&A?
Peter Jackson: Yes, that's the other components, a little smaller than the commission's number. But those are the two big numbers that have changed, obviously, performance this year more broadly has been to a little bit of quicker rule on the timing of the bonus. Although I will say that some of the lapping that will do in the back half of the year will normalize that a bit.
John Baugh: And then lastly, you did a phenomenal job of deleveraging, the acquisition and obviously you got a tailwind from the deflation of commodities. So is there some way to you think about where your, I'm going to ask you, Chad, to project lumber prices. But is there some way using the word normalized? Where your debt-to-EBITDA would be, if we hadn't had all this deflation to kind of get a sense of whether you feel very normal lumber inflation or rate? There might be a creep back up and that number where you are debt-to-EBITDA on a normal lumber price situation?
Peter Jackson: No question. We picked up a ton of tailwind this quarter as a result of the deflation for the past couple of quarters, right? I mean, it's something that we already indicate more broadly, when people ask us long-term question about what would you do in the case of a downturn, right? This is a good example in a, maybe a false way because it's just value of commodities, but we generated a lot of cash when sales were down. And yes, I would say the math. We look at a little less than a couple $100 million that we would have had a tailwind on. This time a year, we're almost always increasing our leverage ratio. So it to drop, it's pretty remarkable and obviously 1.8 turns versus last year is indicative effect. As far as normal, I think we've been pretty committed to the idea of debt pay down and de-risking, but in that 2.5 to 3.5 range, we're not afraid. I would say to fall out of the bottom of that range, if it means we're building dry powder if we can't find those deals, but as we indicated, as we took action on this year, or this quarter, there are some good yields out there. And we will continue to snatch those up where we think it makes sense. And we're getting a good value for our money. I think we're in a bit of a sweet spot now. No question if the price of commodities runs back up, we will see growth in working capital as a result and definitely.
John Baugh: So the simple math would be Peter that, if we saw the lumber inflate right back, we'd get back roughly $200 million of level working capital benefit. Is that a simple way to think about it?
Peter Jackson: Yes, it's probably a little less than that maybe 175, but yes. That's a little bit back to where it was this time last year where it was pretty always.
Chad Crow: It's obviously a seasonal business, so yes, during the peak of the selling season, you could see that.
Operator: We will move now to Steven Ramsey of Thompson Research Group.
Steven Ramsey: Good morning. If you think about investing $30 million this year towards the value add business, does the newly acquired plants take some of the $30 million? Or do you are to that kind of that level of investment to increase the capacity and grow these new plants?
Peter Jackson: We're adding, yes it's incremental.
Steven Ramsey: Is there any way to kind of ballpark? Is it meaningful? I know it's only a half year or less than that really?
Peter Jackson: Well, the investment of $43 million, then the acquisition price of the three plants plus the $30 million that you're referring to as or sort of rough guide on how much is the incremental CapEx is going to be attributable to grow in value add. I'm not sure I followed what you were asking.
Steven Ramsey: Yes, I guess I'm saying the newly acquired assets, does it, as it lays a base for the CapEx on to those plants? Is there a need for more CapEx that you want to put in, in the Netherlands?
Peter Jackson: In those specific facilities, we'll assess but I think that they're already in pretty good shape. They're already well automated from what we've seen. But we're looking for ways to improve them but not a significant source of incremental investment.
Steven Ramsey: And then as you think about gaining share, and kind of what that looks like on the ground, do you win that share because of value add for better pricing, or quicker delivery? And then do you win, are you winning that from larger competitors or is it smaller competitors? And then I guess kind of another element to that is a slower market or one that we're in? Does it, is it more conducive to gaining share?
Peter Jackson: I would say, yes. Certainly, the offering of the component side of the business helped us gain share in many times, if you can get that business, a lot of the other products that go into the home will follow. I don't, I think we're taking share from Big and small competitors. There's definitely a market by market situation. But there's no doubt in my mind that enhancing our value add proposition creates additional opportunities to grow share. And as I talked about earlier, the customer stickiness barring a, just dramatic fall in housing, I don't think small ebbs and flows and housing demand is going to impact that that situation when it comes to components and our ability to take share.
Operator: We will now go to a question from Jay McCanless of Wedbush.
Jay McCanless: Hey, good morning, everyone. Peter, I missed the guidance you gave on the commodity inflation for 3Q. Could you give me that again?
Peter Jackson: Sure, it's 14% to 17%. So this is this is the big quarter for the year.
Jay McCanless: I believe you said also that that's going to be the commodity deflation, we should expect for the four year, is that correct?
Peter Jackson: The combined deflation for the full year is similar to what we saw on a second quarter. So that 10% of 13%.
Jay McCanless: Thank you. And then the other question I have is, we've had two public builders now announced that they're going to start potentially building more homes for the single family for rent operators. And just wondering if the if this does catch fire and become a trend and the built, the big builders are building even more houses than they are now. How do you guys feel about your capacity? Would you need to make some meaningful investments if we were to see the big guys take even more share than they already have? Or do you feel like you can flex up without a lot of expenditures?
Chad Crow: I think as far as the structural capacity is there, we would probably have to bring on some additional ship sin some of the points, if it really took off. I wouldn't see a large CapEx investment though I think that we got the capacity and the structure there. But labor, we had to get some more labor.
Peter Jackson: I love the way you're thinking on volume, Jay. Keep it coming.
Jay McCanless: Well, you know, I got to be optimistic about something. The one of the question maybe on value add, and I mean, I certainly don't give me this offline. But what has been the historical growth rate in value add products that have value add volumes, since the merger. You all have that handy?
Peter Jackson: Yes, I don't I don't have a handy have an estimate off the top my head. I would say high single digits, maybe double or write double lines probably in their 8 to 10.
Jay McCanless: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question.
Peter Jackson: Go back and follow up. We can follow up.
Chad Crow: Thanks Jay.
Jay McCanless: Okay.
Operator: Now we will go to Trey Grooms of Stephens.
Trey Grooms: So, just a couple of housekeeping really, one is, let's see the integration-related expenses you guys had in the quarter? I think it was $3 million. Is there anything there? We should be thinking about kind of as we're modeling the next couple of quarters?
Peter Jackson: Not for this year, it's pretty stable. But we are looking as we have promised to finish our ERP conversions by the end of this year. So, there'll be a pretty substantial reduction in that integration cost line coming into 2020. We'll likely shift a bit of that into operations because there's some interesting projects we've been looking at, but there's a pretty substantial portion of that will go away.
Trey Grooms: And then just a little bit of clarity. And sorry, if you guys touched on this, I dropped off for just a second. But the 26 or north of 26% margin that you guys referred to. Just to be clear, that's basically taking out any commodity impact either direction, that's just the kind of the new normal meaning no commodity impact?
Peter Jackson: Exactly, it does assume a flat commodity environment, which we can talk about but that's kind of how we're thinking.
Trey Grooms: And then kind of going into the 4Q guide that you gave, if I heard you, right. You're looking for something North at 26 in the 4Q, but that would, I mean you're, I think, if my math is right, you're going to have a little bit of benefit still left from commodity deflation in 4Q. Is that right? Or is that going to be kind of behind us at that point?
Peter Jackson: It'll be pretty well gone. By that point, we're looking at sort of bringing down inventory at that point. It'll be pretty well gone. We'll be looking at normal. The biggest impact in the fourth quarter that people will see is the lapping of last year's big deflation.
Trey Grooms: Make sense. And then the, given where your leverage is now and again, you may have touched on this, I'm sorry, if you have. But given where your leverage is now, and it's kind of within that target range, should we, I know you've picked up a few plants and done some things like that. And I know you've got plans for plant kind of Greenfield type stuff and expansions on your own. But should we expect you guys to start kind of ramp it up on the on the M&A front? And just given where we are in the cycle, which still seems very reasonable and your leverage here?
Peter Jackson: I said earlier, I liked the position we're in. We don't have to buy anybody. We can invest through just our normal CapEx. If we come kind pf across opportunities, that are a good value at good multiples. We can be opportunistic, we can pay down debt. So I like the flexibility. I like to position we're in. Short answer, yes, we're going to keep looking to expand our value add offering. But it's got to be an acquisition that makes sense. And this one we just did, obviously we built did make sense, but there could be some other smaller opportunities out there come our way.
Trey Grooms: And then lastly is kind of within the guidance Peter. The SG&A I know you guys have some bonuses and things like that you touched on. But it actually looks like the SG&A, if I'm back into this, right. Looks like a pretty reasonable SG&A versus last year. Is that I mean, almost flat, even, maybe even down is that right? Is that the right way to look at the SG&A expenses going in the back half?
Peter Jackson: I appreciate you pointing that out. That has been certainly a significant focus for the operation. You're absolutely right with the exception of some incremental commissions and some incremental bonuses. The team has done a really, really good job of disciplined spent management particularly when you think about the challenges and the overall hiring markets in the challenges and attracting retaining top talent. It is really good job by the team. Obviously, that does look great because the sales line has moved on us. But this, the SG&A dollar discipline has been quite exceptional by the team.
Chad Crow: Yes. And we started out the year really focusing on it because we knew deflation was going to be a headwind. And so the guys were really focused on that. And then, as we've already discussed, we're starting to see some of the operational excellence initiatives flow through largely on the warehouse and delivery side helping us manage those costs even better.
Trey Grooms: Alright, well, thanks for all the color you guys have given us on this call and in the press release and everything on the guidance and everything, it's very helpful. Best of luck in the quarter and talk to you soon. Thank you.
Operator: And with that, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn things back over to Chad Crow for any additional or closing comments.
Chad Crow: Thank you, once again for joining our call today, and we certainly look forward to updating you on our, for the progress of our initiatives in November. And if you have any follow-up questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Binit or Peter. Thank you.
Operator: And again, that does conclude today's call. We'd like to thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-03 10:00:00) =====

Chad Crow : Thank you, Binit. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. I'll start with an update on our first quarter achievement. Then Peter will discuss our first quarter results in more detail. I'll then finish with an update on our strategic priorities and outlook. I'll start on slide 3. I'm extremely pleased with our strong start to 2019 as we managed to outperform the market, demonstrating the resilient strength of our company, strategy and team. We continue to capitalize on our competitive advantages and realize the increasing benefits of our investments and initiatives. While commodity price deflation decreased our net sales by more than 9% we grew our sales volume by nearly 7%, substantially outperforming the recent housing starts. Adjusted EBITDA grew by almost 22% compared to the first quarter last year. Excluding deflation, our value-added product sales grew by an impressive 10% as we continue to benefit from our investments in capacity, as well as investment in our sales force. Our team continue to execute our strategy in a challenging quarter and our results clearly reflect it. Our operational excellence initiatives continue to show tangible progress. As we have discussed on prior calls, our primary initiatives are focused in four areas; enhanced business analytics, pricing management tools, our My BFS Builder Customer Portal, and delivery optimization technology. Today, we have rolled out our delivery optimization system to nearly 170 locations measurably improving the speed, up time, and reliability of our distribution network. We expect these initiatives to contribute between $14 million and $16 million to our EBITDA in 2019. We are increasingly realizing the growth, and margin expansion benefits of our investments in value-added products capacity. While becoming an even more important partner to our customers, by helping them solve challenges like increasing costs, labor scarcity, and long cycle times. Our plan is to continue expanding our manufacturing and value-added capacity to remain on track. During the balance of 2019, we intend to invest in three new truss plants, approximately eight new truss lines in existing plants, door facility expansions and new machinery and systems to a dozen more. We're extremely proud of our industry-leading production capacity, sales force and distribution network. And will continue to invest to enhance our position. I'll talk more about our value-added products and their potential a little later in the call I'll now turn the call over to Peter, who will review our first quarter financial results in more detail.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Chad. Good morning everyone. As a reminder, we have included adjusted figures to normalize for onetime costs related to our integration work and other nonrecurring items. Please also note that we had one less sales day in the first quarter of 2019 than prior year. So I'll speak to our results on a sales-per-day basis. We had $1.6 billion in net sales in the first quarter, down 2.5% primarily due to the commodity inflation which decreased sales by 9.3%. The commodity headwind offset strong sales volume, growth of 6.8%. As Chad mentioned, this included 10% sales volume growth in our value-added product categories, reflecting a strong execution of our strategic plan. Gross margins of $442 million increased by $31 million or 7.5%, over the prior year. Sequential gross margin percentages remained higher than expected at a record 27.1%, 290 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2018. Commodity prices began the quarter by continuing last year's downward trend, before stabilizing at a level a bit below our expectation. As a result, our first quarter gross margin percentage benefited from those declining costs, relative to our customer pricing agreements. Together with our team's continued pricing discipline, this price cost benefit combined with a favorable shift in mix towards higher-margin value-added products resulted in an exceptionally strong gross margin for the quarter. As we have discussed in prior calls, market price volatility inflation causes short-term gross margin percentage compression, when prices rapidly rise and similarly cause gross margin percentage expansion when prices rapidly decline, relative to the short-term pricing commitments we provide customers. This expansionary benefit diminished over the course of the quarter, as commodity prices have stabilized and gross margin percentages are returning to more normalized levels. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales, increased by 160 basis points on a year-over-year basis, this increase was primarily due to higher variable compensation as similar to the fourth quarter our gross margin with higher commissions expenditures in the quarter. Increased insurance expenses, also contributed to the higher SG&A. Adjusted interest expense for the quarter, was $24.9 million compared to $26.7 million in the prior year, a decline of $1.8 million. The reduction was mainly the result of our ongoing balance sheet management in debt. This included the opportunistic repurchase of some of our 2024 notes during the quarter. Adjusted net income for the quarter, was $39.8 million or $0.34 per diluted share compared to $27.6 million or $0.24 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase of $12.2 million or 44% was primarily driven by the improved operating results combined with the lower interest expense. First quarter EBITDA, grew by $18.3 million or 22.2% to $100.9 million. The improvement was largely driven by our strong growth in sales volumes, particularly in our value-added product categories. And the related increased gross margin percentage. Turning to slide 5, the strength of our business including our national scale showed itself in the quarter. Our team successfully managed a soft quarter for housing starts numerous regional weather disruptions and low commodity prices. And despite these challenges, four of our core product segments, categories reported impressive sales growth in the quarter. Excluding deflation, even our lumber and lumber sheet goods product category grew sales volume, reflecting our geographic diversity. As we build further up on this success, we are committed to continuing the expansion of our current network of 58 manufacturing facilities, strategically located across the country. Approximately 25% of our 2019 capital expenditures will be invested in our value-add growth initiatives, and expansion of our production capacity as Chad outlined. Turning to page 6, our fourth quarter sales volume per day grew an estimated 7.5% in the single-family new construction end market in spite of a decline in overall single-family starts. Regional strength, particularly in the Southeast contributed to the outperformance. Our sales volume in R&R and other end markets grew by 5.2%, primarily due to a strengthening in Alaska. And multifamily sales volume improved by 4.1%, largely due to timing of projects started in 2018. Turning to page 7. Our business uses cash in the first of the year and generates cash in the second half, due to seasonal working capital needs. The company used cash in operations and investing of only $14.8 million in the quarter. Given this strong start, we are increasing our full year cash flow guidance to $190 million to $220 million in free cash flow after funding our capital expenditure plans of approximately 1.5% of net sales. Total liquidity as of March 31, 2019 was an ample $585.9 million, comprised of borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. Our net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio on a trailing 12-month basis as of March 31, 2019 was three times, a 1.6 times reduction from prior year and comfortably within our target range of 2.5 times to 3.5 times lower. As we look forward to the rest of 2019, we have a high level of confidence in our team's ability to execute on market opportunities, mitigate challenges and deliver the initiatives within our control. Let me provide some details on what we see for the second quarter of 2019. Net sales are expected to be down in the second quarter, driven by commodity price deflation in the range of 11% to 13%. As a result, despite an expected increase in sales volume, our second quarter sales are expected to be down by 8% to 10% as compared to the second quarter of 2018. However, we expect the gross margin percentage to improve 190 to 210 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2018. Although declining sequentially from the exceptional margin experienced during the last two quarters, the previously mentioned benefit from rapidly declining commodity costs pales off. As a result, second quarter EBITDA is expected to be between $120 million to $130 million. For the full year 2019, we expect single-family starts in our markets to grow in the range of 3% to 6%. R&R market growth in the low single digits and flat to low single digit growth in the multifamily market. At this point, we anticipate full year commodity deflation similar to the 9% to 10% we saw in the first quarter. We also remain confident in our operational excellence initiatives which we expect to contribution $14 million to $16 million to the 2019 EBITDA. We will continue to invest in our business through capital expenditures at approximately 1.5% of sales. Regarding cash taxes, we expect to fully utilize our federal NOL tax asset during 2019 and become a federal cash taxpayer again in the second half of the year. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the full year. Cash interest and interest expense are both expected to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million. As we continue our systems integration work to support our operational initiatives, we expect onetime-related costs of $15 million to $20 million for the year. As already mentioned, we expect to generate $190 million to $220 million in free cash flow for the full year 2019, an increase of $10 million from our prior guidance. Now Chad will provide an update regarding our strategic priorities and outlook.
Chad Crow: Thank you, Peter moving to page 8, although housing has slowed over the last few quarters, the fundamental underpinnings of homebuyer demand remain intact. We continue to expect single-family housing starts to progress over the coming years towards the $1.1 million historical average. We continue to develop our sales force and invest further in our manufacturing and value-added facility expansion initiatives. These growth platforms provide a significant ongoing opportunities to increase our market share and increase the penetration of our higher-margin products as the market also accelerates, its adoption of these laborsaving high-efficiency products. In addition to capture market growth, the growth of our value-added product sales and operational excellence initiatives underway are expected to generate approximately $100 million of incremental profitability in the coming years. Our plan remains on track to generate EBITDA of 50% higher than last year or roughly $750 million as we reached historic norms in housing. We expect to deliver EPS between $3 and $3.50 and achieve greater than 85% conversion of our adjusted net income to free cash flow. The substantial cash we regenerate will be used to fund both our high-return growth investments and to further improve our financial flexibility. Turning to slide 9. We detail expectations for our growth initiatives. Our core business strength including our national footprint, unmatched scale and manufacturing capability and exceptional sales force provides us with a platform well-positioned to capitalize on the continuing operations we see for core growth in the residential housing market. We expect to generate an incremental $130 million to $160 million in EBITDA, compared to the full year 2018 as housing starts return to historical averages. In addition to this core growth, our plans continue to call for investing in approximately 20 new manufacturing facilities including three underway this year by expanding our nationwide footprint to serve a number of markets where we see accelerating opportunities to serve our customers. Additionally our plan includes a set of operational excellence efficiency initiatives already underway, including investments in distribution and logistics software, pricing and margin management tools, back office process efficiencies and information system enhancement. These initiatives are expected to generate an additional $60 million to $70 million in incremental annual EBITDA. When fully rolled out across our 400 locations, these initiatives and investments are designed to deliver cost benefit and margin expansion, which total $90 million to $110 million. They will further differentiate our service levels to strengthen our connectivity with our customers and provide economic and strategic value that is unrivaled by our smaller competitors. Moving to slide 10, I would like to take a moment to provide a bit more detail around what we have been doing to build our leadership in the manufactured products category. As we have outlined previously, our industry leading manufacturing capacity delivers value-added products to fulfill customer's needs, helping them address the ongoing challenges of skilled labor scarcity, long cycle times and control over both quality and cost. With all the talk about future building technologies if you focus on the largest category of off-site construction, which is here today, value-added manufactured components. This is a highly profitable and growing opportunity that we have been focused on for more than a decade. During that time, we have asked extended our leadership position and built a network of 58 manufacturing facilities. Today we carry a complete line of offsite manufactured components from roof trusses, floor trusses and wall panels to our precut, better framing system solution. Our facilities utilize the latest technology including computer control SaaS, 3D software design, and automated material placement and finishing. These high speed lines improve efficiency by 35% to 40% compared to the tip of the manual lines employed by most of our smaller competitors. The trends are clear, customers are increasingly pivoting toward the entry level and lower priced products start to satisfy the growing need for entry level homes. Homebuilders are striving to deliver high value to home buyers while reducing their costs. Builders FirstSource helps homebuilders achieve that goal. In addition to the accelerating rate of adoption, another encouraging sign is the growing interest in a broader set of components beyond roof trusses. We recently held customer workshops in one of our largest MSAs to help builders and their framers understand the benefits of offsite construction solutions. The results were very positive as all the attendees adopted at least one new type of manufactured component many for the first time. The signs are all very positive and our scale, resources and deep customer relationships put us in a position to capitalize on this customer opportunity and continue to gain high margin share in this rapidly growing market. Moving to slide 11. Although we hear divergent opinions about the health of the U.S. housing industry and its outlook, we continue to see a housing supply deficit. As the second quarter has begun, we remain confident in the fundamentals of the macroeconomic environment and in the demographic drivers of demand. And our homebuilders are making the necessary adjustments to their products to respond to the evolving needs of homebuyers. We are confident in our team's ability to execute our strategy, deliver above-market growth and create value for our customers and shareholders. The ongoing rollout of our operational excellence initiatives and our strategic investments in manufacturing capacity are expected to continue to drive improvements and profitability and cash flow generation. I look forward to building on our success. Operator, we can now open the call up for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess, one on the start out on the gross margin, the 27.1% in the quarter. You guys historically talked about that 25% level is being normalized. Understanding, we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves. Obviously there were some incremental lumber capture in the quarter, I think Peter as you mentioned, but just longer term kind of as these operative initiatives rollout, is there any -- I know as you continue to mix towards the value-added categories, is there any reason why structurally that an ongoing gross margin can't be stronger than 25% over time? Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Yeah. Thank you, Matt. That's a good point. The movement in commodities, of course, influences our average gross margin and where we stand currently I don't think there is any question for us internally that there is opportunity north of 25%. In the near-term, let's say drifting 25% to 25.5% but when you start layering on the expense benefits of the growth and value-added manufactured components as well as the working operational excellence, we certainly see that increasing over time. That is accurate.
Chad Crow: And Peter is way too kind with the dollars we are investing in manufacturing facility there damn well better be higher margins in the future. So well done Peter, but -- yes absolutely, there should be higher margins in the future that's the hope we have in all of the investments.
Matthew Bouley: Okay. Well said. Secondly, I was looking at slide 10. There you guys gave some disclosures around the size of the manufactured products industry. It seems that you guys have kind of nearly 25% share of that market. So as you continue to invest in these facilities, do you guys kind of longer term again kind of target I guess a market share of that particular industry? Do you think you can actually grow above even that market or kind of just enjoy how that market itself likely grows faster than broader housing? Thank you.
Chad Crow: I'll just -- can we go back to my previous comment. We are putting a lot of time and money into growing that side of our business. And I absolutely believe we should be outpacing the -- whatever that market is, we should be taking share in that market. And that's been our strategy as we said in the opening comments for over a decade now and that will continue to be our strategy is to grow that side of the business and take share.
Peter Jackson: Again back to our overall strategy, it's a quite fragmented market still, plenty of opportunities for us to grow organically and inorganically as well as expanding use of the product by broader home-building industry. We are excited about it.
Matthew Bouley: All right. I appreciate the thoughts. Thanks again.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll move to Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc.
Trey Grooms: Good morning, gentlemen.
Peter Jackson: Hi, Trey.
Trey Grooms: Nice work in the quarter.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Trey Grooms: So, I guess kind of a follow-up to the last question on the margins. So looking a little bit more near term, I think the 2Q guide would imply 25.7% or something like that in the -- at the midpoint. So given that value-add mix is much heavier value-add than it has been in the past I guess and was the last time we had an environment that wasn't influenced one way or the other by the volatility in lumber prices. Is this 25.7%, is that kind of the way to think about the new norm as we look into the next couple of quarters? Or is there -- in that 25.7% is there any still any benefit at all from the lumber deflation there? Or just how do we think about that?
Peter Jackson: Yes. There is I would say a very modest amount of influence left over in April from the deflation, but that's about it. So I'd say the bulk of that greater than 25% is in our opinion normal. And we'll just have to keep an eye on commodity prices to see how that might move that number around a bit.
Trey Grooms: All right. Thanks for that clarity. And then you're expecting to stand this year 25% of your total CapEx on growth initiatives, which includes value-added capacity, which you kind of talked about some of the different things there. How are you thinking about the revenue opportunity from these expansions that you're putting into place this year? And then also I think you spent $20 million last year on something similar and how do we think about the impact this year coming from that?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So I would say the messaging is consistent. I wouldn't say there have been any changes to the guides we put around those facilities. They're generally $15 million to $20 million in sales with 10% to 12% or higher depending on the opportunity in the geographic location in margins. We are talking about a pretty substantial return, when it comes to the investment. It does take some time to get them out of the ground. So our ramp up expectation is probably about 20 months from start to finish in terms of getting the facility running. So that's were the challenge in laying out number there, but it is certainly a tailwind both in sales and EBITDA based on the investments we've continued to be consistent with over the last couple of years and we expect to continue over the upcoming years. With the advantage of as we return to one more normalized record ratio opportunities for tuck-ins to contribute to that as well.
Trey Grooms: Okay. And then looking longer term, I know you laid out 25% of CapEx this year, but longer term is that the kind of -- is that the level of investment needed as we look forward to hit the type of incremental EBITDA numbers you're kind of looking at for value-added products over the longer-term? Is that kind of a good assumption going forward on the spend?
Peter Jackson: We think so yes. I mean, our models has a pretty consistent growth amount in there. Admittedly, there is certainly a lot more to do there. So more investment to come, but over the coming years we think that's -- that consistent level of investment is a good baseline for your model.
Trey Grooms: Okay. And last one from me kind of on the page 10 there where you have those four categories of manufactured products. And you look at those four buckets there and with your expansion plans, what would that mix of kind of incremental capacity look like? Is it pretty balanced among those four buckets? Or is there one area that's more attractive to you? Just any color there.
Chad Crow: I would stay the bulk of the investment would be in the roof trusses and the floor trusses, a lesser amount going to the wall panels and the precut framing packages.
Trey Grooms: All right. That's it for me. I’ll turn it over. Thanks a lot for taking my questions and good luck.
Chad Crow: Thanks Trey.
Operator: Our next question we'll hear from Trey Morrish with Evercore ISI.
Trey Morrish: Hi. Thanks, guys. And I’ll add my congratulations on a great quarter.
Chad Crow: Thanks Trey. Good morning.
Trey Morrish : I wanted to just ask just how conceptually lumber prices really haven't rebounded this year granted it's has been a slow start to the year and the housing environment has gradually improved, but I'm just wondering from where you're sitting, why do you think that lumber has kind of stayed down where it has?
Peter Jackson: Well, I think last year was obviously an anomaly several things that triggered the rapid inflation we saw, and then the course had fell off at the end of the year. I think what we've seen so far this year we have had some additional capacity come on. We haven't had the delivery the rail and the trucking delays that we saw last year. And I think housing demand has been a little soft at the first half the year. I think a lot of that was due to a little bit rougher weather year-over-year. I think as we get into the -- more of the seasonal building time, you'll -- we would expect to see prices strengthen a little bit. We're not expecting a runaway like we saw last year, but would expect as we get into the summer months as demand picks up, it will eat up some of that additional capacity that's come online at the mills. But all-in-all still expecting it to be a relatively flat year from a commodity pricing standpoint.
Trey Morrish: Okay. And then talking about your volumes very strong numbers 6.8% and then on a single-family sales up 7.5%. While the starts environment really over the last six months has been very underwhelming just kind of wondering why you've been able to see such strong growth particularly this quarter in such a tough environment? And then why as most of us believe that the housing environment is getting better as the year goes on for a little bit of decelerate 2Q?
Peter Jackson: So I guess, I can start there and Chad can sure chime in, but end of the analysis we've seen so far would indicate that our geographic exposure being so broadly spread out across the country helped to sort of insulate us from some of the disruption in certain key markets. I think that some of the markets that were hardest hit are markets that perhaps we don't have a strong presence in so that worked to our advantage as well. And then lastly in the part that, I would emphasize the most is this idea that our value add in our manufactured components, the areas that we feel is the right balance and the portfolio sort of offering that we're able to provide continued to be strong than in March reason, because we haven't continued to invest right. We continued to investment from sales force perspective, from an equipment perspective so those aspects of the business continue to grow as a result of that focus and operational performance.
Chad Crow: Yes. And this year, as Peter hinted is a little different. Last year at this time, it was more of the Western part of the country that was outperforming. And this year for us, it's more in the Southeast. And I think some of that was weather related. I think west of the Mississippi took a harder hit from a weather perspective. And we're really performing well in some of these Southeast markets and taking some shares. So it's a little bit different than what we saw last year, but I think the geographic diversity certainly as Peter mentioned helps that.
Trey Morrish: Okay, guys. Thank you, Chad and Peter. Appreciate it.
Chad Crow: Thank you.
Operator: And next we'll move to Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.
Nishu Sood: Thank you. I wanted to start out with the sales expectation for the second quarter. You had a really nice daily sales day performance in 1Q. Offset a good proportion -- you had 6.5% that offset a good proportion of the commodity price deflation. You're implying I think in your guidance that the 11% to 13% commodity price pressure in your 8% to 10% overall sales growth, you're implying that slows the daily sales growth to about 3%. So, just trying to understand that 6.5% against the volatility that we've had in the housing market is a really nice performance. And so why would that slow especially given that housing has stabilized and even started to rebound here?
Peter Jackson: Yes. I'm not surprised at all that you've caught that an issue. So my observation on this is that you know this as well I do. One quarter does not a trend make, while we feel very confident about our performance, and we're pleased with it, it seemed unwise to extrapolate a number that was so successful. Are we going to try to replicate that? Absolutely. From a forecasting perspective, we believe that the overall performance of the industry is one that we will approximate and hopefully beat, but we're trying to forecast what we believe to be a reasonable and deliverable target that we absolutely intend to try and beat.
Nishu Sood: Got it. Got it. And a question on the investments in the manufacturing capacity, clearly the continued focus on that through the housing wobble has turned out to be a great decision. Looks like the housing market may have still some room left to run here. At what stage though does it become late enough in the cycle? And how will you judge that to say that the investment should perhaps be slowed down? Because clearly adding capacity later in the cycle closer to potential recession or volume declines would kind of aggravate the risk of those investments. So how are you focused judging that? Or are you taking a through the cycle view on these investments, and that it could continue even later into the cycle?
Peter Jackson: Well, I think a lot of that will depend on as things play out what we think the cycle is going to look like. Right now, we are in the camp of -- the growth can't go on forever. But I don't -- at this point, I wouldn't expect a significant downturn when there is a slowing, and when we do kind of hit that peak of a cycle. So, we are very well could for the most part, invest right through it and if that's the position we continue to take. And a lot of it maybe dependent on the market, this market specific that we are looking at, but it's a balancing act as you know. We want to be long-term focused. We want to invest in where we think the building industry is heading. Will we have to tap the brakes here and there along the way perhaps. But again, it's just kind of -- be a game time decision as we get a little deeper into the cycle.
Chad Crow: The other thing I would like add to that is a complicating factor in trying to make the decision is that, there is growth broadly in the use of that component product. There is also this aging of the ownership and the experience level in the industry. So there is sort of this, almost disconnected from the market opportunity to grow that part of the business. So there is certainly a lot of tailwind there, and we don't want to leave money on the table. To your point, we always have to keep an eye on the end as well.
Nishu Sood: Got you. And just related to that Clayton Homes, big news, 4,000-unit facility to serve Nashville not only for their single-family builders, but arguably for competitors as well. As you know, obviously there are the lumber contractors -- I'm sorry, the framing contractors that have entered the space as well. You continue to make investments, and obviously there is a growing level of interest from not only those players but from startups as well. So it's pretty active space. As you folks sit and think about your relative position, what gives you the confidence that the distributor who is best positioned to longer term provide this service? Or do you think the landscape is large enough that there is room for different business models?
Chad Crow: Personally, I think the landscape is large enough. As Peter mentioned, I think the trend to off-site construction will continue. And I feel like that there is a growing opportunity out there. So, it doesn't surprise me at all that other players see the same thing and want to get into it. I think Buffet's a pretty smart guy, so maybe that just validates our investment thesis.
Peter Jackson: And I do think, we are better positioned than they are just from the perspective that we can sell to everybody and it helps us better utilize our capacity on an ongoing basis. Because, we can sell to every homebuilder, and homebuilders try and do it themselves or, even framers that are aligned with the given homebuilder try and do it themselves. It's far more difficult for them to cover it or fix the overhead over time. It's an advantage that we will posses no matter of the market or the competitor.
Nishu Sood: Got it. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: And Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets, we'll have our next question.
Mike Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Peter Jackson: Good morning.
Mike Dahl: My first question on, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the market commentary a little bit, and fully appreciate your ability to outperform your markets just given the investments you're making, and also some of the better trends that the builders have reported from new order standpoint. But, we did come out of 1Q with, I think national single-family permits down 8% year-on-year, and so just trying to think through the cadence to get through to the 3% to 6% that I think was your market growth, not just your specific company performance. So can you help us a little, and maybe just frame what you think your markets -- how you think your markets performed in the quarter?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. I guess I can start. The commentary, as far as our performance during the quarter, we saw the same, I would say, broad starts numbers in our markets that we would have expected in the national with the exception of Northern California. It's probably the most obvious one. A little bit in some of the secondary MSAs, but clearly we're in the heart of most of the large ones. So not a massive difference, but certainly a difference -- California is a significant mover. And so that is absolutely one of the ways in which we think that 3% to 6% for us, perhaps, differentiates a little bit from the national number. But that is an area where we continue to see strength as we hear feedback from our homebuilder customers. Our sales force continues to hear that. Yes, there has been a slowdown. Yes, there's been a pause, if you will, but there's absolutely a wave coming in terms of the rebound that you might expect to see from the reduction in home mortgage rates and the actions that the homebuilders have taken to recover the market.
Chad Crow: Yes. And we had all our regional leaders in Dallas, I believe, it was last week, just for an operational review. And a lot of the feedback we got was exactly what Peter said. It seemed like towards end of last year and this is -- specifically, they were talking in the Southeast U.S., a lot of the builders, as rates were creeping up last year, started backing up on specs. And the guys that were in last week fully expect and are hearing from their builder customers, that now they're -- they were little behind and they're going to have to build more specs than they had originally thought. And then some of it of course is -- they feel like there's some pent-up demand from all the weather we've had and they said the backlog is looking very strong over the next several months as these lots continue to dry out and construction can start to take place at a normal cadence.
Mike Dahl: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then, my second question, clearly strength on the gross margins which you've covered. I think the -- sum of the trade-off has been you -- I think, as you've called out, have some variable comp that's tied to some of those levels of profitability. So I was hoping just like you gave your thoughts on what a new "normal", at least in the near term on gross margins could be. Can you give us what your sense or how should we be thinking about kind of a normal run rate for SG&A right now?
Peter Jackson: Yes. Well, you're definitely seeing the few things that are happening. One is the reset with the deflation flowing through, but also the outside margins are driving a bit higher -- of the higher expense on SG&A conditions in the long term. So I do think that over the longer term we are talking about still the 12% to 15% fall through, still seeing a normalized EBITDA rate that is influenced both by that mix that move towards value add and the operational excellence initiatives. In the near term, no question that the EBITDA dollars will be negatively influenced by the reset in the deflation -- reset in the commodities and the difficult -- resulting deflation, but again offsetting with the underlying growth that's kind of how we get to the full year number. And we'll just have to work through that messaging, so that everybody is clearly able to understand the impact of the commodity movement and how that differentiates from sort of the core operations of it.
Mike Dahl: Okay. I think that’s helpful. Thanks, Peter and Chad.
Chad Crow: Thank you.
Operator: And John Baugh with Stifel will have our next question.
John Baugh: Good morning. Congrats. Thanks for completely ruining all our models and taking housing starts and lagging up three to six months.
Chad Crow: Happy to help, John.
John Baugh: Yes. I was wondering if we could, from a high level, talk about the value-add. You've obviously been added for, as you said, a decade. And talk to, I don't know, the barriers to entry, if you will of -- because it's obvious, it's working. Is it your scale geographically? Is it your capital balance sheet? What precisely do you think keeps you in front of the competition as this is a clear direction that people should be moving? Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Well, a big part of it is just the people. We've got people in this organization that have lived and breathed components their entire life and they're really good at it. There is bit of a barrier to entry, certainly, higher than someone who just wants to open a lumber yard. When you're talking probably $6 million, $7 million to get a plan up and running, there is a degree of a barrier there. And I think, our broad footprint and our customer relationships across the country certainly help us when we do decide to put a new plant in, to build it a lot quicker and begin to cover that overhead, because we'll typically be in conversation with customers in that market long before we put a plant there and know that there is a level of demand there that will support it. So, look, I think, it's just a combination of those things. And as you already pointed out, we've been doing it very, very, very long time and it's just something we feel like we're one of the best at. So there is a competitive advantage there, when you have been doing it as long as we have and have the personnel we have and the customer relations we have coast-to-coast.
John Baugh: And Chad I know you, it is long since integrated ProBuild but they were not as progressive with this opportunity as you. Is there -- obviously it hinges on where you build a plan but is there some sort of buy-in that you've achieved with, if you will, to legacy ProBuild people that also maybe driving this?
Chad Crow: Yes. I think that's absolutely part of it and then a lot of it is just demand from our customers where we continue to see the market shift towards these products and so where there is gaps in our offering we've got in many cases customers reaching out to us and saying when you're going to start selling me components. So it's a good position to be in.
John Baugh: And then just a quick comment maybe on the repair remodel side, existing home sales have been weak for quite some time, and there is some evidence out there is choppiness in that margin. What have you seen based on that on your projection? How are you looking at that side of the market? Thank you and good luck.
Chad Crow: Yes. You know the R&R market just to recap right we are primarily exposed in three key markets: Southern California, Alaska and the Upper Midwest. Southern California as everybody is aware has seen a pullback in the housing starts and certainly a lot of interruption from weather started this year. However, in short the core, R&R part of that business has been pretty stable, pretty healthy. Alaska has been a headwind for us the past couple of years. They've struggled with the reset in the oil prices, but things have leveled off there and they started to see some growth which we are pleased with. It's a great operation for us. And while we continue to I can see a bit slower than normal growth in the Midwest. It's not been enough to offset the recovery more broadly. So it's, I think, it's a strong part of the business for us right now we always anticipate that it's going to be a bit more stable and the volatility in single-family starts market and that sort of proving out while a quarter here, a quarter there might be weaker – we’ve seen it, its pretty consistent.
John Baugh: Great. Thank you. 
Peter Jackson: Thank you. 
Operator: And next we will move to Megan McGrath with Buckingham Research. 
Megan McGrath: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. All of my questions have been answered, but maybe a couple of big picture ones on your value-added businesses. With housing starts having slowed a little bit I know builders getting much relief from the labor side, but are your conversations with them in terms of your long-term needs that you're meeting are they changing at all? Or is it less about meeting the labor availability problems and more about cost? Or are the conversations staying the same?
Peter Jackson: I would say they're pretty consistent. And as I said earlier, I fully expect as we get into the seasonal building time those labor constraints are going to be just as real as they were last year. Obviously, they hit the peak during the late spring and summer when most of the building activity is trying to take place. So now so far those conversations really haven't changed.
Megan McGrath: Okay. And then when you think about market potential the slide that you showed us in terms of the share of those manufactured products, it's part of that assumed growth dependent on your ability to kind of bring these options to market at a lower price as you become more efficient in your manufacturing is that still barrier for the builders? Some are saying we just can't make a pencil.
Peter Jackson: I think your argument is that the overall studies would say it proves itself. We can charge what we believe to be a fair market price and the benefits to the homebuilder in speedway, safety, the quality plus the computer-aided design and engineered aspect of the components it generally takes costs out just from a pure lumber perspective. So we've had very good success at getting paid a fair margin and a fair price and still having it to be of benefit to the homebuilder. So we don't think as cost out component that's net needed in order to be a competitor not to say we're not going to continue to fight for it. We think the efficiency is where we continue to separate ourselves from competitors.
Megan McGrath: Okay. Great. Thanks. Thank you. 
Operator: And next we'll move to Matt McCall with Seaport Global securities.
Matt McCall: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
Peter Jackson: Good morning, Matt.
Matt McCall: Can we maybe look at the manufacturing products anyway, you could give us an idea the same location growth there I think the growth 8% if I just average the other non-commodity categories your growth in manufacturing process was double. The other categories I guess I'm trying to understand the growth is from the market the same location share gains are generating and then maybe the share gains from new facilities that you have been able to recognize?
Peter Jackson: I appreciate the question. It is a really good question. And no. Basically, A, I don't have the materials in front of me; B, at this stage, we haven't made the decision to stop breaking out. Clearly, we're going to communicate that as part of our long range plan messaging over time. We are not just not ready to do that today.
Matt McCall: Okay, that's fair. Maybe one so the pricing and margin structure for manufacturer products is a lot lumber there as well. How does that work in a volatile commodity environment? Do you see the same impact from a profitability perspective or the contract structure differently?
Chad Crow: It is a component obviously but there is a lot more that goes into the manufacturing of trusses as opposed to distributing sticks and so while it can impact that manufactured component business it's not nearly to the degree it would be on commodity lumber. You've got design cost you've got labor cost you've got other things to go in to the component that kind of helps insulate it from the valve swings that you can get on them on the distributed framing products.
Matt McCall: Okay, all right. It's helpful. Thanks Chad. And I guess the follow-on; there have been a few questions around this. But the starts projection you gave up 3% to 6% I don't remember what the assumption was -- or the outlook was last quarter and you talked about some of the regional improvements, but can you just go through first of all was it -- what were some of the specific geographies that changed to help you move it up to 3% to 6% this year?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So, honestly, we did not provide full year guide in the last quarter guide really because of the uncertainties. The homebuilders weren’t willing to guide and we didn't think it's wise for us to get out in front of them. Subsequent to that, we have put a lot of commentary -- a lot more if you will and their expectations for the year. As well as in the commentary directly from them, so we feel much better. I think that's 3% to 6%, it might be a little richer based on the first quarter results than what we have modeled when we gave some of our cash flow guidance, but as the increase in cash flow guidance, we think there has been some strengthening beyond even our expectations. Immediately offset little bit by the continued flatness of the commodity pricing.
Chad Crow: And I think part of our optimism the balance of the year is from what I talked about earlier when we had the regional leaders in few weeks ago. There does feel like some pent-up demand due to the weather and the commentaries from some of the builders that they feel like they're a little behind on specs.
Matt McCall: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Chad Crow: Thank you.
Operator: And next we'll move to James Jay McCanless with Wedbush.
Jay McCanless: Hey, good morning. The first question I have was on the logistics and I think you guys said you had rolled that out 170 locations. Can you just remind us where you are in that and how much longer that rollout is going to take?
Chad Crow: We expect to be done with the bulk of rollout at the end of this year and then we are going to -- that won't be to every location it's the larger locations. We are going to pause at that point and then see how much further we think we need to roll it out it, may not make sense to rollout to a single-site market for example you get much more benefit in larger markets we got multiple locations trying to work together to make deliveries and serve the customers. So, we are going to will finish Phase 1 at the end of this year and then as I said pause and see if there is a next phase or not.
Jay McCanless: And then the other question I had I know this isn't probably the best part, but if you just look at framing lumber, it seems like you guys are going to have the commodity headwind for this quarter assuming prices stay were they're now. And then third quarter -- but then fourth quarter it looks like it gets a lot easier, is that how you guys are thinking about internally if prices stayed flat and if so, what type of effect assuming that that commodity inflation lessens through the year. What type of effect should we expect on gross margin?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So, I would say on the commodity value impact, you hit the nail on the head we will see a fading headwind to the sales dollars. One thing think I want to make sure and I want point out is just we just account for the lapping that we will see. So, I don't want anybody anticipate significant deflationary environment in the fourth quarter of this year which would cause us not to be able to replicate the large tailwind from the deflationary impact in the fourth quarter. So, to keep that in mind, over those two different thesis, right is, of course, the baseline core operating impact of the value of commodities, and then there is the short-term swings or flows in gross margin percentage that we see in any given quarter related to those compare. For example, this quarter we saw the tailwind not only from this year's deflation, but also the lack of inflation from last year.
Jay McCanless: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Chad Crow: Thanks Jay.
Operator: And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Crow for any additional or closing remarks.
Chad Crow: Thank you and again I really appreciate everyone joining our call today. And we certainly look forward to updating you on the progress of our initiatives in the quarters ahead. If you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Binit or Peter. Thank you.
Operator: And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-03-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.bldr.com. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Binit Sanghvi, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Chad Crow: Thank you, Binit and good morning everyone. I appreciate everyone taking the time to join our call today. I would like to share with you an update on our 2018 financial highlights and strategic achievements. Then I will turn the call over to Peter who will discuss our Q4 financial results in more detail. I will then finish with an update on our strategic priorities and outlook. Starting on Slide 2, we completed a year of very strong financial performance and achieved key milestones of value creation despite a moderating growth environment and a volatile commodity market. In 2018, we again showed the agility and resilience of our exceptional team, platform and strategy. Net sales in 2018 grew by almost 10% and EBITDA grew by almost 20% to a record annual $502 million, earnings per share increased by nearly 50%, value-added sales grew by an impressive 10% as we continued to invest in our strategic growth capacity. Our dedicated team accomplished these results while at the same time executing on our working capital initiatives generating a record $186 million in free cash flow for the full year 2018. Using that strong cash flow generation, we achieved our leverage target announced at the time of the transformative ProBuild acquisition in 2015. Turning to Slide 3, I would like to spend a few minutes highlighting a few of our strategic achievements in 2018. First, we continue to realize the growth and margin expansion benefits of our strategic investments and value-added products capacity by helping our customers solve challenges like increasing cost, lack of labor, and waste management. These investments are driving higher margin sales as we continue to grow our industry-leading manufacturing network through new plants, automation, new machinery, and system upgrades. Since 2016, we have opened eight state-of-the-art truss and millwork manufacturing facilities. As these facilities mature, sales will continue to grow, enabling us to capture share of the expanding offsite fabrication market as homebuilders look for solutions to overcome their labor and cost challenges. We also continued to make progress on our operational excellence initiatives. These best practices are being implemented throughout the organization to make Builders FirstSource more agile and more responsive. Initiatives underway include enhanced business analytics, pricing management tools, our My BFS Builder Customer Portal, and digital safety among others. I will specifically highlight our delivery optimization success a little later in the call which is already posting tangible benefits furthering the competitive advantage of our efficient distribution network. We once again delivered on our commitment to generate strong free cash flow to fund our long-term investments, while restoring balance sheet financial flexibility. We funded $101 million in capital investments including further expansion of our industry-leading value-added production capacity refreshing our fleet of rolling stock and upgrading our asset base. At the same time, we reduced our leverage to 3.1 times as of December 31st, 2018 a reduction of 1.1 times compared to the prior year end. Lastly hiring, training, and retaining the best people continues to be a top priority. We invested in the addition of 160 new sales team members in 2018. We also introduced training tools and processes to systematically drive and enable the productivity of our high-caliber sales culture throughout the organization. We are only strong as our 15,000 talented team members and we remain committed to growing and developing future leaders throughout the organization. I will now turn the call over to Peter who will review the fourth quarter financial results in more detail.
Peter Jackson: Thanks Chad. Good morning everyone. As a reminder, we have included adjusted figures to normalize for one-time integration and other costs. Please also note that we had one more day of sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 than the prior year. So, I will speak to our results on a sales per day basis. We reported net sales of $1.8 billion, a 0.5% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 including commodity deflation of 2.8% and an estimated 3.3% from sales unit volume growth. Our value-add products increased 6.8%, led by a particularly notable 9.1% growth in manufactured products. Gross margin was $492.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, increasing by $61.6 million or 14.3% over the prior year. We recorded our highest quarterly gross margin percentage ever at 27.1%, up approximately 290 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017. And a sequential improvement of 240 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2018. Commodity prices declined sharply again in the fourth quarter of 2018, continuing the fall that began in June. Framing lumber and sheet goods prices declined 39% and 32% respectively compared to the beginning of the third quarter. As a result, our gross margin percentage improved as cost declined relative to our customer pricing agreements. Our team again demonstrated its ability to manage through commodity price volatility. And at the same time maintain a consistent focus on delivering high-quality value-added solutions to our customers. As we have discussed on prior calls, commodity inflation causes short-term gross margin percentage compression when prices rapidly rise. And margin percentage expansion when prices rapidly decline relative to the short-term pricing commitments, we provide to our customers. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales increased by 160 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This increase was primarily due to increased commissions and incentives related to our particularly strong and highly profitable growth in the fourth quarter. We pay higher incentives for higher-margin sales. And accordingly our outsized gross margins led to higher commissions expenditures in the quarter. Adjusted interest expense for the quarter was $26.6 million compared to $33.2 million in the prior year, a decline of $6.6 million. The reduction was largely as the result of refinancing transactions the company executed in 2017 as part of the disciplined capital management plan. As well as our ongoing debt reduction, slightly offset by a rising interest rate environment. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $53.1 million or $0.46 per diluted share compared to $46.6 million or $0.40 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase of $6.5 million or 14% was primarily driven by improved operating results, combined with lower interest expense. Fourth quarter EBITDA grew by $28.1 million or 29% to $125 million. The year-over-year improvement was largely driven by our strong sales growth, particularly in the value-added product categories and expanded gross margins from commodity price deflation. As mentioned, the outsized benefit to gross margin from the rapid deflation will diminish over time as commodity prices stabilized and gross margin percentages return to a more normalized level. Turning to slide 6. Our ongoing strategy to invest in manufacturing capacity once again delivered results in the fourth quarter. We grew the value-added products by more than double the market rate. Our unrivaled platform provides us significant ongoing opportunities to increase both our overall market share and the penetration of higher-margin products. In addition, we are committed to continuing the expansion of our current network of 58 manufacturing facilities strategically located across the country. Given the ongoing challenges faced by our customers, the demand for our labor-saving products continues to grow and provides us with expanding opportunities for profitable growth. Our 2019 plans to expand our manufacturing and value-added capacity includes new truss and millwork plants, new truss lines in existing plants, new door machines, new machinery and new systems impacting dozens of markets and locations. In total, we expect to invest nearly one-fourth of our total 2019 capital expenditures in our value-add growth initiatives. Turning to page 7, our fourth quarter sales unit volume per day grew an estimated 4.5% in the single family new construction end market, outgrowing single family starts growth. Our sales volume to R&R and other end market grew by 1.1%, somewhat muted by the slowdown in the Midwest where much of the economy is driven by the Ag industry which is being impacted by the trade dispute with China. Multi-family declined about 1.8% as expected. Turning to page 8, total liquidity as of December 31, 2018 was an ample $595.5 million consisting of net borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. Capitalizing on market opportunities and our financial flexibility, we executed a series of open market purchases of our 2024 notes, totaling $53.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. In February of 2019, we repurchased an additional $20.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the same 2024 notes. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of December 31, 2018 was approximately half of what it was at the end of 2015 only three years ago after our strategic acquisition of ProBuild. This is an important milestone for us and we are proud of the exceptional work our team has done to integrate a transformative acquisition, execute to deliver the synergy targets and ultimately deliver on the promise to delever the balance sheet. Moving to slide 9. Our cash generation was driven -- was again driven by strong EBITDA growth. And our teams focus on working capital conversion execution in the fourth quarter. The $186 million of free cash flow generated for the full year, represents an all-time record for our company after funding for $101 million in capital investments. Our current assets are covering an increasingly larger portion of funded debts, reflecting our steadily improving financial stability. As we look forward to 2019, we have a high level of confidence in our team's ability to execute on the initiatives within our control. Let me provide some color on what we see for our first quarter of 2019. We'll have one less selling day in the first quarter of 2019 versus the prior year. So our guidance will be provided on a sales per day basis. We expect commodity price inflation to negatively impact our sales in the range of 6% to 8% in the first quarter. As a result despite expected increases in unit volume, we expect our first quarter sales per day to be down by a low single-digit percentage as compared to the first quarter of 2018. We expect gross margin percentages to be down sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2018 as a portion of the benefit derived from the rapidly declining commodity costs begins to recede. However as compared to the gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2018, we expect an improvement in the range of 180 to 200 basis points. As a result, we expect first quarter EBITDA to grow at a mid-to-high single-digit percentage as compared to the first quarter of 2018. As we have begun 2019, the macroeconomic environment and fundamental demand factors all remain supportive of growth in single family starts in the housing market generally. However, recognizing the uncertainty in the new housing market and the highly volatile commodity prices, we will at this point refrain from providing detailed full year guidance. We remain confident in the industry and in our self-driven performance. We expect our operational excellence initiatives to contribute between $14 million and $16 million in our 2019 EBITDA. We will continue to invest in our business through capital expenditures at approximately 1.5% of sales. Regarding cash taxes, we expect to fully utilize our NOL tax asset and become a federal cash taxpayer again in the second half of the year. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the full year. Cash interest and interest expense are both expected to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million in 2019. As we continue our systems integration work to support our operational initiatives, we expect onetime related cost of about $15 million to $20 million for the year. As a result we expect to generate $180 million to $210 million in free cash flow for the full year of 2019. I will now turn the call back over to Chad to provide an update regarding our strategic priorities and outlook.
Chad Crow: Thank you, Peter. Moving to slide 11, although the housing market in starts growth have moderated over the last few quarters, we remain confident in the fundamental underpinning of homebuilder demand and expect that single-family housing starts will continue to move towards the $1.1 million historical average over the next several years. As mentioned, we continue to develop our sales force and invest further in our manufacturing and value-added facility expansion initiatives. These growth platforms provide us significant ongoing opportunities to increase our market share and increase the penetration of our higher-margin products. In addition to capturing market growth, the growth in our value-added product sales and our operational excellence initiatives underway are expected to generate an additional $100 million of profitability in the coming years. Our plan remains intact to generate EBITDA approximately 50% higher than our 2018 full year figure of $502 million or roughly $750 million as we reach historic norms. We have revised our cash flow targets to better reflect the cash culture we are building. Our expectation is that over time we will achieve greater than 85% conversion of our adjusted net income to free cash flow. The cash generated will be used to fund strategic growth investments and to further improve our financial flexibility. Turning to slide 12. We detail our specific growth initiatives expected relative to the 2018 performance. Our core business strengths including our national footprint unmatched scale in manufacturing capability and exceptional sales force provides us with a platform well positioned to capitalize on the continuing opportunities, we see for core growth in the residential housing market. We expect to generate an incremental $130 million to $160 million in EBITDA compared to 2018 as housing starts to normalize. In addition to this core growth, we will continue to expand our national manufacturing footprint and capabilities to grow our higher-margin value-added products faster than the overall market. Our plans currently call for investing in approximately 20 new facilities by expanding our nationwide footprint to serve a number of locations where we see great opportunities to serve market needs with our customers. Our plan includes a set of operational excellence efficiency initiatives underway including investment such as distribution and logistics software which I will discuss in more detail on the next slide. As well as pricing and margin management tools, back office process efficiencies and information system enhancements that are expected to contribute between $65 million and $75 million in incremental annual EBITDA. These projects when rolled out across our 400 locations are designed to deliver significant cost benefits and margin expansion opportunities. They will further differentiate our service levels, strengthen our connectivity with our customers and provide economic and strategic value that is unrivaled by our smaller competitors. These initiatives are well defined and well within our control. We remain confident that when scaled they will generate the returns we have targeted. Moving to slide 13. Our dispatch and delivery optimization initiatives have now been rolled out to approximately 140 locations. The goal is to systematically drive best-in-class operational efficiency and customer service. Logistics optimization include the use of GPS technology to allow for predictive maintenance, driver performance monitoring, route optimization, centralized dispatch and more precise management of vehicle disposition and procurement. We have already seen an improvement in driver productivity, fuel cost and safety. Sales and operational alignment centers around what we call the electronic delivery board. The enhanced reporting has reduced paperwork and allowed our sales team to easily understand the status of all orders improving accuracy and efficiency. For example, we have seen a reduction in delivery expense and improvement in sales per FTE where fully adopted. The customer collaboration tools provide the delivery status and job site photos to be automatically uploaded to our online portal My BFS Builder so that sales dispatch and the customers can collaborate online. This is already shown to improve construction times to reduce hotshots and product returns and has also improved customer satisfaction. By the end of 2019, we expect to roll the system out to over 250 locations to make up more than 75% of our sales. In 2018, we delivered profitability and on that a long standing strategic priority to restore financial flexibility marking the completion of our successful integration of ProBuild. At the same time, we continue to invest in building a more durable, value-added solutions platform that has demonstrated growth despite a moderating end-market environment. The ongoing roll out of our operational excellence initiatives also continued creating an even more agile and responsive Builders FirstSource. Despite the commodity price volatility, we demonstrated the strength and value of our differentiated platform across our national footprint to produce solid growth. While the economy and key fundamental demand factors remain supportive of housing growth going forward visibility into 2019 at present is challenging. The timing and extent of the growth in single-family housing starts in our opinion will depend on the continued low unemployment, stable interest rates and homebuilders adjusting to be evolving profile and needs of the home buyers. However, regardless of the exact trajectory of the market, our experienced leadership team and 15,000 dedicated team members remain committed to successfully navigate the changing market conditions. We are better positioned than ever to grow a long-term value for our customers and shareholders and I look forward to building our success together. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator, we can now open the call up for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And going first to Matt Bouley at Barclays.
Matt Bouley: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter and on reaching your leverage targets as well.
Chad Crow: Thank you.
Matt Bouley: So I guess on that point with leverage down near three times you authorized the repurchase of course. What can you say about the M&A pipeline in this environment? And relative to share repurchase, should M&A be a larger priority this year? Or do you anticipate kind of further deleveraging as you get towards the lower end of your leverage range there before M&A becomes a bigger tool? Thank you.
Chad Crow: Yes, I think it will be a little of both. I -- we want to continue to delever. As I've mentioned in the opening remarks, we certainly want to expand our value-added platform. And so if some opportunities came along there to do so -- to buy those greenfield, we would certainly look at it. At the present time, I don't anticipate any significant M&A. But certainly, we would consider some smaller M&A options from a value-add standpoint as opposed to greenfielding. Greenfielding is just getting harder and harder these days with all the restrictions and permitting requirements. And it's just taking longer and longer to get buildings out of the ground. So I would certainly be open to some smaller M&A activity and at the same time continue to delever a bit.
Matt Bouley: Okay. I appreciate that. And then secondly, just around the guidance. I think the first quarter EBITDA guide given the gross margin performance, it would suggest there's still some offset I guess on the SG&A side. Is that just further commissions and incentives as in Q4? Or is this kind of further heavy lifting around some of your investments? Really just how should we think about SG&A I guess beyond the first quarter? And when some of these investments may kind of reach scale? Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Yes. So the discussion around SG&A obviously you saw the jump in the percentage. There's couple of factors obviously as we deflate there'll be some natural inflation. Just like we saw the benefit in the earlier months in 2018. But we did see commissions go up. And hopefully that was a clear explanation and that we are -- our commission plans are built to reward our salespeople for selling at higher margins. And so that award is showing both in the fourth quarter and of course a bit in the first quarter as well. The other major factors I would describe comp and benes is certainly an area where we've seen pressure over the last year unemployment is down. And we certainly had to work to take care of our employees and make sure that we have good retention. And we have seen some headwinds in the areas of insurance, both medical and casualty due to ever increasing. It seems medical costs in this country as well as some of the hurricanes and the weather that we've seen. So some areas there where we have -- and we'll likely continue to see some challenges with inflation. But the team is doing a good job of managing expenses and staying discipline particularly in the controllable areas. In our benefits associated with the improvements of the operational excellence are certainly going to be felt throughout the year. And we anticipate increasing over time. It is important to remember seasonality though, right? So Q1 and Q4 are certainly our lowest volume periods. And that's when it will show the highest percentage of SG&A in any given year.
Matt Bouley: All right. I appreciate all of the detail. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Nishu Sood at Deutsche Bank.
Nishu Sood: Thank you. So the sales per day guidance implies -- for 1Q 2019 implies that you're expecting -- once you factor out the lumber price. So in the commodity inflation drag about mid single-digits gains year-over-year and sales per day. That's obviously a pretty strong performance in light of some of the volatility that we've seen in the housing market. Some builders are reporting double-digit order declines et cetera. So is the -- has the book of business, has it seen any effects from that for you folks? And if so, when would you expect to see it? Your macro commentary sounded still positive, but just wanted to see if you could reconcile for us the pretty robust expectation for 1Q 2019 versus some of the other data points we're hearing from some of the public builders?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. So I guess I'll start and of course Chad can jump in. The components there in - I would say our expectation is more in the low-single digits increase particularly for single family. There is growth in the business. We've got, of course, a little bit of share that we think we've got a line of sight too. Perhaps a little bit of rounding in some of the number that you're doing the math on. But we think it's in the low single digit range. Reason for our confidence in that is really the performance we had in the fourth quarter for starters as well as the ongoing contact we have with our customers. The sentiment out there despite the headlines and we read them too. But the sentiment amongst the people on the ground is that a lot of what has concerned folks and has slowed people down has begun to abate. Interest rates have dropped a bit, the cost of lumber clearly has dropped a bit. And we think those encouraged homebuyers to get back in the game as things settle down a bit. The pause that we expected we think is just that pause and things will get back to a more normalized level or perhaps slower growth than we've seen in certain points in the past couple of years, still growth. So a lot of optimism out there and despite some lumpiness whether it be weather or a pause we saw a lot of confidence in the underlying demand.
Nishu Sood: Got it, got it, okay. And second question. On the increased sales commissions you had a fantastic record gross margin as you mentioned 27.1%. Let's suppose that the 25% is the normalized, and I should -- I love your thoughts on that whether that's still the case. So 210 basis points above "normalized" how much incremental sales commission did that drive in basis points?
Peter Jackson: Let's see. So I guess the first comment I'll make is regarding normal. I still think that 25% is a reasonable proxy for normal in terms of gross margin. We've talked about that in the past. I think that's still true. When we talk about comp and benefits, I don't know that I have a breakdown of the commissions as a percentage. I can tell you it's about half -- a little less than half of the SG&A variance for the fourth quarter. So it's substantial amount…
Nishu Sood: Got it, got it. And as the -- as we think about this commission I mean it -- was it larger because of the extreme volatility? So the incremental sales commission against where prices were -- I mean I used the benchmark of that 25% normalized gross margin. But does the commission work that way? Or is it against improvement in gross margin so that the extreme volatility might have had a greater effect and pushed those sales commissions on stronger margins up more than they might've been on a normal volatility environment?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. I think it's fair to say your assumption is right. If you think about it from a purely simplistic level if we are making 20 points normally on some lumber and the underlying cost falls and we talked about it being in the 30% range, it's a substantial increase in the profitability of that particular sale. Just like it -- when we see inflation, the profitability goes south, we both reward and penalize our sales people for achieving higher profitability and lower profitability, respectively. So that net compounding effect of improved gross margins generates a higher payout, because the dollars have increased. And there's a premium associated with higher than normal and in this case much higher than normal margin recovery. Does that make more sense? Is that clear?
Nishu Sood: No, that's great. Thanks very much.
Operator: And our next question is from Trey Morrish at Evercore ISI.
Trey Morrish: Thanks very much guys. And really good quarter. I want to talk a second about the margin trajectory outside of lumber. So we understand that lumber can have quite a bit of volatility just given the massive pull down. But could you give us some thoughts some insights on what your gross margins outside of the lumber category looks like? Were they also up as well? Or were they kind of more flattish?
Peter Jackson: They were pretty flat. The only exception to that is where we've done work around our pricing optimization tools. We think that by managing and being a bit more disciplined in some of the tools we have we were able to drive for the year probably about $4 million worth of benefits in those initiatives and a lot of that was in the fourth quarter.
Chad Crow: And I'll just add we did see some improvement in the manufacturing products category. As you know, we continue to invest in our truss plants and automate where we need to and we're seeing some efficiencies there. So Peter's right obviously lumber was up, especially the back half of the year, the other product categories were relatively flat, but we also saw a decent little bump in manufactured products.
Trey Morrish: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then turning back to the volume outlook that you're looking for 1Q. You said it was kind of low single-digit range. But this point we're two-thirds of the way time-wise through the quarter, maybe not quite business and sales-wise. But would it be fair to extrapolate from your comments that you're probably tracking flat to probably up so far year-to-date?
Peter Jackson: I don't plan to change my guidance and I think we'll make the guidance for the quarter.
Trey Morrish: Okay. All right.
Peter Jackson: If that is implied, right. I mean, yes. Thank you.
Trey Morrish: Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Mike Dahl at RBC Capital Markets.
Mike Eisen: Good morning. Mike Eisen on the line for RBC. Just wanted to start off on the value-add products you guys continue to invest and then drive growth here. But we did see it step down a little in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what drove some of that? And whether you think that's broader market slowdown? Or if we should expect a more consistent mid to high single-digit rates? Or if you guys can reaccelerate that and continue to grow outside in that -- in those segments?
Peter Jackson: Yes. It's a fair question. There's certainly a deceleration in the growth when you look at the numbers on a consolidated basis, right? I'd say some markets are still very healthy, some markets have weakened on balance, it's a bit slower. There's still a lot of demand for the value-added product, right? There's – despite, again, all of the terrible headlines the demand hasn't really gone anywhere it's still there. And so the availability of labor the job sites being -- not having sufficient people on the ground are all still challenges for our customers. We still are seeing significant year-over-year increase in people investigating, expanding their use of prefabricated products. Whether it be trusses or panels or the better framing system. We are seeing that and enjoying the benefits of that. Gauging it on a quarter-by-quarter basis in terms of growth trying to align it with the overall market growth, it's a challenging thing to do from a forecast perspective. Probably fair that it would step back a bit from its heavier days last year when the overall market was growing at a high rate, but we still anticipate healthy growth through 2019.
Chad Crow: Some of it could be regional too. A lot of the heavier used regions of the country over the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast and those tend to be impacted a little more about weather then say Texas would -- isn't impacted as much, but also is as much of a truss market.
Mike Eisen : Got it. That's really helpful information. And then transitioning to your delivery optimization program. You guys laid out some early successes you've had and desired to roll this out to 75% of the branches before the end of the year. Can you help us think from a P&L perspective some of the early results you've seen in the branches where it is? Whether it'd be better SG&A better throughput? Something that we can help quantify the magnitude of the potential here?
Peter Jackson : Yes, sure. So we are looking that number for 2018. Still early days in a lot of locations, but really positive feedback from the users and those that have really adopted it and started to see squeeze some juice out of it have seen some really nice benefits on the bottom line. As you can imagine, it impacts both gross margin in the variable cost as well as SG&A in some of the overhead costs. We think that we saw -- and we from our analysis, we've seen about $2 million worth of benefit in 2018 from the delivery optimization tools, which is primarily the software that we manage as well as some other ancillary tools that we're using. We think that of course is going to grow as we get those locations implemented and then ramped up, sort of a two-phased approach for each location.
Chad Crow : And I'll just add. In total we see it as a company over the next several years is somewhere around $20 million to $25 million opportunity, which translated -- it means we need to be about 5% more efficient from a delivery standpoint and from a yard personnel standpoint. Or say it in another way somewhere around 30% basis points as a percentage of sales. So it's a real opportunity and I feel very good about being able to achieve those numbers in the coming years.
Mike Eisen : Got it. Thanks, good luck.
Chad Crow : Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jay McCanless at Wedbush.
Jay McCanless: Thank you. Good morning everyone. So my first question if lumber prices stay where they are in now, theoretically should we expect some deleveraging on the overhead margin just assume we stay like in this 350, 400 band for the full year?
Peter Jackson: Of course. Yes I mean it's -- we think it's going to work on an adverse way as last year. The growth in commodities benefited us on SG&A as a percentage of sales when it was inflating. And as it deflates, it will go the opposite direction. We didn't add people for example when it inflated so we won't take people out when it deflates. But underlying that I think we're very pleased with the fourth quarter results. There were some skepticism if you recall Jay in the market about whether or not we'll be able to protect our margins in case of deflation, and whether or not we would see the outsize benefit in our gross margin percentages that we claimed. And I think our results certainly proved that we did what we said we would do. And so we'll manage through this year. There'll be some continued volatility commodities always manage to throw us a curveball or two. But I think we're very well positioned. We've proven our discipline and our ability to manage in both up and markets. And we're going to do that this year and focus on the operational stuff that we know we can control. And we'll focus on making money on commodities and keeping the business in line and being disciplined.
Chad Crow: Yes. And I'll just add. I don't think I'm going out on a limb to say, its very likely commodity prices will not be as volatile this year as they were last year. I do think, as we get into the spring and summer building season, we will see some inflation. But even, that being said, it's likely going to be a bit of a headwind this year. But all in all, as you guys -- everyone knows on this call, we operate in a cyclical business. And this is just part of it. And in a cyclical business, you have good years, you have bad years. 2018 was a good year and despite maybe some additional headwinds in 2019, 2019 is going to be a good year. So as Peter said, we will deal with what comes our way. But we feel really good about things as we sit here today.
Jay McCanless: The second question I have with the excitingly bad weather we've in a lot of different locations this year. I'm assuming that the guidance you've given on sales per day includes whatever weather benefit you've seen so far? Could you talk about that a little bit? What impact it's had on R&R? And then also the other one I want to sneak in on the -- could you repeat, and I missed this, so I apologize. But just how much of the 2024 notes you guys bought in, both in 4Q and then this quarter?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So to answer the second question first. It's about 75 total, 50 in Q4 -- 50-ish in Q4 and 25-ish in Q1. Yes. I mean, I'll make a couple of comments on the weather. I mean, first of all, definitely not a benefit. I'm assuming you were being facetious on that one. A lot of destructive weather, a little bit in the fourth quarter, more in the first. We -- candidly, we don't like getting into the weather reports, but you having heard other folks talk about it, it absolutely is real. Polar vortexes, blizzards, unusual snow in the Pacific Northwest, unusual rain in the Pacific Southwest. So it is certainly an interesting time. Yes, we've included the bulk of what we've seen so far. But I can't say tomorrow's weather pattern is focused in. We'll, have to respond to that, but we think it's pretty well baked in. Certainly, a lot of West Coast disruption, upper Midwest disruption. It's been problematic. But it is what it is.
Jay McCanless: Sounds good. Thanks guys.
Peter Jackson: Thanks, Jay.
Operator: And we'll go next to Matt McCall at Seaport Global Securities.
Matt McCall: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
Chad Crow: Hi, Matt. 
Peter Jackson: Good morning, Matt.
Matt McCall: So the -- that you talked about the bogey, 85% average annual free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income. Can you talk about that? How that looks in 2019? I'm specifically thinking about the impact of lumber on working capital, I mean, how do we think about 2019 relative to that 85%?
Peter Jackson: Yes. So it's a good question. I mean, part of the reason for not giving guidance is because, depending on where commodities goes there goes my both EBITDA and there goes my working capital, likely in different directions. Same is true with single family starts. The rational for the change is, people got hung up candidly on that long-range plan presentation with regard to the accumulative cash flow and kept trying to lock back to -- so what year and what year. And our point in that is, really to emphasize a normal housing market has a significant tailwind from where we are today on our results. And over time, our performance -- improving performance really thinks back very well to that sort of 85%. Some use more, some use a bit less, but running in that 85% range historically and going forward for cash generation that we can utilize, right, to grow the business to pay down debt, continue to strengthen our balance sheet. So we felt that was a more appropriate way of talking about it, rather than a single dollar amount over a cumulative number of years. So that was a rational for the change. As we get into a full year guide, we can add that sort of list to providing to everybody that percentage for the year.
Matt McCall: Okay that's fair. I understand the uncertainty around what lumber does. So I think in the past you talked about 9% to 10% working capital, 9% to 10% in incremental sales. If lumber stays where we are today, how should we think about the full year? Is that still a good rule of thumb?
Peter Jackson: I would say, generally it is. But you have to account for the lumber volatility as of -- as an impact as well, right? And if you can tell me what my volume is and what commodities we'll do? I can tell you what my working capital impact is going to be.
Matt McCall: Okay. I'll work on that. So, Chad, you said you're still going to focus on debt reduction. You've kind of gotten, I think, to the midpoint of the targeted range, if I remember correctly. What's -- do you have a new target established? Or you just continue to work it down in the absence of an opportunity from here? Where -- how do we think about your net debt-to-EBITDA bogey?
Chad Crow: Yes. It depends, right? It depends on how we're feeling about the cycle and where we are. It depends about -- it depends on what opportunities may present themselves. I'm not going to turn a blind eye to opportunities, if they come along. If something came along and it required us to pop back up to 3.5 or 3.8 times. But we had a clear runway of bringing it back down in short order. I'm not going to say no to -- or at least, not going to say, I'm not going to look at something like that. We back in 2015, we had no idea ProBuild would come along. And I'm being glad we did it. So it really just depends on the opportunities that are out there. But I would say, bar any significant opportunities that we want to look at. Yes, I'd say, driving it down somewhere closer to 2.5 on a longer-term basis is probably what we'll be looking at.
Matt McCall: Okay, perfect. And then, last one, I think, you broke out the CapEx, it's going to be aimed at kind of new facilities, some of the truss -- if you see truss facility, more plants, truss lines and door machines. I guess, the question is, what's the incremental add look like 2019 versus what you just experienced in 2018? How much are you going to add to either each one of those or the total?
Peter Jackson: We called that about a quarter of our CapEx, another quarter of the 1.5% we think will be focused on those categories that I think you are outlining there.
Matt McCall: And how does that -- what was the total in 2018 in those terms? About the same?
Peter Jackson: That's a good question. Probably about the same, maybe a little less, but right in there.
Matt McCall: Okay. All right. Thank you all. 
Operator: Moving next to Steven Ramsey at Thompson Research Group. Sir?
Steven Ramsey: Good morning. I would assume … 
Peter Jackson: Good morning.
Steven Ramsey: … just thinking about your locations sort of on a portfolio basis as you continually access KPIs and the outlook of each. From that perspective, did you close any locations last year or open any? And do you expect anything on that front this year? And kind of how do you look at the penetration of value-added products penetration in locations? And the revenue capacity and generation of each -- I guess just kind of thinking locations bases or where you want to be?
Peter Jackson: So, I guess, I can open it and then sure Chad will probably want to jump in. But the decisions about opening and closing facilities in the given year, yeah, we opened I think two this year and closed two this year. So, we're continuing to modify. We closed an operation in East Hartford Connecticut I think. And one in Oklahoma City, but kept others in Oklahoma City. We're constantly sort of looking for opportunities to take out businesses where the return isn't where we need it to be and add locations where we think either a greenfield or a product specific location might help about -- with regard to capacity. On the value-add side each line each type of equipment has certain capacity availability. And that's where we flex, right? If we got a location it starts to run up against capacity constraint, but has manual equipment, we can move that manual equipment out to another location and bring in automated equipment and add a bunch of capacity into a locale. A little trickier around the lumber side. Your footprint matters or things you can do to improve efficiency, but there is some real space constraints that will limit the amount of dollars you can put through a facility. And that falls into the decision-making. We go through regularly about where do we need to add either square footage or acreage in order to run the business. It is an ongoing decision. And it is one of the things that we've really started to analyze a couple of different ways, right? We, of course, manage it on an EBITDA basis, on an EBIT basis, but also we're looking at it on an ROIC basis in order to make sure we're making wise decisions from a more strategic perspective.
Steven Ramsey: Great. And then thinking about R&R slower in the Midwest, but broadly outside of the Midwest, is R&R activity performing more strongly when you look at it that way? And is your outlook from today thinking about 2019, is it more predictably good? Are you able to kind of quantify range on growth in that end market than you are with new construction?
Peter Jackson: I would say -- to answer your second question first, no, we are not quantifying growth in that space largely because of our geographic exposure being in the Midwest -- in R&R and other, in the Midwest in southern California and up on to Alaska. Those are sort of concentrated areas at least in the Midwest perspective, a lot of uncertainty candidly with regard to the U.S./China trade and the impact on ag soybean's important in particular. And the resulting sort of hesitation by certain markets to really get aggressive in some of their sales and some of their investments. Southern California is I'm sure everybody knows very volatile market historically. That's proven true in the last couple of years as well, so I'm a little reluctant to call a ball on that market, as well. And then unfortunately, Alaska despite the beginning of the recovery in oil prices in the fourth quarter are sort of pullback a bit. So we are -- there is a bit more wait and see up there as well. So, I'd say those are all reasons for uncertainty, not reason for optimism at this point, but we're going to wait and see.
Chad Crow: Yeah, I don't -- wouldn't say the sky is falling, but the upper Midwest will be a challenge this year. I think Alaska will be a little better and Southern California is a bit of a question mark right now. So, I would echo what Peter said. Don't say it going gangbusters. It could be a little sluggish this year.
Steven Ramsey: Great. Thank you.
Peter Jackson: Thank you. 
Operator: And we'll go next to Kurt Yinger at D.A. Davidson.
Kurt Yinger: Yeah. Good morning everyone and thanks for taking my questions.
Peter Jackson: You bet. Yeah. 
Kurt Yinger: I just wanted to start off on going back to gross margin. I did my math right. You're looking for 26% or maybe a little bit better in the first quarter. And you mentioned 25% is still kind of a reasonable normal figure. How quickly could we move back towards that as the year progresses? Is it something where you lose a lot -- about 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter in the first quarter and the same in the second, or is it may be more of a gradual step down?
Peter Jackson: Generally what we've said in the past and I think it's true still now is it -- it takes about a quarter or two to work through inventory on the ground and the pricing arrangements we have with our customers. So, I would say given that price has started running back up in Q1. Q1 and Q2 is where you're going to see the vast majority of the impact.
Chad Crow: Yeah, I think it'll pretty much have played out barring some unexpected change by the end of Q2.
Kurt Yinger: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks. And looking at the $65 million to $75 million sort of improvement now from operational initiatives returning to sort of mid-cycle building levels. Is there any way to think about that savings between cost of sales and gross margin versus SG&A?
Peter Jackson: I would say it's probably a third margin, two-thirds SG&A.
Kurt Yinger: Okay. And lastly, what's a good way to think about interest rate -- interest expense for the year?
Peter Jackson: Yeah. So, our guide is about $95 million to a $100 million.
Kurt Yinger: Okay. Thanks very much.
Chad Crow: You bet.
Peter Jackson: Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. And I'd like to turn things back over to Mr. Crow for any additional or concluding remarks. Sir?
Chad Crow: Well, thank you once again for joining our call today. We look forward to updating you on the progress of our initiatives in the quarters ahead. If you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Binit or Peter. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, once again that does conclude today's conference. And again, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today.

M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Binit, and good morning, everyone. As usual, we will start with a brief update on our third quarter performance as well as our strategic growth initiatives. Then I will turn the call over to Peter who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Let's start on page 4. I am happy to report that in the third quarter, we delivered sales growth of 12.7% to $2.1 billion and generated a record-level $155 million of EBITDA. We grew our higher margin value-added product sales by nearly 14% as our team focused on executing our strategic plan and continued to provide value-added solutions to our customers to help mitigate challenges they face, including labor availability. I am also especially pleased with our team's responsiveness to a dynamic market and continuing focus on pricing discipline in a volatile commodity environment. Through their hard work, we are continuing our track record of strategic growth, expanding profitability, product differentiation, and value delivery to our customers. We successfully passed on commodity price inflation, which represented approximately 11.2% of the sales growth, while 1.5% came from organic growth, including approximately 3.1% in the single-family homebuilding end market. R&R and other was down 2.6%, largely driven by a slowdown in the Midwest where much of the economy is driven by the Ag industry. Turning to slide 5, our strategy to invest in manufacturing capacity is delivering results. Relative to our estimated overall organic growth of 1.5%, we grew manufactured products volume by double digits and total sales by 21%. Our platform provides us significant ongoing opportunities to increase both our overall market share and the penetration of our higher margin products, as evidenced by the 14% growth in our value-added product categories. Commodity prices declined sharply in the quarter, as framing lumber and sheet good prices ended the quarter down 26% and 16%, respectively, compared to the beginning of the quarter. As a result, our gross margin percentage improved as commodity cost declined relative to our short-term customer pricing agreements. Our team again demonstrated its ability to manage through the commodity price volatility and, at the same time, maintain a consistent focus on delivering value-added solutions to our customers. Our plans to expand our manufacturing and value-added capacity remain on track this year, including two new truss plants, approximately 10 new truss lines in existing plants, one new millwork facility and capacity additions to many locations. We are committed to continuing the expansion of our network of 57 manufacturing facilities strategically located across the country. With the continuing challenges being faced by our customers, demand for our labor-saving products should continue to rise, providing us additional opportunities for profitable growth, as evident in our results for this past quarter. Moving to page 6. With an overview of the macro housing markets, the outlook for new residential housing demand and activity remains favorable, as does homebuilders' sentiment. We have seen a recent easing in the rate of growth as builders and homebuyers adjust to changes in interest rates and shift in the mix of homebuyer demand. However, underlying demographic trends, household formations as well as employment and overall economic conditions remain supportive for ongoing growth in demand, which is what we continue to see in the market as well. The U.S. homebuilding industry has now reached a 12-month run rate of approximately 1.26 million annual starts, with approximately 890,000 of those being single-family starts, approximately 20% below the long-term historic average. Moving to page 7. As single-family housing starts over the next several years continue to move closer toward the 1.1 million historical average, we continue to execute our operational excellence and value-added investment strategy that will support further profitability enhancement and growth in revenues. We continue to develop our sales force and invest in our manufacturing and value-added facility expansion initiatives. These growth platforms provide us significant ongoing opportunities to increase our market share and increase the penetration of our higher margin products. In addition to capturing market growth, our value-added product growth and operational excellence initiatives underway are expected to generate an additional $100 million of profitability. Our plan to double 2016 EBITDA, as housing starts return to long-term averages, remains on track. This equates to an EBITDA level of approximately 50% greater than our current trailing 12-month figure of $473 million. These initiatives are expected to also generate over $1 billion in cumulative free cash flow from 2016 and deliver an EPS between $3 and $3.50. Our strategic plan prudently balances the deployment of cash into strategic investment opportunities and profitable growth and ongoing debt reduction to achieve our leverage target of 2.5 to 3.5 times EBITDA. Turning to slide 8, we detail our specific growth initiatives. Our existing core business strengths, including our national footprint, unmatched scale and manufacturing capability, and best-in-class sales force provides us with a platform to capitalize on growth in residential housing market and is expected to generate an incremental $250 million to $280 million in EBITDA as compared to 2016. We call this core growth. In addition to this core growth, we continue to expand our national manufacturing footprint and capabilities to grow our higher-margin, value-added products faster than the overall market. Our plans currently call for investing in 25 new facilities over the next four years, including the three facilities underway this year, expanding our nationwide footprint to serve a number of locations that do not currently have adequate access to these higher-margin products and where we see great opportunities to serve market needs with our customers. Our strategic plan also includes a set of operational excellence efficiency initiatives, including distribution and logistics, pricing and margin optimization tools, back-office process efficiencies, and information system enhancements that are expected to contribute between $65 million and $75 million in incremental annual EBITDA. Our project teams continue to make solid progress on these work streams, including for example our dispatch and delivery optimization, which has now been rolled out to over 100 locations. As a result, we are starting to see engine idle times decrease and on-road percentages increase, starting to deliver the improvements in overall fleet efficiency that we expected. Another example is our pricing model rollout, which is showing positive early results in the markets in which we have piloted this enhanced process. These projects when rolled out across 400 locations will offer significant margin expansion opportunities and will further differentiate our service levels and connectivity with our customers, providing economic and strategic value that is unrivaled by our smaller competitors. Based on results to-date, we are confident that the expanding benefits from our initiatives will, when scaled, generate the returns we have targeted. I will now turn the call over to Peter, who will review our financial results in more detail.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. As a reminder, we have included adjusted figures to normalize for one-time integration and other costs. We reported net sales of $2.1 billion, a 12.7% increase compared to the third quarter of 2017, including an approximately 11.2% benefit from commodity price inflation and an estimated 1.5% from organic growth. Our underlying sales volume grew an estimated 3.1% in the single-family new construction end market. And as Chad highlighted, our value-added products increased 13.9%, led by particularly strong growth in manufactured products of 21.1%. Gross margins of $522.8 million in the third quarter of 2018 increased by $63.5 million or 13.8% over the third quarter of 2017. Our gross margin percentage was 24.7%, up approximately 30 basis points from 24.4% in the third quarter of 2017 and a sequential improvement of nearly 100 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2018. The improvement in the gross margin percentage was attributable to a sharp decline in commodity prices during the quarter and from strong growth that our team drove in our high-margin, value-added products. Framing lumber and sheet good prices declined 26% and 16% respectively since the beginning of the third quarter. As we have discussed in our prior calls, commodity inflation causes short-term gross margin percentage compression when prices are rising and margin percentage expansion when prices are falling, due to the short-term pricing commitments we provide customers versus the volatility of the commodity markets. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased by 80 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This reduction was driven by operating leverage and ongoing cost efficiencies. Interest expense for the quarter was $29.1 million, compared to $33.8 million in 2017. The reduction was largely the result of transactions the company executed in 2017 to lower our go-forward cash interest expense and further strengthen our capital structure, slightly offset by a rising interest rate environment. Net income for the quarter was $77.8 million or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to $45.4 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase of $32.4 million or 71.4% was driven primarily by sales growth, mix improvement, and ongoing cost management. Third quarter EBITDA grew $32.8 million or 26.9% to $154.8 million. The year-over-year improvement was largely driven by these same factors. Most noteworthy to me, however, is the impact from our strategic value-added investments, which are expected to provide growing returns as our investments mature. Switching now to the year-to-date financial highlights, please turn to slide 11. The company achieved strong results this year-to-date in 2018, including 12.4% sales growth, 16.9% EBITDA growth, a $0.57 improvement in earnings per share, and a 0.7 times reduction in leverage, even after funding our strategic growth and capital improvement investments. I'm very pleased to report that value-added sales per day grew at a healthy 13% year-to-date. Turning to page 12, our free cash flow generation remained strong as we entered the last quarter of the year. Cash generation will continue to be supported by EBITDA growth and our continuous focus on working capital efficiency, which is estimated to run at approximately 10% of incremental sales. We will continue to invest in our business through capital expenditures at approximately 1.5% of sales. Our current NOL tax asset will shelter us from paying all but approximately $15 million to $20 million in cash taxes in 2018. As a result of the capital markets transactions we executed in 2017, our cash interest is expected to be approximately $95 million to $100 million in 2018. As we continue our systems integration work to support our operational initiatives, we expect one-time costs of $15 million to $20 million for the year. In total, we continue to expect to end the year within our free cash flow guidance of the $170 million to $190 million, albeit closer to the lower end of the range. The cash generated will be used to pay down debt and fund our strategic growth investments, and we remain confident that we will end the year with a leverage ratio below 3.5 times, delivering on a major commitment communicated at the time of our ProBuild acquisition in 2015. Given the seasonal pattern of working capital needs, we typically use cash in the first half of the year and generate cash in the second half of the year. Cash used in operations and investing in year-to-date was $67.3 million, including $76.8 million of capital investments. This remains in line with our expectations and with our annual guidance. We have continued to reduce our leverage despite the impact of commodity product price inflation on working capital. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a trailing 12-month basis as of September 30, 2018 was 3.9 times, representing a 0.7 times reduction from the third quarter of 2017. As we begin our seasonal working capital conversion, total liquidity at September 30, 2018 was ample at $448 million, consisting of net borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. As we look forward with confidence in our team's strong execution and the solid underlying demand of the housing market environment, let me provide some color on what we see in our fourth quarter of 2018. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales per day to be up mid-single digits over prior year, with a little more than half coming from commodity inflation. Gross margin is expected to be up sequentially from the third quarter by 30 to 40 basis points, as we continue to see the benefit of declining commodity costs and the expansion of our value-added product categories. We also expect an effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the balance of 2018. Further supported by our continued focus on cost discipline and efficiency improvements, we expect EBITDA to grow between 20% and 30% over the fourth quarter of 2017. I will now turn the call back over to Chad for his closing comments.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Peter. Our third quarter results demonstrate the alignment of our entire team around our strategies and customer value propositions and our ability to successfully manage through the commodity price volatility and other challenges effectively. It also demonstrates the value of our national footprint, unrivaled end-market diversity, and geographic reach, without which we cannot have achieved this record level of quarterly EBITDA or continue to generate such strong free cash flow for our shareholders. Despite the moderating market growth that we have seen recently, there continues to be substantial demand for new housing. We believe the market is adjusting its ability to satisfy this need with the right products at the right prices in the right places. We remain highly confident and enthusiastic about the runway that remains ahead of us and the value creation we will deliver from the consistent execution of our strategy. Our team remains focused on delivering exceptional value to the customers and strong results to our shareholders, and I thank all of our associates for their commitment as we build an even brighter future together. Before I turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, I want to take a moment and comment on the 8-K we filed this morning, announcing the passing of our colleague and dear friend, Morris Tolly. Morris joined BFS through the acquisition of the Pelican Companies in December 1998, almost two decades ago, and from that point on was instrumental in building the company we are today. From an operational perspective, he was the leader, the coach, the mentor and the friend we all leaned on to help pull together what was then a collection of acquired companies into the industry-leading team we are today. We will miss his keep-it-simple, commonsense approach to the business and his low-country witticism that made us all laugh hundreds of times. Our lives were all enhanced by knowing him, and we've all been blessed to work alongside him. He was just one of those guys. While Morris' passing caught us all by surprise, his leaving the company did not because I expected him to formally announce his retirement in the coming weeks, which makes his passing even that much more upsetting. Succession planning was well underway, and I anticipate an internal successor will be named very soon. Operator, we can now open the call up for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our first question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Sorry for your loss.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, Mike.
Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC: First question relates to just the environment. Obviously, a lot of moving pieces, particularly around the lumber but also with some of these slower builder order trends of late. So, strong fourth quarter guidance. I know it's early but I was wondering if you could provide a little commentary even directionally on what you expect from 2019. Is the magnitude of decline in lumber prices and this relatively slower growth such that it will be, I guess, difficult to grow EBITDA in 2019? Or can you talk about whether you expect growth next year?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah, you're right. There are a lot of moving pieces right now and it seems like a lot of things are kind of in flux. But we do still feel like overall housing demand will grow, single-family demand will grow next year. Best guess now, maybe single family is up 4%, 5%. Time will tell, obviously. But it still feels like more of a pause, a speed bump, whatever you want to call it. So I would say sitting here today I expect single family to be up. Commodity prices. It's funny, two quarters ago we were talking about how high prices were and were we going to update our long-term forecast because what we've thrown out there would be a slam dunk at those prices. And now we're talking about are prices going to stay where they are today. I think what we can all agree is prices aren't going to stay where they are. And I think when I responded to the question two quarters ago, I said, yeah, that would be great but we all known prices won't stay where they are, commodity lumber prices, they just don't, they never do. So I would fully expect to see commodity price inflation. From where we are today, it's starting to feel like we've hit some lows. And we'll be dealing with some of the same things we've dealt with last year, transportation issues, things like that. So, yes, if commodity prices stayed where they were today all the way through next year, that'd be a pretty big headwind, but I really don't anticipate that's going to happen. And we're closing out a year that was probably the most volatile ever in commodity prices and I think we managed through it really well and we're producing a hell of a year. And so we'll deal with whatever cards are dealt us next year, but I would fully expect to see some inflation between now and then as we work through the rest of next year.
Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Yeah. It's been pretty wild.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah.
Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC: The second question, and either you or maybe Peter can take this, sticking with the commodity price inflation but asking more from a working cap standpoint. Can you quantify how much of a headwind you expect it to be to your 2018 results? And if lumber prices were sitting where they're at today, next year how much of a potential tailwind could you see to working cap from the lower commodity prices?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: It's a good question. I think that maybe the best way to characterize it is that at the peak we were seeing pretty substantial increases in both accounts receivable and inventories from the impact of inflation. I think that when we were looking at it in the third quarter, it was still probably $100 million to $150 million range of headwind that we were still burning through. We think we'll burn off a good chunk of that by year-end, sort of in line with the way that we generally would pull down accounts receivable and inventory. I don't really have a number for you off the top of my head for next year's cash flow results, but I think it's fair to say that we would see it as a tailwind. Again, to Chad's comments, so it's a little early to count any chickens on that just because of the volatility we've seen.
Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Fair enough. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.
Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. And I'll say we're all sorry for your loss over here as well.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I wanted to follow up around the questions on the commodity price. And I think you just mentioned that you guys are confident around kind of a rebound there. So, just if we are in, I guess, this stable single-family volume environment here, I think you just mentioned 4% to 5% next year, and given housing is a big driver of lumber demand and you guys are obviously closer to the market and normal isn't really a word that you can necessarily apply to lumber, but at this point what's kind of your best guess, given supply and demand, around what kind of a normalized lumber price should look like into next year? Thank you
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Oh, gosh. If I had to guess, I would say next year will be volatile as well. Probably not to the degree we saw this year. And I wouldn't be surprised if, by the time we end next year, average prices for 2019 are maybe 20% lower than they were on average this year. So I think we'll see inflation. I think we'll see volatility. But I would be surprised if average prices in total for the year are as high as 2018, but I still think they would be some pretty healthy levels. And again, that's obviously just – that's just a guess at this point.
Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Understood. Thank you for that. And then, on the manufactured products business, the 21% growth, I think I heard you say double-digit on volume. Is there any finer point you can put on that volume versus price there? Because it's just – obviously, given what you mentioned around the market growth next year, I think it would just be helpful to understand your growth relative to the market and so how we can think about that into 2019? Thank you.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So, I mean, we don't have any real market information that we feel comfortable banging up against. I mean, I think that when we talk about single-family, we have some high-level starts numbers, even that's tough given the changing size and profile of the homes that we sell into. We feel very good about our performance. We think we're at or above market. We think we're holding or gaining share as far as value add goes. Yeah, there's a good chunk of commodity inflation and pricing change in the number this year, but we're still solidly in the double digits for growth in the manufactured products, I think still in that double-digit range for consolidated value add, so clearly market share being taken in that space. I think it's consistent both with the investments we're making as well as the market adoption of that sort of labor-saving service that we provide in that space. So we feel like that is very healthy and I think consistent that we've seen pretty much all year and through last year. So we feel very, very good about the investments we've made and our continuing commitment to that space. We think our customers like it and it continues to get great traction.
Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thank you for the detail.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Morrish with Evercore ISI.
Trey Morrish - Evercore ISI: Hey, Chad and Peter. I also want to add my condolences to everyone else. We're all (30:16)...
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Trey Morrish - Evercore ISI: ...to hear that. So, I guess I want to start on the SG&A. You clearly had a lot of benefit to your top-line sales but the leverage that you saw in the quarter wasn't nearly as good as you saw it in the second quarter of around 80 basis points improvement this quarter versus 130 basis points last quarter, despite the much better top-line growth because of the lumber inflation. So, could you talk about, like, what happened in the quarter? Was there anything unique why it was a little bit less of year-over-year improvement in the third quarter relative to the second quarter?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Sure. I think you hit the nail on the head. We did have a good quarter. Sales were up. We did see leverage. We're very pleased with that. But I think your point is valid. There are some components we are seeing in our SG&A results. Some of it's real obvious. We had better profitability, so we saw increased incentive comp. That's probably the biggest piece. Another one is we pay more commissions when we have higher gross margins. So, predictably, our commission rate went up a bit. There are also some, I think, underlying expense. I think the inflation environment we're seeing is – I think it's fair to characterize that it continues to be a challenge. We called out fuel in the Q, so you'll see that. I think that's a continuing headwind. There's also a couple of internal aspects with regard to insurance. I think healthcare continues to be a headwind for us. The costs there are real and something we're battling through. And then I would say that wage inflation is a broad-based challenge for us. I think we're doing quite a good job at managing it, but it continues to be something that we see on an annual basis.
Trey Morrish - Evercore ISI: Got it. Thanks for that. And then more high level, labor constraints are definitely a – we think are going to be a challenge for the remainder of this cycle, even if you're going through a period of slower growth. Could you talk about, with your large footprint for manufactured product sales, how you expect that part of your business to evolve and develop over the remainder of this cycle?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, we're obviously making a lot of investments in that part of the business, the value-add side of the business, and expanding our footprint, and we will continue to do so. I do think the long-term trend is going to be less labor, less construction on the jobsite, and more done in plants or factories. And so, as we look further down the road – and I also think that labor is going to remain a challenge for the foreseeable future. So we're constantly investing in our truss and panel capacity, for example. And anywhere we can take some of that labor off the jobsite, I think that's where we're going to create the most value for our customers and create the most stickiness with our customers, and obviously that's going to result in higher margin.
Trey Morrish - Evercore ISI: Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. Two questions. One a bigger picture on multi-family. Are you starting to see some signs of multi-family, which has nationwide been in a little bit of a downturn here, start to pull back up for 2019?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: It does feel like we may have hit kind of the low point. We'll see a lot of that's market-by-market as well. But I'm hopeful we've hit kind of the low point on that. We're investing a lot in our multi-family team and really trying to serve the multi-family business more from a roof truss and floor truss perspective primarily. And so, time will tell, but hopefully we're going to start to see some upside there.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And two, there was a comment on interest expense being $95 million to $100 million, I think, for 2018. You're at $85 million year-to-date. I know you're paying down debt, but that's a pretty drastic reduction on a quarterly basis. I guess what's causing that? What are we looking at for the fourth quarter?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I don't know if I have a change in profile there. I think that there's a – when we look at the interest that we're incurring throughout the year, we incur more when we have our seasonal borrowing, which is coming down pretty rapidly right now. So I think, on a profile basis, our fourth quarter has relatively lower interest.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. So it's going to be...
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And nothing special is going on is the short answer.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. So it's going to be $10 million to $15 million, is that kind of what we're looking at for the fourth quarter?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think that's the squeeze, yeah.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from (sic) Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.
Timothy Daley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. This is actually Tim Daley on for Nishu. Thank you for the time and please accept our deepest condolences for the loss.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Timothy Daley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So the first question, Chad, I was I guess hoping to better understand some of the commentary provided in the press release specifically around how the associates remained focused on developing close relationships with customers and have demonstrated this commitment in the third quarter. I don't think we've ever heard you use that terminology or language before to describe customer interaction. So, how should we be interpreting this? And does it signal any sort of change or, I guess, shift in focus on the sales strategy or kind of like its application of the sales force?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: No, certainly not a shift in focus. I mean, we try to be in the back pockets of all our customers and that's where you're going to provide the most value in helping them actually build the house and be more than just a building products distributor. And so we're constantly pushing our guys to solve our builders' needs, solve their pain points. So, no, certainly not a shift in strategy. It's always been a strategy of ours, but it's something we continually harp on.
Timothy Daley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. Thank you for that. And then I guess thinking about the – kind of as home price appreciation is starting to slow under rising affordability pressures, builders are losing their pricing power. So, how are you, I guess, keeping builders who are currently utilizing the manufactured products, I guess, away from switching back to cheaper stick framing under these new lower commodity prices?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, most customers who use those products recognize the value in it and there's a lot of components to the value. Structurally, it's a better built house, less jobsite waste, increased cycle time. So you may have a few that try to shift, but I don't think the dip in commodity prices is really going to trigger that. During the depths of the downturn when framing labor costs hit rock bottom and commodity prices were down, that's where you'd seen builders more likely to re-evaluate the cost benefit. But I don't think we're anywhere near that right now.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And to add to that point, I think the labor constraint hasn't been alleviated despite some of the challenges you've outlined there. I think that, yes, we are – the homebuilders need to reset and be able to provide what the homebuyers really want. But that labor to build those homes hasn't magically appeared and it continues to be a great solution for our customers for that problem.
Timothy Daley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. That sounds positive. So, I guess and then my second question, thinking about – obviously there's been solid growth in the kind of selling locations and the number of sales associates that you guys have active. So, what was that number in this quarter and I guess how are you thinking about the continued growth in these metrics over the next year?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, for the year, we've probably added somewhere around 75 – or added or internally promoted around 75 sales folks. That's a gross number. We obviously have turnover. I don't have the net number handy. But, look, that's a big push of ours is really to put a focus on developing our sales force, developing our general managers and developing our employees overall. And so, that's going to continue to be a focus of ours.
Timothy Daley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And then how about the growth next year, just any color or quantification you could provide, if possible?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Growth on sales force?
Timothy Daley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Correct.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I would imagine we'll be pushing for a similar number, similar to this year.
Timothy Daley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Understood. All right. Thank you for the time.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt McCall with Seaport Global Securities.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Hi, Matt.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Morning.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Chad, really sorry to hear about your loss.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks. I appreciate it.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: That maybe had a big impact on you, so sorry about that.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Absolutely.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: So, maybe talk about pricing for a second. You mentioned some pricing tools. The 11 points of price is actually a little better than I think you expected in the quarter, definitely better than we modeled. And then the Q4 guide even seems a tad better than we had expected. So, are the pricing tools helping there? Is there something else that's going on? Is there any change, or is this just kind of where you thought it would be?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, certainly the commodity prices moving in our favor helped. We saw margin improvement in all our value-add categories this quarter, which didn't surprise me. And the pricing tool we've piloted in three or four markets and we've seen some positive results. It's really a tool we've built to make it easier and quicker for GMs to do pricing, puts a little more discipline around it, provides us better exception reporting when pricing goes outside of some predetermined levels that we set and does some customer stratification for us. So it's really just adding a level of sophistication. And we have seen some good results and we're working towards rolling that out more next year. So I would say maybe I was slightly surprised by the overall improvement in gross margin, but it certainly wasn't out of what was in the realm of expectation.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. Okay. As we look out in the next year and we think about the impact of incrementally lower lumber prices and trying to keep in mind how to model that, what's the updated thought, given some of the things you just said, on the decremental margin that you'll face from falling lumber?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I don't even want to get into speculating that because I think to try to waste time right now trying to assume that prices are going to be where they are today all the way through next year, I just don't think that's a useful – it's not a good use of our time. I think I feel pretty good we're going to hold gross margins, improve gross margins next year. Commodities will be what they're going to be, and that's part of the business and we deal with it. And I think we did a great job this year dealing with extreme volatility, and we're going to continue to execute no matter what it brings. So we really haven't even run numbers yet because I just don't think the prices are going to stay where they are.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Sure. Okay. That's fair. And I guess one last one. Peter, in the past, we've talked about some internal working capital initiatives. Working capital is a little better than we thought and lumber is likely going to help that. But what's the way to think about working capital? I know there was a question earlier about the impact of falling lumber and you're going to have a tailwind. But how do we think about it given maybe some of those initiatives on top of falling lumber as we move out into next year?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. Fair question. I think that the work that we've done around working capital is more a matter of structural discipline and a continuing focus on it to make sure that it never gets out of control, and we're still in that 9% to 10% range. I think that there are some specific examples that I can give you of success stories on a location-by-location basis. The dynamics that I think is challenging for the quarterly metric or for the ongoing metric is the in-month ups and downs, the nature of what we hold for our customers, the nature of how we have product on the ground at different valuations for projects or specific ordering profiles. It's a little bit harder to point to a specific quarter or a trend move, but I do see the benefits of the organization in what we do on a location-by-location basis by that focus. And I'm not quite ready to change our guide on that, but I think it will be part of the tailwind that we see coming to the back end of this year. And as we look at the year-over-year comps for working capital use into 2019, I think we'll see it as well. It's going to be caught up in that deflation number though based on where we are right now.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you all.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Rygiel with B. Riley FBR.
Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Thank you. Just one quick question. Was there an extra sales day in the fourth quarter 2017?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yes. I think that's the – fourth quarter is when we have our mismatch again this year.
Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Thank you.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Baugh with Stifel.
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good morning and my condolence as well on Morris' passing.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I had a little higher-level question and it relates to the shift of value-adds in manufactured and certainly commodities moved all over the place and they impact margins when they do. But when you think, Chad or Peter, about what – the pace you're on of shifting your mix, what overall impact that's having to either gross margin or EBITDA? Any sense of how you're moving the needle through time? I'd love to just get a sense of that.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: That's a good question when you try to drown out all the other noise that's going on. I think if we execute on our strategic plan over the next few years of expanding value-add on the company as a whole, gosh, I could see by the end of say 2021 or so kind of a permanent improvement of 40 basis points or so in our gross margin would be, I guess, a best guess off the top of my head.
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, if we saw housing starts in 2019, say, flat or maybe even slightly down, I'm assuming your earnings might get impacted if that played out. But I'm curious as to how your free cash flow might react. And I realize you're not giving 2019 guidance, and that ties into the working capital question, which I know ties in the commodity price changes and all those things. But, again, from a very high level, I'm trying to think about the leverage targets you have in time, and obviously if EBITDA goes down, that, everything being equal, raises leverage, but I'm curious about the free cash flow component.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. Go ahead, Peter.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, I would say that I think our guide is pretty consistent at least on the working capital side. I think that 9% to 10% of incrementals is a fair expectation for us. You hit the nail on the head. There's obviously a lot of noise in there with regard to deflation and the previous question about the work we're doing on working capital, but I think that's still a fair metric to use in your model.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I would just add that in that type of environment...
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, Peter, just to be clear, that would decline, right? Yeah. Go ahead.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. In that type of environment, the cash flow would not be impacted as much as you might think because you do have the offset of working capital less taxes. And if things look like they're slowing down, we may delay some of the CapEx too. And so it's a bit of a silver lining in the business we're in. We do, as business is growing, use up a lot of cash and working capital and investing in things like that. But as things slow, we're able to release some of those items. So the net change in cash flow can be fairly minimal.
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Correct. And then my last question then, and this sort of came up earlier, but if we had a no-inflation scenario that's not impacting your revenues, what kind of organic growth, real growth, does it take to leverage SG&A even just a little bit?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, I think our guide historically has been that we think that there's about a 70% variable component of SG&A. I think that's fairly true. I think that – we're still very confident in the market. We think there's still a lot of opportunity there for us to grow. So we definitely don't see the existing market or the market we're looking at day-in day-out is a cause for concern, a cause for aggressive action to make sure we're getting in front of it. I realize that folks on the Street look at a decline of growth from 9% to mid-single digits as something well-nigh the apocalypse, but it still feels like a pretty healthy market for us. We're still feeling pretty good about our opportunities. So I think that we will continue to deliver along the lines of what we've been talking about over the past few quarters in terms of incrementals on working capital, commodities, SG&A. I think all those things are still holding true.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I don't see the leverage of SG&A as really a step function. I see it more as linear, and every little bit of incremental volume we get helps. And as you know, it also helps the gross margin side of things as well with volume going through our plants. And historically speaking, the busier the builders are getting, the more they're building, the less focused they are on saving a nickel here and there and become much more focused on service. So, in my opinion, every little bit of volume helps.
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks for answering my questions. Good luck.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning and please accept my condolences as well.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: The first question I had, and just going back to great numbers on the manufacturing product side and in terms of the adoption of panelization and things like that, I've always felt like the sticking point there wasn't the homebuilders but actually the framing subs. Can you talk about what types of discussions you're having with them and are some of them finally giving in to panelization and other type of projects because they just can't get the labor anymore?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's accurate. We are seeing more and more interest and more and more discussions with builders who historically have not used it, deciding now is the time to start trying it.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: And then, just wanted to ask also, with the sharp drop in prices over the last couple of months, is this something where there is an inventory problem inside the industry that's working itself out? Or is this more dislocation from people being worried about whether housing starts keep growing. What do you guys think has caused this sharp decline over the last two months?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: To some degree, I almost feel like we're victims of our own actions. I think as prices start to fall, everybody gets a little more cautious on buying. And so, all of a sudden, everybody's gone from, oh, I've got to buy to cover my position because prices are rising, to sitting on the sidelines and waiting to see where things stop falling. And so, in a sense, we all start acting in concert and it ends up – and I think that's part of the problem. And I think at some point folks are going to say this thing's hit bottom and everybody is going to start buying again, and we all know what that's going to mean. It's going to mean prices are going to go up. So I think it's a lesser concern about – I mean there's seasonality involved for sure. But I think it's less a concern of the overall health of housing, as it is just people just trying to guess when the bottom is going to be.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And I think you hit the nail on the head a little bit in terms of the industry-wide inventory levels. I think that that disruption we saw earlier in the year with regard to transport caused people to take safer positions. So, when it turned, there was enough wood on the ground and in the channel that people have been able to do what Chad talked about, which is just kind of wait it out a little bit, see what's happened, and it's corresponded with the seasonal decline in usage. And you sort of layer those things together and, yeah, I think it's structurally something we'll work through, and to Chad's point, it'll find its level pretty quick here.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good. And then the last one I had, the 3% growth you guys registered in single-family sales outpaced the national numbers for the third quarter. Can you talk about – I mean, and then that's something I know you guys typically do on a routine basis, but can you talk about, as we move into 2019 and if starts are flat or a little bit softer than people expect, do you think the value-add products that you have out there and some of the things you're going to be introducing will allow you to keep growing faster than the market?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Certainly, yeah, that's the plan. And I think, as I said earlier, I don't see all of a sudden having to go out of labor to build houses. And so I think that's going to continue to be an issue for the builders, and I think the builders are going to continue to look for ways to more efficiently build homes, build homes more quickly. So, yes, I think the investment we're making in the value-added products will allow us to grow faster than whatever the market is giving us.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Sounds great. Thank you.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens, Incorporated.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and like everyone else has said, I'm really sorry to hear about Morris.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, Trey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: I just have a few kind of last-minute ones here, and thanks for squeezing me in. So, one is, I know you've touched on it a couple of different times on this call and, Peter, I know you just mentioned SG&A. You kind of reiterated that, I think, on the 70% variable component. Does that still hold true if we kind of fast forward into next year and you continue to add to the sales force kind of at the pace that you've done in 2018? It sounds like you're going to continue on with that next year as well. Does that same mix still hold true there?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I don't think there's a material change.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: It's always moving around a little bit, but yeah.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Helpful. And then on the R&R piece being down 2.5% or 2.6%, I'm sorry if I missed it, but can you just talk a little bit about what's going on there, what's driving that? Is that expected to be down in the 4Q as well or just any color around that number?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. As I said in the prepared comments, that's largely in the upper Midwest, the Ag region of the country where the tariff wars that are going on have really started impacting some of the farmers and made them cautious about spending. They're a big part of the business up in that part of the country. And to a lesser degree Alaska, although Alaska is performing a little better than last year, still relative to national numbers that you see in R&R, still underperforming a bit. So it's primarily those two markets for us.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. Sorry I missed that. And then with free cash flow, the target, $170 million to $190 million, expecting to come in at the low-end, I think that's what you guys said last quarter, too. But just wondering what was the driver of coming into the low-end. I understand the earlier part of the year when you had a big working capital draw with the higher lumber, but I would have thought it might be more of a tailwind with the commodity coming down and maybe might catch a little more benefit in the 4Q. Any just commentary around the direction there of going towards the low-end?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I'll be real candid that that type of cash flow forecasting for the year-end is always very challenging. We're looking at the numbers in detail and trying to dial it in. Part of it has to do quite simply with the burn-off of the – or the collection process around the sales and the burn-off of the inventory that we had earlier on in the year. I'm sure you can appreciate the fact that the averages look nice and easy, but down at the location level, it's a bit more challenging to see where's the wood, where are the receivables, and at what pricing, and then how are we burning it off. It's our best estimate. We're clearly going to shoot for more than that, but I think that $170 million is the right number for the guidance. But in light of that, we are still going to be below the 3.5 times levered number. That's a commitment that we are committed to and that we're looking forward to delivering on as sort of the final chapter in the ProBuild acquisition story.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And, Trey, it gives us a little flexibility if we decide to take some inventory position between now and the end of the year as well.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. All right. That's all I had. Thanks a lot. Good luck.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson at Thompson Research Group.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. I've noticed a lot of focus on lumber, but if we could shift focus to more gypsum roofing and insulation products. It'd be helpful to understand what trends you're seeing there, particularly since you've had a few mid-year price increases in some of those categories, which is a little more – mid-year price increases are a little bit more unusual. But give your perspective on trends and what you're seeing in those types of products and if you have any thoughts going into 2019. Thank you.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, for us, it's a very small piece of our business, I would say, from a sales perspective. That's where we do a lot of our commercial and multi-family business, and so that's obviously been down somewhat for us. From a gross margin perspective, been relatively flat year-over-year. I would expect to see a little uptick in the overall business in those categories next year if we do start to see a little bit of a rebound in the multi-family side of things for us.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: And that's on pricing? I was really kind of focusing on just kind of what you're seeing from an inflation standpoint for those categories. Are you saying it's been flattish from a pricing standpoint for you?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Oh, no. Sorry. That was from a gross margin standpoint. So what price increases we have gotten, we've done a good job of getting those passed on.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. And just really focusing, once again circling back on the value-added manufactured products. And as you continue to develop this more and build momentum in that business, what types of customers – and really, kind of want to get a better sense of regions and types of projects you're seeing greater acceptance. And where do you think that business can be, not just next year, but two to three years from now as a percentage of your total sales?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, we see acceptance across all our single-family homebuilder categories, and certainly the multi-family side are big users. So those products aren't limited to national builders or custom builders. There's pretty good acceptance across all categories. As far as regions go, historically, components have been readily accepted in the Northeast, in the Northwest, a little less so in the South where you've traditionally had more labor availability, but that's changed. Those dynamics are changing. And so we're certainly seeing more acceptance in the Southern part of the country than we've had in the past. From a mix standpoint, gosh, we're going to continue to push. And anything we can do to drive down the pure commodity distribution business and expand the value-add side of the business, I think, gosh, we said it as a percent of sales that we can move that mix 1% to 2% a year that would be pretty successful in my mind.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: One of the challenges we've had on that point is that with the growth in commodities, it's sort of been hiding the fact that we have been growing our manufactured products quite well. But that will prove itself out over time.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Do you have happen to have handy or off top of your head, when you look at the regions like the Southeast, which admittedly has been slower in acceptance, what that is as a percentage of your Southeastern sales, say, three to four years ago where it is today or is there maybe even a growth rate associated with that region, just to give a perspective on growth?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Not handy. No. We can try and look forward to having some of that information in the future, but that's not something we've done in the past.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.
Kurt Yinger - D.A. Davidson Companies: Yeah. Good morning, everyone. And I know it's late, so I'll just stick with one. I'm wondering if you could talk about how you think about geographies to add new manufactured components capacity in 2019 and going forward, and if there's any one or two geographies that are particularly compelling at this point.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, it's largely the Western part of the country where we feel like we're under-represented in our footprint. I'd rather not disclose which particular markets we're talking about this for competitive reasons. But I would say a lot of it's largely the legacy ProBuild footprint where those products were under-represented.
Kurt Yinger - D.A. Davidson Companies: Great. Thank you very much.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So the one point I want to clarify to Alex's question earlier about the days, he asked the question and I was agreeing that we have a difference in days, but I've been pointed out that we think he might have said less days. It's actually more days in the fourth quarter. In 2018, we lost a day of sales in Q1, and we'll gain a day in Q4, full-year flat. So, just a clarifying point.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Peter. We appreciate everyone joining our call today. Look forward to updating you on the progress of our initiatives in the quarters ahead. And if you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Binit or Peter. Thank you.
Operator: At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Crow, I will turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah, we're done. We made our remarks. Thank you. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.

M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Jen, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I will start with a brief update on our second quarter performance as well as an update on our progress against strategic growth initiatives. Then, I will turn the call over to Peter, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After our closing comments regarding our outlook, we will be happy to take your questions. Let's start on page 4. I'm very pleased with our performance in the quarter as we continue to deliver profitable growth initiatives while successfully managing through challenges, including commodity price volatility. Our results highlight our team's ongoing focus on cost discipline and flexible response to changing market factors as well as strategic growth in value-added products and capturing share through strong customer relationship management. Our sales for the quarter of $2.1 billion grew a solid 13.4% over 2017. Approximately 8.8% of this year-over-year growth was achieved by successfully passing on commodity price inflation and approximately 4.6% from increased sales volume, including 6% in the single family homebuilding end market. Turning to slide 5. Commodity prices showed large fluctuations in the quarter, rising sharply most of the quarter before retreating in recent weeks. Framing lumber and sheet good prices ended the quarter up 26% and 27%, respectively, over prices at the beginning of the year. As we manage through this period of commodity inflation, our short-term pricing agreements caused gross profit margin compression. Our team reacted quickly and, again, showed the ability to respond to these challenges and mitigated the impact on EBITDA margin through cost leverage and disciplined cost management. The result was a substantial year-over-year improvement in total EBITDA dollars, while maintaining our EBITDA margin percentage and setting the stage for margin expansion as commodity prices ease. Our increased investments in manufacturing capacity also continued to pay off with 19% growth in manufactured products, leading to double-digit growth in our overall value-added products in the second quarter, considerably faster than the overall growth of the residential housing market. We will continue to invest in our growth initiatives. As the results show in the second quarter, these platforms provide us significant ongoing opportunities to increase both our overall market share and penetration of our higher margin products. We also remain committed to our initiatives focusing on developing our sales force and management pipeline and have invested over the last several years in adding to our exceptional talent. We believe these initiatives are positioning our business for future accelerated growth. We continue to execute on our strategic plan to expand our manufacturing and value-added capacity this year, including 3 new truss plants, 10 new lines in existing plants, 1 new millwork facility and capacity additions to many more. We'll continue to invest in these higher margin products in order to grow them faster than the overall housing market by adding further to our existing network of 57 manufacturing facilities strategically located across the country. With the continuing labor challenges being faced by our customers, demand for our labor-saving products should continue to rise, providing us incremental opportunities. Moving on to page 6 with an overview of the housing market. The outlook for new residential housing demand and activity remains very bright. The U.S. homebuilding industry has now reached approximately 1.25 million annual starts with approximately 880,000 of those being single family starts. This remains approximately 20% below the long-term historic average and is just now reaching the levels that we have seen in previous recessionary troughs. Demographic trends, market demand, employment and other underlying economic conditions remain very supportive. Homeownership rates have recently started to show improvement with household formation among young buyers trending higher but remained below pre-crisis levels. We continue to anticipate mid- to high-single digit growth in the single family homebuilding market this year with ongoing growth in the years ahead. Moving to page 7. We are on track in executing our plans to accelerate growth, further expand profitability and create meaningful incremental shareholder value. We will continue to develop our sales force and invest in our manufacturing and value-add facility expansion initiatives. These growth platforms provide us significant ongoing opportunities to increase our market share and increase the penetration of our higher-margin products. Beyond our expectations that the market will return to historical average housing starts over the next several years, we have growth and operational excellence initiatives underway geared to generate an additional $100 million of profitability, independent of market growth. We have set challenging but achievable targets based on the strengths of our core business along with our operational excellence initiatives and strategic growth investments. The plan is to double 2016 EBITDA of approximately $380 million and to generate over $1 billion in free cash flow after capital investments and deliver an EPS between $3 and $3.50 as housing starts reach historical averages. Our strategic plan balances cash generation, high return reinvestment opportunities and profitable growth and ongoing debt reduction to achieve our leverage target of 2.5 to 3.5 times EBITDA. Turning to slide 8. I would like to provide a bit more detail on our specific growth initiatives. Leveraging our existing core business strengths, including our national footprint, unmatched scale and manufacturing capability and best-in-class sales force, we are confident that our plans enable us to capitalize on growth in the residential housing market to generate an incremental $250 million to $280 million in EBITDA. We call this core growth. In addition to this core growth, we continue to expand our national manufacturing footprint and capabilities to keep growing our higher-margin value-added products faster than the overall market over the next several years. Our plans call for investing in 17 new truss and 8 millwork indoor facilities over the next 4 years, including the 4 facilities underway this year, expanding our national footprint to serve a number of locations that do not currently have adequate access to these higher-margin products and where we see great opportunities to serve market needs with our customers. Our strategic plan further includes a set of operational excellence efficiency initiatives across our organization, including distribution and logistics, pricing and margin optimization, back-office efficiencies and system enhancements that are expected to contribute between $65 million and $75 million in incremental annual EBITDA. We have made good progress implementing these initiatives and are focused on creating substantial, strategic and economic value for the organization through efficiencies and customer service advancements. These projects when leveraged across our 400 locations should offer a significant profit margin expansion opportunities and further differentiate our service and connectivity with our customers, providing economic and strategic value that is unrivaled by our smaller competitors. We are starting to see benefits from our initiatives that give us confidence that these projects should generate the anticipated value creation. I will now turn the call over to Peter, who will review our financial results in more detail.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. As a reminder, we have included adjusted figures to normalize for one-time integration and other costs. We reported net sales of $2.1 billion, a 13.4% increase compared to the second quarter of 2017, including an estimated 8.8% benefit from commodity price inflation and a 4.6% from organic volume growth. Our underlying sales volume grew approximately 6% in the single family new construction end-market. And as Chad highlighted, our value-added products increased 11.1%, led by a solid 18.7% growth in manufactured products. Gross margin of $496.3 million in the second quarter of 2018 increased by $35.5 million or 7.7% over the second quarter of 2017. Our gross margin percentage was 23.7%, down 130 basis points from 25% in the second quarter of 2017. The margin percentage decrease on a year-over-year basis was attributable to sharp increases in commodity prices. Framing lumber and sheet goods prices increased 26% and 27%, respectively, from year-end 2017 to the end of the second quarter. As we have discussed in prior calls, commodity inflation causes short-term gross margin percentage compression when prices are rising and margin percentage expansion when prices are falling due to the short-term pricing commitments we provide customers versus the volatility of the commodity markets. Additionally, higher prices in commodity products had a negative mix impact on gross margin percent. I am pleased with our team's ability to mitigate the impact through continued cost discipline and strong growth in high-margin products. Furthermore, in the quarter, through the combination of our team's execution and ability to pass on higher commodity product prices on a year-over-year basis, we are reaping the benefits of EBITDA dollars versus 2017. As we near the end of the quarter, commodity prices started to ease, albeit at a high level. As this trend in lumber price continues, we should further benefit with enhanced profitability and a return to more normalized gross margin percentage in the coming quarters. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased by 130 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This reduction was driven by operating leverage and ongoing cost management. Interest expense for the quarter was $29 million compared to $33.7 million in 2017. The reduction was largely the result of transactions the company executed in 2017 to lower our go-forward cash interest expense and further strengthen our capital structure, slightly offset by a rising interest rate environment. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $62.6 million or $0.54 per diluted share compared to $43 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase of $19.6 million or 45.6% was primarily driven by robust sales growth and ongoing cost management. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew $15.1 million or 12.2% to $139.1 million. The year-over-year improvement was largely driven by strong sales growth, operating leverage and disciplined cost management, which fully offset the impact of commodity inflation on gross margin. Additionally, we realized the positive benefits in EBITDA dollars from our team's ability to pass on higher lumber prices on a year-over-year basis. We expect this benefit to expand as commodity prices normalize. Switching now to the year-to-date financial highlights. Please turn to slide 11. The company achieved strong results year-to-date in 2018, including 12.3% sales growth, 10.8% EBITDA growth, a $0.29 improvement in adjusted earnings per share and a 0.3 times reduction in leverage even after funding our strategic growth and capital investment. I'm very pleased to report that value-added sales per day grew at a healthy 10.5% year-to-date. Turning to page 12. We expect our free cash flow generation to be utilized to fund our balanced investments in strategic initiatives and continuing debt reduction. We believe this will be supported by EBITDA growth and our continuing focus on working capital efficiency, which is estimated to run approximately 10% of incremental sales. We expect to continue to invest in our business through capital expenditures at approximately 1.5% of sales. We expect our current NOL tax assets to shelter us from paying all but approximately $15 million to $20 million in cash taxes in 2018. As a result of the capital markets transactions we executed in 2017, our cash interest should be reduced to approximately $100 million in 2018. We expect one-time costs of $15 million to $20 million as we continue our systems integration work. And in total, we expect to generate $170 million to $190 million target range in net free cash flow after investing activities for the full year 2018, albeit likely at the lower end of the range given the headwind we have experienced from still elevated lumber prices in our inventory. We expect to utilize cash generation to pay down debt and fund our strategic growth investments, and we remain confident reducing our leverage ratio to below 3.5 times by yearend, achieving a major target set in 2015 with the ProBuild acquisition. Due to the seasonal pattern of working capital needs, we typically use cash in the first half of the year and generate cash in the second half of the year. Cash used in operations and investing year-to-date was $217.8 million, including $48.9 million of capital investments. This was in line with our expectations and with our annual guidance. We continue reducing our leverage ratio despite the impact of commodity price inflation on inventory. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a trailing 12 months basis as of June 30, 2018 was 4.5 times representing a 0.3 times reduction from the second quarter of 2017. Total liquidity at March 31, 2018 was ample at $298 million, consisting of net borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand which is more than sufficient for our operating needs. As we look forward with confidence in our team's execution and the housing market environment, I would like to provide color on how we are seeing the third quarter of 2018 as well as reconfirming how we are thinking about full year 2018. For full year 2018, we still expect single family starts to grow in the mid- to high-single digit range, R&R market volume growth of approximately 3% and declines in the multi-family end market. We anticipate 6 to 8 percentage points of top line sales growth from commodity inflation on a year-over-year basis. From a gross margin perspective, the recent relief in the rise of lumber and panel prices has started to benefit our gross margin percentage. And as we move through the remainder of the year, we expect to move closer to a more normalized gross margin in the 25% range. Commodity inflation driven gross margin compression during the balance of 2018 should not be nearly as impactful in the second half, allowing us to return to a more normalized incremental EBITDA conversion of 12% to 15% in the second half of 2018. We will continue our growth investments, including initial costs in our operational excellence initiatives. All of which combined, we expect to total $10 million to $12 million in incremental costs in 2018. Overall, we expect 15% to 20% year-over-year EBITDA growth for the full year in 2018 and current estimates still indicate that we will finish out at the upper end of that range. We expect the impact of the 2017 tax act to result in an effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the balance of 2018. For the third quarter specifically, we expect sales to be in the 10% to 15% over prior-year range with 5% to 9% coming from commodity inflation. Gross margin is expected to be up sequentially from Q2 by 40 to 50 basis points as we start to see the relief on short-term margin pressure from the recent commodity price moves. We will maintain our focus on cost discipline, efficiency improvements and leverage reduction while investing in our growth initiatives. We expect the EBITDA growth to be between 20% and 30% over Q3 2017. Before I turn the call back over to Chad for his closing comments, I would like to thank Jen Pasquino for all of her contributions to Builders FirstSource since joining us in 2011. Most of you know, she has decided to retire and this will be her last earnings call as our Investor Relations Officer. She will be transitioning responsibilities to Binit Sanghvi through the end of August. We wish Jen all the best in her future endeavors. And with that, I'll turn it back to Chad.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Peter. As demonstrated by our solid second quarter results, our team continues to execute on plans and deliver value to our customers at an exceptionally high level. I am impressed with their execution in building an even stronger Builders FirstSource. I continue to look forward to capturing the substantial growth and value-creating opportunities that we have laid out and to further setting the groundwork for our future. We continue to execute a clear strategy, and I believe that we have never been better positioned to generate increasing returns for our shareholders and value for our customers by leveraging our national footprint, strong customer relationships, end market diversity and operational excellence initiatives. I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work and, once again, delivering such strong results as we build an even brighter future together. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Matt Bouley with Barclays.
Unknown Speaker: (00:21:42) on for Matt. Thanks for taking the questions.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Unknown Speaker: I wanted to start on your manufactured products growth. Was there any benefit in the quarter from the timing of your capacity expansion? And I guess, more specifically on that, where do those projects stand that you have outlined for this year?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So, I wouldn't say that there's a significant change due to the facilities – the four facilities that were opening up this year. Generally, the ramp-ups are pretty smooth. They're elongated over the first year. There's always a little bit of a headwind associated with the inefficiencies when you do that. So, that's part of what we called out in the investments in our strategic initiatives. But the benefit you're seeing this year was primarily from the facilities we opened last year.
Unknown Speaker: And then, was there any sort of – presumably there's some pricing in there, is there any comment that you can give about the level of pricing benefit in that growth percentage?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. There's around 4% or 5% benefit from inflation in there.
Unknown Speaker: Thanks.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So, still very, very strong volume growth.
Unknown Speaker: And maybe switching to gears to obviously a more minor segment, the roofing, gypsum and insulation. Presumably, there's some price in there, a couple quarters of sales declines sequentially here. Have those categories just seen an inflection in the competitive landscape? Or how should we think about those specific categories going forward?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, a couple of things. Yes, I would say you're right. The competitive landscape is changing and we're certainly not considered one of the major players in those categories. And so, from a competitive positioning, that has gotten a little tougher. I will also say that a lot of our business that we do, especially in gypsum, is multi-family and commercial. And then, we've obviously seen a tail-off in that business.
Unknown Speaker: Thank you. That's helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Yeah. This is Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. So, I wanted to ask about the gross margin outlook. Lumber prices were peaking by some of the indices in kind of mid-2Q or so, and then declining after that. So, obviously, it's going to help your margins. Would we expect to see a little more though than just I think you said 40 bps to 50 bps in gross margins? Wouldn't that trajectory – I guess, it depends on what you're assuming kind of going forward. But wouldn't that get us pretty much back to normalized with that kind of peaking in mid-2Q based on the kind of 60 to 90 days you're normally pricing out those contracts?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, Nishu, I would say that the price has peaked at the beginning in June. And so, we had maybe two to three weeks of prices falling in the back half of the second quarter. And so really obviously no benefit in the second quarter. And given the transportation issues that we were all experiencing before prices started falling, we had a six, seven-week backlog of orders coming in, which were at the higher prices. And so what we saw in July was the tail on our – on order products still coming in. We obviously weren't buying much additional inventory because prices were falling so fast. You typically don't like to be buying when prices are falling that rapidly. You'd rather wait till you hit a bottom. And so our average cost on hand was slow to change. Combine that with the 30-day tail we have on most of our pricing. And so most of July was spent finishing out projects that were priced in the second quarter. And so the net result of all that is we saw minor margin improvement in July. But in the last couple of weeks, we've started to see a marked improvement invoiced margins up 50, 60 basis points. But remember that – after July, it was relatively flat with the second quarter. So a little bit of lag there. I hope that helps explain some of it. But certainly like the trends we're seeing now, and we expect those trends to continue and even accelerate.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it, got it. No, that makes a lot of sense. And this extreme volatility – so obviously, it has made it more difficult from your folks' perspective. What about the behavior on the customer perspective? When prices are so volatile, obviously, it makes inventory management a little more complex as you mentioned. Do builders change the timing of their purchases as well? Or is that – not purchase. I meant obviously, the amount of timing the contracts and the price locks or does it really just entirely dependent upon the construction cycles?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: It's hard for them to move houses back and forth that easily, and time is money for them and they want houses completed and done. You do get a few customers and we've seen it who have asked for us to reset our price agreements because prices were falling. And the short answer was no. We took it in the shorts the last year on the way up and we committed – we stayed committed to our contracts, and we expect our business partners to do the same. And so the answer was no to that. And something else I'll mention on the commodity prices, prices have fallen a lot in recent weeks but they're just now getting back to where they were at the beginning of the year. And so it's easy to lose sight of how high a point they started to fall from. Prices are still at a healthy level even though they've fallen as much as they have. In fact, they could fall, gosh, another $100 or $1,000 and we would just then be getting back to a historical average price for both framing lumber and OSB. And so we feel like prices will start to bottom out in the next couple of weeks. There's a lot of folks that have been on the sidelines not buying. Inventory positions are getting low, and folks are going to have to start buying again. So it feels like we're going to find a floor here in the next couple of weeks.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And just following up on the earlier question about the strength in the manufactured products, what do we – obviously, very encouraging to see that strength and obviously that's the higher value-add, higher margins part of the business. So to what extent is that sustainable? Obviously, you've laid out the 10% to 15% sales growth for the year. And yeah, so just wanted to kind of understand the sustainability of that.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I'm fairly confident it will sustain itself. We're really happy with what we're seeing and hearing from the demand side. I know there's been a few negative headlines on housing recently on prices – our home prices getting expensive and interest rates creeping up. But in my opinion, the tailwind still outweigh the headwinds. And we're liking what we see from a demand standpoint, and I think that's going to feed right into those value-add products.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Great. That's it for me. And thanks – and, yeah, congrats to Jen.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, Nishu.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Morrish with Evercore.
Trey Morrish - Evercore Group LLC: Thanks, guys, for taking some time to answer my questions. So first, I want to talk on the SG&A side. Clearly, you saw a good amount of leverage year over year. And part of that was likely due to just better top-line revenue from the commodity inflation. But could you talk about what types of internal initiatives you're doing and pushing to tighten the belt to really drive down some of those costs?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, I'll touch on one that's near and dear to my heart, and that's our delivery optimization efforts. We've targeted – of that $65 million to $75 million of annual savings, one-third of that is delivery optimization. And to-date, we've rolled out our new delivery dispatch management system to about 100 of our locations and then expect to have that rolled out to 140 by yearend. And we're starting to see a gap now between the markets that are on the system and have been on it a while and have adopted it versus those that aren't on it yet. We're seeing driver on road percentage go up. We're seeing engine idle times decrease. And basically, what you want to see an overall increase in your fleet efficiency. And so although diesel has gone up this year and driver wages continue to go up, these are starting to look like they're taking some – taking hold and really helping us offset some of these increases. And so I think that's part of what you're seeing. We're going to implement a driver incentive program in Q4 to further motivate our drivers to begin managing their day by these metrics. We've got a lot of really great information in the hands of our operators when it comes to delivery optimization and we're starting to see that take hold. So, that's just one area. Obviously, a lot of these initiatives, back-office efficiencies, things like that, some of them are really hard to measure from a hard dollar perspective. If we're turning our trucks a little quicker in the yards, if our drivers are on the road a little more during the day, there's obviously savings there, there's efficiencies there. Hard to put an exact number on these things. But the overall goal is to see your SG&A as a percentage of sales drop. And so, I think that's certainly part of what you're seeing.
Trey Morrish - Evercore Group LLC: Got it. Thanks for that. And then, turning back to gross margins. You talked about some modest new improvement sequentially. It sounds like you're still working through some of that higher cost of lumber and you expect when they – when lumber falls or when it ultimately finds the bottom, you think – it sounds like you'll jump in and buy a lot more because you'll see some sense of stabilization. But assuming that lumber remains firm kind of from here, at what point do you think you will ultimately see your gross margins return to that 25% number?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: We generally talk about it, and I know you've heard us in light of the amount of inventory we have on hand and then the time lines around when we reset our pricing with our customers. So, we generally say, it's about a quarter or quarter and a half from the time the turn happens whether it'd be up or down. The things would level out kind of that three to four-month range.
Trey Morrish - Evercore Group LLC: Okay.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So, fourth quarter for us.
Trey Morrish - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Appreciate it.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. As we look out to the remainder of the year, given what you've said on the previous questions on inventory, we would see, all other things being equal, a step-up in gross margin in the fourth quarter from the third quarter. Would that be correct as the lumber flows through the income statement?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. And as long as we stipulate that commodity prices sort of stay where they're at now, that's a reasonable assumption.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I've made a million assumptions in there, but I'm just trying to isolate the...
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah, agreed.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Second question, on the – on SG&A, a lot of leverage here in the quarter. Is that something – and I'm going to – or I guess it's kind of actually a lumber question. Will we continue to see this kind of leverage going into the second half or will that sort of slow up to one degree or the other?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. That will moderate. I mean, if you think about the impact of commodities on the business, to the extent that moderates, that will back off a bit. Q3 is probably in a favorable position still, but if – as we talk about Q4, that would be one of the offset.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And you referred in the prepared statement about 17 new truss facilities, including 4 for this year. How long does it take for one of those to get up to full capacity where we – or just a rate where we – very additive (34:21) to the margins of the company?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: You're usually looking about right on a breakeven after about one year and then, obviously, in years two to three being profitable and it's usually about overall three-year payback on those things.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. As you look at that, it's about four years, is that going to be the pacing we'll see?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yes, sounds about right.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, how about the mill work? How quickly will those come on?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Those are quicker. I would say – yeah, within a year, you're probably up and running and maybe slightly shorter payback, a little less expensive equipment. And not only are we opening some new facilities, but also upgrading some of the equipment in some of our plants too. And obviously, that's an immediate benefit when you're just replacing older equipment with more efficient equipment.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and nice results in what's obviously been a challenging lumber environment. A couple of questions just following up on some of the manufactured products questions. The first one is, I was hoping you could break down – so, it sounds like there's mid-teens volume growth in the quarter. Can you give us a sense of how much of that was same customer growth versus expanding your customer base there?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I'm not sure I understand it. Could you repeat the question?
Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC: So, how much of the growth in volume from manufactured products was coming from effectively your same customers buying more of that – of those products this year or further penetrating and expanding your customer base into new – like, new relationships?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I'm not sure I have that information. Do you have...
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I don't have that – I would say my gut would say it's probably – by far, the lion's share is growth through additional customers. Maybe 90% of the growth was through the same customers and the remainder on acquiring new customers.
Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Okay. Second question on that is just around the margin profile. I know you don't want to get into specifics around margin – product categories. But could you give us any sense of at least directionally what the margin has looked like for manufactured products? Are you seeing the type of margin pressure that you've experienced in lumber just due to the pricing volatility there? Or has there been a stronger year-on-year trend in manufactured product margins?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I would say the margin trend on manufactured has been somewhat flat because there is some pressure on price due to lumber inflation. But also the incremental volumes and running these plants more efficiently has helped to offset that. So, I would say it's been relatively flat on a margin basis.
Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Thank you. And, Jen, we'll miss you. Enjoy retirement.
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Baugh with Stifel.
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. And likewise, Jen, enjoy your future. I did have a quick question. The gross margin in the press release commentary says that the decrease was largely due to the commodity price. What other factors were in there, if any? And you did just touch on the manufacturing margin being relative really flat. I guess I'm curious – and this is a longer-term question not a Q3 question. Should we see the gross margin outside of inflation dissipating improve? If so, kind of, what should be the expectation and why and when?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So, I think we hit on a couple of those. Clearly, we saw a decline – the bulk of the decline that we talked about attributable to commodities. There's also the mix component, again, through this quarter. So, that gets us to over 100 bps of the 130 bps. There's maybe a little bit in there on the gypsum piece. We've kind – I've kind of talked about that in a couple of discussions that the dynamics in that marketplace with regard to pricing and price increases has been a challenge for us. We definitely see, as you alluded to, an increasing gross margin level. There's the increase in EBITDA dollars on a year-over-year basis, which is great. But also, as the normalization in the commodity prices are seen, we see a leveling out or more of a return to normal for us; A, getting rid of the headwind; and, B, catching up on pricing. That's definitely a trend that we're seeing as we're getting into Q3 and one that we expect to see for the rest of the year.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And I'll just jump in because I love talking about these initiatives. But some of the pricing initiatives we have going, I'm excited about some early results we're seeing. We are piloting a new pricing tool in two markets this month. And once we get the kinks worked out of that, we plan on rolling that out to additional markets. We've got a special quarter margin initiative, so special order meaning items that we don't typically carry in stock, but with special order for customers. We've got an initiative we just started that in July. And in the first month, we saw a 25 basis point improvement in special order margin. I expect more to come on that. And then, our new BI platform that we're rolling out is giving us a lot better information around net profitability by customer and allows us to do some customer stratification. And so, it really helps the guys have some information at their fingertips to look at what are we really making off our customers. It's easier to say, hey, I'm selling this guy a 24% margin. That's a good margin. But are they paying by credit card or are we having to run additional hotshots out there? And so, we're getting reporting in place now where we can look at all the pieces of profitability, basically down to EBIT or EBITDA per customer and makes some more educated pricing decisions. And so, a lot of things like that are underway. Again, rolling these things out to 400 locations and adoption is always a challenge but – so we're still in the early stages, but really liking some of the early results so far.
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful color. Thank you. And then, Chad, you sound fairly bullish about – I don't know the near and intermediate term outlook for housing in general. I guess, trying to look for potential issues, are you hearing or seeing anything from the people you talk with that you're concerned about? Certainly, we seem to be under building relative to household formation, but we have this dynamic with inflating cost of building a home. And I'm just kind of curious. We could have a two-hour discussion I'm sure on the building outlook. But the puts and takes, anything you're seeing on the horizon maybe that's concerning or cautious, I know you see us getting back to a normal build level.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: The one thing I think could slow the rate of growth, I don't think it would be enough to send us backwards, would be the cost of homes, especially the higher-end homes. I think there are some markets now where it's getting pretty pricey and I think some folks may step aside and wait for prices to come down. I think if that happens, then prices will come down. Builders will have to adjust. I think there's still demand there. I think we're going to see an increase in demand in the entry level homes. But if there's any, I guess – if you would say, if there's any headwind at all that I think might have some teeth to it, it would be the upper-end homes and how pricey some of those are getting. But again, does that mean we go from a 8% growth in single family to a 4% or 5% for a period of time or, heck, even if we had a year where we flattened out, not the end of the world, that's still a very healthy environment for us, and we can still perform very well and generate a lot of cash even in that environment. So yeah, I am bullish about it.
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. And then, lastly, any – you kind of know how you skew geographically to the national housing start numbers we talk about. Any color there on your 6% single family – I guess, (00:44:11) single family piece?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So this quarter we didn't see anything specific in the geographic mix. We do see a strong trend with regard to the starter homes. We think that's a really positive part of the growth in the market right now in terms of that next leg of the stool if you will in the expansion to get us back to a more normalized build rate. So we think that's a component and what we're seeing in the discrepancy between the starts number and our number, we certainly in the markets we plan don't see share loss.
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, and good luck.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So the only thing – sorry, go ahead and finish.
Operator: You can go ahead, sir.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So the only thing I wanted to add and it was sort of a follow-up to the gross margin question was with regard to some of the impacts that we see. There was a component when I mentioned gypsum that I wanted to add to it I guess is the idea that we definitely see an exposure in the multi-family and the commercial sales, and that is a piece of it. But there's also the rule of thumb on the expansion of our facilities. So continuing to see declines in multi-family, but the other component was the rule of thumb on the new trust plant creation because there was some question about how that started up and where we were going to see the benefits. The cost in those facilities are about $5 million to $7 million on the facility, assumed leasing the land and the building and then revenues really in that $15 million to $20 million range on an annual basis. EBITDA, $2.5 million. We generally would see breakeven in about a year with payback in that two to three-year range. So with an IRR of around 20%, definitely excited about the opportunities to open up those new truss plants. Always have to cross the hurdle on expansions, on the timing and the building requirements as well as making sure we select the right locations. So it looks like we have a couple more questions, operator?
Operator: Yes, sir. And our next question comes from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks, everyone. Jen, congratulations. I'm sure you've got lots of fun stuff planned for retirement. I just wanted to double-check. What are you guys expecting for fiscal 2018 total revenue growth, including the commodity portion of it?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So, it's a Q3 question?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Full year.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Full year?
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Yeah.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So sales growth for the full year, we haven't laid out – we have laid out the commodity impact, though, about 6% to 8%.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: I was just wondering because the – from 1Q to 2Q, the CapEx percentage went down to 1.5% from 1.7%, and I didn't know if that was a shift in some spending or what was going on there.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So yes, we had some timing on a couple of projects. Nothing fundamentally changed in our investment strategy. We are certainly seeing (00:48:06) to the plant build discussion. The hurdles on building some of these facilities is extending the time line on them.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: And then, Chad, I know you discussed lumber prices earlier, and that's something I really wanted to touch on because we've seen OSB prices. The weekly numbers have turned negative in the last couple weeks. Framing lumber seems to be holding up a little bit better. Does this guidance that you guys have laid out there assume that maybe we see a couple more weeks of declines and then things turn? Or how are you thinking about it? And as part of that also, what should we think about the relative impact of OSB on you guys versus framing lumber?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. The guidance we laid out assumes that the price has bottomed out here in the next couple of weeks and kind of stabilized within a reasonable range. Framing lumber is the largest component of our commodity category. The one largest SKU is 7/16-inch OSB, which I think – and I could be off a little here – I think is about 5% of that category. But the framing lumber composite, it drives the majority of that category.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: All right. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Hey, Trey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: And yeah, I just want to start off by congratulating Jen as well, and good luck with your retirement. We'll miss you.
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, Trey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: So, one was just on the rollout. I think – the 17 plants that you highlighted. Is there a geographic – I mean, I know, Peter, you mentioned you're making sure that you hit the right markets with those and that sort of thing. But we're looking out over a three or four-year period as you roll these out, understanding these aren't three or four-year investments but longer term. Is there a geographic focus that you guys have in mind with those that you could talk about?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, it's – generically, Trey, it's out west largely. I mean, we've got a pretty concentrated footprint in the eastern part of the country. The holes in our geography are more western part of the country.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And so I understand that right on the 2017 that's truss and millwork combined? Or is there – was it mostly truss plants?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: The new facilities is mostly truss plants. The expansion is blended between the truss and the door facilities – door and milling facilities.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thanks for clearing that up. And then, Peter, you mentioned the – you kind of reiterated the free cash flow guidance range for the year, but says that it may come in at the low end. Can you help bridge that for us? Where it would – if it could shake out low end versus where it would have maybe midpoint or higher end of the range?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, what we're struggling with at this point – and you can imagine, right? The purchase price has changed quite a bit for the lumber and building materials. So, to-date, we've seen a pretty substantial headwind from that inflation on our inventory and, to some degree, in our AR. So, as we look at that sort of receding as it has, we start to get a sense of normalizing kind of that bottom end of the range. It's – the adjusted EBITDA, we sort of laid out integrated (00:52:06) some expenses in that $15 million to $20 million range, working capital in that. Right now, we think it's about 10% of sales on the incremental sales. Cash interest in the $95 million to $100 million cash taxes in the $15 million to $20 million. Capital expenditures like as we mentioned came down a little. So you're kind of not that 1.5% range. That gets you to the lower end depending on where we ended up – we end up with the year-end EBITDA and the year-end working capital as a kind of true variables here from this point to the end of the year.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Right. And just so we're clear longer term. Kind of taking some of these fluctuations out, is it still kind of 9% or 10% of the working capital piece? Is that kind of what we should be looking for?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. In that core piece, yeah, that 9% to 10% is still – we feel pretty good about that barring the kind of the lumpy fluctuations, correct.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: All right. Well, thanks for...
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: (00:53:10) about the cash at the end of the day.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Well, thanks for putting me in, and good luck. Thank you.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I just wanted to follow up on the previous question from Jay. Just a little more clarification. Of our commodity product category, 70% of that is framing lumber driven and 30% is panels. And of that panel portion, 7/16-inch OSB is the largest piece of that. I think it's about 6% of that panel's category. So, I just want to clarify that.
Operator: At this time, there appears to be no further questions. Mr. Crow, I will turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, thank you once again for joining our call today. We look forward to updating you on the progress of our initiatives in the quarters ahead. And if you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Jen, Binit or Peter. Thank you.

M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Jen. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I will start with a brief update on our first quarter performance as well as an update on our longer-term strategic growth initiatives. Then, I will turn the call over to Peter, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After our closing comments regarding our outlook, we will be happy to take your questions. I'll begin on slide 4. I continue to be impressed by the execution of our associates capturing the benefits of a growing market in a rising price environment, successfully managing through challenges, including commodity price inflation and weather and continuing to focus on improving profitability through cost discipline and strategic growth in value-added products. Our sales for the quarter of $1.7 billion represent a healthy increase in sales per day of 12.7% over 2018 (sic) [2017] (3:08). This growth was benefited by commodity price inflation of approximately 9.6%. Sales volume per day grew approximately 3.8% in the single family homebuilding end market and approximately 2.8% in the repair and remodeling and other end market. Turning to slide 5, we continued to see rapidly rising commodity prices. Framing lumber and sheet good prices increased 13% and 24%, respectively in the first quarter alone. As we managed through this period of commodity inflation, our short-term pricing agreements caused gross profit margin compression. However, I'm again very pleased with our organization's response in this to the challenge and ability to mitigate the impact on EBITDA margin through disciplined cost management. In the quarter, we have also begun to realize the positive year-over-year benefit of higher lumber and sheet good prices on our total gross profit and EBITDA dollars. Our increased investments in manufacturing capacity also continue to pay off with 11% sales per day growth in manufactured products and 9% growth in windows, doors and millwork in the first quarter faster than the overall growth of the residential housing market. Consistent with our long-term strategic plans we have previously shared with you, we are continuing our expansion of manufacturing and value-added capacity this year, including three new truss plants, nine new lines in existing plants, one new millwork facility and capacity additions to many more. We are committed to grow these higher margin products faster than the overall housing market, capitalizing on the opportunity to serve fundamental customer needs by adding to our network of 57 manufacturing facilities strategically located across the country. With the continuing labor challenges being faced by our customers, demand for these labor-saving products should continue to rise as homebuilders look for ways to build homes more efficiently. Moving on to slide 6, with an overview of the macro housing market, the outlook for new residential housing demand and activity remains very bright. The U.S. homebuilding industry has now reached 1.2 million annual starts with approximately 860,000 of those being single family starts. This remains approximately 20% below the long-term historic average and is just now reaching levels we have seen in previous recessionary troughs. Demographic trends, market demand, activity levels and underlying economic conditions remain very supportive. We are anticipating mid to high single-digit growth in the single family homebuilding end market this year, a solid environment to continue executing our strategic plans with multiple years of expected growth ahead of us. Turning to slide 7, our 2018 priorities dovetail into our longer-term strategic growth initiatives. We will continue to invest in our sales force and our manufacturing facility expansion initiatives. These growth platforms provide us significant ongoing opportunities to increase our market share and increase the penetration of our higher margin products. They are delivering results and we expect these ongoing high return investments to continue over the years ahead. Our scale enables us to easily absorb the initial cost of these additions, while positioning our business for accelerated growth. We've also made good progress implementing our operational excellence initiatives, which are focused on creating substantial, strategic and economic value for the organization through efficiencies and customer service advancements. Our continuing focus on cash generation also remains a priority, allowing us to invest in these strategic growth and value creation initiatives, while continuing to deleverage our balance sheet. We expect to generate $170 million to $190 million of net free cash flow in 2018 after funding over $120 million of capital investments and expect to reduce our leverage ratio to 3.5 times or lower by year end. Finally, we are committed to continuing to attract, train and retain the best people in the industry and to developing our future leaders throughout the organization. We have increased our college recruiting and sales and management development programs to grow our own talent and leaders for the future. Moving to slide 8, we are on track in executing our plans to accelerate growth, further expand profitability and create meaningful shareholder value. Believing the housing market will return to historical building levels over the next several years, the strength of our core business along with our operational excellence initiatives and strategic growth investments should enable us to double 2016 EBITDA, which is our baseline year and to generate over $1 billion in free cash flow after capital investments and deliver an EPS between $3 and $3.50 within the next four to five years. We're well-positioned to continue to deliver in the current environment as well as benefit from continued market growth as our initiatives underway position us for above market growth, expanding profit margins and enhance free cash flow, all of which are based on our strategic plan that balances cash generation, high return reinvestment opportunities and ongoing debt reduction to achieve our leverage target of 2.5 to 3 (sic) [3.5] (8:14) times EBITDA. Turning to page 9, I would like to provide a bit more detail on our specific growth initiatives. Leveraging our existing core business strengths, including our national footprint, unmatched scale and manufacturing capability and best-in-class sales force, we are confident that our plans will enable us to capitalize on growth in the residential housing market to generate an incremental $250 million to $280 million in EBITDA. We call this core growth. In addition to this core growth, we will continue to expand our national manufacturing footprint and capabilities to grow our higher margin value-added products faster than the overall market over the next several years. Our plans call for investing in 17 new truss and 8 millwork and door facilities over the next four years, including the 4 facilities underway this year. Expanding our national footprint to serve a number of markets that do not currently have adequate access to these high margin products and where we see opportunities to serve the needs of our customers. Our strategic plan further includes a set of operational excellence efficiency initiatives across our organization, including distribution and logistics, pricing and margin optimization, back office efficiencies and system enhancements that are expected to contribute between $65 million and $75 million in incremental annual EBITDA once fully implemented. We are on target with our implementation plans and have made good progress this quarter rolling out several projects. Our delivery and dispatch management project is underway with the system rolled out to 30 locations in the first quarter and another 60 locations scheduled for the balance of 2018. This system links with our delivery fleet's black box technology for more efficient fleet management, driver safety, DOT compliance and delivery optimization. We also rolled out the first phase of our data analytics reporting tool in March, an enterprise analytics solution to enable more efficient operations and cost management. These projects, when leveraged across our 402 locations, should offer significant profit margin expansion, further differentiation of our service, and increase connectivity with our customers providing economic and strategic value that is unrivaled by our smaller competitors. I will now turn the call over to Peter, who will review our financial results in more detail.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, Chad. Good morning, everyone. As a reminder, we have included adjusted figures to normalize for one-time integration, closure and other costs. On slide 11, you can see we had one fewer sales days in the first quarter of 2018 than the prior year, so I will speak to our results on a sales per day basis. We reported net sales of $1.7 billion, a 12.7% increase compared to the first quarter of 2017, including an estimated 9.6% benefit from commodity price inflation. Despite the impacts of weather-related facility closures on our company's sales numbers and a number of markets during the quarter, we estimate that our underlying sales volume were approximately 3.8% in the single family new residential homebuilding end market and 2.8% in the repair and remodel and other end market. Gross margin of $411 million in the first quarter of 2018 increased by $34.9 million or 9.3% over the first quarter of 2017. Our gross margin percentage was 24.2%, down 30 basis points from 24.5% in the first quarter of 2017 and flat sequentially from the fourth quarter. The margin percentage decrease on a year-over-year basis was attributable to rapid increases in commodity prices. Framing lumber and sheet good prices increased 13% and 24% from year end 2017, respectively. As we have discussed in prior calls, commodity inflation can cause short-term gross margin percentage compression when prices are rising and margin percentage expansion when prices are falling due to the short-term pricing commitments, we provide customers versus the volatility of the commodity markets. Additionally, higher dollar sales in commodity products had a negative mix impact on the gross margin percentage. These price fluctuations caused some ongoing short-term gross profit margin compression. But, I'm pleased with our team's ability to mitigate the impact on our EBITDA margin through continued cost discipline and strong growth in high margin products. Furthermore, in the quarter through the combination of our team's execution and sustained higher commodity product prices, we are beginning to realize the positive benefits in EBITDA dollars on a year-over-year basis. As commodity prices stabilize, the company should further benefit from these higher commodity prices, enhancing our go-forward profitability. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased by 80 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This reduction was largely driven by ongoing cost discipline and operating leverage achieved, even while absorbing the costs of our investments in growth and operational initiatives, including additional sales associates, new facilities and start-up investments in our operational excellence programs. Additionally, we realized this improvement despite lapping a $4.2 million one-time decrease in insurance and benefits expense that we reported in the first quarter of 2017. We do not expect this insurance variance to repeat the balance of the year. Adjusted interest expense for the quarter was $26.7 million compared to adjusted interest expense of $33.8 million in 2017. The $7.1 million reduction was largely due to multiple transactions the company executed in 2017 to lower our go-forward cash interest expense, to extend our maturity profile, and to further strengthen our capital structure. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $27.6 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of $12.1 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase of $15.5 million or 128% was primarily driven by strong revenue growth, ongoing cost discipline and lower interest expense achieved through our refinancing actions. First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew $6.5 million or 8.6% to $82.6 million. The year-over-year improvement was largely driven by strong revenue growth, operating leverage and disciplined cost management, partially offset by the impact of commodity inflation on gross margin, the initial cost of the investments we are making in our strategic growth initiatives and the previously mentioned one-time decrease in insurance and benefits cost recognized in the prior year's first quarter. Additionally, we are beginning to realize the positive benefits in EBITDA dollars from a combination of our team's execution and higher lumber prices on a year-over-year basis. As commodity prices stabilize, we expect to further benefit from these higher prices, enhancing our go-forward profitability. Turning to slide 12, we expect our free cash flow generation to be utilized to continue our balanced investments and our strategic investments and continuing debt reduction. We believe this will be supported by EBITDA growth and our continuing focus on working capital efficiency, which is estimated to run approximately 9% to 10% of incremental sales. We expect to increase investment in our business through capital expenditures at approximately 1.6% of sales. We expect our NOL tax asset to shelter us from paying all, but approximately $15 million to $20 million in cash taxes in 2018. As a result of the capital markets transactions we executed in 2017, our cash interest should be reduced to approximately $100 million in 2018. We expect one-time costs of $15 million to $20 million as we continue our system integration work, and in total, we expect to generate $170 million to $190 million in net free cash flow after investing activities for the full year 2018. We expect to utilize cash generated to pay down debt and fund our strategic growth investments and we expect to reduce our leverage ratio to 3.5 times or lower by year end, which is within our long-term target range. Due to seasonal patterns of working capital needs, driven by the seasonal nature of our customers' business, we typically use cash in the first half of the year and generate cash in the second half of the year. Therefore, in the first quarter of 2018, cash used in operations and investment was $197.9 million, including $19.5 million of capital investments. This was in line with our expectations and with our annual guidance of generating $170 million to $190 million in net free cash flow for the full year of 2018. We continue our track record of reducing our leverage ratio and this quarter was no different. Despite the impact of commodity product price inflation on inventory, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a trailing 12-month basis as of March 31, 2018 was 4.6 times, representing a 0.4 times reduction from the first quarter of 2017. Total liquidity at March 31, 2018 was $321.9 million, consisting of net borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand, which is more than sufficient for our operating needs. As we look forward with confidence in our team's execution and the housing market environment, we would like to provide color on how we are seeing the second quarter of 2018 as well as reconfirming how we are thinking about 2018. For full year 2018, we still expect single family starts to grow in the mid to high single-digit range, R&R market volume growth of approximately 3% and declines in the multi-family end market. We also anticipate 5 percentage points to 6 percentage points of top line sales growth from commodity inflation on a year-over-year basis. From a gross margin perspective, the recent lumber and panel price moves will continue to constrain our gross margin percentage in the second quarter. However, as we move through the second half of the year, we expect to return to a more normalized gross margin in the 25% range. Year-over-year commodity inflation driven gross margin compression during the balance of 2018 should not be nearly as impactful as it was on our 2017 results, allowing us to return to a more normalized incremental EBITDA conversion of roughly 12% to 15% in the second half of 2018. We will continue our growth strategy of investment in new value-added manufacturing facilities and sales talent in 2018 as well as start-up costs in our operational excellence initiatives, all of which combined, we expect in total $10 million to $12 million in incremental cost during the balance of 2018. Overall, we continue to expect 15% to 20% year-over-year EBITDA growth for the full year in 2018 and current estimates indicate that we will finish out at the upper end of that range. We expect the tax impact of the 2017 Tax Act to result in an effective tax rate of approximately 25% for fiscal 2018. The recently enacted tax reform will also enable us to generate higher net free cash flow in the years ahead, enabling more rapid debt repayment and providing additional cash for our strategic growth initiatives. For the second quarter specifically, we expect sales to be in the 10% to 15% over prior year range, with 6% to 9% coming from commodity inflation. Gross margin is expected to be flat to Q1 2018 as we continue to absorb the short-term margin compression from the recent commodity inflation. We will maintain our focus on cost discipline, efficiency improvements and leverage reduction, while investing in our growth initiatives. We expect EBITDA growth to be around 15% for the quarter. I'll now turn the call back over to Chad for his closing comments.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Peter. There's certainly a lot to be excited about here at Builders FirstSource as we capitalize on the opportunities we see for our team and our company in the current environment and invest in an even brighter future. We've all worked hard to achieve our strong positioning and we are set to take advantage of improving market conditions, including ongoing growth in the housing market and the benefits of higher commodity prices that have begun to turn our way. We expect to continue to improve our margins through investments that deliver operating leverage, investments in the growth of our value-added products network and disciplined cost management. I am confident that the investments we have underway across our strategic initiatives will yield meaningful profit growth and a further advantaged service model for our customers in the coming years. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question is Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Let me start off with the sales volume per day, the 3.9% I think in the single family. What do you think that would have been without the weather effect? Just trying to get a sense of that. Would it have taken you all the way back to the kind of mid to high single digits you're expecting for the year or – yeah, so just trying to get a sense of the weather impact?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I would qualify the weather impact as a slight negative year-over-year. So, would it have gotten us all the way there? Probably not. But what we have seen in the first quarter was some outsized (23:20) growth and some of the larger markets that we don't participate in, Phoenix, Vegas and Miami are a couple of examples. But weather was part of the equation there. And I think there's other issues. You've got labor constraints out there that are likely slowing cycle time and so the level of construction that may or may not be taking place on a particular start may be varying. And with the growth in the starter homes and the first time move up homes, you are looking at some smaller homes as being part of the mix, but that's part of the deal. If we're going to get back to a more normalized level of housing starts, we need that first-time homebuyer to get active. So, I think it's a combination of those things.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thinking about the mix of factors that you just went through, the mid to high single-digit volume assumption you have for the market overall, how will that then translate do you expect for your new home sales growth on a volume basis?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: In the guidance we gave, we're assuming around a 5% volume growth in those numbers. That answers your question.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got you, got you. And the other question I wanted to ask was on the inflation. 9% impact of inflation in 1Q. You are expecting mid-single digits. Can you walk us through just some of the puts and takes there? Is it just that the obviously the year-over-year comps, obviously the trajectory was pretty much straight upwards, the relative movements of panel – panels versus lumber? What brings it back down from the 9% to the 5% to 6% you're expecting for the year overall?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: It's mainly just the year-over-year variance. We had quite a bit of inflation in the back half. And so, when we run those numbers, we're just assuming prices stay where they are as of today from an inflation standpoint.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got you. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.
Steven Ramsey - Thompson Research Group LLC: Good morning. This is Steven Ramsey on for Kathryn. With the single family in construction to lower price point homes, are you seeing this in all regions and does that necessarily imply that you're seeing a decline in mid to larger homes? And can you discuss how this helps or hurts product categories?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So, well, a couple of specifics. We are tracking it and seeing it at that lowest level by region. I think most of what we're seeing isn't seen in the data that's being broadly available to everyone, right? There are a couple of surveys and some studies that have indicated a transition. Obviously, some of the larger homebuilds, we've talked about it a lot. In certain markets definitely becoming a more important part, but no, I don't think it's at the expense of the mid to higher range home sales. I think it's in addition. I think that's the part that we really are happy about. It's the idea that we can get to the more normalized growth, that 1.1 million to 1.2 million single family starts that we kind of all expect, that's the piece, I would say the largest component that we're missing up until now is that starter home sort of tier. So, excited about that. And the meaning – what it means to us, while the top line may – you may see because you've got less linear (27:12) smaller home than you would in a larger home, maybe a little bit of a headwind on the revenue or revenue per start, but we still feel good about the EBITDA dollars per start, and that's really because of the trends to use more manufactured or pre-fabricated components in those homes. Generally, a simpler design allows us to provide roof trusses, wall panels or joists where they might perhaps not be used in some other designs and the cost to serve given the nature of single family constructions generally in our favor as well. So, we feel really good about the opportunity that that represents.
Steven Ramsey - Thompson Research Group LLC: Excellent. And then with homebuilder consolidation, is this a headwind or tailwind for you or does it potentially increase the opportunity to drive adoption of the value-add manufacturing facilities products?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, with the consolidation we've seen to-date, we've got great relationships with those builders. I think it's going to – with our national footprint, I just think it's going to make us even more valuable as they grow and as they cover more of the country, I think our footprint and our scale is going to play nicely with them.
Steven Ramsey - Thompson Research Group LLC: Great. Thank you.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is with Matt McCall with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: So, I think I've heard – well, I know I heard the commodity inflation here, but what about the commodity volatility? Not talking about the mix impact here. Was there a hit from volatility in the quarter? And then, what do you expect in the Q2 guidance from the movements in commodities?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. So, we definitely did see a couple of different things going. And I guess to reference one piece of a comment from before, the general trend in the first quarter was lumber was a very volatile, very aggressive increase and that was the cause of the pain. We did see some tailwinds from the pullback on OSB, but it was overwhelmed by the negative influence on margins of the lumber inflation. What we would expect to see is that the year-over-year basis, our gross margins in the quarter hurt us for about 50 basis points on a combination of rate and mix, right? So, while the dollar – while percentage amounts in the quarter were up on both lumber and OSB, OSB from a net impact on gross margins in the quarter was favorable because of the buys that we made in the fourth quarter based on the volatility in that OSB. We think that is probably those contracts is worth maybe around $5 million of negative impact all in for the quarter. And if that combination again of the negative mix associated with the rapid growth of lumber, offset by the benefit of the positive mix from the favorable growth of our manufacture and value-add products.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And, Matt, I'll just add and I know you know this, framing lumber has been on a tear the last few weeks, but panels and OSB have been remarkably flat and all indications are at least where we sit today. Lumber could have a little bit more upside, but we see panel and OSB kind of settling in where it's at. And later in the year, we may see a little fall off in lumber, but all in all the lumber prices are at very good levels for us and it does finally start to feel like we're getting on the other side of this thing. We're obviously generating incremental gross margin dollars now, even though our margin rate is lower. But we've gotten some good price increases pushed through and it really feels like we're – this thing is going to start to turn and actually be a wind in our back. And it's been a long time coming, all of us in this space for a year and a half feel like we've been chasing this thing and it finally feels like we're catching up with it.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay, very helpful. So, you've mentioned a few things. You mentioned cost management efforts and you've also talked about the investments. I think the total growth investment was $4.6 million in the quarter. I think you previously discussed $10 million to $15 million for the year. Is that still a good number? What is the kind of the trajectory through the year, the cadence through the year? And then, how does that compare to maybe some offsets from a cost management perspective?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah, I still think those are good numbers. A little bit of front loading on some of that. Some of that has to do with the spend. Some of that has to do with the benefit, giving you a net number there. So, I think it's still a good number what you've got. The initiatives are underway. There is – it's hitting on a couple of different lines. So, I'm not sure how to give you more detail about it.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. I mean, so you said the offset, so the cost management. Are there other offsets where we see maybe it's the investments in that being net neutral or close to net neutral? I'm just trying to get a magnitude of the cost management efforts.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah, not yet. At this point, we're funding to get the projects rolling, staffing, third-party resources, that sort of thing. As the year progresses, some of that comes in, but the net is the $4.6 million.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Got it.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: For the quarter, and the net for the full year is that $50 million (32:58).
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Net number. Okay. All right. Thanks, Peter.
Operator: And our next question is from Will Randow with Citi. Please go ahead.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, and congratulations on the progress.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, Will.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I guess I just had a question, I've obviously asked in the past, but in terms of your guidance, looks like it's based on current price locks with your customers or stated differently pricing from a little over a month ago on average. Please correct me if I'm wrong. And then also can you review your EBITDA and free cash sensitivity for this year, basically second half, if you have a 10% move in lumber and also what that would look like for next year?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: To answer your first question, yeah, obviously, we've got price locks. We've got some good price increases pushed through in the second quarter. As I mentioned, we'll see what framing lumber does. If it stays up where it is, that will be a bit of a headwind later in this quarter. But, overall, I still think you're going to see some nice progress in our margins. And again, borrowing any unexpected additional run up in the back half of the year, I think we're following going to get the wind in our back. As far as the cash flow sensitivity, all that, I'll let Peter take that one.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah, so cash flow for the full year, we're definitely still on guidance. We feel good about it. The sort of key components in there is that working capital around 9%. Taxes being at – still at the 15% to 20% range, interest at about $100 million, one timers doing that $15 million to $20 million range and then CapEx at a roughly 1.6% number, and as you recall, we generally use a lot of cash at the beginning of the year and we generate in the back half. We still think that's true. Obviously, the inflation and the increased pricing in the lumber and commodities do have an impact on working capital. But at this stage, we think we're managing through it and we expect to deliver on guidance.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And just to rehash that for clarity purposes, your guidance is based on your current price locks, not the current spot prices. And it sounds like based on the commentary you just made, Peter, you're probably at the top end of your free cash flow guidance given where lumber prices are?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think we're at the higher end of our guidance on the EBITDA growth. I'm not sure I would say we're at the top end of the guidance on the cash growth just because of the offsetting impact of the value of working capital.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: (35:48).
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I follow. And the price lock piece, that's what your guidance is based on, your current price locks?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. It's based on our current experience, that's what our forecasts are based on. Correct.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then just as a quick follow-up. In terms of like engineered products, meaning assembled wall components, et cetera, are there any regions where you're seeing incremental acceleration in terms of adoption? Obviously, the Pacific Northwest has been a strong market for some. But are you seeing a real incremental pickup in certain markets just given the labor constraints?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Ones that come to mind, as you mentioned, Pacific Northwest, Colorado, Florida, would probably be the top three.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Sounds great. Thanks again, guys, and congrats again.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is with Jay McCanless with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: The first question I had in terms of the sales benefit for the full year from commodity growth, it looks that you guys have tightened that range. I think you said 4% to 6% in the 4Q call, and now you're saying 5% to 6%. Did I hear that correctly?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yes.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then in terms of the volume growth, I heard – I jumped on late, so I apologize, but was the comment about 5% volume growth, was that related to 2Q sales or is that what you guys are thinking volume growth looks like for the full year?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah, no, so that's not the volume growth for the full year. The full year total revenue is in that 10% to 12% range. The full year volume growth for single family is in those mid to high single digits range. That's what we were talking about in terms of that 5%. That's really just the single family component. Obviously, we believe multi-family is down a bit again this year, R&R and other still in that kind of 3% range as usual.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I think the multi-family growth will largely be offset – or multi-family decline will largely be offset by the R&R growth. So, what you're left with is somewhere around 5% to 6% volume growth in total and for single family the way the math works.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Another question I had, just if you look at some of the other indicators that are out there for repair and remodel spend and repair and renovation spend this year, a lot of those seem to be ticking towards the high end of the traditional ranges. So, I'm a little surprised to hear you guys talking about 3% growth. What could change or what do you see that might influence that number from 3% to 3.5% or 3% to 4%?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, this is one we struggle with. I mean the greatest challenge we have in this space is geographic exposure and where our R&R/other is geographically versus the national averages. So, our exposure to California and Alaska and the Upper Midwest in the R&R space and then of course the other representing some of the commercial and industrial work that we have in some of the other product areas, that is where we have a tendency to candidly not be a good reflection or a good match to that national metric that you're seeing. I think certain markets are absolutely doing better than that for us and candidly some others aren't. Alaska is a good example of a market that's struggling a bit that pulls down our average, but it's still a healthy business for us and we like it.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. And then just since you mentioned California. With the state's adoption of these new solar panel codes starting in 2020, is that something that could benefit you guys? Do you all distribute any of the solar panel equipment now or is it something you would consider doing, assuming that code change holds?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, that's obviously a pretty new headline, I haven't given a lot of thought. I did call on our Texas location today and told them to get ready for some incremental business from the influx of Californians coming over. But all joking aside, absolutely we would consider it. It's not something we do now. And we'll see. I don't really know exactly what that means, what's going to be required. I think I saw an incremental $10,000 in cost for new houses, the current estimates. So, we'll see. It's an interesting twist that we'll certainly keep an eye on.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Sounds great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question is Blake Hirschman with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.
Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning. Congrats on a good quarter and thanks for taking my questions.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.: First off, there's a lot more talk kind of across the space on increased freight and transportation costs and apologies if you've already kind of touched on it. But just was hoping to hear if you guys could kind of walk us through how that might impact you guys?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, that's certainly – the transportation issues are certainly one of the main factors that are driving the commodity prices up and keeping them in elevated level. So, it's really just all part of our cost of goods and getting that pushed on. The net result we – as you know, we love high commodity lumber prices and transportation is certainly playing a part of that. So, at the end of the day, it's a good thing for us and as I said earlier, it feels like we've got (41:36) now and we're about to finally get in front of this thing and get some wind in our back. So, net-net, it's a good thing for us and that's definitely part of the equation right now and getting those wood products into our locations.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And on the (41:52) side, clearly we're seeing the impact of the fuel and the cost of drivers. But because we own our own fleet, we're a little less tousled by the winds of expense with regard to the freight lines and their rates.
Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. And then one more. I think I caught earlier comments that incremental margins are expected to be kind of at that more normal 12% to 15% and I think you said in the back half of the year. So I just wanted to be clear if there was any changes the way you're thinking about incrementals for the full year, which if I'm not mistaken was 12% to 15% excluding some additional SG&A investments that you guys have called out?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. So, that's correct. We are trying to communicate that as we get into the second half of the year, we expect that we'll get back to two things. One is the gross margin that closer approximates what we were 18 months ago in that 25% range and in addition to fall through, we think in the second half we'll be back within the normal range as well in that 12% to 15%.
Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Matt Bouley with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Marshall Mentz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. This is actually Marshall Mentz on for Matt. How are you all doing?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning. Good.
Marshall Mentz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I just wanted to ask about, what do you all see as you're exiting the quarter in terms of trends and maybe quarter-to-date here into May that leads you to the growth that you're expecting in EBITDA for the second quarter, and then your comments about expecting to be now more towards the high end of the full year EBITDA range? Is that driven by inflation coming in at the high end potentially of the 5% to 6% or are there other factors moving in your favor that you're seeing in your end markets?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, a couple of things. Certainly, we're pleased with the price increases we're getting passed through, the rate at which, at least in place, our lumber products have gone up has seemed to have slowed. So, I said earlier we finally seem to be getting caught up from that standpoint. And another big factor is just the demand for our truss and panel products, certainly don't see that letting up and probably continue to grow as the builders continue to look for ways to cut back on their labor and deal with these labor shortages. So, it's a combination of those things and just the positive feedback we're getting from our guys out in the field and from our customers, it just – it feels like things are really setting up for a pretty good back half of the year.
Marshall Mentz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you and good luck.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Lee Nalley with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Lee Nalley - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning, Lee.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning, Lee.
Lee Nalley - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Just wondering, what's your current appetite for acquisitions and then what would be your max comfort level on increasing leverage too?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Not a big appetite right now. We're still on a path of delevering and we intend to stick to that. I couldn't rule out a small tuck in here or there, especially if it was a buy versus build decision. I think that might be a situation where we might buy someone rather than build a new location. But we're – anything large or transformational, if it's going to deviate us from our deleveraging that we – the path that we're on, then that's very unlikely.
Lee Nalley - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. Thanks. And then what – so what would be your target for getting leverage too before you just start considering bigger M&A? I know your target is 2.5 to 3.5. Is it just once you get there or something lower?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, that's our initial target, and I think we'll be there by the end of the year and then I think it's just a matter of assessing the overall environment where we think we are in the cycle, what the next couple of years look like. But that would probably be the point in time where we really start to give us some serious thought.
Lee Nalley - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Right. Okay. Thank you.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Alex Rygiel with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
Min Cho - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Min Cho for Alex. Most of my questions have been answered, but I do have this one kind of question. If you could provide any progress that you're making on the growth initiatives that you discussed in terms of the new truss plans and hiring the new associates and when do you – when should we expect to start to see some of the benefits of those investments?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, from a sales growth or sales force growth initiative, we hired around 120 net new sales people last year. I think right now we're trending somewhere 75 to 100 this year and so that has certainly been successful and definitely helping us build the bench strength for the future. And earlier in the call in our prepared remarks, we discussed a lot of our growth initiatives, significant investment in truss plants, both new facilities and increasing the efficiency in existing plants, door shops. And so that's all part of the growth in our manufactured and value-add products that you're seeing. And certainly in the last year, year and a half, the growth in those categories has outpaced the market. So I think you are seeing it and I think you will continue to see it.
Min Cho - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And that's all the time we have for questions. Mr. Crow, I will turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you once again for joining our call today. We look forward to updating you on the progress of our initiatives in the quarters ahead and if you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Jen Pasquino or Peter Jackson. Thank you.
Operator: And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Jen, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 earnings call. I will start with a brief update on our fourth quarter performance and an update on our execution against our 2017 priorities, as well as our longer-term strategic growth initiatives. Then I will turn the call over to Peter, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After our closing comments regarding our outlook, we will take your questions. Let's start on page four of the presentation. I continue to be impressed by the execution of our 15,000 associates across our 402 locations as we work to further enhance our position as a preferred supplier to our customers. Our sales for the fourth quarter of $1.8 billion represent a solid increase in sales per day of 13.2% over 2016, excluding closed locations. This growth was benefited by commodity price inflation of approximately 7.6%. Sales volume per day, excluding closed locations, grew approximately 7.5% in the single family homebuilding end market, and approximately 5.2% in the repair and remodeling, and other end market. Turning to slide 5. Throughout the year, we experienced rapidly rising commodity prices. Framing lumber and sheet good prices increased 21% and 18% in 2017 respectively. These price fluctuations caused an ongoing short-term gross profit margin compression, but I am very pleased with our organization's responsiveness to the challenge and ability to mitigate the impact. As we manage through this period of commodity price inflation, we expect these higher prices will benefit our profitability in the longer term. I am also pleased to report that our increased investments in manufacturing capacity continue to pay off with 11% growth in sales of manufactured products in the year, faster than the overall growth of the residential housing market. Our growth and other value-added products of windows, doors, and millwork, which are sold to the multi-family and R&R markets, as well as to our single-family building customers grew 6.1% this year, also faster than the overall markets they serve. We are accelerating our manufacturing and value-added investments and expanding capacity further in 2018. Including three new truss plants, nine new lines in existing plants, one new millwork facility, and capacity additions to many more, our value-added products provide a solution to the growing demand to build homes more efficiently, addressing labor constraints and rising costs. We are committed to growing these higher-margin products faster than the housing market and adding to our already-unparalleled scale of manufacturing facilities strategically located across the country. Moving on to page six with an overview of the housing market, the outlook for new residential housing remains very bright. We have reached approximately 1.2 million annual starts with approximately 850,000 of those being single-family starts. This remains approximately 25% below the historic average, just now reaching levels that we have seen in previous recessionary troughs. We are anticipating mid- to high-single digit growth in the single-family homebuilding market for 2018, a supportive market environment in which to continue to execute our profitable growth plans and strategic priorities, and what we believe to be multiple years of continued growth ahead of us. Turning to slide 7, I am pleased to report that we successfully delivered against our 2017 priorities. We invested in the addition of 120 net sales professionals and trainees in 2017. We are committed to these investments that will drive long-term results and we plan to continue our sales expansion initiatives in 2018. It is the scale and strength of our platform that enables us to absorb the initial costs of these additions, while positioning our business for continuing profitable growth in the years ahead. As I mentioned, there remain significant opportunities to increase the reach and penetration of our higher-margin value-added products and our expansion initiatives are delivering results in terms of above market growth. Our 2017 investments included opening four new truss plants and productivity enhancement at 20 existing plants. With the continuing well-publicized labor challenges being faced by our customers, demand for these labor saving products will continue to rise as homebuilders look for ways to build homes more efficiently. We have also increased our focus on best practice implementation across the organization and have identified numerous areas to drive incremental operational efficiencies. Our logistics and back-office automation initiatives are underway, valuable in their own right but also the beginning in terms of driving our longer range operational excellence initiatives. These are designed to generate even greater value for the organization and further cost savings and customer connectivity. Of course, our continuing focus on cash generation remains a priority, allowing us to fund these initiatives while continuing to deleverage the balance sheet. We generated $119 million of net free cash flow in 2017 after funding $62 million of capital investments and reduced our leverage ratio to 4.2 times, 0.6 times lower than prior year. Finally, we are only as strong as our 15,000 talented associates and we are committed to continuing to attract, train, and retain the best people in the industry and to developing our future leaders throughout the organization. In keeping with this commitment, we have stepped up our focus on college recruiting and sales and management trainee development to create a program to grow our talent and leaders for the years ahead. Moving to slide 8, we continue to develop our plans to accelerate growth and further expand profitability with the primary focus on creating long-term shareholder value. As the housing market returns to historical average building levels over the next four to five years, the strength of our core enterprise, along with our focused operational excellence initiatives and investments in growing our value-added product categories, should enable us to double 2016 EBITDA, and to generate free cash flow of 2.5 to 3 times the 2016 level. This represents over $1 billion in cash over that time period and results in an EPS between $3 and $3.50. We are on track with the plan that we communicated last year and have updated the financial metrics to include the impact of the 2017 Tax Act. Our platform is exceptionally well positioned to take increasing advantage of accelerating growth and improved market conditions, and our initiatives underway position us for expanding profit margins and growing free cash flow. We have created a realistic roadmap that balances cash generation, reinvestment opportunities and profitable growth, and ongoing debt reduction to achieve our long-term leverage target of 2.5 to 3 times EBITDA. Turning to page 9, I would like to provide a bit more detail on our growth initiatives. Leveraging our core business strengths, including more than 400 locations in 75 of the top 100 MSAs, our unmatched scale in manufacturing capability and best-in-class sales force, we are confident that our plans will enable us to capture growth in the residential housing market that will generate an incremental $250 million to $280 million of EBITDA. Beyond this core growth, we will expand our national manufacturing footprint and differentiated capabilities designed to grow our higher-margin value-added products, faster than the market, over the next several years. Our plans call for investing in more than 25 new facilities over the next four years to drive this result, expanding our unparalleled national footprint to serve locations that do not currently have access to our higher-margin products. In addition to growing our value-added products, our strategic plan includes execution of operational excellence, cost saving initiatives including distribution and logistics, pricing and margin optimization, back-office efficiencies, and system enhancements that are designed to contribute between $65 million and $75 million, an incremental annual EBITDA once fully implemented. The scope and scale of our existing infrastructure, customer base and logistical capabilities means that improvements and efficiency, when replicated across our network, can yield substantial profit margin expansion. I have great reason to be confident about the future of our company and our ability to create substantial value for our shareholders, while improving our advantage service model for our customers, suppliers and associates. I'll now turn the call over to Peter, who will review our financial results in more detail.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. On slide 11, I will first discuss the current quarter results and then touch briefly on our year-to-date results on page 12. As a reminder, we have included adjusted figures to normalize for one-time integration closure and other costs. We have one more sales day in the fourth quarter of 2017 than prior year, so I will speak to our results on a sales per day basis. For the fourth quarter, we reported net sales of $1.8 billion, a 13.2% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, excluding the impact of closed locations and including an estimated 7.6% benefit from commodity price inflation. We estimate that our sales volume grew approximately 7.5% in a single family new residential homebuilding end market, and 5.2% in the repair and remodel/other end market with expected market driven declines in multi-family. Our gross margin percentage was 24.2%, down 110 basis points from 25.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease on a year-over-year basis was largely attributable to the higher commodity prices, framing lumber and sheet goods prices increased 21% and 18% from year-end 2016 to year-end 2017 respectively. Commodity inflation will cause short-term gross margin percentage compression when prices are rising and margin percentage expansion when prices are falling due to the short-term pricing commitments we provide customers versus the volatility of the commodity markets. Additionally, higher sales in commodity products had a negative mix impact on gross margin percent. These price fluctuations caused some ongoing short-term gross margin profit compression, but I am pleased with the company's ability to mitigate the impact. I expect that as commodity prices stabilize, the company will begin to benefit from higher commodity prices, enhancing our go-forward profitability. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased by 140 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The reduction was largely driven by cost savings and leverage achieved, while absorbing the costs of our investments in growth initiatives, including additional sales associates and new facilities. Interest expense for the quarter of $89.5 million includes $56.3 million associated with the one-time cost associated with redeeming our 10.75% unsecured notes. This transaction reduced our go-forward interest expense by approximately $35 million per year. Income tax expense of $18 million included $29 million related to the revaluation of our deferred taxes as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. Excluding this non-cash revaluation, adjusted income tax expense decreased by $14.2 million, compared to 2016, largely attributable to the premium paid on our debt refinancing transaction. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $46.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $18.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew $12 million, or 14.2% to $96.9 million. The year-over-year improvement was largely driven by sales increases, cost leverage, and disciplined cost management, offset by the impact of commodity inflation on gross margin and investments the company made in growth initiatives, including an increase in sales associates and new locations. Switching now to the year-to-date financial highlights, please turn to page 12. In the face of the commodity price inflation pressures previously noted, the company achieved strong results for 2017, including 10.7% sales growth, 9.8% EBITDA growth, 56% growth in net income and $119.1 million of net cash flow generation which, even after funding our strategic growth investments, enabled ongoing debt reduction. Our refinancing transaction eliminated our most expensive notes, reducing go-forward interest by $35 million per year. We reduced net leverage by 0.6 turns as compared to a year ago to 4.2 times. As we move into 2018, free cash flow generation will continue to be a priority as we continue our balanced approach to strategic investments in our future, along with continued deleveraging. Turning to page 13, we expect free cash flow generation will be utilized to continue our balanced approach to strategic investments and continuing to pay down debt. We believe that this will be enabled by EBITDA growth and a focus on working capital efficiency, which is estimated to run approximately 10% of incremental sales. We expect to increase investment in our business through capital expenditures at approximately 1.7% of sales. We expect our current NOL tax asset to shelter us from paying all but approximately $15 million to $20 million of cash taxes in 2018. As a result of the opportunistic capital market transactions we executed in 2017, cash interest will be reduced to $95 million to $100 million in 2018. We expect one-time costs of approximately $20 million. As a result, we expect to generate $170 million to $190 million in net free cash flow for the full year of 2018. We expect to utilize cash generated to pay down debt and to fund strategic growth investments, as we expect to reduce our leverage to 3.5 times or better by year-end, which is within our long-term target range. I would like to provide color on the first quarter of 2018, as well as how we are currently thinking about 2018. For full-year 2018, we expect single-family starts to grow in the mid- to high-single-digit range, R&R market growth of approximately 3% and continued declines in the multi-family end market. Whether single-family starts can grow at the high-end of that range will, in our opinion, depend on construction labor availability. We anticipate 4 points to 6 points benefit from commodity prices on our sales. From a gross margin perspective, the recent lumber and panel price moves will continue to constrain our gross margin early in the year. However, by later in the year we expect to return to a more normalized gross margin in the 25% range. The year-over-year commodity driven gross margin compression should not be nearly as impactful as it was on our 2017 results, allowing us to get back to a more normalized EBITDA conversion of 12% to 15% in 2018 before growth investments. We will continue our investment strategy in new facilities and additional sales professionals in 2018, as well as startup investments in our operational excellence initiatives, combined totaling $10 million to $15 million incrementally. We are expecting 15% to 20% EBITDA growth in 2018. The company expects the impact of the 2017 Tax Act to result in approximately a 25% effective tax rate in fiscal 2018. Additionally, the tax reform will enable us to repay debt more quickly and have additional cash on hand for our priorities, namely; funding growth initiatives. For quarter one, we will have one fewer selling day versus prior year. So, I will talk to sales per day in our guidance for the quarter. We expect sales growth for the quarter to be up 10% to 15% on a sales per day basis over prior year, with about half coming from commodity inflation. Gross margin is expected to be flat to Q4 of 2017 as we continue to absorb the short-term margin compression from the recent commodity inflation. We will maintain our focus on cost reductions and leverage while not sacrificing investing in growth initiatives. We have some timing differences year-over-year related to insurance and benefits costs which will increase our SG&A in Q1 of 2018 by approximately $7 million, which we expect to be recaptured in later quarters. Overall, as a result of one fewer selling day and these SG&A timing issues, we expect EBITDA growth to be around 5% for the quarter. However, we are expecting 15% to 20% EBITDA growth for full-year 2018. I'll now turn the call back over to Chad for his closing comments.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Peter. And thank you, all, for allowing us to share with you our progress on our ongoing investments in the company's future. There's a lot to be excited about as we enter 2018. Housing demand appears strong and while material cost inflation continues to create short-term challenges, I see it as an advantage in the coming years. In addition, we will continue to leverage our core strength to grow the top-line and profits, as well as creating meaningful value for shareholders through our strategic growth priorities and operational excellence initiatives. We've laid out a plan to double EBITDA and generate over $1 billion in net cash flow and are excited about the prospects the future holds. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Blake Hirschman from Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.
Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, guys, and congrats on a great quarter.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, Blake.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.: First off, just wanted to get a little bit more color and insight into how you're kind of thinking about the trend in lumber prices going through the year from these sky-high levels? I mean, I appreciate the detail, the 4% to 6% top-line and the flat sequential margins. Just kind of curious as to when you guys are making your outlook for the year if you expect them to pull back throughout the course of the year, stay up here or just kind of overall on...?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: It's been an incredible run, a year, a year-and-a-half of really unprecedented inflation. I was looking at price charts a couple of weeks ago, and I really thought the line was going to go vertical and actually fall back over on itself. It was so absurd. But our best guess is in the next four to six weeks, you'll probably start to see some flattening out. And, I think, prices will stay at healthy levels all year. It's just the demand has been really strong. The weather has been strong. The fires late last year were creating some log shortages. And then, this time of the year in the winter with the colder weather, you do have transportation issues primarily in the colder weather. Trains can only carry about half the rail cars they normally would. So, all these things are just adding up to a lot of demand and a lot of pressure on price. But, all in all, as we've said many times, high lumber prices is great for business. I think you will see things start to flatten out through March and into April. So, that's kind of what we're counting on, maybe a little more pressure in the near-term. Back half of the year, hopefully, a little bit of relief.
Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.: Got it. All right. Thanks for that. And then one more, just on the long-term plan, the EPS update. Just to be clear. Is there anything else that changed outside the tax reform and, I guess, the interest savings from taking out the 10.75% notes? Was there any other assumption changes there?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: No. We didn't make any changes beyond those.
Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks for answering my questions and best of luck.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. The 15% to 20% EBITDA growth for 2018, can you just walk us through kind of the high-level assumptions behind that, just in terms of – on the revenue growth, and just the kind of drop-through, or what you're assuming in terms of the commodity headwind to gross margins and on the SG&A side?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Sure. We want to break down the revenue. We're talking about high-single digits for a single family, about 3% for the R&R space, and then probably similar downturn that we saw in 2017 and 2018 for the multi-family. We're looking at the numbers around commodity inflation based on what we're seeing right now, kind of in that 4% to 6% range. And then based on the growth that we're seeing in the relative space, in other words, the rapid growth in the manufacturing products space, we think that that is all going to pan out to that 12% to 15% range, not including, of course, the incremental investments we're making in some of our operational excellence initiatives.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. 12% to 15% incremental you're talking about?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Incremental flow-through. Correct.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Got it. Okay. Great. The commodity inflation that we've seen here should make your four- or five-year targets that you've laid out easier to achieve. I think you mentioned that the only change you're assuming in the numbers, because obviously you've updated them, is the tax rate. So, how should we think about it relative to the commodity inflation? Have your numbers become more conservative as a result of the unprecedented rate of commodity inflation?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: If – I'll jump in if you don't mind. If you assume lumber prices stay where they are today, yeah, there's probably a little bit of conservatism in there, but we all know that's not going to happen. Lumber prices never stay stable for a four- or five-year period. But assuming they did, yes, you're correct.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Got it. Okay. And just finally, obviously in this dramatic increases in lumber prices, has the effect which you always lay out very well on near-term effect on gross margins, longer term it benefits, has this unprecedented rate of inflation kind of reduced that near-term drag? In other words, obviously a lot of demand for lumber – single-family trends have been very, very strong. Has that reduced to the period of kind of price guarantees and maybe lessen the shorter-term drag from the commodity inflation?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Are you asking if our pricing structure has changed with our – like with our national builders, for example?
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Exactly, yeah.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: No.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, another of (26:49) your lookouts are shorter now, lesser effect on the gross margin.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: No. There really hasn't been any change in the pricing structure that we have with the national builders thus far.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Will Randow from Citi. Please go ahead.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys, and congrats on the progress.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I guess in terms of your growth investments, could you dig into a little bit more detail there? I believe $10 million to $15 million you're looking to spend this year and what that run rate may look like over the next couple following that. And also on CapEx at 1.7%, when do you think it'll kind of stabilize closer to 1.5%?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yes. So, okay, I'll answer those in inverse order. The CapEx number of about 1.7%, we had a little bit of timing at the end of 2017 with a couple of projects that rolled over into 2018. So, we're sort of feeling like we're still in the band for that period. With the change in the tax code and us continuing to look at growth opportunities over the upcoming years, we'll update you if we change it but right now, we're staying in that 1% to 1.5% band. As far as the comparisons year-on-year for the investments, we had about an incremental $2.5 million in the fourth quarter related to our investments in locations and salespeople primarily, for about $10 million year-over-year. And then for next year, we've got another $10 million that's going to be broken up new locations, additional salespeople, we won't lap the full load of those incremental salespeople until, probably the end of Q1, so in Q2. And then OpEx investments represent the rest. So operational excellence items that where we're spending money on teams and some help on that area.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And just to be clear, after this $10 million to $15 million the following year, you're thinking about $10 million, is that incremental, or could that be at the midpoint of $2.5 million step down?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: For 2018, we see that as incremental but we think that starts to put us in a healthy space for the investments that we want to make.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then just as a last question – just as a last follow-up on operational excellence. Can you talk about kind of what buckets you expect to see cost savings, and how that may offset some of the increase in sales spend, for example?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. The main buckets we're looking at is pricing and margin optimization, delivery optimization, and then back-office automation and efficiencies there. And we've laid out a number. At the maturity down the road, we're probably looking at incremental annual savings of somewhere in the $50 million to $60 million range. And those are broken out about a third, a third, a third in each of those buckets I just gave you.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And that starts kind of hitting towards the end of this year?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, we'll get a little bit of benefit this year. I would estimate full maturity on some of these initiatives is probably three to four years out.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys, and good luck in 2018.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Dahl from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. This is Matthew Bouley on for Mike today. Thanks for taking the questions.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning, Matt.
Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. So, you outlined kind of a pathway to the 3.5 times leverage by the end of 2018. Could you just outline, now that you're reaching these levels, kind of your expectations on returning to the M&A market at this point? Thank you.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. We're not in a hurry. We've got a lot to say grace over right now and a lot of things we're looking at internally that, I think, can drive some real value. But when we acquired ProBuild and took on the leverage, we knew we would have two or three years of being kind of out of the M&A market and we're sticking to that plan. I think by the end of 2018, as you said, we will have kind of gotten to the promised land from a leverage standpoint. So, later this year, maybe we start entertaining things. But as I said, we're really in no hurry right now.
Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thank you for that. Second question the working capital guide 10% of incremental sales. Just the question is really how we should think about the pace of inventory investment here just in light of the lumber inflation and kind of your expectations around inventory within that guide? And I know you outlined the completion of the delivery management integration with ERP if I guess, if that's playing into it at all. Thank you.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, the incremental working capital is pretty well within our range. We consistently talk about 9% to 10%. There's clearly a headwind in that number associated with the inflation, right? The same sticks of lumber are worth a bit more and we are a seasonal user. So, just to remind everybody we're going to build up inventory in Q1 and Q2, and then burn that inventory off in the back half of the year. That's pretty consistent with what we've done in the past. I think that hits on your main points.
Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Rygiel from B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Good morning. Nice quarter, gentlemen.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Two quick questions. First, can you talk a little bit about the benefit of the hurricanes from Texas and Florida that rolled over into the first quarter or in the fourth quarter that are rolling over into the first quarter and into maybe the second quarter of this year?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yes. We've talked about that in prior quarters. I really think the governor on (33:18) all that is going to be the availability of labor. And so, I think you're going to start seeing some benefit on the rebuild going on in Houston and Florida over the next year or two, but I really think the availability of labor is going to limit how much that growth can really be in those markets. So, overall, it's an absolute positive over the coming years. But, I think, it's just going to bleed in slowly over the next year or two.
Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: And then to follow-up on an earlier question. Your longer term EBITDA goal that you set out a little while ago was before the inflation of commodities, was before a number of the additional salespeople that you've added, and it was before a lot of the new value-added plants that are coming online and are planned for next year. So, why not raise the long-term EBITDA goal at this point in time?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So, a couple of points. I guess the point on inflation, fair, like Chad mentioned, as things stabilize, we'll start to feather that in as it makes sense. We have not. We've left a static commodity number in our forecast. Those other items though were included. We did have the expanding sales force as an initiative, the additional value-add as initiatives. And we continue to include the benefit from the operational excellence initiatives as well. We try to break that out on slide 9 in the presentation to give everybody a better feel. But those were the items that we've been counting on as our strategic plan since we rolled this out. So, that's not new.
Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay McCanless from Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: A couple of housekeeping items first. Could you let us know what we should use for D&A this year, as well as what did you say the tax rate provision is going to be?
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: 25% and $100 million in D&A.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. And then, the second question I had, very strong growth in R&R this quarter, but then guidance for about 3% growth as we move into 2018. Can you talk to us about what's going on there and why that growth that we saw in the fourth quarter isn't going to be sustainable as we go into the rest of the year?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, we're guiding to 3% growth in full-year 2018. We did have a little bit stronger Q4 in R&R. But keep in mind, a lot of our R&R business is up in Alaska, and that's going to be a little bit sluggish up in Alaska, we think, in 2018, again.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then the other question I had on the gross margin guidance, probably something sub 25% for the first couple of quarters and then go into 25%, maybe 25% plus in the back half of 2018. Is that the right way to think about it?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Directionally, yes.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt McCall from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning, Matt.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: So the new truss plants, the new lines, new millwork facilities, new door shops, additional salespeople, can you go through all the additions – and I know, I understand that it's in your longer term outlook and kind of the additions in 2017. Quantify maybe on a percent basis if you can the percent additions to both sales capacity and to physical capacity, and what does that look like in 2018? I guess I'm trying to get at – you outperformed starts, is that – are all the investments fully layered in, or we're going to see residual benefit as we move out in 2018? And how long do the benefits last that you're going to make in 2018?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, I'll let Chad talk to some of the specifics. He's got some exciting commentary about the individual things we're doing. I think broadly, we do have these feathering in as they come online. As you know, opening the doors doesn't equate to full production and full profitability. But, yes, absolutely, these are coming online, we'll get to that one year breakeven amount, and then they start contributing back, right? So, that means some of the things we did in 2017 are the things that are going to really move the needle in 2018 and on a go-forward basis. Rule of thumb, particularly on the manufacturing, the truss plants, $5 million to $7 million cost, $15 million to $20 million a year in revenue. So, you're generating EBITDA of about $2.5 million a year once they're up and running. Like you said, very nice for us, a nice contribution, but they're going to feather in over time.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. And so, we've got – we opened four new plants in 2017. Right now, we have scheduled to open three new truss plants in 2018. And then some of the efficiency gains are also in upgrading the existing plants, putting in automated lines, overhead laser projection. When you do all those things to a plant, you can add anywhere from 20%, 30%, 35% efficiency to those plants. So combined, there's a lot to get excited about in growing the value-added side of the business.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: So, thank you, Chad. So, Peter, earlier, you were asked about how you get to the high end, and you talked about the market assumptions that you were making there. What about the company's performance beyond the cycle? What kind of outgrowth assumptions do you have in your outlook for 2018, maybe compared to 2017 even?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well for 2018, what's included is the benefit of those value add product growth components. That's the biggest contributor. In the near-term, the effect of the investment and the effort of the team is going to be pretty modest on the bottom line. There is some benefit there but it's a lot offset in in the raw numbers. As we get into the out years as Chad was referring to that's where we start to see the outsized benefit of the operational excellence initiatives. The value add stuff, that's more of a cumulative snowball type of fact.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And there's – it's a good trade up. There's a little bit of cannibalization when you convert a builder for example from stick framing to trusses, but that's a trade we'll take all day long because it's a much higher margin for us.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Note that, it does represent share growth.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. So, said differently, maybe this year, there's not as much share growth in your assumptions? It comes in later years did I hear that correctly? Use kind of market growth as our guide?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think it's a solid place to start. There is consistent share growth year in year out, although, with the offsetting impact of cannibalization is probably fairly modest. What I was talking about in the out years is really around the operational excellence initiatives.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Oh. Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you all.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: There appears to be no other questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you for joining our call today. We look forward to updating you on the progress of our initiatives in the quarter ahead. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Jen Pasquino or Peter Jackson. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect.

Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter of 2017 earnings call. I will start with a brief update on our third quarter results and then turn the call over to Chad who will provide an update on our execution against our 2017 priorities, as well as our longer-term growth initiatives. Finally, Peter will discuss our financial results in more detail. After our closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions. Let's start on page 4. Our sales for the quarter were $1.9 billion. We had one fewer sales day in the third quarter of 2017 over the third quarter of 2016. Therefore, we'll discuss the sales per day growth in the quarter. We're very pleased that our sales per day in the quarter, excluding closed locations, grew 9.5% over 2016, and was benefited by approximately 6.9% as a result of the impact of commodity price inflation on our sales. Sales volume per day, excluding closed locations, grew approximately 4.7% in the new residential homebuilding end market and approximately 1.7% in the repair and remodel end market. Excluding Alaska, whose economy continues to be impacted by oil prices and drilling slowdown, our R&R growth in the lower 48 was up 4%. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma took their toll on Houston, Florida, and the Southeast region of the United States, where about 13% of our annual sales are concentrated. Thanks to our hardworking associates, we relatively quickly returned to full operation with only minimal physical damage to our locations. However, given that many of our stores in these regions were closed for several days during and after the storm, sales in the quarter were affected. And we estimate the storms impacted the company's sales by $18 million to $20 million and EBITDA by approximately $4 million. Now turning to slide 5, in the quarter, we continued to experience rapidly rising commodity prices. Framing lumber and sheet good prices increased 21.4% and 43.1% since 2016 year-end respectively, most of which occurred in Q3. Higher lumber prices are contributing to our sales. However, rapid price fluctuations caused some short-term growth profit margin compression. However, higher prices are good for our business in the long run. I'm pleased to report that our investments in manufacturing capacity are continuing to pay off with 8.4% growth of sales in manufactured products in the quarter faster than the volume growth in the single-family end market. Moving on to page 6 with an overview of the macro housing markets, the outlook for new residential housing market continues to be bright. We've reached approximately 1.2 million annual starts, with approximately 835,000 of those being single-family starts. This remains about 25% below the historic average, just growing now to levels we have historically seen in recessionary troughs. As a reminder, we are lapping strong single-family starts growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 of approximately 13% and are estimating mid-single-digit growth in the single family homebuilding market for the balance of 2017, bringing the full-year 2017 growth in the mid-to-high single-digit range. We believe there are still multiple years of growth ahead of us and are very confident in the continued strength of the housing market. I'll now turn it over to Chad who will discuss our 2017 priorities and our look at future growth.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning. Starting on page 7, I would like to share our progress against our 2017 priorities, including our increased focus on profitable market share expansion and improved operational efficiencies. We are still making significant new investments to drive our growth initiatives, including 110 net additional sales associates year-to-date. We are committed to these investments that will drive long-term results and plan to continue our sales force expansion initiatives. There remains significant opportunities to increase the reach and penetration of our higher-margin value-added products. Year-to-date, we have opened three new truss plants with plans to open additional locations later this year and into next. The demand for these products will continue to rise as homebuilders look for ways to build homes more efficiently, especially with the well-publicized labor shortages and extended lead times. We are also increasing our focus on implementing best practices across the organization in order to drive incremental operational efficiencies. Our logistics and back office automation initiatives are underway in our existing infrastructure, customer connectivity, and logistical capabilities should make these particularly rewarding investments. Our continued focus on cash generation will allow us to fund these initiatives as well as continue to deleverage the balance sheet. We generated $41 million of cash in the quarter, which is in line with our 2017 guidance of generating $145 million to $155 million of free cash flow and reducing our leverage ratio to 4 times by yearend. Finally, we are only as strong as our people and we are committed to continuing to attract, train and retain the best associates in the industry and develop our future leaders. Moving to page 8, we continue to build out our plans to accelerate growth and further expand profitability with the primary focus on creating long-term shareholder value. We believe that as the housing market returns to historical averages over the next four to six years, along with our focus on operational excellence and growing our value-added product categories, it will enable us to double 2016 EBITDA and cash flow, generate approximately $1 billion in cash over that time period and result in an EPS between $2 and $2.50. We have a strong platform that is well positioned to take advantage of accelerating growth and improved market conditions. On top of that, we are executing initiatives intended to expand profit margins and cash flow. We plan to continue to leverage our national manufacturing footprint and differentiated capabilities to grow our higher margin value-added products faster than the market over the next several years. In addition to growing our value-added products, we see opportunities to increasingly leverage our strength, including unparalleled size, geographic footprint and end market exposure to grow and capture market share. This growth model, coupled with unlocking the opportunities we have identified with our operational excellence initiatives such as distribution and logistics, pricing and margin management, back office efficiencies and system enhancements, provides opportunities for us to meaningfully accelerate profit growth. As a result of our focus on growth and operational efficiencies, we believe we have a realistic approach that creates cash generation and reinvestment opportunities. Our balanced approach to growth investments and ongoing debt reduction is designed to allow us to increase investment in organic and acquisitive growth, while achieving and maintaining our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times to 3.5 times EBITDA. Before I turn the call over to Peter, I would like to make a few comments related to the executive transition we announced in August. As you are aware, Floyd Sherman will be stepping down as CEO at the end of the year. Over his 16-year tenure at Builders, Floyd was instrumental in building the platform and business we currently have, turning adversity into opportunity, and positioning the business to take advantage of the growth potential we have today. I would like to thank Floyd for his contributions to Builders FirstSource, and I am pleased that he will remain as an employee advisor to the company through March 2019 and will also remain on our board as we execute the company's growth strategy in the coming years. I will now turn the call over to Peter who will review the financial results in more detail.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 10, I will first discuss the current quarter results and then touch briefly on our year-to-date results on page 11. As a reminder, we have included adjusted figures to normalize for one-time integration, closure and other costs. We had one less sales day in the third quarter of 2017 than prior year, so I will speak to our results on a sales per day basis. For the third quarter, we reported net sales of $1.9 billion, a 9.5% increase compared to the third quarter of 2016, excluding the impact of closed locations and including an estimated 6.9% benefit from commodity price inflation. We are pleased with the growth despite the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, given that many of our stores in these regions were closed for several days during and after the storms. We estimate that our sales volume grew approximately 4.6% in the single-family, new residential homebuilding end market and 1.7% in the repair and remodel end market with market-driven declines in multi-family and other. Our gross margin percentage was 24.4%, down approximately 60 basis points from 25% in the third quarter of 2016. The decrease on a year-over-year basis was largely attributable to the rapid run-up in commodity prices. Framing lumber and sheet good prices increased 9.8% and 25.7% in the third quarter, respectively. Rapid commodity inflation will cause short-term gross margin percentage compression when prices are rising and margin percentage expansion when prices are falling due to the short-term pricing commitments we provide our customers versus the volatility of the commodity markets. I expect that as commodity prices stabilize, the company will benefit from higher commodity prices, enhancing our go-forward profitability. Our SG&A percentage of sales decreased by 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The reduction was largely driven by cost leverage achieved while absorbing investments in growth initiatives, including additional sales associates and new facilities. Interest expense for the quarter was $33.8 million compared to adjusted interest expense of $39 million in 2016. The $5.2 million reduction was largely due to multiple transactions the company executed to lower our go-forward cash interest expense, to extend our maturity profile, and to address our capital structure. These transactions have reduced our annual cash interest expense by over $30 million annually and extended our weighted average long-term debt maturity. Adjusted income tax expense increased by $29 million compared to 2016, although the company does not expect to pay federal cash taxes in 2017, given its NOL carryforwards. Tax expense increased year-over-year as a result of the company no longer maintaining a full valuation allowance reserve against its deferred tax assets. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $45.5 million or $0.39 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of $69.2 million or 61% (sic) [$0.61] per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016. More than all of the reduction on a year-over-year basis can be attributed to the income tax expense issues I just discussed. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew $3.8 million to $122 million compared to prior year. Sales growth generated profit growth in the quarter offset by investments in growth initiatives and short-term commodity inflation impact on gross margins. Additionally, we estimated that the hurricanes negatively impacted EBITDA by about $4 million. Switching now to the year-to-date financial results, please turn to page 11. Year-to-date net sales were $5.3 billion, a 9.3% increase compared to year-to-date 2016, excluding the impact of closed locations. We estimate that our sales volume grew approximately 5.9% in the single-family new residential homebuilding end market and approximately 3.2% in the repair and remodel end market. Offset by declines in multi-family and other. Commodity price inflation benefited sales by an estimated 5.8%. Year-to-date gross margin percentage was 24.7%, a decrease of approximately 30 points from 2016. The decrease on a year-over-year basis was largely driven by gross profit margin compression on our commodity products due to inflation in the lumber and lumber sheet good markets. To reiterate, commodity inflation will generally benefit the company's operating results in the long term although it can cause short-term margin compression. Year-to-date SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased by 70 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The reduction was largely attributable to the decline in depreciation and amortization on acquired ProBuild assets and cost leverage realized. Adjusted net income was $100.6 million or $0.87 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of $75.8 million or $0.67 per diluted share year-to-date 2016. The 34% increase was largely driven by EBITDA growth, $21.7 million in interest expense savings, $16.1 million decline in depreciation and amortization related to ProBuild assets offset by previously discussed increase in income tax accruals. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA grew $25.5 million to $322.3 million compared to year-to-date 2016. The 8.5% year-over-year improvement was largely driven by sales growth again while absorbing the impacts and costs of commodity inflation, hurricanes in the period, and the investments we are making in growth initiatives that we have mentioned. Turning to page 12, we expect free cash flow generation will be used to drive down our debt in 2017. We believe this will be driven by EBITDA growth and a continued focus on working capital efficiency, which is estimated to run between 9% and 10% of incremental sales in the long term. We expect to invest in our business through capital expenditures at approximately 1% of sales. Upon further review with our tax planning team, we expect our current NOL tax assets to shelter us from paying federal cash taxes in 2017. As a result of the opportunistic capital markets transactions executed in the last year-and-a-half, cash interest should be reduced by approximately $130 million in 2017. We expect one-time ProBuild integration and conversion costs of approximately $20 million. And as a result, we are reconfirming our full-year cash flow guidance of approximately $145 million to $155 million, although perhaps more to the low end of the range. Our business typically uses cash in the first half of the year and generates cash in the second half of the year due to seasonal working capital needs. The company generated cash from operations and investing of $48.1 million in the third quarter. Due to seasonal working capital needs in the first quarter (sic) [first half], cash used in operations and investing was $50.9 million year-to-date. This was in line with our expectations and annual guidance of $145 million to $155 million in positive cash flow from operations and investing activities for the full year of 2017. We will utilize this cash to pay down debt and expect to reduce our leverage ratio to 4 times by year-end. Turning to page 13, total liquidity at September 30, 2017 was $769 million, consisting of net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand, which is more than sufficient for our operating needs. We have an extended debt maturity profile with no maturities until 2022 and a weighted average long-term debt maturity of 6.4 years. We are committed to further debt reduction, and the terms of our debt allow the company to repay our most expensive bonds first, benefiting future free cash flow. We have made progress on improving our leverage ratio. The net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a trailing 12-month basis as of September 30, 2017 was 4.6 times, a 0.7 times reduction from prior year, which is consistent with our focus on deleveraging the balance sheet and increasing cash flow and improving liquidity. I would like to update our 2017 guidance. As a reminder, higher lumber and sheet goods pricing is beneficial to our business in the long term, resulting in higher gross margin and EBITDA dollars. Commodity inflation can cause short-term gross margin percentage compression when prices are rising and margin percentage expansion when prices are falling due to the short-term pricing commitments we provide customers versus the volatility of the commodity market. However, commodity price inflation generally benefits the company's operating results in the long term, creating higher gross margin and EBITDA dollars. We expect benefit from higher commodity prices in the future and have not changed our long-term goal of doubling the 2016 EBITDA. We will not sacrifice our growth initiatives to short-term margin issues that will ultimately reverse, reconfirming our investment strategy in new facilities, and additional sales professionals. We expect sales growth in the fourth quarter to be up high-single digits on a sales per day basis over prior year with about half coming from volume and half from commodity inflation. Gross margin is expected to be relatively flat to Q3 as we continue to feel the short-term margin compression from the recent commodity hyperinflation. We will continue to focus on generating even more cost leverage, while not sacrificing investing on growth initiatives. Overall, we expect to see EBITDA growth of 5% to 10% and cash flow generation of approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter. Given the recent commodity inflation impacts on our business, we are pleased with these financial results. I will now turn the call back over to Chad for his closing comments.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Peter. I'm excited about the outlook for Builders FirstSource. We are continuing to leverage our scale and look for opportunities to grow the top line and profits. The new residential housing market continues to show strength, and we are continuing on the path of deleveraging our balance sheet, which we believe will give us flexibility to continue to fund our growth initiatives. We have laid out a plan to double EBITDA and cash flow and are excited about the prospects the future holds. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. And we can take our first question from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. And so first, I wanted to ask about the recovery of sales pace in the hurricane-affected areas. I think you laid out pretty well what happened in the third quarter. Where are we in terms of getting back to the kind of pre-event sales pace in Texas, Florida, and in the Southeast?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Our guys did an incredible job of bouncing back in both those areas that were impacted by the hurricanes, Nishu. I would say we're back to levels of where we were pre-hurricane. Obviously, we were shut down for probably on average about six days. And then, it was a little slow for a week or two after that, but so far it looks like we've returned to normal business levels.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And the importance of, obviously, your products in rebuilding efforts, would you anticipate some tailwind? Obviously, two pretty major events happening at the same time implies some significant rebuilding. As you look across your product portfolio, even what you've seen since the events, do you anticipate any benefit from that in 2018?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think it'll definitely be a net positive for us. I think we'll probably start seeing it in 2018. As you know, it will take a while for folks to get their insurance money. And in these markets, as there are in many markets, there's still the issue of labor shortages. But I do think we'll start seeing some bounce in 2018 and no doubt over the next couple of years, it will be a net positive for us.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And the second question was on the rising lumber prices, obviously pretty sharp, and I think you discussed that pretty well just the effects on the third quarter. My question was about the effect of the rising lumber and panel prices on the value proposition of your pre-fabricated products. As lumber prices rise, that obviously means that a larger percentage of – obviously the price would go up on the pre-fab products as well, how does that affect the value proposition as you're out there in the market relative to site framing?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, I think, you have increases on both sides. You see the increases from the labor shortages and the inflation on the labor side, as well as the inflation on the lumber side. I think it's a pretty balanced impact net-net. The overall desire of homebuilders to be more efficient, we think, outweighs it in the long run.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Mike Dahl with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Looking at some of the impact in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter around some of the growth investments, and I know you had outlined these earlier in the year, could you just give us an update on how these are rolling out and whether or not there have been incremental investments since the second quarter discussion?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So, this year, we've got about $7.5 million in total in the investments we've made in those growth areas, about almost $3 million in the third quarter of incremental year-on-year investment. Again, focused in those two areas of salespeople and value-added facility expansion, so the additional facilities that we've added. We feel like the progress has been very solid, very positive, and we're making progress in both those areas.
Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I guess what I should have asked is, the spend that we're seeing come through, does that represent additional opportunities that you've identified over the last few months, or is it simply more of a timing issue on the spend around some of the initial investments?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, I'll comment on the sales force growth. We're going to keep pushing that initiative. We think it's very important to recruit new people into our industry. It is an aging workforce, and we're going to push hard over the next couple years to develop the bench strength we need. And so we have no intentions of tapping the brakes on recruiting and training sales force, and that's probably the bulk of the cost that you're seeing as far as an investment standpoint. And then as Peter mentioned, the other large piece is the opening of new manufacturing facilities which we're obviously going to keep doing as well. So, I guess, the short answer to your question is no, not necessarily new opportunities that we've seen in the last few months. This was something we had planned for the year and this is something we're going to keep doing.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Just from a timing perspective it ramped up in earnest at the beginning of the third quarter last year, so you're seeing the lapping of that ramp up to the full load.
Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got it. My next question, understanding that, obviously, you've been dealing with a difficult environment in terms of some of the rapid moves in your inflation and that's causing some disruption in the profitability near term. Given what you're seeing today, I hear you on the fourth quarter commentary, as we look into early 2018, realistically when do you think we should see a return to more of the 25% type of gross margin range?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, I think as we look at the commodity movements always volatile, difficult to forecast, but based on where we are today I think we feel confident going into Q1 and Q2 we're going to see a nice recovery back to where we think are far more normal gross margin levels. Although it takes a little while to get fully back, but I think in that Q1, Q2 range we're feeling very good. We'd love higher commodity prices in the long run.
Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And next we can go to Trey Grooms with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, good morning.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning, Trey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: First off, I want to congratulate you, Floyd, on your retirement, it's been great working with you over the years and we wish you the best.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you. I appreciate it.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: And also, it's great working with you, Chad, as well. (30: 07)
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: It's also been great working with you guys.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: What's that, Trey?
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. Okay. I'll move on to questions. So I guess, first, I know lumbers, there's been a lot of attention there but just with the folks that you guys talk to, I mean, you've got your finger on the pulse of what's going on in the lumber industry as well as anybody, but also understanding that things happen and things move around, but just from where you sit today, what are your expectations as we kind of look into the next several months as it relates to lumber prices? Understanding, I mean, you don't have the crystal ball, but, you do – and as I said, you guys usually have as good a feel as anybody.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I'll jump in, and Floyd may want to add on, but I would say from the framing lumber standpoint, it feels pretty solid. I think, we're going to see prices hold pretty much where they are right now. I think, OSB and panels probably have some slack in it. They're pretty elevated and you may see a pullback on those. That's typically the most volatile of our commodity product categories as the OSB. But generally speaking, I think, we'll see some healthy lumber prices for most of 2018.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah, and I would agree with what Chad had to say.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Thanks for that. Appreciate it. And then also just kind of outside of lumber, as we're moving into next year, I know a lot of folks out there, manufacturers, are seeing inflation on their raws as well. And just – and there's price increases in the market and that sort of thing. But just outside of lumber, if you could just give us any thoughts around your expectations around the other things that you guys are providing to your customers, window and doors, drywall, et cetera. Just any color on directionally how we should be thinking about that.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think, in general, we'll probably – and we've already started discussions with suppliers. We'll probably see price increases next year on most of those product categories you mentioned in the 2% to 3% range.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: 2% to 3%. Okay. Great. And then lastly, I guess – and this is kind of, I guess, a little bit bigger picture, but – and maybe it's a little premature as well, but just with the discussions you're having with your customers kind of looking into next spring, and again, I know it's early, but just any initial thoughts or conversations you guys are having with the builders and your customers in the new res market this year and kind of looking into next year rather. And then the moving pieces there, specifically new single-family versus multi and then starter home versus move-ups, and how labor is ultimately playing a role, just any high-level color you could give us around some of those conversations and how they're going.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: It feels like the demand next year is still going to be strong. We still feel good about kind of that high single-digit growth in single-family. I think, it's going to be another rough year in multi-family. You're probably looking to multi-family down another 5% to 10% year-over-year, and I think R&R will be fairly steady, 3%, 4% growth. Labor will still be tight. Somehow, we've figured out ways to build more houses every year, So slowly we're figuring out the labor problem should play well into the – sort of, truss and panel side of the business next year as it has been. So, we feel good about it. We really haven't come off our forecast of kind of that high single-digit growth in single-family over the next few years.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Great. That's super helpful. And, again, congrats to both of you, and I'll pass it on. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Jay McCanless with Wedbush. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking my questions. And definitely I want to echo what Trey said for both Floyd and Chad. Great accomplishment for both you, guys.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, Jay.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: The first question I had, could you give me the breakout of the gross sales change for both R&R and single-family for the third quarter?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. So, we saw in the third quarter, on a sales per day, about 4.7% growth in single-family, down about almost 13% in multi-family, R&R about 1.7% up (34: 47) Alaska.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: But when you make the adjustment for Alaska, that brings our R&R in the rest of the 48 states in which we operate back to about a 4% increase.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Right.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: To a total volume growth up for about 2.5% (35: 10).
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: 2.5% on volume growth. Okay. That actually plays into my second question. Is there a certain level in terms of crude oil pricing we could watch for Alaska to get better? And if so, is there any type of lag, three-month, six-month lag from oil hitting a certain price and then Alaska starting to get better, that we can (35: 32) or price level where we can focus.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. That's a tough question, Jay. I don't know that we have the answer on what's kind of the trigger point on oil prices. I would think there would be some sort of lag. As you know, it takes a little bit of time to get the drilling activities ramped up again. But I don't have a good answer for you on that one. Sorry.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then the last question I had. And I apologize if I missed this, but the expenses as a percentage of sales, where do guys expect that for 4Q? And also maybe could you talk a little bit about how much you've invested in these salespeople thus far with this initiative, and what type of payback period you're expecting with it?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I'll attack your second part first and then let Peter address the first one. Year-to-date we're at about, I think it's about $6 million that we've invested in the sales force. Year-to-date it's about $5 million that we've invested in the sales force. So far, those guys in general are covering about half of their commission cost. So with some of them haven't been here all that long, we feel pretty good about that. So overall I think those guys are probably – well, they're certainly north of $150 million in sales they've generated, but 110 net new associates we feel pretty good about. And we certainly think it's worth the investment when you're looking out three, four years in the future of our business.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And then back on SG&A. We do anticipate seeing improved SG&A performance versus prior year and versus Q3. So our comp will continue to get better as we continue to leverage really the cost that we have in our fixed pool.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. A question also on SG&A. You've shown some really nice leverage this year really in all quarters and per your last comments in the fourth. As we turn to 2018, will that number continue to show leverage accelerate given that you've done some investments and picked up -what's your kind of rough view for 2018?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. So I would say generally we have seen positive leverage. We will continue to see positive leverage. Some of the benefits we've seen is related to the commodity price. That's mathematically true, but we also anticipate in the long run to see leverage from our incremental sales at a roughly 70% rate. So we do expect to see – it's about 70% variable on SG&A. So we expect to see leverage there. And part of our long-term strategy as we drive the business forward is really focused around operational initiatives to help us increase efficiency and improve that leverage over time. So, yes.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And on the long-term plan that you highlighted last call, we have a slide on it today. Can you give us a few of the underlying metrics in terms of getting to the EPS numbers such as D&A, interest expense, share count, things like that, so we can work down from EBITDA to your $2.00 to $2.50 in EPS.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. We're not ready to break down those components for you yet. We're at the point right now of working through the specific initiatives that are going to drive the key points here. We've got some models internally, but over the next few quarters, we'll start giving you more details about what we're thinking we're going to work towards. We could talk a little bit more about some of the initiatives we've got going but not ready to break down those components yet.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to John Baugh with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Floyd, a distinguished career. Enjoy retirement.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, John.
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Questions. I think there was a reference that the commodity was the primary influence on gross margin, and I don't recall if that was Q3 or year-to-date or both maybe. Could you discuss the pluses and minuses, which I get net to a slight drag, of the other influences on gross margin for the quarter and/or year-to-date?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, the major items that you'll see in the numbers is with the growth being so quick on the lumber side, there's a mix component, the Lumber & Sheet Goods side. So that's a important part. We've also talked a little bit about the impact of the less sales per day, so that was a slight headwind; the hurricanes, obviously, another headwind; and the investments we made, we think were important investments in terms of the growth of the business on a go-forward basis. Those are those two main things we've talked about in terms of expanding the sales force and expanding our value-added footprint.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And I'll just add, the window plant being shut down in Houston was a decent drag on our Window category in the quarter as well, which is one of higher margin.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, and in addition to the Window plant in Houston, we have a very, very large millwork presence in Houston. That was really impacted by the hurricane. We, unfortunately, got caught in a real high water area. And so we lost considerable days in the Houston millwork operation. And that was also true in Florida, our millwork operations were really impacted. It took a while to get back. As you know, in Florida, the main issue we faced was a loss of power. But as Chad said earlier, we're now back running full steam. We're back on normal track and things looked very good in October from my point of view.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And I...
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I'm very, very pleased with what I see.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. Floyd's comments really underscore the business' ability to overcome those unexpected events and really show both sales growth and profit growth in a very disruptive quarter.
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Obviously a lot of moving parts in Q3. I guess, kind of furthering that question, assuming we don't have disruptions like this in the future and assuming lumber settles down, would the mix shift to pre-fab or manufactured components allow gross margins, everything being equal, to go up or are there other influences that may get in the way of that?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, over time, the improved profitability of manufactured components will absolutely improve our mix over time. We see a significant margin trade-up on any movement towards manufactured products, absolutely.
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just to put it in context, 110 sales people net additional, what's the gross number of sales people today?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: We had about 1,700 at the beginning of the year, outside sales force.
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then my final question is simply any guide on the future ProBuild D&A numbers or percentages changes?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: We're pretty well rolled out of that this quarter. There is a modest decline in the future, but we're through the bulk of it now.
John Allen Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Good luck.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Matt McCall with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Morning, Matt.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Morning.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Now, I'll add my congratulations to both you guys. Well done, Floyd, and look forward to many years, Chad. So I guess I'm going to follow up on a few of these just to make sure I understand. Peter, did you say that we should view your SG&A as 70% variable and that's kind of the way to look at the leverage opportunity?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: As an internal rule of thumb, that's generally what we use. Obviously, that's modified by significant initiatives and investments, but, yeah, as an operating rule of thumb.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. That's kind of where I was going with it. So you've got the sales adds, the new locations, and you quantify this year I think $5 million or $6 million incremental spend. So is that the way to kind of look at it? We've got the 70% that's variable, and we got to add in the components like these growth initiatives to get to kind of a true number so that that fixed component is kind of growing. Is that the way to look at it?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. We think that's a reasonable approach to model it.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. And, Chad, you said I think to John's question you added 110 sales people to your 1,700 sales people base, and it sounds like that's going to continue. So as we kind of look out and model 2018, is the expectation something similar next year from a total spend perspective? I assume was that $5 million just the salespeople?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Correct.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. And so is that a good way to think about next year? You said you're going to continue to invest. You think that's still a good opportunity?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I think so, $5 million to $6 million probably next year.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. And then how many – you talked about new locations. What's been the – sorry, if I missed it, but what's been the total addition to-date in locations and how should we think about that looking out to 2018?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, this year we've opened three new truss plants, and we've got three more slated for the back half of this year and into next year, obviously still working on some budgeting for next year. And also we've invested in some of the equipment in those truss plants and other truss plants as well to increase the productivity and the efficiencies. So that's always been our focus, and we will continue to focus on the manufacturing side of the business. So, no, I would say over the next few years, you're probably looking at something similar, three to four new plants a year
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Three to four new. I'm assuming that goes – it's the cost of goods line. Have you talked about the total investment this year and the way we should think about that?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, certainly, the manufacturing facilities do have a higher component of COGS, but you also have incremental SG&A with that when it comes to the management and drivers and the delivery cost of those facilities are down in SG&A.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. Any quantification similar to that $5 million to $6 million that we talked about for people, for the sales force?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Year-to-date, I think it's about $2 million to $3 million, so probably $3 million to $4 million on an annual basis.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you. And then, last question I had. The outlook you gave from kind of an end market perspective, R&R, single family, multi-family, that was helpful. The question I have is really on R&R. To Floyd's point, Alaska had a bit of a drag. How should we think about all-in? So you said 3% to 4% growth to R&R next year. Maybe that was – was that a market comment and you guys are going to see a little bit of pressure because of the exposure to Alaska or was that kind of an adjusted number?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think we'll probably still see some drag to that number due to Alaska next year
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you, all.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. All right. And it appears we have no further questions at this time. Mr. Sherman, I can turn it back to you for any closing remarks.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. I feel very, very excited about the future that we have before us for this company. I'm very excited about what Chad, Peter, the rest of the team are going to be producing in the years ahead, and I can tell you since I am a shareholder and will remain a shareholder, I'm going to be really looking closely to make sure that we deliver on the promise that I know that's in front of us. And I'd like to thank all of you for joining the call today. And since this will be my last earnings call before handing in over the reign to Chad, I'd like to express my sincere appreciation to all of the investing community who have supported us throughout the years. In addition, I'd like to extend my appreciation to all of our associates who've helped us build a great organization, and I'm very pleased with what we have built and look forward to seeing the progress over the coming years. And thank you and have a great finish to the week.
Operator: And this does conclude today's call. Thank you, everyone, for your participation. You may disconnect at anytime and have a great day.

Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2017 earnings call. I will start with a brief update on our Q2 results and then turn the call over to Chad, who will provide an update on our 2017 priorities, as well as our longer-term growth initiatives. Finally, Peter will discuss our financial results in more detail. And after my closing comments regarding our outlook, we will take your questions. Let's begin our discussion on page five. I am very pleased with our sales growth in the quarter and year-to-date, both up 10%. Sales in the first half of 2017, excluding closed locations grew 10.1% over the first half of 2016. Our enhanced focus on investment and targeted growth is really, as expected, starting to yield results. Year-to-date, sales volume excluding closed locations and commodity inflation grew approximately 7.4% in the single-family new residential homebuilding end market, in line with the starts growth as reported by the Census Bureau. Additionally, year-to-date sales in the repair and remodel end market increased over prior year by 5.1%. Commodity price inflation benefited our year-to-date sales by approximately 5%. Demand continues to grow in the industry for ways to build homes more efficiently as labor constraints and rising costs increasingly impact our homebuilding customers. Our value-added products address this need, providing products that are constructed offsite, reducing the home cycle time and require significantly less labor on the job site. We believe this is a significant growth opportunity for us and that we are well positioned to drive and one of our key growth priorities for 2017 and beyond. Our sales of value-added products, including manufactured products, windows, doors and millwork for the first half grew 9.6% versus 2016, almost double our total commodity adjusted volume growth. The investments we are making at our manufacturing facilities are really paying off with sales of our manufactured products growing 12.2% year-to-date. We'll continue to focus on growing our value-added products faster than our total sales and future investments for growth will target the higher margin value-added offerings to our customers. Moving on to page six with an overview of the macro housing markets, the new residential housing market has reached approximately 1.2 million annual starts, which includes a bit over 800,000 single-family starts. This remains well below the historic average, just growing now to levels we have historically seen in recessionary troughs. We believe there are still multiple years of growth ahead of us and we are estimating mid to high-single-digit growth in the single-family homebuilding market for the full-year 2017. Additionally, we believe the repair and remodeling market will continue to grow in the low-single-digit range. The housing market growth provides a solid foundation for our investments and above-market growth expectations. I'll now turn it over to Chad, who will discuss our 2017 priorities and our look at future growth.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning, everyone. Starting on page seven, I would like to share our progress against our 2017 priorities, including our increased focus on profitable market share expansion and improved operational efficiencies. We had a strong first half of the year relative to growth in single-family starts. We are making significant new investments to drive our growth initiatives, including 73 additional sales associates in the quarter and 105 year-to-date. While these investments take a little time to pay off, we are already beginning to see their impact. We believe we have significant opportunities to increase the reach and penetration of our higher margin value-added products. These products allow manufacturing and assembly of homebuilding materials off the job site, aiding builders with the well-publicized labor shortages and extended lead times. Growth in total value products year-to-date was 9.6% over 2016, led by growth in our manufactured products of over 12%, which is almost double the growth rate of our total commodity-adjusted sales volume. Three new component plants came online in Q2, expanding our product portfolio and reach of these value-added products in growing markets. We are also increasing our focus on implementing best practices across the organization in order to drive incremental operational efficiencies. Our initial focus is on logistics, back office automation and using technology to improve integration with and service to our customers. As an example, we have developed implementation plans on a delivery and dispatch management system that we will begin deploying in the coming months. This system will enable us to optimize delivery routes, reduce yard and delivery cost and better serve our customers. We are excited about the efficiencies these projects will unlock across our business. Our continued focus on cash generation will allow us to fund these initiatives, as well as to continue to deleverage the balance sheet. We generated $47 million of cash in the quarter, which is in line with our 2017 guidance of generating $145 million to $155 million of free cash flow and reducing our leverage ratio to below 4 times by year-end. Finally, we are only as strong as our people and we are committed to continue to attract and retain the best associates in the industry and develop future leaders. Moving to page eight, I want to share our plans on leveraging our strengths to accelerate growth and further expand profitability. With the benefit of these initiatives, plus a return of the market to a normalized 1.1 million single-family housing start environment over the next four to six years, we would expect to double 2016 EBITDA and cash flow, and generate up to $1 billion in cash over this time period, resulting in an EPS of over $2 per share. We have a strong core business that is well positioned to take advantage of accelerating growth and improved market conditions. On top of that, we have significant initiatives that are designed to expand profit margins and cash flow. We plan to build on the momentum we have established with our 2017 priorities and continue to leverage our national manufacturing footprint and differentiated capabilities to grow our higher margin value-added products faster than the market over the next several years. In addition to growing our value-added products, we see opportunities to increasingly leverage our strengths, including unparalleled size, geographic footprint and end market exposure to grow faster than the single-family starts and capture share. This organic growth model, coupled with unlocking the opportunities we have identified with our operational excellence initiatives, such as distribution and logistics, pricing and margin management, back office efficiencies and system enhancements, provides opportunities for us to meaningfully accelerate profit growth. As a result of our focus on growth and operational efficiencies, we believe we have a realistic approach that creates cash generation and reinvestment opportunities. Our balanced approach to growth investment and ongoing debt reduction will allow us to increase investment in organic and acquisitive growth, while achieving and maintaining our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times to 3.5 times EBITDA. We look forward to sharing our progress with you over the coming years. I will now turn the call over to Peter who will review our financial results in more detail.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. I will first discuss the current-quarter results on page 10, and then touch briefly on our year-to-date results on page 11. As a reminder, we have included adjusted figures to normalize for one-time integration, closure, and other costs. For the second quarter, we reported net sales of $1.8 billion, a 10.1% increase compared to the second quarter of 2016, excluding the impact of closed locations and including an estimated 6.1% benefit from commodity price inflation. We estimate that our sales volume grew approximately 7.4% in the single-family new residential homebuilding end market, and approximately 2% in the repair and remodel end market, offset by a decline in multi-family and other. Our gross margin percentage was 25%, up approximately 10 basis points from 24.9% in the second quarter of 2016. The increase on a year-over-year basis was largely attributable to procurement savings, offset by the recent commodity price inflation, which negatively impacted our margins by about 35 basis points. We completed negotiations with our suppliers to realize procurement savings to offset this drag on gross margins. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased by 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The reduction was largely attributable to the decline in depreciation and amortization on acquired ProBuild assets, offset by investments the company made in growth initiatives, including sales associates and new facilities. Interest expense for the quarter was $33.7 million compared to adjusted interest expense of $41.1 million in 2016. The $7.4 million reduction was largely due to multiple transactions the company executed to lower our go-forward cash interest expense, to extend our maturity profile and address our capital structure. These transactions have reduced our annual cash interest expense by over $30 million annually and extend our weighted average long-term debt maturity. Adjusted income tax expense decreased by $0.5 million compared to 2016. The decreases in effective rate can largely by attributable to tax planning initiatives to reduce our state cash taxes and utilize our state NOLs going forward. Adjusted net income was $43 million or $0.37 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of $20.9 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew $7.2 million to $124 million compared to prior year. The 6.2% year-over-year improvement was largely driven by sales increases and was in line with our guidance. Switching now to the financial results for the first half of 2017, please turn to page 11. Net sales for the first half of 2017 were $3.4 billion, a 10.1% increase compared to the first half of 2016, excluding the impact of closed locations. We estimate that our sales volume grew approximately 7.4% in the single-family new residential homebuilding end market and approximately 5.1% in the repair and remodel end market, offset by declines in multi-family and other. Commodity price inflation benefited sales by an estimated 5.1%. Gross margin percentage for the first half was 24.8%, a decrease of approximately 20 points from 2016. The decrease on a year-over-year basis was largely driven by gross profit margin compression on our commodity products, due to inflation in the lumber and lumber sheet goods markets during the first half, mitigated by procurement savings. Commodity inflation can cause short-term gross margin percentage compression when prices are rising and margin percentage expansion when prices are falling, due to the short-term pricing commitments we provide customers versus the volatility of the commodity market. However, commodity price inflation generally benefits the company's operating results in the long term, creating higher gross margin and EBITDA dollars. Our first half SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased by 90 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The reduction was largely attributable to the decline in depreciation and amortization on acquired ProBuild assets and cost savings realized. First half adjusted net income was $55.1 million or $0.48 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of $6.8 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the first half of 2016. The 710% increase was largely driven by $16.5 million in interest expense savings, $13.5 million in depreciation and amortization related to ProBuild assets, and the balance primarily related to net sales growth over prior year. First half adjusted EBITDA grew $21.6 million to $200.1 million compared to the first half of 2016. The year-over-year improvement was largely driven by net sales growth. Turning to page 12, we expect free cash flow generation will give us the opportunity to further reduce debt in 2017. We believe this will be driven by EBITDA growth and a focus on working capital efficiency, which is estimated to run between 9% and 10% of incremental sales. We expect to invest in our business through capital expenditures at approximately 1.2% of sales. We expect our current NOL tax assets to shelter us from paying federal cash taxes in 2017, assuming no material changes in our shareholder base or the taxes (16:46). As a result of the opportunistic capital markets transactions executed over the last year and a half, cash interest should be reduced to approximately $130 million in 2017. We expect one-time ProBuild integration and conversion costs of approximately $20 million. As a result, we expect to generate approximately $145 million to $155 million in cash flow for the full-year 2017. Our business typically uses cash in the first half and generates cash in the second half of the year, due to seasonal working capital needs. The company generated cash from operations and investing of $46.9 million in the quarter. Due to seasonal working capital needs in the first quarter, cash used in operations and investing was $98.9 million year-to-date. This was in line with our expectations and annual guidance of $145 million to $155 million in positive cash flow from operations and investing activities for the full-year 2017. Turning to page 13; total liquidity at June 30, 2017 was $723 million, consisting of net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand, which is more than sufficient for our operating needs. We have an extended debt maturity profile with no maturities until 2022 and a weighted average long-term debt maturity of 6.6 years. We are committed to further debt reduction, and the terms of our debt allow the company to repay our most expensive bonds first, benefiting future free cash flow. We have made progress on improving our leverage ratio. The net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio on a trailing 12-month basis as of June 30, 2017 was 4.8 times, a 0.5 times reduction from prior year, which is consistent with our focus on deleveraging the balance sheet and increasing cash flow and improving liquidity. I would also like to provide color on the second half of 2017, as well as how we are currently thinking about full year. We expect sales growth in the second half to be roughly in line with the first half, 9% to 10% over prior year, with about half coming from volume and half from commodity inflation. Our market growth assumptions for the second half are consistent with our previous discussions around full year, including mid to high single-digit growth in single-family starts, low single-digit growth in repair and remodeling, and continued declines in the multi-family and other markets. We expect gross margin in the second half to be flat to up slightly versus prior year. This would translate to an estimated EBITDA growth of 17% to 23% year-over-year and in the range of our normalized sales-to-EBITDA conversion rate. Full year, this would result in EBITDA growth between 15% and 18% year-over-year, driven by 9% to 10% sales growth. Additionally, we are reaffirming our previous cash flow guidance of $145 million to $155 million of cash generation from operations and investing. I'll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Peter. Turning to our outlook, I remain enthusiastic about the future of our company. The continued strength in the fundamentals of the new residential housing market, our emphasis on profitable revenue and share expansion, as well as our investments in key markets position us exceptionally well for the continued growth and accelerating value creation. I'm excited and optimistic that the strategies and investments we have underway to grow our value-added business and unlock savings through our operational excellence initiatives will yield meaningful profit growth in the coming years. Our goal is to double our EBITDA and cash flow, generate more than $1 billion in cumulative cash over the four to six years, which should result in an EPS of over $2 a share, assuming the housing market continues its solid trajectory towards a normalized start level. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: First of all, wanted to talk about the long-term targets that you were laying out, really great to be getting back to that kind of a discussion. So I was wondering if you could lay out the kind of assumptions there. Obviously, the volume you laid out, the pricing with the volatility, especially in the lumber market, wanted to get your sense there. And also the cash flow and the EBITDA doubling, it seems to imply a lot more than $2 in EPS, so yeah, just wanted to get your general thoughts around that, please.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I'll start out trying to attack that. The general assumptions are we continue with the housing recovery like we've seen the last couple of years. Somewhere around 7%, 8% growth in single-family housing each year should put us back to around 1.1 million single-family starts in somewhere around the five-year timeframe. And that includes what I feel like is a very reasonable conversion rate on EBITDA to within the range we've always talked about of 12% to 15%. And then on top of that, these operational excellence initiatives, I really feel like we can squeeze a lot of cost out of the business. As we've talked about in the past, the business has grown so much since the ProBuild acquisition that just small improvements can result in meaningful savings. It's the concept of the aggregation of marginal gains, right? Look for a 1% improvement in everything you do, and over time those aggregates have really significant changes. And so that's really our approach to driving the efficiencies in this business. So those are the general assumptions around how we get to those numbers we stated. And you're right, you do the math, and you will get something quite a bit higher than $2 a share. As far as lumber goes and I'm not going to try to guess where lumber will be in five years, but I've got think if we're back in that 1 million, 1.1 million single-family starts range, we're going to be pretty happy with where lumber prices are. But in the near term, we have seen a little bit of run up in lumber, since the end of June with the forest fires, but prices are still just kind of where they were when the run-up peaked a couple of weeks ago or a couple of months ago. We love where lumber prices are right now. I feel like we've certainly weathered the worse of the storm from a gross margin compression standpoint in Q2 and we should really start seeing some nice benefits from lumber in the back half of this year. So we've all been waiting years to have lumber prices where they are today and we're excited about it. I don't know if I did all your questions or not.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No. No. That's very helpful. Sorry. I've got a lot in there. But on lumber prices, there's been, call it, a two-headed spike in lumber price this year, so they've gone up in of the cross border action and then some relief and then obviously a run up again. I think folks might have anticipated more of an effect in the second quarter of the second bit of a run up. But they're really – there seem to be obviously less than the folks are expecting. You cited procurement initiatives being a main source of kind of offsetting that. I was wondering if you can take us through that a little bit and how that helped you offset it, obviously very positive. So just want a little bit more color on that please.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. So this is Peter. We definitely did see some headwinds from the commodity inflation as we expected. But as you mentioned, it was more than offset by our procurement actions. We were involved in and aggressively pursued and closed out some procurement rebate programs that really did benefit us as well as we were able to make some timely lumber buys. So we feel really good about that performance in the second quarter.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And I'll add our guys did a nice job of getting prices pushed through in the second quarter, and so it's a combination of those two things.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, and another factor too, the – our rebates are better on our value-add products and we certainly accelerated the sales in those categories in Q2, and we're going to continue driving that side of the business. And we're benefiting and it comes about in many ways, it comes about in improved margins, which are helped by improved rebates that we get on the products that make up that product group.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And the final one, we're now a year past the point when we started talking about the shift from the internal focus back to regrowth of sales or a focus on sales. Just wondering if you could just give us an update on that, where you feel you are in that? Obviously, your metrics are in line with the market growth, which is great to see. Is there further to go there? Could you return to a position of submarket gains or are you happy with where the initiatives are taking you today?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, I think we're pretty happy with the second quarter sales growth. We're never happy enough, right? There's always – we always want more. There's no doubt the distractions of the integration were real a year ago. They're minimal now, I mean, almost non-existent. Our guys have really done a good job of refocusing their efforts on growing their markets. We're still looking at some of the initiatives that we're laying out, are still designed to take some of the administrative burden off our guys in the field and either eliminate it through technology or maybe centralize some of it to corporate, just to give those guys more of an opportunity to get out there and sell. But the short answer to your question is those distractions are behind us and we feel good about the growth we're seeing.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Dahl from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just had a couple of follow-ups around some of the long-term goals. And first specifically, how do you envision manufactured products and other value-add product mix as a percentage of your overall sales as you get to those longer-term targets? Because I think you're back up to 37% year-to-date, and actually just especially curious on the manufactured product side.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. So, we have looked at this number. Historically, Builders, prior to the purchase of ProBuild, was up about 50% of the business was value-add. So, when we combined the two entities, it dropped to relatively close to where you see it now. We've seen some increases in that number in the high 30%s. So, our drive is definitely to get back towards that 50% number. There's no limit on how far we could take it. But it does take time to grow that business, and that is absolutely a key part of our strategy moving forward for the improved profitability, to improve gross margin, and for the value that it provides our customer base.
Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And as part of that, when you think about your portfolio of the manufactured products and obviously a need to help Builders address some of the constraints that exist in the labor market, how much thought have you given to further expansion into other adjacencies or even more revolutionary aspects within manufactured products over the next couple of years, and any color you can give us on other things you're thinking about there?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: We think about those questions a lot because I have no doubt that is a trend we will continue to see. Builders are constantly looking for ways to build more efficiently. And with our size and scale, there's no reason we can't be a number one partner with those guys and coming up with strategies to do that. Over the next year or two, to be candid, our focus is going to primarily be on these platforms we've laid out, which is probably going to not include acquisitions. I think as we get our leverage down to where we want it, there's going to be real opportunities for us through acquisitions to possibly expand into some of those different avenues that you've laid out. I think in the next year or two, it's largely going to be continue what we've been doing with the expansion of our truss and panel plants in the markets where we have holds and coverage. But longer term, yes, the strategy is to look for some of those opportunities which could be through acquisition, I think through acquisition would make more sense if you wanted to do something transformational.
Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Rygiel from FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Thank you. Nice quarter, gentlemen.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Just a quick question. The three new component plants that became operational in 2Q, can you give us a ballpark of what the revenue capacity is of these and/or the timeline for full utilization?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. The five plants that we have scheduled to go in this year, we really just got three of them, have just really gotten started on a production basis. We start manning them up in the second quarter, hiring the required estimators, designers, the management staff for the plants. The other two will be initiated in the back half of end of the third and fourth quarters. Those plants really are not going to be producing what I will say will be meaningful sales during the balance of the year. But I think once they are up and fully operating, I think all of those plants will produce in excess of $12 million to $15 million a year per plant. Some of the plants will ultimately turn out a higher sales number than that. But I think for the coming year, that's what we're going to be looking for. We got off to a very good start in the three plants, really ran into no unanticipated issues. The training has gone extremely well. Our people are in place. So, I am very, very pleased and optimistic with what those plants are going to be producing for us towards the back half of the year and into mainly 2018. This will give us – right now, we are operating 56 truss plants and 13 panel plants. So, we'll be getting a nice increase in that number. We're going to have more plants on the CapEx list for next year, and we're going to continue expanding this business and probably increasing our plant count by 10% to 15% a year as we look forward. We think this is an extremely attractive proposition to the builder right now; it's very readily accepted, both single-family and multi-family. The truss plants also give us an entry – a solid entry into the multi-family product arena with our installed millwork capabilities and that's where our concentration is going to be. And we think we can greatly expand our presence in the multi-family market, even though the multi-family market is contracting somewhat from the levels that we saw last year. It still provides us a very healthy environment that we can compete in. So, we're very excited about this side of the business. We do offer a, what we call, our better – the better framing system, but our first alternative is to drive our panel sales. That is really the best cost proposition to the builder and that's what we lead with. So those are what we're going to be really focusing, these areas on manufactured products is where our focus is going to be. And I will add, not only in the truss and panel area but also millwork operations. We added and started a new millwork operation in the second quarter and we're going to be looking to expand our presence in the millwork area.
Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: And to follow-up on that, you added 73 sales people in the second quarter, 105 year-to-date. What's your full year plan this year? And how should we think about the need to add sales capacity to achieve some of your four to six-year goals that you've laid out?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: We're going to keep pushing hard with our new salesman program. We have added 105 year-to-date, over 200 since the program started, and we've generated almost $150 million of incremental sales through that program, so definitely seeing some positive results there. Right now, we have no desire to stop. The boots on the ground is how you go out and drive business and I think we've got to continue to recruit young talent into this industry, get them excited, get them trained up, because they will be a big part of getting us to those goals we laid out.
Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Hey, good morning.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: I wanted to ask a quick follow-up question on the sales add (36:16). How long does it typically take for the productivity of a new salesperson to ramp up?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: These guys will typically go through six month training program, they'll go through and they'll learn all aspects of the business, they'll ride with truck drivers, they'll work in door shops, they'll do it all to really get a good understanding of what it takes to serve our customers. Then, beyond that, it's probably to give somebody fully where you want them, it's probably a two to three-year process, but I'll tell you right now, these guys that we've hired and we track them closely, they've become about 50% productive already. So that means they're covering about 50% of their margin and they're growing their business like what we want them to. So, usually, the first six months is slower because they're in training. We're seeing them get about 50% productivity after a year. And then it's another year or so before they're really up and running.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. (37:17) really having a sensible investment. But – and then I guess just shifting gears a little bit looking at sales volumes in R&R. I guess that 2% is consistent with the low-single digits that you called out for the full year, but was there anything unusual in the quarter and do you think there's an opportunity to may be accelerate growth, particularly in that R&R end market?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, the biggest drag there is Alaska. That's where we do a lot of our R&R growth and a lot of R&R business. And as you know, that economy is very dependent on the oil industry and government spending and that's one of our slower markets right now. If you pull Alaska out of the R&R calculation, we're actually up over 4%. So that's really just the Alaska slowness that you're seeing there.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. Okay. And then I guess just last question. I wanted to see if you wanted to add any kind of prognostication about lumber prices here?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I'll give you my thoughts. I think the little run up we've seen the last few weeks was more emotional than anything with the fires. If you look at the amount of supply that was actually impacted, I've seen numbers as low as half a percent of the supply was impacted by the fires. I would expect to see prices probably trickle down a bit the balance of the year somewhere between as far as framing lumber composite maybe drift down into that $4.10, $4.15 range from where it is now. But don't really expect any significant volatility. You have any different opinion, Floyd?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: No. I think that pretty much reflects what – the opinion that I have plus within our lumber buying group and so forth.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Baugh from Stifel. Please go ahead.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, Floyd, Chad, Peter, Jennifer and the whole Builders FirstSource team. Thanks for taking my questions.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, John.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, can you give us a frame of – how many salespeople do you have? So, what is the base number?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: We have actively, what I will say is a true field sales people, 750 to 800, and then the – and then we have, in addition to that, there's several hundred more that operate in a capacity, both field sales and back office.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Super. Thank you. And then when do we lap or have we already lapped the closed locations, or is that something that we'll see a trickle continue?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: There'll always be a trickle. We're constantly evaluating the profitability of our locations, and it's not going to be a meaningful number going forward, I wouldn't think. But we could – you could see closing one or two facilities a year. Those would probably be some in the smaller, more rural markets.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Super. And then help us with the D&A piece on ProBuild and the influence on SG&A and the sort of out quarters for the rest of 2017 and then 2018.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. So, the initial markup or fair value adjustment when we did the acquisition of ProBuild, that last about a year. So, we're seeing an inflated amount of D&A for that short-term period. It's probably – we're probably looking to add a $25 million per quarter on a go-forward basis, more or less.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And that's a total D&A number, Peter, quarterly for the company sort of going into 2018?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Correct.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Super. And then lastly, just another little – the other bucket for revenue. I think it was a decline of $13 million either in the quarter or year-to-date, I can't remember. Refresh us on that and what that is and what that does going forward.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. So that's actually the same answer to Chad had just given on Alaska. That's really the big bucket there.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay. All right. And as we think about this working capital number that you alluded to, I think it was 9% to 10%. Is that something that kind of goes both ways? Obviously, we're in a growth mode now. But trying to think about a possible recession at some point, hopefully in the distant future, do we see that same kind of flow through the other way?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Absolutely.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Super. Thanks.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Both ways.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Thanks. Good luck.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay McCanless from Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Just wanted to ask on SG&A with the additional people that you're bringing on. Can you maybe give us what the baseline on a quarterly run rate is going to be for SG&A now and then how much, as you guys add more people in the back half of the year, we should expect that to move up?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, I guess broadly speaking we believe that our SG&A in the second half of the year should continue to show improvement versus prior year. The investments that we've made in that sales force are just the – probably the biggest part of the conversation, started in the back half of last year. In all seriousness, that was when it really started to ramp up. So, you're starting to look at the lapping on a year-over-year basis. So that should settle it down a little bit. But we believe in these investments. We think they're very valuable to us and we continue – we are intending to continue to support them on a go-forward basis.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. It could run $6 million a year or so but keep in mind, as these guys become more and more productive then – there'd still be an SG&A, right? But they'll be generating a lot more margin dollars so the net profitability should be a positive impact.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. The second question I had is with multi-family, is the contraction there just a function of what's happening in the market or are you guys purposely walking away from some jobs because you're seeing a profit squeeze or something along those lines?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I'd say it's more market-driven. As Floyd mentioned earlier, we're trying to accelerate our participation in the multi-family market when it comes to trusses and panels.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then the last question I had, if we get to 2018, lumber prices stay around where they are and kind of hold that level through the year. Are you guys going to be able to get your traditional markup on that or is a flat lumber market going to be maybe a little – maybe weigh a little bit on adjusted EBITDA growth and revenue growth?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I would anticipate we'll be able to get a normal pricing off of that.
Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: All right. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning, Trey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: The ProBuild $20 million conversion and integration costs scheduled for 2017, and you may have mentioned this, but if I missed it I'm sorry, what are you guys budgeting for next year on that just as we kind of think about free cash for next year?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. So, we're looking at probably about $10 million roughly, basically really focused on the remaining ERP conversions, just maintaining that pace until we're done with those in 2019.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And again, I may have missed this, but the panel plant – excuse me, the components plant that you guys are bringing on this year, what's the investment on those there? I mean, you talked about some of the revs per plant per year. I may have missed the cost there, CapEx associated with that.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: All in, it's usually somewhere around $5 million and that's leasing the facility. Obviously, that's not buying the property.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: $5 million per plant?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Per. Yes.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then, Floyd, last quarter I think it was when you mentioned you were – I guess as we kind of look through the year and the recovery, especially with the single-family housing, you mentioned that you thought labor constraints might be one of the things that could potentially hold back starts in the busy summer months. Are you seeing that? I mean, your results definitely wouldn't suggest that that's much of an issue for you. I mean, so what – has that shaken out better than what you would've expected kind of going into it, and is that labor situation looking better in your eyes?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: No. I can't say it's looking any better. I can't say it's looking any worse. I think, Trey, we seem to keep finding ways to solve our problems and I still believe it is – it's certainly is holding back the start rate. But we really like at least the consistency that we're seeing in the starts. They're staying pretty much right where we had projected them to be. So, the industry, as well as people like ourselves, we keep – we're finding solutions to the problem. And I think we're going to continue to find those solutions and hopefully, we're going to be able to accelerate and I think we've demonstrated, we're showing that we're solving problems and accelerating our sales faster than others in the business. So, I'm still very, very optimistic about what I see on a go-forward basis. And I think we're going to keep seeing a consistent improvement in our business as well as an improvement in the housing start rate.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: All right. Well, thanks for your color there. Always appreciate it and good luck, guys and gals.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Okay.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Some questions on the long-term view you gave. I assume you talked about doubling of EBITDA, just in terms of the baseline, we're talking $750 million of EBITDA at 1.1 million single-family starts, so that rough numbers?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: That's correct, yes.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: That's right.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So, what kind of margin do you think that would represent at that number?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Gross margin?
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: EBITDA margin.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: You'd be pushing – yeah, pushing 9%.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. I got the same sort of numbers. If I just interpolate on that, it seems like that would push EBITDA contribution margin, over whatever period of time this takes, to high teens, which is a little bit above what we've seen in the past couple of years, a little more in line with what we saw in the last cycle. Just kind of get your view, is that purposeful increase, something changing there? What's your view there?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. And you're right and there's really a couple of pieces to that. One is the EBITDA contribution from our base business, which we've said will be in that 12% to 15%. The other, the incremental piece you're seeing is the savings we're generating from our operational initiatives and also the incremental margin and profitability coming from continue to expand the value-add side of our business.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And I assume in this scenario, you're not putting any kind of acquisitions in, is that correct?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: That's correct.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt McCall from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning, Matt.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: I'll just continue on that last question. What about share gains, dollar for start increases? Anything else included in that outlook, that longer term outlook?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: There are share gains included in that number and the growth of the business is, well, largely in line with the market. It does show some revenue per start improvement.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. All right. And then, Chad, I think you said there was some savings included or some incremental savings included in that longer term goal. Is this a part of the continuation of ProBuild, synergies you're going to get? You have others targeted, or is this just a longer-term plan where you want to take out X% of costs? Just help me frame that savings expectation.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: It's more of a longer-term plan. As we've talked about in the past, I thought we did a heck of a job bringing our two companies together. But now is the time we have the luxury of going back over the way we do things with a fine-toothed comb and really making some nice improvements and squeezing some efficiencies out. And as I said earlier, small improvements here or there are meaningful dollars, and an example I'd like to use. We spend close to $1 billion in comp and benefits every year. Give me a 1% savings in that. That's $10 million. I'm pretty sure that's right. I'm not good with numbers, and that's a lot of zeros. And that's just 1%, right? I think we can do better than 1%. So, when you look at the scale that we've achieved now, if we can squeeze 1%, 2% out here and there, that's meaningful dollars. So, part of our long-term goal of getting to the doubling of EBITDA that we've laid out is going after these efficiencies and between these operational efficiencies and the mix improvement that we're going to be shooting for by growing the value-add side of the business. That's right now we're looking at about $100 million of EBITDA gain by the time we get to the promised land in five or six years.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And, Chad, these are things that we really envisioned in putting the two companies together. Scale has definite benefits. First, you had to stabilize the company, which we did, make sure that we – that the train didn't run off the track. And I think we demonstrated that we did, as Chad said, a very, very good job in bringing the two companies together. We continue to improve sales and continue to improve the operational performance and the profitability of the business. And now, we're going to start focusing on those things to where are the benefits of creating the scale of the company that we have. And they're very real and they're going to be achievable. And I think you will see that our performance in this area is going to be just like it was in combining the companies, and the integrating of the two companies. We did a hell of a job in that area, we're going to do a hell of a job in bringing these benefits to the bottom line and benefiting our shareholders.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: That sounds great, Floyd. Maybe if I go a little near term, looking at the second half revenue guidance, I think you said half and half, you're going to grow high-single digits half and half inflation and volumes. Chad, my math works a little differently and looks like it's a little bit higher inflation level, are you assuming what you said earlier that lumber prices tick lower and you see that impact on the top line?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I would expect to see somewhat lower prices the balance of the year.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. And that's what's in the guidance. From a volume perspective, the comps, I think the comps eased in the back half. So is there something we should keep in mind as to why we would see an increase in year-over-year volume growth?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: No, we feel good about the second half. I don't think there's any message we're trying to send there, other than continued performance by the business in the market.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And we expect to see a good second half and on our pace consistent or slightly better than what we've seen in the first half relative to the second half of last year.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. Okay. And then finally, the procurement benefits that you referenced in Q2; are there similar benefits baked into the outlook for the second half? Are there still opportunities to offset some of that inflation?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: No. No, that was – is behind us. We have seen good performance out of our procurement team. We expect that to continue but not like that second quarter performance.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thanks, Peter.
Operator: And I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Sherman for any additional or closing remarks.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Okay. The – thank you for joining the call today and we look forward to updating you on the progress of our business initiatives in the months ahead. And if you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to recap to Jen or Peter. And we hope you have a good weekend and looking forward to your staying in touch with the company. Thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect.

Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings call. I feel very good about the start we got on the year in our first quarter. This positive start was accomplished in spite of significant headwinds we faced during the quarter, such as weather, lumber inflation and labor. In spite of these challenges, our people delivered, in my opinion, outstanding results, of which I am very appreciative. I'll start with a brief update on our sales and recent events that are impacting our lumber prices. And then, I'll turn the call over to Chad, who will provide an update of our 2017 priorities. Following Chad, Peter will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we will take your questions. Let's begin our discussion on slide 5, with an overview of the macro housing markets. In 2016, the new residential housing market reached almost 1.2 million total starts, with 782,000 single-family starts. This is well below the historic average, just growing now the levels we have historically seen in recessionary troughs. Continued labor shortages will continue to constrain housing growth from 2017. We believe there are still several years of growth ahead of us and are estimating mid single-digit growth in the single-family homebuilding market in 2017. Additionally, we believe the repair and remodeling market will grow in the low single-digit range. Our sales for the quarter were $1.5 billion. Sales, excluding closed locations, grew 10.2% over the first quarter of 2016 and were benefited by approximately 4.1% as a result of the impact of commodity price inflation on our sales. Sales volume, excluding closed locations and commodity inflation, grew approximately 7.2% in the single-family, new residential homebuilding end market as compared to single-family start growth as reported by the Census Bureau of 5.9%. Additionally, sales in the repair and remodel and other end market increased over prior year by 6.4%, offset by declines in multi-family sales. Turning to Page 6, one of our key growth priorities is to expand share in our higher margin, value-added products. Our sales of value-added products included manufactured products, windows, doors and millwork for the quarter increased 9.7% versus 2016. The investments we made in our manufacturing facilities in 2016 are paying off, with sales of our manufactured products growing 15.1% over the first quarter of 2016. We believe our company is well-positioned to help homebuilders mitigate the impact of well-publicized labor shortages and increased cycle times through our manufactured and value-added products across our natural footprint. We will continue to focus on growing our value-added products faster than our overall sales, and capital investments for growth will be targeted towards this opportunity. Please turn to Page 7, where we will cover some recent developments in lumber pricing and import tariffs. The Department of Commerce has announced its preliminary import duty on Canadian lumber averaging just under 20%. As you may know, Canadian lumber imports were taxed under the previous Softwood Lumber Agreement for a decade, and that agreement expired in late 2015. This preliminary duty is in response to the suit filed by U.S. producers when a new agreement was not reached. It is enforceable for approximately four months and will be replaced by the final finding of the ITC. It'll be paid including any retroactive penalties by the Canadian mills not directly by BLDR or any other LBM distributor. However, as you would expect, the tariff does impact our purchase price, as a final determination by the ITC is not due until late next year. There most likely will be a gap in both timing and possibly the amount of the final duty, including retroactivity and any additional anti-dumping findings. Year-to-date composite prices are up approximately 20% and have not moved significantly since the announcement. Uncertainty around rates and availability on imported products is having an impact on domestic lumber products, with buyers stocking up on more inventory. I'll now turn it over to Chad, who will discuss the impact of the resulting commodity inflation on our business, as well as an update on our 2017 priorities.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Floyd, and good morning. I'll begin on slide 8, with an overview of the impact of the higher lumber prices on our business. We believe lumber prices will remain considerably higher than last year, but likely not at current levels. Given the uncertainty around the final Canadian tariff, and the timing gap between the initial determination, which lapses in September, and the final finding by the ITC late in the year, we believe there could be significant fluctuations in the imported lumber prices during 2017. Domestic lumber will also have inflationary pressures as uncertainty around pricing and supply out of Canada continues. As you know, rising lumber prices can cause gross margin and EBITDA conversion ratio compression for the company in the short-term, but in the long-term higher prices benefit the company in higher revenue and profit dollars. Assuming today's prices, commodity inflation benefit to total net sales could be in the 5% to 6% range for the year. Turning to page 9, I would like to share the progress against our 2017 priorities, including our increased focus on profitable market share expansion and improved operational efficiency. First, we are committed to capturing profitable market share and growing faster than the market by leveraging our scale and strong customer relationships, as well as continuing our investment in our sales force. I am pleased to report that we had a strong start to the year relative to the growth in single-family starts and repair and remodel market growth. We also believe we have significant opportunities to increase the reach and penetration of our higher-margin value-added products. These products allow for manufacturing and assembly of homebuilding materials offsite, aiding homebuilders with the well-publicized labor shortages and extended lead times. Growth in total value-added products in the quarter was 9.7% over the first quarter of 2016, led by growth in manufactured products of over 15%. We are focusing on implementing best practices across the organization in order to drive incremental operational efficiencies. Our initial focus will be on logistics, back-office automation and using technology to improve integration with and service to our customers. Our continued focus on cash generation will allow us to fund these initiatives as well as continue to delever the balance sheet. We are on track to generate $145 million to $155 million of free cash flow in the year. Finally, we are only as strong as our people and therefore, we are committed to attract and retain the best associates in the industry. I am pleased to announce that we have been named to the 2017 Forbes Best Large Employers list. I will now turn the call over to Peter, who will review our financial results in more detail.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. I will first discuss the current quarter results on slide 11. As a reminder, we have included adjusted figures to normalize for one-time integration, closure and other costs. For the first quarter, we reported net sales of $1.5 billion, a 10.2% increase compared to the first quarter of 2016, excluding the impact of closed locations, including an estimated 4.1% benefit from commodity price inflation. We estimate that our sales volume grew approximately 7.2% in the single-family new residential homebuilding end market and approximately 6.4% in the repair and remodel and other end market, offset by declines in multi-family. Our gross margin percentage was 24.5%, down approximately 50 basis points from 25% last year. The decrease on a year-over-year basis was largely attributable to the recent commodity price inflation drags on our margins. Although commodity price inflation generally benefits the company's operating results in the long-term, it can cause short-term gross margin percentage compression when prices are rising and margin percentage expansion when prices are falling. This is due to the short-term pricing commitments we provide customers versus the volatility of the commodity markets. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased by 150 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The reduction was largely attributable to cost efficiencies, the decline in depreciation and amortization on acquired ProBuild assets, and commodity inflation cost leverage. Excluding the depreciation impact, cost savings and cost leverage benefit was 100 basis points. GAAP net interest expense in the quarter of $36.2 million includes $2.4 million of cost associated with the amendment of our term loan and revolving credit facilities. In addition, interest expense in the first quarter of 2016 was reduced by a $7.8 million gain on debt extinguishment related to the note exchange transactions executed in that period. Absent these expenses, adjusted interest expense was $33.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, a $9.2 million reduction compared to interest expense for the first quarter of 2016, largely as a result of a series of transactions that have reduced the company's interest expense. Adjusted net income was $12.1 million or $0.11 per diluted share compared to an adjusted net loss of $14.2 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016. This improvement was largely a result of cost savings realized, revenue growth and interest savings driven by debt refinancing. Our adjusted EBITDA of $76.1 million, which equated to 23% year-over-year growth, slightly exceeded our guidance range of $70 million to $75 million due to higher sales. Adjusted EBITDA grew $14.3 million to $76.1 million or 5% of sales compared to $61.8 million or 4.4% of sales for the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year growth and improvement was driven largely by cost savings initiatives and revenue growth, offset by commodity-driven gross profit margin compression. We have provided an adjusted EBITDA reconciliation on slide 16. Turning to slide 12, we reduced debt outstanding last year by $116 million and we expect free cash flow generation will give us the opportunity to further reduce debt in 2017. We believe this will be driven by EBITDA growth and a focus on working capital efficiency, which is estimated to run between 9% and 10% of incremental sales. We expect to invest in our business through capital expenditures at approximately 1.2% of sales. We expect our current NOL tax asset should shelter us from paying federal cash taxes in 2017, assuming no material changes in shareholder base or tax code changes. As a result of the opportunistic capital market transactions executed over the last year and a half, cash interest should be reduced to approximately $130 million in 2017. Cost savings initiatives should benefit 2017 by approximately $25 million over 2016, and we expect one-time ProBuild integration costs of $20 million to $25 million. As a result, we expect to generate approximately $145 million to $155 million in cash flow for the full year 2017. Our business typically uses cash in the first half and generates cash in the second half of the year. Due to seasonal working capital needs, cash used from operations and investing in the first quarter was $145.8 million. This was in line with our expectations in annual guidance of $145 million to $155 million in positive cash flow. Turning to slide 13, total liquidity at March 31, 2017 was $612 million, consisting of net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and cash-on-hand. The company has executed multiple capital market transactions in the last year – year and a half and extended our maturity profile and improved our financial flexibility with accumulative go-forward annual interest savings of approximately $37 million. We will continue to evaluate opportunistic transactions to lower our interest expense or otherwise address our capital structure. In the first quarter, the company amended and extended its term loan credit facility to 2024, with an interest reduction of 0.75% or approximately $3 million annually, as well as extending its revolving credit facility to 2022. Our weighted average long-term debt maturity is currently 6.8 years, and our maturity profile allows multi-year runway of EBITDA growth and cash flow generation to reduce debt levels before refinancing is required. We are committed to further debt reduction and the terms of our debt allow the company to repay our most expensive bonds first, benefiting future free cash flow. We have made progress on our leverage ratio. The net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at year end March 31, 2017 was 5 times, a 0.5 turn reduction from 2016. We believe we should be able to move this ratio to 4 times or less by year end 2017. I would like to provide color on the second quarter of 2017 as well as how we are currently thinking about full year 2017. We expect all-in sales growth in the high single-digit range for the second quarter, with about half coming from volume and half from commodity inflation. Our market growth assumptions for the quarter include mid single-digit growth in single-family starts, low single-digit growth in repair and remodeling, and modest declines in the multi-family market. Given the current labor constraints that are putting a governor on growth, we are expecting the lowest growth rates in the busiest summer building season, as we approach a maximum number of starts the market can handle. Whether single-family starts can grow faster this summer, in our opinion, depends on the severity of labor constraints. From a gross margin perspective, we will continue to have headwinds from commodity inflation in the quarter, which could equate to gross margin percentage on a year-over-year basis being in line or down a bit more than 50 basis points, similar to what we experienced in quarter one. Cost savings are expected to continue. This would shake out to an estimated EBITDA growth of 6% to 12% year-over-year. Full year, our expectations for single-family starts are in the mid single-digit range, with multi-family down mid single-digits and R&R up low single-digits. We anticipate continued benefit from commodity prices on our sales. Given the uncertainty and potential fluctuations for the balance of the year in commodity prices, the year-over-year commodity-driven gross margin impact will negatively impact our EBITDA conversion rates. While in a more stable commodity environment we expect to convert sales to EBITDA at a 12% to 15% rate, we expect our conversion rate could be a bit lower in 2017. However, to reiterate, high lumber prices provide benefit to total EBITDA in the long range, but can impact our margins in the short-term. I'll now turn the ball back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Peter. Turning to our outlook, I remain positive about the future of our company. I believe the housing industry remains on a trajectory of steady growth. The reports we are getting from our people in the field continue to be very optimistic about the current business conditions relating to housing construction activity. However, given labor constraints continue to impact the rate of single-family starts, we do expect a flattening of the seasonal curve during this stage of the recovery, as builders may approach a capacity of houses they can build in the busiest summer months. We are increasing our focus on growth with value-added products, national builders who are capturing share as well as leveraging our strong local relationships and investments in our sales force to grow faster than the market. Our company is well-positioned to be the building supply company of choice for builders around the country, thanks to our geographic reach, enhanced product offerings, national manufacturing capabilities and differentiated customer service. Our focus will be to leverage our national scale and sales capability to grow faster than the market with a focus on profitable growth and value-added products. These strengths, our scale and the leverage provided by our cash flow generation and debt reduction plans combined to make Builders FirstSource an industry leader with significant growth opportunities. I believe we will create significant value for our shareholders in the years to come. Furthermore, I attribute the success we have achieved so far to all of our hard-working and dedicated associates. They truly are the people who make this company go. Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: We can take our first question from Trey Grooms. Please go ahead.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Morning, Trey.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Just a quick question on the labor commentary there, Floyd. We're seeing apparently some enough labor constraints where it could start to limit the type of recovery we could see in – you said in the summer months, a flattening of the seasonal curve. Is that kind of across the board in your opinion as you look at your footprint geographically or is there areas that are more concerning than others, and if you can just kind of talk to that? And then also, I mean, it seems that we're still a long way away from normal demand for housing. If you can just kind of talk about how you think that impacts the cycle? I mean, is that going to shortstop us here for – in the recovery earlier than what we normally would see, or is it just going to be elongated curve? What your thoughts there?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. Trey, we are seeing the labor situation pretty much across all areas of the markets that we serve. But we're building more houses than we did last year. We built more houses last year than we did the year before. We continue to find ways to solve the labor problem, find ways to alleviate the labor problems. Certainly, the labor saving products that we offer the builder is definitely helping out. You can see it from the sales gain that we had on those products, that the builders are turning more and more to the use of these labor saving products and they offer true value enhancements to the builder in getting their houses built. As tough as the labor situation is, I think somehow we're going to continue finding ways to attract more people into the labor force. And I really don't see us hitting a wall to where we can't build any more houses. What I do see happening is that we tend to get labor cut and it causes the flow on a jobsites to go on in surges, you get behind on the concrete, pile in (25:12) the concrete gets caught up and then you got the framing surge and then the finish out surge, the jobs don't run as smooth as they once did. But the end result is we continue to build more houses and we're getting the job done. I don't think that the builders are missing – at least not from what I'm hearing from our people in the field, and from talking with the various builders, I don't think they're missing any sales because of the labor issues. And so, yeah, I'm not as negative about labor as what the picture looked like a year or two ago. And I just see us continuing to find ways to get the job done.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And I think it's just going to end up in a slower steady recovery, which is great. And I would also think that if you continue to see multi-family cool down, you will see some of that labor move over to the single-family side of construction.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, makes sense. Thanks for that. And then looking at, I guess, the commentary around lumber. And, Chad, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments that you expect lumber prices to stay higher, but maybe not where they are today, and that it sounds like it's going to be fairly choppy. I guess what's behind that expectation? Are you seeing more supply come in, or domestically more – just kind of re-commissioning some lines or anything like that? What's behind your expectation after having a fairly rapid increase in lumber prices and then kind of stabilization? What's behind your thoughts around that?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, a lot of it. It's just historically you never see flat lumber prices for very long. And when I say lower than they are today, I'm not talking significantly lower. I think, maybe, the framing lumber composite is around $430 right now, may you see it bounce around between $400 and $430 over the summer months, which is still a very good environment for us.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: And that's embedded in some of the commentary you had around 2Q, is that lumber outlook?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. Other than when I said the sales for the year might be benefited by 5% to 6%, that's assuming prices stay where they are today. If they dip a little lower than that on average then maybe we're on the low end of that inflation impact. But, yeah, generally speaking, that's embedded in the commentary.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, got it. And then last one from me is on the manufactured products up 15%. Floyd, I think in your comments you mentioned that you made some changes there last year. I think you've touched on that in the past a little bit, but those are starting to pay off. That 15%, I mean, that's obviously very strong. But with the shortage of labor you're talking about in the backdrop there, obviously you would expect a continued out-performance from the manufactured product side of things, but what's the run rate there? I mean, is that 15% or was there something unique, was it really the comp on that side, which I don't think it was? But are you guys – what was going on in that quarter that was unique that – or should we continue to expect that level of growth?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I really can't sit here and say, Trey, that there's anything truly unique. I do think there's probably a couple factors that are coming into play. One is, and I believe alluded to in previous calls, that as we are now getting, let's say, more stable and we move through the integration process, our people are focusing more and more on how to build the markets, and certainly, there's a lot more management attention being given to building market share. We have invested. We're going to continue to invest in adding component plants. This year, we're slated to probably get started another five plants. We're getting more coverage in our markets. So all of these factors, including – yeah, I think we are the best at the roof truss, floor truss, wall panel business in the country. We aggressively make it a part of our package. It's all part of our selling value-added products. And I think our sales force is reacting to that message on a steadily improving basis. So I think that's all the reasons why we grew the way we did. We still have plenty of competition, there's a lot of good competition out there, but I think we're the best at the game and it's paying off for us.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: All right. Well, that's really encouraging. Thanks, guys and congrats again on a great quarter and good luck in 2Q.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I really appreciate you saying that, Trey, because, yeah, we worked hard in the quarter and it definitely showed.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah, paid off. Thanks, guys.
Operator: We can take our next question from Will Randow. Please go ahead.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys, and congrats on the progress.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Will.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, Will.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So I just was hoping to get a bit more granularity on your prior comments. Just simply looking at the lumber chart on slide 7, which has been focused on in a couple of prior questions, why haven't you guys raised full year 2017 cash flow guidance, given the gap up in lumber prices that I guess shouldn't have only caused net full year benefit to your commodity sales, but also should boost other pockets that are levered to lumber like the trusses business?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, we do invest in working capital at a rate of about 9% to 10% of sales. So as the increasing value of our lumber is recorded in inventory, we will see a headwind on the cash flow.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: But, I guess, I have to work through the math, but what's implied by my question was there should be a net benefit, especially when you consider that not (31:46) just a quarter commodity, your truss business, for example, will see that benefit. So I assume there should be a net benefit, but am I wrong in that?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: There is a net benefit in the long run. In the near-term, we do have compression in gross margins and we'll have to digest that as we go through the rest of this year. And as we get better clarity on where those pricings will be, we'll give you a better look at full year.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then a follow-up on labor constraints. Builders really aren't talking about that issue the way they were over the past two years, meaning it's become less of an issue based on their commentary, but maybe that's wrong. So with that said, on value-added products, you really have two drivers there, one good and one bad. On the good side, builders, as you mentioned, need improved cycle times. If I remember correctly, you can take two weeks out of the rough for a home, maybe one to two weeks. And it's a 20-week cycle time, so reduce it by about 10%. On the bad, most builders are using less trusses as they shift down to lower ASP product, meaning entry level and move-down, at least that's what we're seeing in the field. So it appears that they may use less trusses, given their focus on the move-down/entry level buyer. So I guess how do you think about the tailwind of incremental structured panels and the potential headwind of builders pulling out (33:17) cost, including trusses?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, I think there's going to be a continuation. Obviously, the builders aren't talking as much about the labor issues because we in the supply industry who build – really build the houses for the builders are finding ways to get the problem solved. And there are no longer is the holdup. I do not believe that builders are losing sales because of the inability to get homes built on a timely basis. But what they're finding is that in order to get this done, they've got to utilize more labor-saving products going into the home. And that's what they're doing. And we see this as a continual growth side of the business for us. There's more and more demand for the labor-saving products and value-add products going into the home. So I see that as a continually growing part of our business. I don't see it as a tailwind.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And if I could just sneak one last one in, some of your specialty products, call it, windows, doors, roofing, insulation, you had then single-digit growth, which was lower than overall company, and I assume that's because of lumber inflation, meaning skewing the growth. How do you feel about gaining traction in terms of growing, for example, the roofing business across stores as you extend ProBuild's product offering across the Builders FirstSource platform?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think we feel really good about the growth. I think what you saw there in that number is the mix of where we sell and some projects that float in and out. But overall, the growth in that part of our business has been very healthy and strong. We feel good about it going forward.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys, and good luck for the year.
Operator: We can take our next question from Nishu Sood. Please go ahead.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. I wanted to also ask on the lumber import tariff. You folks mentioned that in the industry some buying of – change, obviously, buying patterns, pre-buying around the price volatility. So I wanted to ask how have you folks handled that around the tariff and the price volatility, how did it flow through so far this year. And also, just as importantly, if this volatility is likely to continue, as you're pointing out, and which makes a lot of sense, how might that affect the 9% to 10% incremental working capital as a percentage of sales target? Would it put that at risk, potentially?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: To answer your first question, we were fairly aggressive earlier in the year leading up to the announcement that came out several weeks ago. You're limited to some degree on what you can do. You physically have to have room for the inventory. And then, we were able to negotiate some buys over several weeks. So we had a pretty good position going into the announcement. But like us and our competitors, we will all still be out there buying. You can't stock six months worth of inventory. So we're back out there buying again. Your second question, yes, it could be a slight headwind to working capital, but I still think, generally speaking, that 9% to 10% range is going to be close to where we would come in at.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. That's great. Very helpful. And then, I also wanted to – looking back to mid-year last year, there was some slowdown in sales. And at that stage, you folks always gave us the straight talk. And you talked about perhaps the internal focus on synergies and integration detracted from selling efforts. Now, if we look back, so if we think about the new kind of flattening out of seasonality, and perhaps it has more to do with kind of industry constraints, maybe we can look back at that sales slowdown last year and think about it in those terms versus the focus on the synergies and the integration. Now, obviously, the positive side of that is maybe you folks were a little bit too hard on yourselves last year, but then looking ahead, maybe it means that the bounce back in sales might not be as much as expected, if it's more of an industry-wide phenomenon. How do you folks think about that now in retrospect? And I guess the broader question is, have you have been continuing to refocus on generating the sales growth? How should we expect that to play out this year?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, personally, I think the distraction factor last year was real because we were trying to measure our growth versus what we thought the end market growth was during the same period. So I think it was real. It's, in a way, theoretical, it's soft. It's hard to measure, but I feel like it's real. And so that's not really trying to compare it to the other part of your question, which is the flattening of the seasonal curve. We were really trying to compare it to what we felt like the market was growing at that point in time. So I think it was real. I think if you were to go out and hold the guys out in the field, they would tell you the same thing. We really tried to make 2017 a year with as little change as possible so the guys can focus on the business. Now, to your point, that doesn't mean we won't have a flattening of the seasonal curve, but I kind of see those as two different issues.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Got it. Okay. And just last one on the repair and remodeling, nice strong sales growth there, kind of in the mid six percentage, I think. So, anything unusual there? Your year forecast still for the kind of 3% to 4%, I believe. So how should we think about the strong performance there?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I can't think of anything unusual there, pretty small piece of our business overall. And in a lot of markets, the winter weather wasn't too bad, so that probably weight into a little bit, but nothing unusual that comes to mind.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We can take our next question from Alex Rygiel. Please go ahead.
Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Thank you. Very nice quarter, gentlemen.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Could you expand a little bit upon any geographic demand variances that you might have noticed in the quarter?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: No.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So just with those numbers. I mean we were up across most of the country pretty consistently, particularly single-family look very good for us. Certain regions, given their economic exposure, I think maybe were held back a bit. Oil impacted locations generally had a tougher go than some of the others.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: But if we look at our top 10 state, the seven out of the 10 had double-digit increases. The remaining three were high single-digit. So the top 10 state for us, that approximate two-thirds a little better than two-thirds of our total volume. So we had a lot of strength in the big producing states. I'm very pleased to see in Texas again double-digit performance. Houston is starting to come around real nicely for us. We had a real positive gain in Houston and a nice gain. So that market is very, very important to us and it's even as part of the state. And so we had a good mixture, all across the board, very good performances in our markets.
Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: And as it relates to the sales force expansion, did you see any net benefit in the first quarter? And if not, I suspect we'd be witnessing benefit in 2Q and beyond? And then also kind of transition into a little bit more detail on your outlook for SG&A leverage over the next couple quarters.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, I'll tackle the first part of that. Yes, we track very closely the salesmen that we're hiring through this program that we implemented early last year. And with hiring any one, you're going to have some that really outperform and some that their performance is a little lacking, but we're tracking them closely. We're training them. And so, yeah, on a net basis, we're starting to see some really nice results from these guys. We're still kind of on the front-end of that. It does take a new salesman in this industry a while to build up a book of business, but feel good about the program so far. As far as SG&A, I'll let Peter tackle that one.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. As far as SG&A, I think that we'll continue to see leverage as the commodities stay higher and that lumber pricing works to our advantage in that space. But otherwise, I think consistent performance as we see the benefits of our operational improvements for the full year, but we continue invest in different areas of the business as we see opportunities.
Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Thank you very much.
Operator: And we can take our next question from Keith Hughes. Please go ahead.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. One detail question on tax, the $0.11 adjusted, (43:33) there was virtually no tax. What kind of taxes on an adjusted basis would you expect to be accruing the remainder of the year?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yes. So, for this year, we would anticipate kind of that 40% tax rate, but we are not intending – we're not expecting to be a cash taxpayer this year because we will utilize our NOLs for the federal tax portion. A couple of assumptions there; one being that there's no fundamental changes in the tax code, and second that there aren't any significant changes in our shareholder base that could cause us to defer any portion of that NOL.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: But from an adjusted EPS, we'll see roughly 40% in second, third and fourth quarter.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yes. That's our expectation.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay.
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: There's virtually no net income, so you have very little tax accrual in the first quarter. It's seasonal business that follows that, so...
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes, I'm asking it because the adjusted EPS means (44:29) as you get bigger nominal (44:32) quarters.
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. So in Q2 and Q3, you'll see something more in line because we make more net income.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And if you look longer-term, I know you've laid out what you're going to do for us in terms of debt reduction for this year. Assuming trends remain as you've kind of highlighted for 2017 and 2018, I would assume debt reduction would still be the main goal of the company in 2018, or could that change a little bit?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, I mean, we continue to look at the near-term goals for ourselves, right, like you mentioned, trying to get under 4 by the end of 2017 and to that 3 to 3.5 range within 2018. I think we've touched on this a couple of points. And I think we're consistently thinking this way and that's that we're going to reassess where we are in the market cycle to determine where the best direction for us will be. We continue to look at tuck-in opportunities in the interim. And when we get to that point, we'll consider what our options play out in front of us, but clearly debt reduction is a great opportunity for us to release value, and looking at this market at that point I think makes a lot more sense.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We can take our next question from John Baugh. Please go ahead.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. I was wondering if we could talk maybe longer-term, there's obviously a lot of moving parts short-term with margins, but as your value-add products grow, and you had given an overall 12% to 15% incremental, is that a number that stays in that range, improves? I guess, I'm asking can the value-added mix be accelerated or – because I believe ProBuild is well behind the predecessor company. I'm just kind of curious as to how that moves margin through time and what the incremental might be on that business versus the rest of your business?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, you're right, long-term, and we have mentioned in the past that there were holes in the ProBuild side of the business on the manufacturing side. So that is the area we're targeting now and I think that's helping to contribute to the growth in that category. Typically, to get 12% to 15% incremental EBITDA, you're going to need gross margin expansion in the quarter and you're going to need the leveraging of your SG&A. If you have gross margin compression, as you know, it's really hard to get to that 12% to 15%. So I think if we can get past this period of inflationary headwinds, you will start to see gross margin expansion, part of that will be due to the growth in value-add. And I think we will kind of find that sweet spot to grow beyond the 15% incremental, probably some quarters you can, but I think long-term, that would be very difficult to consistently outperform that just largely due to the volatility that you do see in commodities over time. But, yeah, overall as our mix changes, our gross margin should strengthen. It wasn't that long ago, we were 25%, 26% range until we hit this period of inflation. So if we can see some stabilization in prices, I see no reason why we can't start getting back up to those levels.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And is there a constraint given proximity to a manufacturing site or wherever you're doing value add components? What would be – if you were 100% converted to the markets that made sense, what would be the possible mix of value-added? And I realize it could take some time to get there. And also in that question, would we expect to see perhaps rather than acquisitions maybe more CapEx in terms of building out those capabilities longer-term?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, as you know, legacy BFS total value-add had gotten close to 50% of our business. That's manufactured products and the millwork category. I'm trying to remember the highest we've got to from a manufactured product. It was probably close to 25%. That sound about right, Floyd?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And so I think if we can get the entire footprint built out, as you said, it'll take time, but I think we can get back to those historical levels. You can ship trusses and panels 125, 150 miles. It's a better proposition shipping those than it is sticks. So to some degree, you are limited by the proximity of your plant.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you and good luck.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We can take our next question from Mike Dahl. Please go ahead.
Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. This is Matt Bouley on for Mike today. Thanks for taking our questions. I just wanted to follow-up on the earlier discussion on SG&A leverage and the 100 basis points decline ex D&A that you called out. Should we expect any incremental investments going forward, any additional sales force investments? And how should that interplay with the cost efficiencies that you've called out? So the question is, I mean, should we expect a similar level of leverage going forward as you did in the first quarter? Thank you.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, I think it's definitely fair to say that we will continue to make investments. We're strong believers in the programs that we've been supporting and we see opportunities going forward for additional programs to drive operational improvement. So, clearly, we'll continue to invest. As far as leverage goes, we have every expectation that increasing lumber price will drive leverage for us. And we think there's a consistency there, although our business is quite seasonal, so we will respond to the growth requirements of the business with the appropriate head count. That said, I think it's fair to expect leverage out of SG&A as we grow, may be not at 100 points, but improvement.
Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, understood. Thank you. And then I wanted to ask a little further about the strength in manufactured products. Do you sense that you're gaining share with existing customers as a result of the labor shortage? Or how much would you say is due to this true market expansion or gaining new customers as you kind of expand capacity to different regions? Thank you.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: We definitely can see we are adding new customers and we are taking a larger share of existing customers' wallet. It's a combination of both. On the newer customers, because you're starting with a new customer, it takes a while for those volumes to build up, but nevertheless, it is adding significantly to the progress we're making with our component products.
Matthew Bouley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: We can take our next question from Matt McCall. Please go ahead.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Hey, Matt.
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: So I don't want to knit pick these numbers too much. But I think you said your multi-family outlook is now down low single-digits, flat (52:46) in my notes it's flat to down, single-family also ticked a little bit lower from what I write, 7% to 8% to up mid single-digits. I know it's just a couple of points here and there. But I guess the question is, if labor is the main issue for single-family, and multi-family declines are going to provide more labor for single-family, Chad, I think you said that, is there another constraint that's pushing that single-family outlook a little bit lower from what we had last in our notes?
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I'm sorry. So you're asking if we're dropping our guidance on single-family?
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Well, the last time I had in my notes is single-family of seven days. And I think you just said mid-single, and maybe that's the same thing, maybe you'd haven't changed it. But when I saw it, it looks like multi-family is down just a little bit more, the outlook is down. Maybe I misreading or misinterpreting what you're saying, but -
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah, I think we've always said multi-family is going to be down and I think we said mid to mid-high. So, (53:50)
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: We haven't changed our forecast at this point.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. All right.
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: All right. So misinterpret. So we talked a lot about lumber, maybe could you talk to us a little bit about some of the product categories from a price, from a cost perspective? Just the trends you're seeing from an inflation perspective just in general.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think most of the other products where price increases have been announced by the industry is pretty much difficult for us, but it's running very low single-digits for the most part. And many of those increases were announced prior to the end of the year, so that you had chance to get those built into your pricing models. Typically, you get some anywhere from 60 to 90 days advance notice of it. And so there wasn't much of that and that showed up in the first quarter, but it's been pretty much as usual. And I don't see anything really unusual going on in this area. So...
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. All right. That's fair. Thanks for that. So the last one I had, the outlook for inflation, are you expecting the pressure to continue in the back half or – I think Chad, you said prices could come down a little bit or the potential for us to get a better price cost match and thus better incremental margin in the back half.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's accurate. And as you know, we do have pricing commitments with many of our customers that can – that you can go out as much as 90 days. And so as we get the opportunity to reset those at more current market prices, you should see improvements in the back half of the year.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. So, Peter, your comment on the normal EBITDA conversion being a little lower than the 12% to 15%, maybe that's the case for the first half, back half is in that range, maybe a little better, or – is that the way to think about it?
Peter Jackson - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. That's correct. So we would see pressure until it stabilizes and then catch back up to Chad's point.
Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you, all.
Operator: We can take our next question from Nick Coppola. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Hey, good morning.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Morning, Nick.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: So I just wanted to follow-up on the earlier conversation on buyers stocking up on lumber inventories. How big of a drag do you think that would be on Q2? Do you expect that there would be a meaningful impact there?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: What do you mean by a drag on Q2?
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: So buyers worked on inventories rather than buying or getting new shipments?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think it'll be a drag in Q2, my concern right now on Q2 is, as we continue to buy to replenish and we're kind of bumping up against our ability to reset prices with our customers, our average cost is going to start creeping up. And so that's the biggest concern I have for Q2. It's not a quantity issue whether we're going to run out of lumber, it's just the timing of our buys versus our ability to reset prices.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. All right. And then, I guess, I'll shift gears here. So you talked a bit more about your greenfield strategy. I saw five new manufacturing facilities and one new millwork facility for 2017. So what is your decision-making process look like there? And then how you think about greenfields versus M&A over the longer-term?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, greenfield versus M&A largely boils down to – we get feedback from our folks out in the field on whether they're seeing the demand, for example, a truss plant, and where we don't have one. As you look at that market, you determine are there any acquisition opportunities that maybe we have discussions with. So, as Jim said earlier, it's a buy versus build decision at that point. And if there are no candidates in the market or none that are willing to sell, then you would turn to greenfielding, but generally that process starts with our operators out in the field coming to us and saying, hey, I really feel like we have an opportunity for a millwork workshop here, a truss plant here, and then going through that process that I just described.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: You bet.
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, Nick.
Operator: And unfortunately, we were out of time for any further questions today. So I'll turn the program back over to Floyd Sherman for any additional or closing remarks.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Okay. We appreciate everyone joining the call today. We look forward to updating you on the progress of our business initiatives in the months ahead. If you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to give Jen Pasquino a call. Thanks, and have a great day.
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

Floyd Sherman: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. I'll start with a brief update on our sales and then turn the call over to Chad who will provide an update on our integrated -- integration progress and our 2017 priorities and then Peter will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions. Let's begin our discussion on Slide 5 with an overview of the macro housing markets. In 2016 the new residential housing market reached almost 1.2 million starts with 782,000 single-family starts. This is well below the historic average just growing to levels that we have historically seen in the recessionary troughs. We believe the 5.6% growth in total starts for the year, including 9.4% single-family is shy of the demand for new housing in the U.S. market. Continued labor shortages have constricted housing growth year-over-year. We believe there are still several years of growth ahead of us and we're estimating mid to high single-digit growth in the homebuilding market in 2017. Additionally, our involvement in the repair and remodeling market has historically provided a more stable revenue base and diversified our end market exposure. Our sales for the quarter were $1.5 billion. We had two fewer sales days in the fourth quarter of 2016 over the fourth quarter of 2015. Therefore, we'll discuss the sales per day growth in the quarter. Sales per day grew 10.1% over the fourth quarter of 2015 and was benefited by approximately 4.4% as a result of the impact of commodity price inflation on our sales. Sales per day, excluded closed locations grew approximately 13.2% in the new residential homebuilding end market and approximately 3.7% in repair and remodel end market in the fourth quarter. For the year, we grew sales by 5.5%, excluding closed locations and including 7.5% sales volume growth in the new residential construction end market. This was a bit shy of market growth. As we've discussed the last couple of quarters, our integration efforts have been a major priority for the company and the EBITDA contribution from these cost savings initiatives was substantial. As a result, I believe the internal focus to deliver on all of the integration priorities, impacted our abilities to grow share. I believe this was the right long-term strategy for our business. With the ProBuild integration largely complete, we are renewing our focus on growth opportunities. Turning to a Page 6, our key growth priorities is to expand share and on higher margin value-added products. Our sales of manufactured products, windows, doors and millwork for the year increased 7% versus 2015 and increased 12% per day in the fourth quarter. The investments we've made in our manufacturing facilities in 2016 are really paying off with sales of our manufactured products growing 10% over 2015 and growing 18% per day in the fourth quarter. We believe our company is well-positioned to help homebuilders mitigate the impact of well-publicized labor shortages and increased cycle times through our manufactured and value-added products across our national footprint. We will continue to focus on growing our value-added products faster than our overall sales and capital investments for growth will be targeted towards this opportunity. I'll now turn it over to Chad who will provide an update on our ProBuild integration as well as our 2017 priorities.
Chad Crow: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning. I'll begin on Slide 7 with an overview of the progress we've made on the acquisition integration and associated savings. The cost savings opportunities we targeted of $100 million to $120 million are largely achieved. Synergies are being captured through network optimization procurement and G&A costs. We achieved a run rate savings of $100 million at year end with a breakout of about 15% from procurement, 15% from network consolidations and 70% from overhead in G&A savings. The ERP conversions are on track and we now have over 60% of the company's revenue on our proprietary system. We've also completed our SOX compliance project, closed all plant overlapping locations and virtually all personnel and benefit plan changes have been actioned. I'll now reflect back on all we've accomplished over the past year and a half we have a lot to be proud of. Builders FirstSource acquired a company three times its size and while not perfect, the integration has gone extremely well. Since 2014, the baseline year for measuring our progress, we have grown adjusted EBITDA by $125 million at 22% CAGR and improved our adjusted EBITDA margins from 4.2% to 6%. Also, when looking across both 2015, a year of commodity price deflation and 2016, a year of commodity price inflation, our adjusted EBITDA flow through on incremental sales was 44% including synergies and 14% excluding synergies, in line with our internal expectations. None of this could have been possible if not for our talented associates who have come together to create a combined company, which is greater than the sum of the parts. My sincere thank you to all of our hardworking associates. With the ProBuild integration, largely behind us, we are increasing our focus on profitable market share expansion and improved operational efficiencies. Turning to Page 8, I would like to share our 2017 priorities as we transition away from our focus on integration. First, we are committed to capturing profitable market share and growing faster than the market by leveraging our scale and strong customer relationships as well as continuing our investment in our sales force. We also believe we have six significant opportunities to increase the reach and penetration of our higher margin value-added products. These products allow manufacturing and assembly of homebuilding materials off the jobsite, aiding homebuilders with the well-publicized labor shortages and extended lead times. Additionally, now that the bulk of the integration efforts are behind us, we have the luxury to go back across our operations with a fine-tooth comb and spread best practices in order to drive incremental operational efficiencies. With G&A spend in excess of $1 billion, we believe the opportunity exist to drive meaningful savings through these initiatives. Finally, our continued focus on cash generation will allow us to fund these initiatives as well as continue to de-lever the balance sheet. I'll now turn the call over to Peter who will review the financial results in more detail.
Peter Jackson: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. I will first discuss the quarter -- the current quarter results on Slide 10. As a reminder, we've included adjusted figures to normalize for one-time integration closure and other costs. For the fourth quarter, we reported net sales of $1.5 billion, a 6.6% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 excluding the impact of closed locations. This is despite the loss of two sales days on a year-over-year basis, which negatively impacted year-over-year revenue comparisons by approximately $46 million. We are discussing sales per day growth in the quarter for an apples-to-apples comparison. Sales per day grew 10.1% over pro forma sales for the fourth quarter of 2015, benefited by an estimated 4.4% from commodity price inflation. We estimate that our sales per day, excluding closed locations grew approximately 13.2% in the new residential homebuilding end market and approximately 3.7% in the repair and remodel end market, offset by declines in commercial and other. Our gross margin percentage was 25.3% down approximately 100 basis points from 26.3% last year, but improved versus last quarter by 30 basis points. The decrease on a year-over-year basis was largely due to the combination of commodity price deflation benefits in 2015 and commodity price inflation in 2016. Although commodity price inflation generally benefits the company's operating results in the long term, it can cause short-term gross margin percentage compression when prices are rising and margin percentage expansion when prices are falling. This is due to the short-term pricing commitments we provide customers versus the volatility of the commodity markets. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales excluding depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and one-time acquisition and integration expenses decreased by 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Interest expense in the quarter of $44.4 million included $9.7 million of premium paid and non-cash deferred loan cost and debt discount write-offs, associated with the repurchase of $50 million of principle amount of our 2023 unsecured notes with a 10.75% coupon. Absent these expenses, adjusted interest expense was $34.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 an $8.4 million reduction compared to interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2015, attributable to debt repayments and a series of transactions that have reduced the company's interest expense. Adjusted net income was $18.3 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to an adjusted net loss of $0.3 million $0.00 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2015. This improvement was largely a result of the operating synergies realized, revenue growth and interest savings as a result of refinancing and debt reduction. Our adjusted EBITDA of $84.8 million exceeded our guidance. Despite the loss of two sales days on a year-over-year basis, adjusted EBITDA grew $8.5 million to $84.8 million or 5.5% of sales, compared to $76.3 million or 5.2% of sales for the adjusted fourth quarter of 2015. This 11% growth versus the fourth quarter of 2015 exceeds the guidance we provided of mid-single-digits growth. The year-over-year improvement was driven largely by cost savings initiatives and revenue growth, offset by commodity-driven gross profit margin compression and a reduction of two sales days. We have provided an adjusted EBITDA reconciliation on Slide 16. Moving to Slide 11, the company achieved strong results for fiscal 2016, including 21.8% EBITDA growth reducing go-forward interest by $37 million, reducing net leverage by 1.4 turns, exceeding cash flow guidance and reducing net debt outstanding by $115.9 million in the year. As we move into 2017, cash flow and de-levering will continue to be a priority. Turning the Slide 12, we reduced debt outstanding last year by $116 million and we expect free cash flow generation will give us the opportunity to further reduce debt in 2017. We believe this will be driven by EBITDA growth and a focus on working capital efficiency, which is estimated to run between 9% and 10% of incremental sales. We expect to invest in our business through capital expenditures at approximately 1.2% of sales. We expect our current NOL tax asset should shelter us from paying federal cash taxes in 2017. As a result of opportunistic capital markets transactions executed over the last 12 months, cash interest should be reduced to approximately $127 million in 2017. Cost savings initiatives should benefit 2017 by approximately $25 million over 2016 and we expect one-time ProBuild integration cost of $20 million to $25 million. As a result, we expect to generate approximately $145 million to $155 million in cash flow for full year 2017. Should market conditions unexpectedly accelerate or decelerate, we have the ability to quickly adjust our capital spending and working capital accordingly to help mitigate the impact on our cash flow. As a reminder, our business typically uses cash in the first half and generates cash in the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 13, total liquidity at December 31, 2016, was $681.6 million, consisting of net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand. The company has executed multiple capital market transactions in the last 12 months to extend our maturity profile and improve our financial flexibility with a cumulative go-forward annual interest savings of approximately $37 million. We will continue to evaluate opportunistic transactions to lower our expense or otherwise address our capital structure. In February 2017, the company amended and extended its term loan credit facility to 2024 with an interest reduction of 0.75% or approximately $3 million annually. Our weighted average long term debt maturity is over seven years and our maturity profile allows multi-year runway of EBITDA growth and cash flow generation to reduce debt levels before refinancing is required. We are committed to further debt reduction and the terms of our debt allow the company to repay our most expensive bonds first, benefiting future free cash flow. We have made progress on our leverage ratio in the year. The net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at year-end 2016 was 4.8 times, a 1.4 times turn reduction from 2015, benefited by $116 million in debt reduction since December 31, 2015. We believe we should be able to move this ratio to below four times by year end 2017. I would like to provide color on the first quarter of 2017 as well as how we are currently thinking about full-year 2017. As you remember, growth in the first quarter of 2016 over 2015 was over 16% in total housing starts and over 20% in single-family starts. From a market growth perspective, the first quarter is the toughest comparison. Therefore, we expect all-in sales growth of 6% to 8% in the quarter. From a gross margin perspective, we will continue to lap the benefits of commodity deflation last year versus commodity inflation this year in the quarter, which will equate to a gross margin percentage flat to down slightly on a year-over-year basis. Cost savings are expected to continue and this will shake out to an estimated EBITDA of $70 million to $75 million. Full year, our expectations for single family starts are in the mid to high single-digit range with multi-family and commercial down mid-single-digits and R&R up 3% to 5%. Whether single family starts can grow at the high end of that range, will in our opinion, depend on the severity of labor constraints. We anticipate a pointer to a benefit from commodity prices on our sales and a bit of share gain in the single-family end market. The year-over-year commodity-driven gross margin impact should not be nearly as impactful as it was on our 2016 results, allowing us to get back to a more normalized estimated EBITDA conversion ratio of 12% to 15%. I'll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd Sherman: Thank you, Peter. Turning to our outlook, I feel great about the future of our company and all that we accomplished not only in the fourth quarter, but in total for the year. I believe the housing industry remains on a trajectory of steady growth. Now that the ProBuild integration efforts are largely behind us, we're increasing our focus on growth with value-added products and national builders who are capturing share as well as leveraging our strong local our relationships and investments in our sales force to grow faster than the market. Our company is well-positioned to be the building supply company of choice for builders around the country, thanks to our geographic reach, enhanced product offerings, national manufacturing capabilities and differentiated customer service. Our focus will be to leverage our national scale and sales capability to grow faster than the market with a focus on profitable growth and value-added products. These are strengths and are scale and the leverage provided by our cash flow generation and debt reduction plans, combined to make Builders FirstSource an industry leader with significant growth opportunities. I believe we will create significant value for our shareholders in the years to come. Furthermore, I attribute the success of what we have achieved so far all of our hard-working and dedicated associates. Thank you. And I'll now turn on the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Rob Hansen of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Rob Hansen: Thanks guys. Good of see most of the integration behind you. So I wanted to ask about how you're going to drive share and win back some of those customers that maybe you weren’t able to reach in 2016? And when you talk about share gain, like how much faster are you thinking that you would grow the market -- compared to the market in 2017.
Chad Crow: I'll take the first stab at that Ron. I think as we talked about a lot the last couple of quarters, it's really just -- there's only so many hours in a day and so by getting most of this integration behind us, it frees up the folks in the field. They now have more time to focus on customers, to focus on going after that incremental business. So certainly, just the allocation of time now will be a benefit for us and as we've also talked about the last few quarters, we are going to continue to invest in the value-added side of our business. We feel like especially in the Western part of the country, there's a lot of pockets where we have the opportunity to increase our presence in the trust and panel business for example. And so, I know it's hard sometimes for folks to imagine the complexity and the time it takes to bring together two companies like we did, all the way from just the personnel side of things, all the way through getting the ProBuild side of the business SOX compliant. It was extremely, extremely difficult, extremely time-consuming. And so, I think the biggest bang we're going to have in 2017 is just the fact that that is behind us and folks can now focus on running their operations and customer service. And I think we started to see a glimpse of that in the fourth quarter and we feel good about what we're seeing this year.
Floyd Sherman: And I think another very important point Chad is certainly the expansion of our salesforce. We are really working diligently on increasing the number of salesman that we have in the field. This is an extremely important element in this business in helping to drive market share and we have been steadily increasing our sales force since midyear last year. And in 2016 this is -- certainly we intend to continue accelerating this process throughout '17. We need to get more feet on the street. There is a lot of opportunities continue to develop in every market. We certainly will be spending a lot more time on a market by market basis, looking at our customer mix, looking at those customers that we're selling and products that we're not selling to those customers and how can we increase our sales and get more of the existing pocketbook. But also at the same time, there is a lot of customers out there who we're not selling and we need to find out what it's going to take to do it. In many cases when we started analyzing this, we really began to see that we didn't have the salesman necessary to cover a lot of these opportunities and we're certainly working hard on that and we're going to continue to expand those efforts. And I think that combined with now the increased focus on our business that Chad spoke about, is going to be largely responsible for driving the market share gains that we would anticipate. And think you can really see what we -- how we accelerated in the fourth quarter and I'm very pleased to see what we're experiencing to start this year. So, I am feeling very good at this point.
Rob Hansen: That's good to hear and just so, we're sure, we're kind of aware, when you're talking about share gains and growing a little bit faster than the market, you're not talking like if housing start starts grow 5%, you're not talking that you're going to hit like 7% right. It's just more of a smaller kind of incremental peace there?
Chad Crow: That's right and we've said before, you can always grow share faster if you want to drop your doors and lower your prizes. I think that Floyd Sherman wants to use that quote, but yeah, I think the key there is profitable market share growth.
Rob Hansen: Okay. Good. And then just one other question on the incremental that you guys grew at 12% to 15% for this year and you also have talked about adding in a lot more sales people. So, does that 12% to 15% kind of factor in like okay, we're going to grow our base overhead by certain percent?
Chad Crow: Yeah, that would be an all-in flow through including any extra carrying cost of the sales force.
Rob Hansen: Got it. And then just last question on CapEx, came it at pretty low number in 2016 I thought, given everything that's going on and I think you threw out a number for I think you said 1.2% in 2017. So, I just wanted to get an idea why it's a little bit lower than I think most people are expecting given the integration and the growth initiatives?
Chad Crow: Yeah, so in the results for the fourth quarter, we did the cash number that we were anticipating really attributable to a few things, the first being the EBITDA; obviously, that was worth $10 million, so we like that. The other fit was about $5 million that we benefited from the sale of properties that were held for sale as a result of the combined entity and properties that we were willing to part with. And then the rest of it was really attributable to capital expenditures. Two real drivers there, the first being timing on some of the projects that didn't come in right when we expected at year end and the second, really a response that we took to tepid market share growth in certain markets where we managed our capital expenditure in ways we thought was appropriate. But that 1.2% expectation we do maintain that for 2017 that is in our expected cash flow forecast of $145 million to $155 million.
Rob Hansen: All right. Appreciate it guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Dahl of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mike Dahl: Hi thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to follow up on the sales environment, one of your competitors talked about seeing some more intense competitive activity on the commodity lumber side just as prices have ramped up and not everyone has gone through to the market with full pricing. Just wanted to get your comments on how you're approaching this and so what you're seeing and how you intend to compete?
Peter Jackson: Well, I think that we have been all along. You're right, it is a very, very competitive situation out there yet. Typically, we find ourselves in the middle probably of pricing and sometimes toward the higher end of pricing and we will evaluate and continue to evaluate all of the situations in which we're bidding and if we feel that we need to get more aggressive, we will do so providing we see that it will put more dollars to the bottom line for us. And that's a job-by-job evaluation where you're running into those situations. Typically, the spread is pretty small in a lot of cases and then builder makes his decision on who he feels can provide him the best service, get the job done in a orderly manner and so that his construction can proceed on a planned basis and meet the time delivering expectation. Certainly, where a builder is primarily interested in price, a lot of those decisions, we will make the decision to walk away from it and maybe look at it the next time the bidding situation comes up, but all I can tell you is a constant process of evaluating the jobs on the benefits that it produces for the company.
Mike Dahl: Okay. Thanks. And it didn't look like just based on inventory balance that you were doing anything different seasonally -- than normal seasonality in terms of building inventory ahead of this. But have you guy's prices have continued to run in the first quarter? Have you done anything to effectively buy ahead and stock some additional inventory?
Chad Crow: Yeah, I think we prepared ourselves I think pretty well. We anticipated the run-up in the first quarter. You can't cover yourself a 100%, but I think we anticipated properly. We adjusted our inventories than in other aspects of the business. We saw where we can take inventory out and we did that to help offset the additional inventory we were putting in on the commodities fast turn items. So, I think we protected ourselves in a pretty fashion in the first quarter.
Mike Dahl: Got it. That's helpful. And then shifting gears slightly to some of the capacity investments, so it seems like setting up some investments this year, could you give us a little more color on if there's any specific markets or areas that you're working on any larger projects?
Chad Crow: Yeah, we were definitely -- our projects as we said earlier, really centered around the value add products. California, we view as an extremely attractive area for expansion and we're addressing that. There are areas in what I will say the Rocky Mountains and also Pacific Northwest area that we are expanding. The southeast is another area that offers we think still a lot of promise for us and so we're putting additional facilities into servicing that area of the company. So, I think we're somewhat broad-based I would say although most of it is designed specifically to really go after the very large MSA markets, that's where we're really concentrating the asset deployment.
Mike Dahl: That's great. Thank you.
Jennifer Pasquino: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group.
Nick Coppola: Hi. Good morning.
Floyd Sherman: Good morning.
Nick Coppola: So, I understand that you are already at $100 million cost savings run rate and that by the end of '17 you're projecting $100 million to $120 million. What's left to do and what would you need to see to get to the higher end of the range?
Floyd Sherman: I think the area where we have the most opportunity yet to come will be procurement and then on the G&A side. Most of the facility consolidation efforts are complete. We did negotiate additional rebate programs last year that we'll see a more of a full benefit for this year. And then on the G&A side for example as we go through 2017 there will be two legacy ProBuild ERP systems that we'll be able to sunset and unplug those and there's obviously a cost savings there and getting rid of the support for those systems. And we feel ongoing back-office consolidation efforts underway, that you'll continue to see us drive some incremental savings. So, those will be the primary areas.
Nick Coppola: Okay. That's helpful. And then just wanted to touch on the particularly strong performance and manufactured products of 18% year-over-year on a sales per day basis. Can you just talk more about I guess higher achieving that and then elaborate on maybe labor constraints through there?
Chad Crow: Yeah, I think in the manufactured products area, obviously, the labor conditions that exist in the industry are helping drive the demand for those products and we have been investing in our facilities, upgrading our facilities, putting ourselves in a position to take advantage of the expanding opportunities in that area. I think we are very, very focused as a company on driving value-added products and I think that's one of the things that the legacy BFS approach brought to this, the integration of our two companies in which we had stated in previous earnings calls that this was an advantage and an opportunity that we were looking to expand upon and we bought there was a lot of opportunity for. We have very good facilities and then obviously, this business requires really good people from the engineering support to the design, the estimating group, the manufacturing group, it's got to be able to react quickly to changing market conditions and be able to take on overload that can develop within a marketplace and you get known for your service and the quality of the product that you put out there. And very frankly we are not only the largest by far in this business. I think you will find a few audited -- the field you will find out that our reputation is the best and we're going to continue to expand them and work on that. But this is a real focus of our business. This is what we intend to really continue to strengthen in this business and where we have a very aggressive CapEx program to further expand this side of the business. So, that's really in a nutshell how we're doing it.
Nick Coppola: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Your next question comes from Will Randow from Citi.
Will Randow: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions and good morning, guys and Jen.
Floyd Sherman: Good morning.
Will Randow: You mentioned a handful have guided items and if my numbers are correct, operating leverage came in a little late that supported fourth quarter like we do to a pinch from lumber inflation. Can you rehash what your expectation for lumber inflation for 2017 is meaning, are you assuming current spot prices? How are you thinking about Canadian terrors the middle of this year and can go over explicit revenue EBITDA and free cash flow guidance again and the sensitivity if we see incremental lumber inflation?
Chad Crow: That's a few questions put together in one. I'll start with the lumber comment, based on the current look, we think it's worth about two to three points on the revenue line for us, for the first quarter and probably for the year, that's based on what we see today. I think we all acknowledge that the softwood lumber agreement is still a bit TBD and we want to work through that as it happens.
Floyd Sherman: But most of the feedback we're getting from our Canadian suppliers is that the market prices you're seeing now have already baked into the anticipated results of the softwood lumber agreement. So, they tend to think that where prices are now, they're probably going to trade in a fairly narrow band form this point on through the rest of the year, which as you know is very good for business. But the challenge will be and the real question will be when can we get those increases pass through. We'll be as aggressive as we can but you're also at the mercy of what your competitors are doing on any given market?
Will Randow: And could you go over your explicit revenue EBITDA and free cash flow guidance again and the sensitivity if we see incremental inflation?
Peter Jackson: So, revenue we can talk to that specifically, the commercial and multifamily we think we'll see continued declines there kind of flat to down. On the R&R, we do expect it to be in that 3% to 4% growth range and then single-family, the difference kind of in that low to mid-single digits in the first quarter, that would put us at an all-in number and that 6% to 8% and that was our -- I am sorry, it's 4% to 5% plus the inflation component of two to three points put us in the 6% to 8%. That two to three points of inflation is a revenue growth number we would expect to see based on where commodity lumber prices are right now.
Jennifer Pasquino: And then so gross profit margin on a year-over-year basis is probably going to be flat to down because we're lapping the benefit of commodity inflation last year. So, that's all in our number and that EBITDA range of $70 million, $75 million will include both our normalized EBITDA conversion, the revenue increase associated with higher commodity prices as well as the fact that last year Q1 we were still lapping it's gross profit margin expansion a little bit. So, we're going to get a little bit squeezed. So, I think all of that shaped out to that $70 million to $75 million for the quarter and we only gave cash flow guidance for the year at $145 million to $155 million. We haven’t given quarterly guidance, but if you want, we're happy to walk through those components. Would that be helpful, Will?
Will Randow: No, we can definitely catch you on the follow-up. In terms of share, where do you think you are picking up share? Is it in a specific category? And are there any opportunities in partnering with home centers that historically have been competitors for smaller customers or picking up share of some of the private competitors? 
Chad Crow: I think most of the shares is coming, the value-added products are leading the way and I think primarily because a lot of our smaller competitors don't even have that capability and so as more and more builders are looking for that as the solution to the labor shortages, that feed right into to our strategy. And I also feel like if you continue to see these higher lumber prices, I think that's going to start to squeeze some of the smaller suppliers as well who don't have the working capital needs to be able to grow their inventory balance and their AR balance in the higher priced environment.
Floyd Sherman: And I think another factor that Chad, that's very important, when we sell our value-add products, the manufactured products, we not only sell roof trusses and floor trusses and all the engineered lumber that go with it, but we also will lead and always try to sell panels to the builder before we start selling and we do have a framing system I'll just call the BFS system, better framing system, that we can offer as an alternative. But your first directive is always to try to sell panels. Now we are really again not all the leaders in the trust manufacturing, but also in panel manufacturing. The majority of the people in this business do not offer panels. Panels is really the better alternative than cost alternative for a builder in getting his home built quicker with less jobsite waste and many other advantages structurally. So, that is something that gives us an added advantage and opportunity to increase our product sales to that builder with value-add.
Will Randow: Thanks for that, guys, and congrats on the progress and good luck in '17.
Jennifer Pasquino: Thanks Will.
Floyd Sherman: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Al Kaschalk from Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Al Kaschalk: Good morning, guys.
Floyd Sherman: Good morning, Al.
Al Kaschalk: I wanted to focus on the regional comments that you could provide. In particular, were there any markets that you saw decline in the fourth quarter? Specifically, I'm thinking like California and maybe Texas? And then what is your prognosis here going forward if it is able to rectify short-term? 
Floyd Sherman: For the most we really have seen a broad base of support through all of our -- the markets in particular the real strength double digit gains in not only California, but also in the Carolinas and Georgia, Florida, the Pacific Northwest. Really, I would Taxes was what I will say a flat, a relatively flat market performance this year and would be heavily affected by what happened with the falloff in housing in Houston even though our people did a really good job of adjusting the business to that major change and Houston is such a huge part of the overall Texas market. Offsetting that is Austin, San Antonio, very strong for us as well as DFW. So, we really don't have any areas that I have any great concerns about or that I see and just all the areas were either flat to up as I said before, it's some of the markets well into double-digit.
Al Kaschalk: Okay. Thank you. And then my follow up if I may. I was hoping, and maybe this is one of the questions that we have been getting on the value-added product area relative to the BFS that you just mentioned. I know the longer-term trend is 50 -- I think 50 percentage points of revenue. But can you talk about where you are at say today? And then what's the major drivers to pick up percentage points of the portfolio in that area? Specifically, is it sales additions? What's going to drive that benefit? Because on the continuum of a margin perspective obviously, this has a little bit better contribution.
Chad Crow: Well I think the first step is going to be to fill in the holes in the geographies where we don't even offer some of the value-add products like truss and panel. And then as Floyd alluded to earlier, making sure you have the sales force to support the sale of those products. I think we've talked before yes, our long-term goal is to get our value mix back closer to that 50%. If you can move that 100 to 200 basis points a year, I think you're doing pretty damn good. So, it's not something that's going to happen overnight, but it's a continual investment in in the facilities to provide those products and an investment in the sales force and in some cases, educating the customers on the benefits of it. This has historically been a slow to change industry and sometimes you really got to take some customer by their hand and walk them through all the benefits and show them how the math works and get them to try it and in nice times out of ten, you get them to try it. They're not going to go back to stick framing. So, it's just a process.
Al Kaschalk: Okay. That's all I have. Thanks a lot, and congratulations on the strong finish.
Chad Crow: Thanks Al.
Operator: Our next question comes Matt McCall from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Matt McCall: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So, two questions for you. First, Chad, not to nitpick these savings numbers too much. But I noticed last quarter the G&A bucket was around $50 million to $59 million, now it is $70 million. I think you said that if you were able to get to the high end of the targeted range it would potentially come for procurement or G&A. Am I just reading too much into those dollars would be moving around a little bit or did something occur in the quarter that caused those estimates to get altered?
Chad Crow: No, I would say in general, the procurement side of it and I think we may have talked about this a quarter or two ago has proven to be the most difficult and not surprising that is the piece that's not really 100% in our control. And so, as we've gone through the process, some areas have proven out to be a little more difficult. Some areas we found opportunities we didn't know exist at the time we closed the acquisition. So as each quarter goes by, you learn a little more, find a little more and I think -- but all in all, we're going to come into that range that we had laid out from the beginning but yes there's probably been a little bit of moving between buckets from time to time.
Matt McCall: And then the -- so the $70 million, it is incremental savings that you found and I think an earlier question was where could the upside come from here. So, there is the potential that as you progress through 2017 there is still more to go. I'd just make sure I am not double counting there.
Peter Jackson: You're correct. There's more to go and I still feel good about by the end of '17, we'll be somewhere in the middle of that $100 million to $120 million range.
Matt McCall: Got it.
Peter Jackson: So, it would be an incremental $25 million or so that I would expect in '17.
Matt McCall: Perfect. Perfect. Okay. And then last question I had. You gave some gross margin commentary I think, Jen, thank you for that. That the SG&A outlook -- just making sure I understand the trajectory of what you are expecting this year. I think you talked about some savings initiatives, but you also talked about more salespeople. And I know it's baked into this incremental EBITDA. I just want to make sure I understand the trajectory of what you expect for SG&A maybe as a percent of sales in '17.
Peter Jackson: Well, typically the way I look at it and try to model it and it gets you in that 12% to 15% flow through is our SG&A usually runs about 70% variable to changes in sales volume. And so, if you're able to manage your SG&A in that manner and you typically need a little bit of gross margin expansion, you're going to fall somewhere into that 12% to 15% EBITDA flow through.
Matt McCall: Okay. And just a clarification on the 12% to 15%. That -- is that all in including the incremental savings from synergies or is that 12% to 15% plus the synergies.
Peter Jackson: No, that should be from the base business.
Matt McCall: Okay. Plus, the synergies. All right. Thank you.
Operator: And we have time for two more questions. Our next question comes from Keith Hughes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Keith Hughes: Thank you. Just going back to the first-quarter guidance, you talked about some of the breakdown. But as you look at the year, do you anticipate a year where you will see more growth in the second half of the year versus first half given that you do have tougher comps in the first half? What sort of shape should we expect from your peak point now?
Floyd Sherman: I wish I had that crystal ball, but yes, I would say in general, yeah, the weather comps really this year versus last year, this hasn’t been a horrific winner, but we've actually had a winner, where last year we didn't. And so, that's going to make the first quarter a little bit tougher comp. Other than that, I think it's going to be pretty even that would be my guess.
Keith Hughes: Okay. And on the lumber inflation coming September and quickly here. If the situation with Canada works out pretty quickly is that something you expect to come right back down or how much of this is just kind of a reaction as much as anything else?
Floyd Sherman: Well I think what we heard from our Canadian suppliers is if the agreement get settled where most think it will, you could see lumber prices come down a little bit from where they are today, but generally folks are thinking somewhere in that 360 to 370 range is where it will settle out more in the back half of the year.
Keith Hughes: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our last question from John Baugh of Stifel. Please go ahead.
John Baugh: Thank you. Good morning, Floyd, Peter, Jen, great year. Just a couple of things. One, could you quantify what the inflation impact in calendar '16 was negatively on EBITDA and then what you think that is for '17?
Jennifer Pasquino: On full year '16.
Peter Jackson: I did some simple math and it basically just said, had we sold our commodity lumber prices in '16 at the same margin percentage we did in '15, we would have $49 million more in gross profit dollars and if you assume staying 85% flow-through of debt to EBITDA you're somewhere around $40 million EBITDA impact. Now that's everything else being equal right, that's just a pretty simple analysis, but it does at least give you some idea on what that gross margin erosion in that category costs us.
John Baugh: Okay. That's helpful. And you mentioned an increase in sales force roughly starting I guess midyear last year. Is there any range of magnitude number wise we are talking about there?
Floyd Sherman: Well, we did talk quarter about, we talked to corporate carrier program where we incentivized our guys in the field to recruit salespeople and we agreed to carry some of that cost to corporate for a period of time. So far, we've hired about 125 salespeople on that program and if we have our way, I hope we get another 100 year this year.
Chad Crow: That's our goal.
John Baugh: And then I apologize if I missed it, but did you break out the value add percentage for the year '16 in comparing to '15 and what the delta was?
Jennifer Pasquino: The gross and value added products.
John Baugh: Yes.
Chad Crow: So, on Slide 6 you can see the 2016 value-added component noted by the dotted line.
Jennifer Pasquino: 10.2% was agreed on the value-added products for the year.
John Baugh: Super. Congrats on a great year and good luck going forward. 
Chad Crow: Thanks John.
Operator: And now I would like to turn it back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Floyd Sherman: Okay. We appreciate everyone joining the call today and we look forward to updating you on the progress of our business initiatives in the months ahead. If you have any follow-up questions don't hesitate to give Peter Jackson or Jen Pasquino a call and thanks and have a great finish to the week and we intend to have a great finish to the quarter.
Jennifer Pasquino: Thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect.

Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings call. Before I comment on the business, I'd like to provide an update on the integration and progress against our cost savings, then I will give a brief recap of the quarterly results and turn the call over to Chad, who'll discuss our financial results in more detail. And after my closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions. Let's begin our discussion on slide 5 with an overview of the progress we've made on the acquisition integration and synergy savings. The cost-savings opportunity we targeted of $100 million to $120 million are right on track. Synergies are being captured through network optimization, procurement and G&A cost. For fiscal 2016, we expect to realize approximately $70 million in savings in addition to the $10 million we realized in 2015. These 2016 projected savings include $10 million to $12 million in procurement initiatives where scale improves our purchasing leverage, $8 million to $9 million in network consolidation savings and $49 million to $52 million in overhead and SG&A savings, including benefit and 401(k) plans. We've realized $20 million in the third quarter. This is before one-time costs to achieve these synergies, which are estimated to be $30 million in 2016. We have successfully completed 77 conversions to Builders' proprietary ERP system to date with minimal disruptions or issues. Turning to slide 6, our value-added sales of manufactured products; windows, doors and millwork in the quarter increased 4% versus 2015 and 7% year-to-date over prior year. We believe our company is well positioned to help homebuilders mitigate the impact of well-publicized labor shortages and increased cycle times through our manufactured and value-added products across our national footprint. We will continue to focus on growing our value-added products faster than our overall sales. And before turning it over to Chad, I'll give you a brief recap of our results for the third quarter. Sales were $1.7 billion in the quarter. This is an increase of 3.1% in sales as compared to last year, excluding the impact of closed locations. We estimate that inflation benefited our sales by 2.6%. Sales in the quarter were impacted by continued construction labor constraints in many markets reflected in the U.S. Census as new residential construction start declines on a year-over-year basis. Excluding the impact of inflation and closed locations, our new residential volume sales grew by 1% in the quarter versus a 1.9% decline in starts as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau including growth in single-family starts of 2% and multifamily declines of 8.6%. Our repair and remodel sales grew 2.8% in the quarter versus prior year. Our integration efforts remain a major priority for the company and the EBITDA contribution from these cost savings initiatives was $20 million in the quarter. As a result, I believe the internal focus to deliver on all of the integration priorities may be impacting our ability to grow share, but believe that this is the right long-term strategy for our business. I'll now turn the call over to Chad who will review our financial results in more detail.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning, everyone. I will first discuss the quarter results on slide 8. As a reminder, we have reflected pro forma adjusted figures to include ProBuild's financial results prior to the closing date as adjusted for one-time integration, closure and other costs. For the third quarter, we reported net sales of $1.7 billion, a 3.1% increase compared to pro forma sales for the third quarter of 2015, excluding the impact of closed locations. To be clear, when we speak of closed locations, we are not normalizing for acquisition-related overlapping market closures. We intend to retain those sales. These are closures in non-overlapping markets that are closed for other business reasons. Sales, excluding the impact of closed locations, grew 3.1% over pro forma sales for the third quarter of 2015, benefited by an estimated 2.6% from commodity price inflation. We estimate that our sales volume, excluding inflation and closed locations, grew 1% in the new residential building end market and increased 2.8% in the repair and remodel end market, offset by declines in commercial and other. Breaking down our third-quarter 2016 sales by key product categories, value-added products, including manufactured products, windows, doors and millwork, were $659 million, up 4% from 2015. Lumber and lumber sheet goods were $588 million, up 7.3% from 2015, aided by commodity inflation in the quarter. Our other categories were down collectively compared to last year on a pro forma basis as our gypsum, metal and concrete products were impacted by the decline in multifamily and commercial sales. From a product mix standpoint, our value-added product categories made up a higher percentage of our overall pro forma sales as our prefabricated components, windows, doors and millwork categories accounted for 37.8% of sales in the third quarter of 2016, a 40-basis-point improvement over quarter three last year and are up 70 basis points year-to-date. Our gross margin percentage was 25%, down approximately 90 basis points from 25.9% last year, but improved versus last quarter by 10 basis points. The decrease on a year-over-year basis was primarily due to a combination of commodity price deflation benefits in 2015 and commodity price inflation in 2016. Although commodity price inflation generally benefits the company's operating result in the long-term, it can cause short-term gross margin percentage compression when prices are rising and margin percentage expansion when prices are falling. This is due to the short-term pricing commitments we provide our customers versus the volatility in the commodity markets. Last year gross margins were benefited by approximately 65 basis points in the quarter as commodity prices were falling in the third quarter last year. Conversely, gross margins dragged in the third quarter of this year by approximately 40 basis points due to commodity inflation. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales, excluding depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and one-time acquisition and integration expenses, decreased by 80 basis points on a year-over-year basis. These cost improvements were primarily due to the $18 million of SG&A synergies realized in the quarter, partially offset by incremental commission costs incurred during the quarter related to our concerted effort to recruit new salespeople, who we generally offer a guaranteed commission minimum for initial period as they build their book of business. We also experienced unfavorable medical claims activity, that were reserved for in the current quarter. GAAP interest expense in the quarter of $92.3 million included $53.3 million of refinancing cost associated with the restructuring of our long-term debt. These refinancing costs include the call premium associated with retiring the company's 7.625% notes due 2021, cost associated with issuing $750 million of 5.625% notes due 2024, and re-pricing our previous senior secured term loan facility with a new $470 million senior secured term loan facility at an interest reduction of 1.25%. Absent these expenses, adjusted interest expense was $39 million in the third quarter of 2016, a $5.2 million reduction compared to the pro forma adjusted third quarter 2015, attributable to debt repayments and a series of transactions that have reduced the company's interest burden. The company recorded $131.5 million in income tax benefit in the three months ended September 30, 2016. This credit can be largely attributed to the release of a substantial portion of our valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets in the quarter. This benefited our GAAP net income by $117.6 million in the third quarter. We've excluded this one-time benefit of releasing the tax valuation allowance from our adjusted net income. As a result of the company's substantial federal net operating loss carryforwards, we do not anticipate paying any federal income taxes in 2016 and only expect to pay $4 million to $6 million in state and other taxes. Adjusted net income was $69.2 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, compared to $34.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2015 on a pro forma adjusted basis. This improvement was largely a result of the operating synergies realized, interest savings as a result of refinancing activities, and the reduction of step-up depreciation and amortization associated with the ProBuild acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA was $118.3 million, or 6.8% of sales, compared to $116 million, or 6.8%of sales, for the pro forma adjusted third quarter of 2015, driven largely by synergy cost savings initiatives totaling $20 million before one-time costs to implement, offset by $18 million of commodity driven gross profit margin compression on our lumber and lumber sheet goods category. We have provided an adjusted EBITDA reconciliation on slide 13. Turning to slide 9, the company has executed six capital market transactions this year to improve our financial flexibility, with a cumulative go forward annual interest savings of approximately $34 million. We are always evaluating opportunistic transactions to lower our interest expense or otherwise address our capital structure. In the third quarter, we issued $750 million of senior secured notes, providing an extended maturity to 2024, as well as an attractive 5.625% coupon. We used the proceeds from that offering to redeem all of our outstanding 7.625% notes due 2021 to repay $125 million of our borrowings under the previous term loan facility. Additionally, through an amendment to the company's term loan agreement, the new term loan facility provided an interest reduction of 1.25%. We have meaningfully extended the maturity of our debt portfolio to a weighted average of over seven years, transitioned a larger portion of our debt from variable to fixed rates and reduced our go forward interest expense. In October, we repurchased $50 million aggregate principal amount of our 10.75% senior notes due 2023. This transaction reduced the company's go forward interest by approximately $5 million to approximately $134 million annually. This transaction was funded by the company with a combination of cash generated from operations as well as short-term borrowings on the revolving credit facility. There are about six years until our first debt maturity; the company expects to make significant strides in de-levering the balance sheet between now and then. Adjusted pro forma EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis was $373.2 million and net debt was $1.969 billion as of September 30, 2016. This implies a leverage multiple of 5.3 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. The company reduced its net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio from 6.5 times one year ago. Turning to slide 10, we expect free cash flow generation will give us the opportunity to reduce debt over the next several years. Our business typically uses cash in the first half and generates cash in the second half of the year. Due to seasonal working capital needs, year-to-date cash used in operations and investing was $73.4 million, including $35.6 million of one-time call premiums and fees associated with retiring the company's 7.625% notes due 2021, which was included in cash used in operations. Excluding these refinancing costs, cash used in operations and investing was $37.8 million through September. Excluding these one-time financing costs, cash used from operations and investing was in line with our expectations and annual guidance of $75 million to $85 million in positive cash flow for the year. Total liquidity at September 30, 2016 was $632 million, consisting of net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand. We expect to reduce debt over the next several years with cash generation. We believe this will be driven by EBITDA growth including projected annual cost savings realization of $100 million to $120 million by the end of 2017 and a focus on working capital efficiency which we believe will run between 9% and 10% of incremental sales. We expect to invest in our business through capital expenditures at approximately 1.5% of sales. We plan to utilize our substantial carryforward NOLs the shelter us from paying federal cash taxes through 2016 and most, if not all, of 2017. In 2016, we expect one-time integration cost of approximately $30 million. As a result, we expect to generate approximately $75 million to $85 million in cash flow for full-year 2016 including the one-time financing costs. This is consistent with previous guidance. As a result of the opportunistic capital market transactions executed this year, go forward cash interest should be reduced to $133 million in 2017; assuming the midpoint of expected synergy savings, this should benefit 2017 by an additional $30 million over 2016 with one-time cost expectations for 2017 to drop to $20 million. Once we have the synergies fully realized and one-time costs behind us, we expect the company's cash flow will significantly increase on a go forward basis. Should market conditions unexpectedly accelerate or decelerate, we have the ability to quickly adjust our capital spending and working capital accordingly to help mitigate the impact on our cash flow. As we're now 10 months into the year, I would like to provide some color on the fourth quarter of 2016, and how we are currently thinking about 2017. In the fourth quarter of this year, we will have two less selling days than Q4 of last year which could impact our growth by 2% to 3%, so I will refer to sales per day growth. From an end market growth perspective, we expect to see continued declines in the multifamily and commercial end markets. If single family starts grow with the 4% rate we have seen across the second and third quarters and on our growth is also a 4%, we would expect the blended average market growth to be 2.5% to 3% on the sales per day basis. On top of that, we could see a couple points of growth from commodity price inflation on a year-over-year basis. That's a long way of saying sales per day should be up about 5% for the quarter but actual sales dollars for the quarter would likely be up 2% to 3% since we are losing two ship days. From a gross margin perspective, we will continue to lap the benefits of commodity deflation last year versus commodity inflation this year, but on a sequential basis, we expect gross margin to increase by 10 basis points to 20 basis points versus the 25% we saw in the third quarter. Synergy savings are expected to contribute $22 million, but we're lapping $10 million of synergy realization from Q4 2015, so the incremental year-over-year benefit will be approximately $12 million. As you can see, a lot of the same dynamics are in place for Q4 that we saw in the third quarter, Gross margin comps will still be a challenge and we will begin to lap synergies, so I would expect Q4 EBITDA to be flat to up slightly versus Q4 EBITDA last year. Next year, our expectations for growth in single family starts are in the mid to high single-digit range, with multifamily and commercial down mid single-digits and R&R up 3% to 5%. Whether single family starts can grow at the high end of that range, will in our opinion depend on the severity of labor constraints. We do not anticipate much of a year-over-year impact from commodity prices on our sales. If all these assumptions were to play out, that would represent sales growth in the 5% range and we would hope to do a little better than that through share gains. The year-over-year commodity-driven gross margin compression should be largely behind us next year, allowing us to expand our gross margin and get back to a more normalized EBITDA conversion of 12% to 15%. EBITDA benefits from synergy cost savings are expected to contribute an additional $30 million over savings realized in 2016, getting us to the midpoint of our synergy cost savings target. Components of cash flow should be consistent with 2016 with the exception of lower interest from the re-financings we executed this year and reduced one-time integration expenses. I'll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Chad. Turning to our outlook, I remain positive about the future of our company. I believe the housing industry remains on a trajectory of steady growth although hampered in the short-term by construction labor availability. This can be seen in the declines in new residential housing starts reported by the Census Bureau for the third quarter in the busiest time of the building season. I'm not surprised that the labor-driven constraints were a governor to the growth in the single-family construction on a year-over-year basis. Oil-related markets continue to be a drag on our overall sales growth. And we believe the overall multifamily market will continue its decline in the balance of the year. To mitigate the impact to our top-line, we are focused on growth with national builders, who are capturing share as well as leveraging the significant growth we are seeing in other markets such as the Pacific Northwest, Colorado, Utah. Our company is well-positioned to be the building supply company of choice for builders around the country, thanks to our geographic reach, enhanced product offerings, national manufacturing capabilities and superior customer service. Our focus will be to leverage our national scale and scale the capability to grow faster than the market with a focus on profitable growth on value-added products. These strengths are a scale and a potential leverage provided by the synergy savings combine to make Builders FirstSource an industry leader with significant growth opportunities. I believe we will continue to create value for our shareholders. And I attribute the success we've achieved in both the integration efforts as well as the strong results we've posted since the ProBuild acquisition to all of our hard-working and dedicated associates. Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our first question from John Baugh of Stifel. Please go ahead.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Chad, maybe you could start, just refresh my memory where will we be on a delta as cash interest expense 2017 versus 2016.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think it will be probably $30 million or so.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thank you. And then a broader question, as it relates to the labor and the impact on construction activity, are you not only seeing the starts delayed because of that issue but in the elongation as well of a start to a finish and, therefore, delay of when you're selling product to the construction trade?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah, I don't think there's any question about that, John. In our estimation, we think it's added somewhere between two-plus months to the cycle and with the labor delays and the labor issues that we're facing out there in the field.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then the declines that you're seeing in commercial, could you maybe elaborate, and I don't think it was much of the legacy Builders FirstSource business, but maybe you could define that market a little bit more granularly on what you're seeing going on there?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, lot of the commercial we do is up in the Northeast and part of gypsum business, and that's why you're seeing that impact in that product category.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then last question is just back to the lumber situation, so it would be our expectation, and I'm looking at 2017 not 2016, that if we assume lumber prices I guess at this level for the whole entire year, that that would be a favorable gross margin trend for you versus the headwind you'd see this year? And what would be the headwind if you could break it out on gross margin in basis points that you now expect for 2016 from lumber inflation?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well I think the first part of your question was if lumber prices stay where they are today, yeah, it would be a slight positive for us, next year, and obviously shouldn't be much of a gross margin issue if prices are relatively flat. I think the second part of your question was full year 2016, what was the impact of commodity inflation on our gross margin, is that your question?
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Correct, and I guess you comparing to your prior where you had some deflation so there was both the impact negatively this year, but I'm really kind of trying to assess what that number was for the entire year on a year-over-year basis point degradation?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, for this year is probably a 30-basis-point drag. Last year, probably a full year benefit of, I'd say, 50 basis points to 60 basis points probably.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thank you. I'll divert it to others. Good luck.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, John.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Rob Hansen of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. I just wanted to kind of revisit the system change over with ERP, are you on plan, are there any integration issues and is the kind of continued market share losses factored into that 4Q guidance?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I would say, yes, the conversions are on right on track. That's probably been the brightest spot, in my opinion of the whole integration, so far is how well that process has gone. I think by the end of the year, we will be up to somewhere around 90 locations converted, which is consistent with where we thought we would be. As we mentioned last quarter, and as Floyd mentioned just recently in his opening comments, yes, we are busy with integration and it's taking up a lot of time internally. So to some degree I would think that's got to be impacting our sales growth or our share gains. And so yeah, when I'm trying to forecast or give some guidance on Q4, I'm certainly basing that off of recent trends that we've seen in sales, which would include some degree of those integration efforts in that level of distraction.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then what did you see in October here, I would assume that it's consistent with what you've reported in the guidance?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. Obviously, I took October into account and the sales in October were consistent with that guidance I just gave.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then I...
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: We don't lose those extra days really until December.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: We haven't seen that. And the reason we're losing too, just so you know, one, is just because of the way the calendar fill, the other one is we have decided to move the New Year's holiday back into the end of this year just for various reasons, it's helping with our payroll conversion that we have going live at the beginning of the year. So typically you would never lose two days in a quarter, but this year we are, but one of those days it's specific to us.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. I think you also mentioned hiring some salespeople. Is this in new regions or is it because maybe you lost some people? What's kind of driving this?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: No, the salesmen adds are pretty much spread uniformly all through all of our regions. A little bit in the higher sales area, we definitely have added more people proportionately. But, no, a lot of it is due to the fact that we need more feet on the street, the – we need a lot of our sales people – our current salespeople are operating at pretty full capacity and we need to increase the amount of new customer adds and making sure that we're taking care of current customers as they expand their footprints and as they expand the number of subdivision offerings in the market and so forth. And so we just – we're trying to get ahead of it and we're trying to be more aggressive in the marketplace and it's an investment in our future and we found that this has really paid off for us in the past and a lot of this – I really attribute some of it to the diversion of our management time due to the integration of the companies. And when you're changing the number of things that we're changing for our operating people, when you start changing benefit plans, paid plans, commission plans, now also to get SOX compliant with segregation of duty, issues, you just get so much of your management time in the operations is spent addressing people questions and people issues, customer issues, related especially where you're doing computer conversions and changing people, and the way they're being invoiced and so forth. We really are focusing as much on the market development, market build and you've really got to stay a year ahead and we're making up for that ground. We're going to get ourselves back ahead of the game again. And the year 2017 for the most part, the integration issues will be behind us and I think the salesman add definitely fell short due to the fact that we were preoccupied with so many other issues. So that's the long and short of it.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Well, I appreciate the commentary. Thanks guys.
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, Rob.
Operator: We will take our next question from Nick Coppola of Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Hi, good morning.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Hey, Nick. Good morning.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Wanted to ask about your view of the cycle here. I know you talked about mid to high single-digit growth in 2017 for single-family construction. I wanted to just get your thoughts about the – I guess more color on the recent slowdown here. And your thoughts going forward on the residential cycle.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: In my opinion, I feel like the shortage of labor is a big issue right now. I think the demand for new homes is still very strong, I think during the second quarter and third quarter of this year, which, as Floyd mentioned earlier, during the busiest time of the year as far as the amount of building going on, it makes sense that you're going to hit kind of that labor availability ceiling during those busier quarters, and I really think that's what we were seeing reflected in the single-family starts. So we're still building more houses than we were a year ago from a single-family standpoint. And so, we solved some of the labor issue over the last year. I think, it will continue to get solved, but I still think over the coming years labor is going to act as a governor. I think, the demand is there to carry improved building conditions for several more years. But, I think, it's just going to be kind of at a muted growth rate because of the availability of labor.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. And I would agree with what Chad is saying and I would add one other aspect to it. It's not only the availability of labor, but it's also the cost element that's associated with that labor. The cost are inflating at a very, very concerning rate and for builders and especially for the large multifamily project developers, this is a real issue and in many cases, especially on multifamily, those projects have been laid out and bid almost a year before they're really started and their labor factor is factored in. And when all of a sudden before your project starts, you realize you may be underwater with the current rates of labor then you're going to pull back on it and you're going to delay the start even further. I think as we look to next year, single-family this year is going to be up about 8% over where it was last year. Multifamily is going to be down slightly, from where it was last year. I think this coming year in 2017, we're going to see that 9% – 8%, 9% again gain in single-family, but I think single-family is going to be held next year. I think multifamily is going to be a lot weaker next year. I think, you're going to see a labor substitution going from multifamily to become more available to the single-family builders. And I think, the labor costs are going to start getting a lot more under control. We've seen a lot more labor cost inflation on the multifamily side than we've seen in the single-family side. But I think, labor is beginning to realize that they may be putting themselves into jeopardy and business may start slowing down unless their cost become a little bit more controlled, then I think we're going to start seeing that. So I think next year single-family is going to be pretty healthy again. That's good for us because we certainly have a lot more concentration on the single-family side. I think, multifamily even though it's important to us and we do a pretty fair amount of business in that area, that's going to be a lot tighter, but I think we have a lot more room to expand our presence in multifamily, so I think we can mitigate some of the slowdown that we're going to see in multifamily. So all-in-all, that's – I think, we all feel next year we'll continue working on – trying to address the labor supply problems as we did this year. And all in all, I think, next year is going to mirror a lot of what we've seen this year.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah, and I think that's a good point, and I mentioned earlier whether we grow at a mid-single-digit or high single-digit in single-family next year, it's going to be dependent on the availability of labor. And to Floyd's point, if we can see some of that labor move over from multifamily to single-family, then I think we got a shot at being on the high end of the range. If it stays tight like it's been in the last couple of quarters, then we may be at the low end of the range. So, we'll just have to wait and see how the labor issue resolves itself.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: But I think, we're also seeing a trend taking place in housing that certainly we have to be – pay a lot of attention to and it definitely affects a lot of our value-add products. That is – what's really the momentum part of housing now is that first-time homebuyer and a first-time move-up buyer, in essence the homes that are $300,000 and less, the higher-priced homes are much more stagnant in growth. And I think, a lot of that is attributable to certainly some of the oil related issues in those areas, and as well as around the country with the slowness of – that our economy is recovering. And so the lower-priced home is less square footage, but you don't have near the number of upgrades in the home. You don't have the number of windows that go into a larger home. You don't have as much interior millwork and finish out. And so it puts a lot more pressure on our operations and to grow our sales in the window and door category, as well as other molding trends and so forth. So we are addressing that and we continue to work to improve our penetration into the lower-priced home area. And we've – but next year, I think, our growth in those product areas probably are going to look more like it's done this year.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Trusses and component is going to be very strong for us
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Got you. Got you. Well, appreciate hearing your view. That all makes a lot of sense. And then I guess kind of transitioning a bit second question here is about your cost savings initiatives for procurement particularly, it looks like you've got a savings estimate for 2016 of $10 million to $12 million. I wanted to get an update on where you are in terms of negotiations with vendors if that's complete and if it was in line with expectations?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: We've pretty much finished. We've got one more larger category that's our millwork and trim category, but all the rest of the categories are finished and we're in a transition period when you transition to a new vendor, especially you bring in the change in product and so forth, it takes time because a lot of times we're committed for certain period of time with a line of products that may change, and so we don't get the immediate advantage of the price reduction that we've negotiated. It also involves when you get back-end rebates and so forth. But everything is progressing right as we had anticipated. I think, we're going to deliver the numbers that overall that we said. While we may come up a little bit short in one area, but then you make it up in another area, but right now certainly the procurement area looks really good to us.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: And we'll next hear from Will Randow of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Hey, Will.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Chad, your commentary on demand and kind of thinking about 2017 as well, I guess, there's two related questions there, number one, this spring was a little earlier than last and this summer was a little hotter than last, as you kind of think about next year, how should we be thinking about volume comparisons given that the first half is probably tougher comps and second half is probably easier comps? And then in terms of your outlook on lumber inflation, how are you guys thinking about the trade agreement given you probably more focused on it than I am?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think, you're right, if you want to talk kind of quarterly comps next year, from a volume standpoint. As I sit here today, Q1 would likely be the toughest, because, as you mentioned, we had a really mild winter and the construction activity really exceeded everyone's expectations in the first quarter of this year. And then I think Q2, Q3, and we'll see how Q4 plays out should all be kind of right there in the same boat together. I don't know, Floyd, you're probably closer to the trade agreement than I am, any commentary on that?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: On the lumber side?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: On the softwood agreement.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. You know, it's still anticipated that there will be a trade agreement. I'm talking with some of our Canadian suppliers. They are I think looking for an agreement to be put into place sometime early to late spring. I think, in anticipation of that, I think what you're seeing now in the futures market is reflecting an increase in anticipated pricing certainly with the new trade agreement, they're anticipating that we will get a lift in pricing on the lumber products. Right now, lumber is softening. I think a lot of that had to do with the fact that a lot of inventory in the system that needs to get flushed out. People anticipated a lot stronger housing market, and especially multifamily market, than what occurred. And so some of that is just getting the inventories adjusted. But I think, next year, certainly first quarter next year, we're going to see a higher cost structure on our commodity products than what we have right now. And I think that's probably in terms 7% to 10%. And I think next year all-in that that's going to pretty much carry through the entire year. And I think probably on an overall average 10% to 15% on increasing commodity prices.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for that. And as a follow-up, it's pretty apparent that the homecenters are trying to make a push into the small pro-contractor. Obviously, you guys are going to play with a bit bigger contractor so to speak. Have you seen any impact from that? Obviously, as volumes improve meaning more houses one guy does that plays towards your business model, but have you seen any sort of impact from the homecenters trying to move into your business model?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: No, I've not really seen much of a change in that area. We've only been really associated with the ProBuild operations now for about a year and a half, and they did a lot more of the small contractor business than we did, especially through the Midwest and Far West. From what our people are saying is that that really has not become anymore noticeable. Probably Menards is more heavily involved in the small contractor business in the markets in which we operate in, and more so than Home Depot and Lowe's, even though Home Depot and Lowe's are in those markets as well. In the Menards area, surprising they – in many of the areas they pulled their sales force from the field and so that they brought them all back into the store, and we really see that that might actually help us and give us an advantage in some of the areas where we compete where our people are in the field calling on those contractors. But other than that, really haven't seen any appreciable change.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for that, and congrats on the progress.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks.
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, Will.
Operator: We will next hear from Trey Grooms of Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, good morning.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning, Trey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Chad, I guess this one's for you. With the synergy targets you've laid out for – you guys have been talking for a while, but you kind of reiterated, I guess, for next year the incremental synergies flowing through. How should we be thinking about the SG&A there? Is it still kind of that 65% variable? I know that's been the case in the past, is that how we should still kind of be thinking about that as we look into 2017??
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah, on the base business, I think it was still be in that 65% to 70% range and then you can layer on the cost savings on top of that
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Got it. So the cost savings would be in addition.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Right.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: And just to be clear that does exclude – that fixed portion excludes or doesn't include D&A I should say, right?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Right.
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: And then just remember that that $30 million in incremental savings, some of it's going to be in COGS and some it's going to be in SG&A.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: And remind us of that split again, is it about kind of 60%, 30% somewhere there?
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: It's more like 75%.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: 40%, I should say.
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah, 75%-25%.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then I guess, just a housekeeping, and maybe I've missed this when you're kind of going through some of your thoughts on next year, Chad, but CapEx range for next year?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think, it will still be in that 1.5%, like we've been running 1.5% of sales.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's it from me. Thanks a lot, and good luck, guys.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, Trey.
Operator: We will take our next question from Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: I have just a couple of – two follow-ups, really more clarifications. Floyd in your prepared remarks, or at least in the press release, you talked about competitive environment in certain regions increasing and I was hoping you could elaborate whether that'd be geographic or particular parts of the business?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: The competitive environment is still very, very competitive throughout our area. In some of the areas, especially in the oil impacted areas, Southwest, Balkan area, Alaska, the competitive environment has increased. Due to the shrinkage of the market and you still have the same people in the market competing for that business and the – it's gotten a lot tougher, so not only are you battling a shrinking housing market, but you are battling a really increased competitive pricing situation. The rest of the markets, I would say, the – it is still the competitiveness is not a lot improved or changed from a year ago. And it's still very competitive, but nothing like we're experiencing in the oil related areas. I will also say in the commercial multi-family arena, especially in the Northeast, down into the mid-Atlantic, the competitive pressures there, especially as it relates to the gypsum operations, have really gotten intense. And again, a lot of that is the shrinkage in the market. As you know, especially in the New York City, the Metro New York area, a tremendous, almost a 50% fall off in multi-family and that was a dominant part of the housing in that market, and so for whatever the available work everybody's really, really fighting for and you know, margins have gotten a lot thinner, but that's – I hope that gives you some coverage that you're looking for to the point.
Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Yes, no that's great. What spurned the question on my end is if we took a step back and looked at the pro forma numbers, and I know there's a lot of moving parts here, but if we see the revenue growth, yet the EBITDA dollar actual contribution was small, and so I'm just – I'm trying to grasp onto is are you having to move product by cutting price and hence the competition comment or if there's other dynamics going on where there are markets you now think maybe you need to reevaluate whether you need to be there at the size or scale that you were there previously. So I guess the border question there is, if there's anything you could add to why on the pro forma basis that EBITDA dollar growth wasn't as good as the revenue growth.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, obviously a lot of that is the gross margin compression we are dealing with. Probably some of the toughest margin comps I've seen in the 17 years I've been here. Round numbers we lost 100 basis points of gross margin quarter-over-quarter, but still held our EBITDA margin flat, so that obviously speaks to the synergies we're getting out of the business. Now we didn't get some of the incremental this quarter that I thought we would get to be honest and part of that we explained that – earlier is the commission, incremental commission expense and some negative trends on group health, but even if you look on a year-to-date basis, our sales are up a little less than 5% and we've grown our EBITDA margin 110 basis points even with 30 basis points or so on a year-to-date basis of gross margin compression. So, yeah, it's been a rough quarter or two quarters from a comp standpoint, but if you look over the longer period, the year-to-date period, I think, we've done a really nice job of delivering on the cost savings and improving that EBITDA margin in what was a fairly tough sales and gross margin environment from a comp standpoint.
Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: I agree. Yeah, no, thank you for that color and good luck, guys. Thank you.
Operator: We have time for two more questions. We'll take the next question from Keith Hughes of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. You had talked about some numbers for the fourth quarter. There's always lots of charges in your numbers given the big merger. The modest increase in EBITDA over prior year, is that off a $76 million number in the prior year in the fourth quarter?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: That's right
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And you're talking, it sounds roughly about the same kind of dollar increase year-over-year that we saw here in the third. And this gets into the last question. Are you still struggling with in the lumber business, quoted activity that you're dealing with higher lumber prices than when the quotes came in?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. Well, we're still dealing with some of that bleed over for sure, not quite as bad – not as bad but, yeah, you – you know, typically even if the builder issued a PO four months ago and for whatever reason he just now asks for the product to be shipped. We would still honor that old pricing. So, yeah, there's still a little bit of bleed over, but to Floyd's point not like it was.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And that's why I'm a little confused that you're not talking about – given the you're still $12 million of incremental improvement in EBITDA from your synergies. I'm just a little surprised you're not talking about something that's well into the 80s versus whatever range it's in. Is there some other offset there?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, part of it is, the two less shipping days, one of those being a holiday. So we're not getting the revenue and we're still incurring the payroll expense. And again we're still going to have – this will probably be the most difficult gross margin comp we have on a quarter-over-quarter basis for Q4. So you know I feel really good about once we get into next year and get this tough comp environment behind us that, as I said earlier, we'll get back to a more normalized margin contribution, EBITDA margin contribution on incremental sales.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, and then moving – excuse me – looking at products within the quarter, there were two areas and you've sort of talked about this in the introduction, two areas where we saw pretty substantial negatives year-over-year; the gypsum, roofing, insulation and siding, metal and concrete products. At least some of those were up pretty good in the third quarter. I guess, are those in branches that specialize in those products or are those co-mingled with the other products you sell in the traditional ProBuild or Builders FirstSource branch?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: There is some co-mingling, but a large portion of it is specialized branches, especially when you're talking the gypsum side of the business.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And is that something that – we've had several negative quarters, is that something that you plan to stay in long term? It seems like it's really pulling down the growth numbers for the company.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: We're always evaluating different parts of the business for whatever reason, right now we have no plans to exit any part of the business or there may be a location here or there that we're looking at that's underperforming, but we have no broad plans right now to close locations either, but to your point it is something we're continually evaluating.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then in siding, metal and concrete products, can you give us any feel there, which of those was the weakest?
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: So the metal is the gypsum metal...
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right.
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: ...essentially, so you get gypsum and metal, but – and you are – concentration of gypsum business is largely in the Northeast quarter, which is the most impacted on a multi-family – we've been commercial there too basis, so that's a big drive for us across both. And then I want to remind guys that our roofing business is largely an aggressive R&R business for us, and in Q3 last year there was in that area more storms, so more roofing, so we had a little bit of lap, we had pretty good growth in Q3 on a pro forma basis last year in roofing. So I'm not sure that we feel any of those, declines are kind of systemic outside of the fact that in the markets they play in, if multi-family is down 9%, our gypsum business and especially in the Northeast was down even more – it could be more impacted.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: On the roofing business, very directly attributable when you look at the locations that had last in 2015 the benefit of some – a lot of hailstorm activity as well as tornadoes, and they haven't had it this year and that's where in those particular markets is where we've seen the shortfall in sales. The rest of the roofing operations are all performing very nicely.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We have time for one more question. There are no further questions. So that does conclude the question portion of today's call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Floyd Sherman for closing remarks.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Okay. We appreciate everyone joining the call today, and we look forward to updating you on the progress of our business initiatives in the months ahead. If you have any follow-up questions, don't hesitate to give Chad or Jen a call. Thanks and have a great day.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Jennifer Pasquino, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jennifer Pasquino - SVP, Investor Relations: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Builders FirstSource second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today is Floyd Sherman, Chief Executive Officer of Builders FirstSource; and Chad Crow, President and Chief Financial Officer. A copy of the slide presentation referenced on this call is available on the Investor Relations sections of the Builders FirstSource website at www.bldr.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. Any reproduction of this call, in whole or in part, is not permitted without prior written authorization of Builders FirstSource. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, August 5, 2016. Builders FirstSource issued a press release after the market closed yesterday. If you don't have a copy, you can find it on our website at bldr.com. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we may make statements concerning the company's future prospects, financial results, business strategies and industry trends. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Please refer to our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC and other reports filed with the SEC for more information on those risks. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. The acquisition of ProBuild closed on July 31, 2015, the closing date. As a result, ProBuild's financial results are only included in the company's GAAP financial statements from the closing date forward and are not reflected in the company's historical financial statements. We have, therefore, provided supplemental financial information of the combined company in this press release that is pro forma or adjusted to include ProBuild's financial results for the relevant periods prior to the closing date. The company will discuss these pro forma and adjusted results from this call. We have provided reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents in our earnings press release and detailed explanations of non-GAAP financial measures in our Form 8-K filed yesterday, both of which are available on our website. At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Floyd Sherman.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings call. Before I comment on the business, I'd like to provide an update on the integration and progress against our cost savings, then I'll give a brief recap of the quarterly results and turn the call over to Chad, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions. Let's begin our discussion on slide 5 with an overview of the progress that we've made on the acquisition integration and synergy savings. It's been a year since the acquisition of ProBuild closed. The cost saving opportunities we targeted of $100 million to $120 million are right on track. Synergies are being captured through network optimization, procurement and general and administrative costs with a breakout of about 20%, 30% and 50% expected for each area respectively. For 2016, we expect to realize an incremental $70 million in savings over 2015. These savings include $12 million to $14 million in projected procurement initiatives where scale improves our purchasing leverage, $7 million to $8 million in projected network consolidation savings and $48 million to $50 million in projected overhead and SG&A savings including benefit and 401(k) plans. We realized $22 million in the second quarter. This is before one-time cost to achieve these synergies which is estimated to be $30 million in 2016. We have successfully completed 46 conversions through Builders' proprietary ERP system with minimal disruptions or issues. We have created a more diversified company with enhanced scale and improved geographic footprint. Since the close, employee and customer attrition has been minimal. We are the leading distributor of lumber and building products to the professional building channel. And with our presence in 40 states and 74 of the top 100 MSAs, we are striving to become the supplier of choice for national homebuilders. Our national scale facilitates strategic partnerships with customers and suppliers. This allows for better customer reach and less exposure to any one market. With 24% of our sales attributed to the repair and remodel end market, we've also reduced cyclicality through broader sales exposure. The repair and remodel end market has proven historically to provide a more stable revenue base with strong growth profit margins and good returns. Now, turning to slide 6. Our value-added sales of manufactured products, windows, doors and millwork in the quarter increased 5.4% versus 2015. And mix in these products increased 80 basis points over the prior year. We believe our company is well-positioned to help homebuilders mitigate the impact of well publicized labor shortages and increased cycle times through our manufactured and value-added products across our national footprint. And we'll continue to focus on growing our value-added products faster than the overall sales. Before turning it over to Chad, I'll give a brief recap of our results for the second quarter. Sales were $1.7 billion in the quarter. This is an increase of 4% in sales volume as compared to last year excluding the impact of closed locations and deflation and we grew adjusted EBITDA by 16.5% or $16.5 million. EBITDA growth in the quarter was driven by our synergy cost savings initiatives. Sales fell short of our expectations largely as a result of weather in April and May and a continued construction labor constraints in many markets. Although our overall sales in the quarter were a bit lower than we had expected, our June sales were up 5.4%. Additionally, our integration efforts remain a major priority for the company, and the EBITDA contribution from these cost-saving initiatives are significant. As a result, I believe that we may be growing a little bit slower than the market as a result of the internal focus to deliver on the integration priorities. I am committed to putting these distractions behind us as quickly as possible to get back to growing the top line faster than market. Now in excluding the impact of deflation in closed locations, our single family new residential volume sales grew 4.1% in the quarter and 11.2% in the first half. Multi-family sales volume declined 3.2% and 3.5% in the quarter and year-to-date June respectively. Repair and remodel grew 7.3% in the quarter and 10.1% in the first half versus prior year. The Census Bureau reported national starts increased 7% in the second quarter 2016 and 13% in the first half from the single family perspective, while multi-family starts declined 10% in the second quarter, and 4% in the first half. Overall, our year-to-date volume growth is more in line with the market growth. I feel good about our sales despite weather issues in the quarter and ongoing construction labor constraints. And I'm confident in our ability to grow this business. I will now turn the call over to Chad, who will review our financial results in more detail.
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning, everyone. First, I would like to discuss the current quarter results on slide 8. As a reminder, we have reflected pro forma adjusted figures to include ProBuild's financial results prior to the closing date and adjusted for one-time integration closure and other costs. For the second quarter, we reported net sales of $1.7 billion, a 3.3% increase compared to pro forma sales for the second quarter of 2015 excluding the impact of closed locations. To be clear, when we speak about closed locations, we are not normalizing for overlapping market closures. We intend to retain all those sales. These are closures in non-overlapping markets that were closed for other business reasons. Total sales volume grew 4% over pro forma sales for the second quarter of 2015, but was offset by 0.7% as a result of the negative impact of commodity price deflation on our sales. We estimate the sales volumes grew 4.1% in the single family homebuilding end market, declined 3.2% in the multi-family end market and increased 7.3% in the repair and remodel end market. Breaking down our second quarter 2016 pro forma sales by key product categories, excluding the impact of closed locations, manufactured products were $291 million, up 5.8% from 2015. Windows, doors and millwork were $343 million, up 5.2%. Lumber and lumber sheet goods were $557 million, up 4% from 2015. Our other categories were flat collectively compared to last year on a pro forma basis as our gypsum, metal and concrete products were impacted by the decline in multi-family sales. From a product mix standpoint, our value-added product categories made up a higher percentage of overall pro forma sales as our prefabricated components, windows, doors and millwork categories accounted for 37.8% of sales in the second quarter of 2016, an 80-basis point improvement over the second quarter of last year. Our gross margin percentage was 24.9%, down approximately 70 basis points from 25.6% last year, but relatively flat to Q1 2016. Our gross margin percentage decreased largely due to benefits of commodity deflation last year. Although commodity price inflation generally benefits the company's operating results in the long-term, it can cause short-term gross margin percentage compression when prices are rising and margin expansion when prices are falling. Last year, gross profit margin was benefited by approximately 50 basis points in the quarter as prices dropped significantly in the second quarter of 2015. Additionally, our procurement saving initiatives have just begun to materialize in a meaningful way on negotiated programs as we are still working through inventory on those products. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales excluding depreciation, amortization, stock comps and one-time acquisition and integration expenses decreased by 140 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This was largely attributed to the synergy savings realized in the quarter. Interest expense was $42.8 million in the quarter, a reduction of $7.1 million over pro forma Q2 2015, largely a result of lower borrowing and capital market transactions by the company to reduce interest. Additionally, we exercised our contractual rights to redeem $35 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2021 notes at a price of 103% in late May. We continue to actively evaluate capital market transactions with the intent of lowering our cash interest. The company recorded $4.2 million and $8.7 million in income tax expense in the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 respectively. This expense can largely be attributed to tax, goodwill, and amortization from the ProBuild acquisition. This negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.04 in the second quarter, and $0.08 per share in the first half. At December 31, 2015, we reported a valuation allowance of $136.5 million against our deferred income tax assets representing a full valuation allowance against these assets. In the second quarter of 2016, we moved from a cumulative loss position over the previous three years to a cumulative income position. If this profitability trend continues, we anticipate that we may reverse substantially all of our valuation allowance as early as the second half of 2016. The company had a federal net operating loss carry-forward balance at year-end 2015 of over $280 million. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any federal income taxes in 2016 and only expect to pay $46 million in state and other taxes. Adjusted net income was $35.3 million or $0.31 per diluted share compared to $18.4 million or $0.16 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015 on a pro forma adjusted basis. We produced another solid quarter of adjusted EBITDA totaling $116.7 million or 7% of sales compared to $100.2 million or 6.2% of sales in the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 16.5% and a 31% EBITDA flow-through. However, this was short of our expectations largely a result of softer sales growth than anticipated. The company was able to realize $22 million of synergy savings in the quarter before one-time costs, driving the EBITDA improvement year-over-year. We have provided an adjusted EBITDA reconciliation on slide 13. Turning to slide 9, I will discuss a few select first half key operating results. For the first half, we reported net sales of $3.1 billion, a 5.9% increase compared to pro forma sales for the first half of 2015 excluding closed locations. Total sales volume grew 9.2% over pro forma sales of 2015, but was offset by 3.3% as a negative result of the impact of commodity price deflation on our sales. We estimate that sales volume grew 11.2% in the single family homebuilding end market, declined 3.5% in multi-family and increased 10.1% in repair and remodel. Our gross margin percentage was 25%, up slightly from 24.9% last year. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales excluding D&A, stock comp, one-time acquisition and integration expenses decreased by 160 basis points. This was largely attributed to the synergy savings realized. Adjusted EBITDA was $178.5 million or 5.85% of sales compared to $121 million or 4.2% of sales for the first half of 2015, an increase of $57.5 million or 47.5% and a 34% sales-to-EBITDA conversion. This improvement was driven by sales growth and realization of cost synergy savings in the year before one-time cost to implement. Turning to slide 10. Our business typically uses cash in the first half of the year and generates cash in the second half. Cash used in operating and investing in the quarter of $6.7 million and the first half of $58.6 million was in line with our expectations and annual guidance of $75 million to $85 million of positive cash flow. Total liquidity at June 30 was $617 million consisting of net borrowing availability under the revolver and cash-on-hand. As of June 30, the company had $104 million of outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility, an increase from March 31 largely a result of the short-term draw to call $35 million of our 2021 notes. We expect to pay down debt in the balance of the year. Adjusted forma EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis was $371 million and net debt was $1.97 billion as of June 30. This implies a leverage multiple of 5.3 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. The company reduced its net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio from 5.5 times as of the end of the first quarter and from 6.5 times from Q3 2015. Turning to slide 11. There are about five years until our first debt maturity. The company expects to make significant strides in de-levering the balance sheet between now and then. We intend to do so through cash generation and paying down debt. Although we are always evaluating opportunistic transactions to lower our interest expense or otherwise address our capital structure allowing us to even further de-lever the balance sheet. We are prepared to act quickly should an attractive opportunity present itself. We expect free cash flow generation would give us the opportunity to reduce debt over the next several years. We believe this will be driven by EBITDA growth, including projected annual cost saving realization of $100 million to $120 million by the end of 2017 and a focus on working capital efficiency, which we believe will run between 9% and 10% of incremental sales. We will invest in our business through capital expenditures at approximately 1.5% of sales and we plan to utilize our carry-forward NOLs to shelter us from paying federal cash taxes through 2016 and much of 2017. In 2016, we expect onetime integration cost of approximately $30 million and cash interest of approximately $155 million to $160 million. As a result, we expect to generate approximately $75 million to $85 million in cash flow for the full year. This is consistent with the guidance provided last quarter. Once we have the synergies fully realized and onetime costs behind us, we expect the company's cash flow to increase on a go-forward basis. Should market conditions unexpectedly accelerate or deteriorate, we have the ability to quickly adjust our capital spending and working capital accordingly. I will now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Thank you, Chad. Turning to our outlook, I remain very positive about the future of our company. I believe our industry remains on a trajectory of solid growth. As Chad mentioned, our sales were shy of expectation in the second quarter. However, we saw a turnaround in June with 5.4% growth on a year-over-year basis. Oil-related markets continue to be a drag on our overall sales growth and we believe the overall multi-family market will continue to decline in the balance of the year. And as a reminder, multi-family makes up about 11% of our sales. To mitigate the impact of our top line, we're focused on growth with the national builders who are capturing share as well as leveraging the significant growth we're seeing in other areas. For example, we've experienced double-digit growth in the areas such as Pacific Northwest, Colorado, Utah, Idaho and Alabama; and near double-digit growth in South Carolina, Florida, Indiana and Wisconsin. Our company is well-positioned to be in the building supply company of choice for builders around the country, thanks to our geographic reach, enhanced product offerings, national manufacturing capabilities and superior customer service. Our focus will be to leverage our national scale and sales capability to grow faster than the market with a focus on profitable growth in value-added products. These strengths are scale and the potential leverage provided by the synergy savings combines to make Builders FirstSource an industry leader with significant opportunities to drive profitable growth. We will continue to create value for our shareholders and I attribute the success we've achieved in both the integration efforts as well as the strong results we have posted since the acquisition closed to all of our hardworking and dedicated associates. Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Rob Hansen with Deutsche Bank.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. So weather was probably – was undoubtedly an issue in the quarter. I think it was also tough in 1Q as well. If you have any quantification on that in terms of revenue that you might have lost, could you help us out with that? But I think the more important question is, can you make up any of that lost volume in the back half of the year in terms of constraints, labor or capacity on your end?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: I think, Rob, the weather, I can't give you a real definitive number for the weather effect, but I can tell you it certainly was a major issue in Houston where we had over 20 inches of rain in one month alone. Certainly, that was our worst weather impacted the market area. I would say also the Mid-Atlantic area and sections in the Southeast in Florida were also very dramatically weather impacted. We really didn't try to put a dollar number to it but those are significant sized markets for us and we did lose significant days in being able to deliver products and certainly that weather, the biggest effect, is how it slows down the construction cycles trying to get the concrete work done, the slabs, pour foundation put in and so forth and it really also – not only in the single family side but it also created problem on the multifamily side. So, that's the best number I can provide unless...
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: I would just add that as far as being able to catch up, I think there will be some catch-up in the back half of the year but we are still hearing a lot of complaining about labor shortages. And with that labor shortage out there, you cannot make up that construction volume in just a couple of months. I think we will start chipping away at it but I think it's just going to take some time.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Well, we have, Chad, as you know, we have seen since the land started drying out, certainly our business in Houston has shown in July a very significant improvement, what we are seeing flowing into the first part of August. I'm very encouraged with what I see the bounce-back in Houston and in other parts of the Southeast including Florida. So, the weather delays things, but as Chad said, labor will continue to be a problem and it will continue to be constrained on homebuilding activity in total. But we don't lose business with weather, it just delays and pushes it out.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And then, Floyd, I think you also commented about maybe growing a little bit slower than the market because of the integration focus. I wanted to see if you could just elaborate on that a little bit here. Were there specific instances that caused a problem there or – and what have you kind of done to remedy that?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. No, we have seen, Rob, in the areas that are going through the consolidation of locations, the convergence or definitely a slowdown. And then it takes about 60 days to 90 days and then you begin to just really see the activity pick back up again. But in total, I have to say and I'm really – I guess when it came to budgeting and looking and projecting our sales, I really underestimated, I think, the diversion that it causes in management time. When you are changing the wages and salary, you're changing the benefit schedule, the health benefit, the insurance schedules. You're changing personnel alignment...
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: ERP conversion.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. And then I was going to say that. Then you add on top of that, probably the most distracting element of all is the conversion on the ERP systems. It really takes the managers of the local location. They've got to spend a lot of time with their people, a lot of time focusing on getting the new policy, procedures and so forth in place. Now, they're also dealing with getting prepared for SOX compliance. And so more of their time is focused on taking care of these details rather than out there with the sales force and driving new sales and so forth. I really can't put a number on it other than we obviously in our management reviews and discussions with our people. It is an issue. I don't like to acknowledge it to a great degree because I don't want it to become an excuse. But very definitely as we – we are seeing the diminishing confusion or distraction as we're going forward, I think by the end of the year, we certainly will be through with all except for the computer conversions. But I just don't want to put a number on it but it definitely has been a distraction and a diversion from management attention to sales to a certain degree.
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. And I'll just add. When I look back on the last year on what we've accomplished, I'm just blown away at how well the people have responded. We are asking a ton of – everyone right now within the company. And they've stepped up and they've done a great job. Does it create some distraction? Absolutely. But I look at it as an investment for the future of this company. It's something we're going through now when we pass this in a couple of quarters and we're going to be bigger and stronger as a result of it. But just to Floyd's point, there's only so many hours in a day and we're asking a lot of folks right now.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. And, Rob, we put a lot of focus on the conversion of our projected synergy cost savings and that we really told our people that was priority number one. You'd like to say priority number one, absolute without question, is sales. But we were looking at – we wanted to be able to convert $100 million to $120 million of cost benefit to this company and be able to accomplish it within a two-year period. And we damn sure have done it and our people have done it and there's a price to be paid for. I didn't – I underestimated very honestly and I had the experience. We went thought it in this company but this has gone far better than it ever did when we went through this process within the old legacy Builders FirstSource, but it's still nevertheless is – has certainly put some pressure on us.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And just to be clear, it's not that you're – is it that you are losing customers or is it that you're not necessarily gaining the market share that you thought you would?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yes. I think we – absolutely we've done a lot of verifying, we are not losing any customers. What we are losing is taking advantage of some of the new interest coming into the market and some of the expanding opportunities that may be available. Our sales to the national builders are really showing very healthy gains. Where we see, I think, less growth is in the smaller builder, the higher end, the more custom builder and that requires a lot of management attention and focus and that's where I think we're missing out on some of the new business. I think once we get over and especially once our operations have gone through the ERP and I would say, and I think Chad would agree with this, that that was the single most distracting event that you go through, but we are seeing noticeable sales improvements in 60 days after, 90 days after the conversions have been made. So, I feel very, very good about we've been able to build and hold with the customers. We have not seen or lost any major or even smaller customer and I feel very good about what we are going to be able to do on a go-forward basis.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Appreciate the color, guys. Thank you.
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Rob.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Baugh with Stifel.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, Floyd and Chad.
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey, John.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Good morning, John.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I was curious on the overlap, your comment only $5 million of loss from absolute closures of locations. But you're excluding those areas where I presume you maybe had two or multiple locations and have consolidated one or two. I guess your expectation has been to maintain 100% of that markets business. Is there any evidence that maybe you're not quite holding 100%? Is that perhaps one of the sales issues?
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: I haven't seen any evidence of that.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: None at all.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then can you help us with lumber and it's fairly volatile, as we know. And it's been up for a while and yet there was still deflation in the second quarter. So, Chad, maybe you could walk us through how that all plays out both, I guess, from a sales gross margin and an EBIT impact as we move forward for the next four quarters, given what lumber has done.
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. There's a lot of moving parts with that right now. When we go through our analysis and estimate the impact on sales, we would get – it's relative pricing, right, so it's – what was the average price this quarter versus same quarter last year. But we look at that on a two-month lag because that's the proxy for how long it takes for us to be able to reset our price with our customers and see that's starting to impact the top line. So when you look at it from that standpoint, we still had a slight amount of deflation year-over-year and that's largely because of the two-month lag. Now, the margin impact is obviously more tied to how lumber prices were behaving within the quarter. And so last year, prices were falling during the quarter which lowers our average cost of sales during the quarter against that fixed customer pricing and it creates a gross margin tailwind. That's what we saw last year. This quarter, we saw prices flat up during the quarter. And that can create some gross margin compression because your average cost is rising versus your fixed price commitments with your customers. Now going forward, prices still seem to be rising a little bit but we are able – we have been able to start resetting our pricing with our customers. And so we are starting to see the benefit of that improved pricing this quarter. Now, prices continue to rise during the quarter. That will compress margins a little bit. I haven't seen inflation to the degree that it's going to create significant compression. And I do think we're going to start seeing more of the procurement savings coming through in the third quarter which will help offset that. So, I think net-net, we will see gross margin improvement, probably 30 basis points to 40 basis points over the quarter just ended, Q2 of 2016. So, that's kind of the mechanics and what we were up against this quarter versus last year. Now, specifically, if you look at our gross margin on our lumber and lumber sheet goods category, that margin dropped about 300 basis points this quarter versus same quarter last year. So, that shows you the impact of – and the difference between the falling prices last year and what we were facing this quarter. That's about $17 million of lost gross profit dollars and we've been able to hold our margins consistent versus last year. So, it was significant. We knew it was coming. That's why we guided basically on a sequential basis flat gross margin. And that's exactly what we saw.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, that's 30 basis points to 40 basis points was the consolidated comp and the actual...
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: That's right.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then my last question is around the buckets. With repair and remodel being the strongest which, again, is somewhat surprising to me, could you comment why that's the case? And then, additionally, you mentioned the June bounce-back, have you seen a somewhat similar pace into July? Appreciate it.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: John, I think there are several factors that are driving the – are really great improvement in growth in the repair and remodel sector. I think, one, we've done a lot of showroom resets, updates to make our selling environment more favorable to both the small contractor and the contractors customers and to the walk-in trade. I think that's very, very important. There has been very little work done in the last few years under Fidelity's ownership to update and improve the showrooms and so forth. So, we have been very aggressive in that area. We will also hire. Our people have done a really good job in getting their internal people's focus on selling higher end products and getting us a favorable mix of high profit items being sold whether it's window, the exterior door units, the other specialty millwork and so forth. I think the – we've also been adding to the sales forces in those repair and remodel areas and I think that's really paying off. And it's all three of those factors. I think another thing that's driving it – can't prove it but in the strong Mid-Western markets, they are both agriculturally based and to a certain extent in a couple of states, the Balkan area, it's oil driven. Agriculture has been under severe pressure. The pricing of the farm commodities are much lower than they were a few years ago. And I think so, our people have seen from a building and maybe some more of the traditional parts of the market drying up. And so, they really put a lot of focus on attacking the repair and remodel sector. And we had people out in the fields actively working with the small contractors and earning his business. This contrast with the big box approach which is they expect everyone to come into the store. They don't really have people working the field and to the extent that we do and I think those – that's another thing, I think we are taking business away from the big box stores in the markets in which we serve. So I think that kind of sums up why I feel that we're getting the type of growth in this area.
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: And to your second part of the question, July sales, we have two less shipping days in July but on a sales per day basis, July looks like it's coming in right about the same sales per day cases we saw in June.
John Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you for that and good luck.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, Floyd, Chad. A lot of helpful commentary there. So appreciate that.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I wanted to go back to your response to some of the earlier questions around the integration and see if we can frame it slightly different way because despite some of these diversions, as to your point, or the synergies certainly seem to remain on track. And the timing seems to remain on track. So I'm just curious if some of these issues have been limited to some of the upside you would have seen to your synergy targets previously or if it's – this is just – there's just some delays and there is still potentially some opportunities beyond what you've already outlined.
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: From a synergy perspective?
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes, from a synergy standpoint.
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, I do feel like we are slightly ahead of pace right now from the realization perspective. And I still feel very good about the range that we've given. And we have, quite frankly, uncovered a few extra nuggets along the way, which really didn't surprise me. So, I think at the end of the day, I'm pretty comfortable right now saying we're going to be towards the high end of that range. So, I don't think – the distractions, a lot of them are part of the process of achieving these synergies. I don't know if it's impacting the upside of the synergies as much as that this might be impacting some incremental sales growth we could had out there based on the distractions that they can create.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Okay. And then just on the margin comments, so gross margin up 30 basis points to 40 basis points, I just wanted to see if we can get a little more clarity because I think in the third quarter, sometimes you see some sequential deleveraging from an SG&A standpoint. So is there any color you can give us on – from an EBIT or EBITDA standpoint, how we should think about margins for the third quarter?
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, typically, you'll see a good flow-through or good gross margin dollar improvement. We pay salesman commission off of gross profit dollars, so that's going to be a variable figure to your incremental cost. But from an EBIT or EBITDA standpoint, we realized $22 million of total synergies in the quarter. There was $2 million or $3 million of that up in gross margin. The rest down in SG&A. There will be incremental synergy savings, I believe, in the third quarter versus what we just realized in the second quarter, which will obviously help our EBITDA flow-through. We've always said on the base business, our SG&A is typically about 65% variable to the changes in sales volume. I still feel good about that number. Now, when we get to the fourth quarter, we'll start lapping some of the synergy savings that we realized last year. And so, when we say $70 million realized for the full year this year, that's incremental to what we realized in 2015. So, I just want to make sure we don't double count that in the back half of the year.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, makes sense. And then final question, just relating to that comment on July sales per shipping day, could you help us or give us a little more context for – is that normal seasonally, is July typically higher than June on a sales per day basis? Is it typically lower? Just anything you can do to help us frame that performance.
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I would say it's typically pretty close. I would say that's pretty normal.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Alex Rygiel with FBR Capital Markets.
Min Chung Cho - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Great. Good morning. This is Min Cho for Alex. I have a couple of questions. First of all, as it relates to the labor constraints, are you seeing orders that are coming in and then just you can't deliver them or are the orders actually being delayed as well? Just want to know what kind of impact it's going to have to overall volumes in terms of sales growth for the year and kind of beyond?
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: I'll let Floyd answer this. But I just want to clarify, this isn't in our labor. This is like the framers out in the field getting slabs for plumbers, HVAC, et cetera.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. And I was going to say we – the – we have been able to attract people to our facilities. We certainly have the people available to meet expanded sales. But I can tell you I was talking with one of our people in a market – in a large market in Florida yesterday and we had a salesman who was also on the line. And he indicated he had eight framing packages that were sitting on the ground at the jobsite waiting for the concrete work to be put in. I can tell in our truss plants we battle this all the way through and beginning to shake loose now but the weather delayed the projects, labor delayed the projects to where we had the – we had the largest backlog of truss orders that we've ever had. And it's – we've had to be built ahead and we're waiting for those releases to come to the jobsite. And this is throughout our areas. So, labor had definitely impacted the jobsite activity which then rolls back. We certainly get some of that. They start once the – once their work is complete and they're getting ready to start the slab, but we're finding and I think we've added almost close to two months to the cycle time from the time we get to start to where we get a unit under construction which is where our materials really are sold into. So – and most of this is now – is labor-driven, that problem. I don't know if you saw a recent article in The Times where they indicated that U.S. had 570,000 fewer construction workers born in Mexico in 2014 than in 2007. But I will tell you, in this industry, a long time, there's always been – you're always confronted with problems, but you find a way to solve them. I will tell you the labor problems were acute last year and the year before, but we're building more houses, we are attracting more people into the construction fields. I think it's beginning to accelerate. I think it's also – we're seeing movement to our manufactured products, products that will take labor out of the jobsite once the work is done. The slabs being put in and I think the industry is solving its problems. I think we are going to still have tight labor going forward but we're going to be able to continue to grow the market. I think we're going to see 8% to 10% for the foreseeable future.
Min Chung Cho - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Single family.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Single family, yeah.
Min Chung Cho - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. So – I'm sorry. So it sounds like it's not really impacting your demands too much though, the demand for your products.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Not impacting the demands because we're seeing the buildup of backlog especially in the manufacturing environment. Typically, where you're delivering the commodity-type products and other building materials; that is done almost on a day-by-day basis. So, we have the contracts to and we've had the commitments that we're going to be delivering future homes, but generally the builder won't release those orders until he thinks he can get that jobsite started. In some cases, they get fooled, they don't – really they get delays and so you get material out on the jobsite waiting for the comp – other trades to get completed with their work. But typically the builders don't want to see material out on the jobsite until it's ready to be used.
Min Chung Cho - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Right. Just my last question has to do with line reviews. I know those are always ongoing but I think the last time we spoke, you were in the midst of your windows and door review. Just wondering where you are on that specific product?
Jennifer Pasquino - SVP, Investor Relations: So specifically, the question was where are we on negotiating our procurement savings at the window and door manufacturers.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. We just have completed our door review and the assignment of – renegotiated the – with some suppliers, I think there we've made some territory changes and product changes. That just finished up. So, we'll begin to see the benefits of that on a go-forward basis. We're in the process with certain areas of our window and that won't be completed for a while. We also completed our engineered wood program. That was completed in the end of April, beginning of May. So, that's behind us and those are the biggest product areas.
Min Chung Cho - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we have time for a few more questions. We'll go next to Nick Coppola with Thompson Research Group.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Good morning.
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Nick.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: So on cost synergies, can you talk more about what is left to do in order to get to the top end of that $100 million to $120 million range and even beyond the two-year mark, what you're going to do to drive further savings?
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: The major items we have left is more in the area of back office type consolidation that will come as we continue to get more and more of the company on one ERP system and then realizing the remainder of the procurement savings. Those are the two big areas left. The ERP conversion, they're going far better than I ever could have dreamed. The field has been very pleased with the conversion teams that we have out there helping them. So, as we continue to get more of the company on one system, we'll be able to streamline back office functions. And we're also in the process of shooting for a 1/1/2017 go-live date on a new payroll HR system that will create some additional efficiencies and then the procurement. Once we get to January 1 of next year, it's really just the continued ERP conversion, the blocking and tackling there. And it just takes time to plow through those markets and then, wrapping up the procurement savings. I think by the end of the year, first quarter next year, most of the SG&A savings will have been realized. And beyond the two-year mark we've talked about before, it's going to take longer than that two-year mark to get through the ERP conversions. And so, as we continue to get more and more those behind us beyond that two-year mark, it will create additional largely SG&A efficiencies. That's not included in the $100 million to $120 million that was our two-year target. But I do think as we get more of the company on that one system, then, there'll be some additional efficiencies we can realize beyond that two-year mark.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay, that's good to hear. And then second question here, in gypsum roofing and insulation categories, sales were down year-over-year. Can you just help think about the major drivers there? What was going on in terms of volume and maybe price in some of those product categories?
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: Very heavily impacted by the decline in multi-family side, also the – some commercial construction. And as the volume – as the activity in those areas come down it also starts getting to be more price competitive. And so, I think it's a combination of those two things. But very clearly, the multi-family – the decline in multi-family has really impacted those products for us.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: And we have time for two more questions. We'll go next to Trey Grooms with Stephens, Inc.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning.
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Hey, Trey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: First question, I guess is for Chad. You've given us some color on the moving pieces going into third quarter. Unless I missed something, I didn't hear a specific EBITDA range or anything like that yet. Is there anything you could give us as far as your stab at where EBITDA should shake out at least on top of a range like you've given us in the past?
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: No. You didn't miss anything. I've given some gross margin guidance. You have some pretty good color on synergy realization and variability of SG&A. I think that the last piece is really what are sales going to do at the back of the year. And I think we all have our estimates on what single family will do. I just think you need to keep in mind the mix of our business now. We're 65% single family. We're 10% multi-family and like commercial, and about 25% R&R. So, our thinking is multi-family is probably going to continue to be down year-over-year at the back half of the year. And I think R&R is probably going to settle in at somewhere around 5% growth. And so, when you look at the mix of those businesses, those two are going to kind of offset each other. We'll get about 1% sales loss on multifamily on a consolidated basis and R&R would put us up 1% or so on a consolidated basis. So, it really boils down to your outlook on single family and keeping in mind that we're 65% driven by single family. So if you just want to do some high level assumptions at 8% growth in single family, 10% decline in multi, and 5% growth in R&R, that should put us somewhere around 5% growth in sales, everything else being equal. No share gain, no share loss. We should see a little bit of a lift from commodity price inflation at the back half of the year now that we're getting our pricing caught up. So – to put a stake in the ground right now on EBITDA guidance, I'll just – it's just too early in the quarter and I'm just not prepared to do that right now.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, fair enough. And then Floyd, based on your comments, if we are looking out a little further, your comments as far as your expectation for this – the integration distractions, I think that you've seen so far and your expectation for that to be behind you guys maybe later this year, if I understood that right. So I guess looking into 2017, would it be your expectation that you guys would then be at a point where you're growing with the market or above the market or how should we think about that aspect of it as we look into next year?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. I definitely believe next year if you look into 2017, we will outperform the market. I think, largely, most of the distraction is behind us when we finish out this year and it's on a – I think it's on a diminishing tail right now. The computer conversions are going to be with us but we're getting, very, very good at that. We've got over 70 people on our conversion teams that are out there. We're adding to it all the time because we are really trying to accelerate the process but we – it's going far better than we had anticipated. And so, I think that's going to also be less of a distraction. So, 2017, I definitely believe we're going to outperform the market.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Good to hear. All right. Thanks a lot. Good luck.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Thank you.
Operator: And there is time for our last question from Will Randow with Citigroup.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Hey, Will.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just had two follow-ups from a couple prior questions, which I think one was more focused on in the, call it, gypsum and roofing segment. You should – saw commodity deflation just like you have in the lumber segment. I'm guessing that had some impact as well as how did your regional weightings help or hurt you this time around relative to what we see on the national data?
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: From a regional perspective, I'm assuming you're talking to sales in general from a regional perspective.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes.
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: Is that right?
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes, exactly like you are weighting to Houston, for example.
M. Chad Crow - President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. As Floyd gave some color earlier, we have some markets that were very strong this quarter: Colorado, the Pacific Northwest, DFW still very strong, areas in the Southeast strong, Florida's got some great markets going right now. The weaker markets were obviously the ones impacted by rain, Houston, the Baltimore, Washington, the Mid-Atlantic specifically. And then those that are starting or those that are driven more by the whole economy. If you were to group the – what I would say the more oil-driven markets that we're in, that was about a 2% drag on our overall sales just to give you some perspective on what those markets did. They were selectively down about 12% year-over-year. And so, offsetting that obviously was some of those stronger markets that we look at or that we discussed a moment ago.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Now, I think the pricing on gypsum and roofing, as you said, there were some increases on gypsum. We saw decreases on about a 100 basis point or so on roofing. But our sales on gypsum were most impacted in the Northeast where we had very, very, heavy amount of business that was going into multi-family. They think the New York metropolitan area, which we service, they saw a dramatic falloff in multi-family permits as well as starts. The roofing sales really are holding up. We're very encouraged. In fact, we're adding roofing to a number of our locations on a continual basis. But we're finding out that we can't compete very favorably in – with roofing with certain types of customers. And so, I'm very encouraged with what I see in roofing. Gypsum, I think, it's going to be tough the rest of the year. But still, we have a good group. I think they will make the best of tough situation.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And your – the commentary towards the end dovetails into my second question and that is, when you think about synergies you guys have identified cost synergies, specifically, but when you think about revenue side of potential synergies, meaning offering products where it makes sense regionally across your portfolio of storefronts, if you will, or lumberyards, what type of revenue opportunity is there and how long would it take you to execute on that?
Jennifer Pasquino - SVP, Investor Relations: So, Will, just to clarify. Is your question about our ability to grow with national builders and leverage the national scale...
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah.
Jennifer Pasquino - SVP, Investor Relations: ...or is it more about value-added products and leveraging the kind of trusses, et cetera, across (62:33).
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): For example, the example that was just given on adding roofing to locations that previously didn't have them. So kind of expanding the breadth of your product at a given lumberyard as storefront?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yes. We definitely are expanding our business with the national builders. If you look at it on a year-to-date basis, our sales to our top 20, which are all national builders. We're up about 15.6%, 15.8%, something like that. We are expanding our offerings to the national builder now in more areas specifically, I will say, California is definitely opening up more and more opportunities for us with the national builder. We're doing things in California. We're looking to expand our facilities there. We're opening up our first California truss plant that will be in operation almost as we speak. And a lot of that is going to be directed towards the national builder, who is willing to utilize the component products. I want to point out when you asked about roofing, one of the key areas, I think, for future development for us will be – is to get into the roofing business in the state of Texas. We are currently not in and we don't sell roofing right now in Texas. So, we haven't been able to take advantage of all the hailstorms that we've had down here. And that has been really a significant boost to roofing sales. But in the future, we think we have a place to play in this arena. And we're investigating and looking at several of our locations to add roofing.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks for taking the – for the time, guys, and congrats on the progress.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Thanks.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: We really appreciate your joining us on the call today. We look forward to updating you on the progress of our business initiatives in the months ahead. And if you have any follow-up questions, don't hesitate to give Chad or Jen a call. And thank you and I am – just keep following us. We're going to be delivering you, I think, some very good future. And I feel very, very good about the prospects of our business and where we're headed.
Operator: And that concludes...
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Thanks.
Operator: ...today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Any reproduction of this call, in whole or in part, is not permitted without prior written authorization of Builders FirstSource. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, May 6, 2016. Builders FirstSource issued a press release after the market closed yesterday. If you don't have a copy, you can find it on our website. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we may make statements concerning the company's future prospects, financial results, business strategies, and industry's trends. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Please refer to our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC and other reports filed with the SEC for more information on those risks. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. The acquisition of ProBuild closed on July 31, 2015, the closing date. As a result, ProBuild's financial results are only included in the company's GAAP financial statements from the closing date forward and are not reflecting the company's historical financial statements. We have, therefore, provided supplemental financial information of the combined company in this press release that's pro forma or adjusted to include ProBuild's financial results for the relevant periods prior to the closing date. The company will discuss these pro forma and adjusted results on the call. We've provided reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents in our earnings press release and detailed explanations of non-GAAP financial measures in our Form 8-K filed yesterday, both of which are available on our website. At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Floyd Sherman.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings call. Before I comment on the business, first I'd like to provide an update on the integration and progress against the cost saving initiatives outlined when the acquisition of ProBuild was announced. Then I'll give a brief recap of the quarterly results and turn the call over to Chad who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions. Let's begin our discussion on slide four with an overview of the key benefits of the combination. On July 31, 2015, we completed the acquisition of ProBuild, one of the largest distributors of building materials to professional builders, contractors, and project-oriented consumers in the United States. The combination created a clear industry leader with expanded growth and margin opportunities. We believe that the benefits of the acquisition include increased scale and diversification, enhanced cross-selling opportunities for value-added products, better customer penetration, and projected $100 million to $120 million of targeted annual cost savings before one-time expenses. We've created a more diversified company with enhanced scale and an improved geographic footprint. We are the leading distributor of lumber and building products to the professional building channel. With our presence in 40 states and 74 of the top 100 MSAs, we are striving to become the supplier of choice for all homebuilders. Our national scale facilitates strategic partnerships with customers and suppliers and this allows for better customer reach and less exposure to any one market. Sales in Texas accounted for 17% of our 2015 pro forma sales, with sales split roughly evenly between the Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio/Austin. No other state accounts for more than 8% of our sales. With 23% of our sales attributed to the repair and remodel end market, we have also reduced cyclicality through broader sales exposure. The repair and remodel end market has proven historically to provide a more stable revenue base with strong gross profit margins and good returns. We feel the geographic diversity and expanded customer base has added both stability and value to our business model. Now turning to slide five, we're very pleased with the progress of the integration efforts thus far. The combined company is operating effectively as one, providing best-in-class service to our customers, growing local market relationships, and delivering on our business objectives. All aspects of the integration including system conversions and facility consolidation are in full swing and progressing as planned, including closing all but one of the planned overlapping locations. We plan to complete 88 ERP system conversions by the end of 2016 and have migrated 25 so far with minimal disruption or issues. Employee and customer attrition has been very minimal. Moving to slide six, we are more convinced than ever that we will deliver the $100 million to $120 million anticipated annual run rate cost saving synergies that were outlined when the deal was announced. Synergies are being captured through network optimization, procurement, and G&A costs with a breakout of about 20%, 30%, and 50% expected for each area, respectively. Within 10 months of the acquisition close, we've already implemented cost savings initiatives that are projected to yield approximately $65 million to $70 million in future run rate savings. These savings include $12 million to $14 million in projected procurement initiatives, where scale improves our purchasing leverage. We've also executed against the savings that are exclusively in our control including $7 million to $8 million in projected network consolidation savings and $46 million to $48 million in projected overhead and SG&A savings, including benefit plans. We expect that our ongoing cost initiatives will benefit fiscal 2016 by $65 million to $70 million and we realized $17 million in the first quarter. As part of the integration process, we expect to incur $90 million to $100 million in one-time cost to achieve these synergies. Approximately half of these one-time acquisition and integration costs were incurred by March 31 with $25 million expected the balance of 2016. Our integration efforts and cost savings realization are a major priority for us. I remain convinced that the combination will continue to create value for our shareholders and customers alike in the years to come. Now moving to slide seven. I'm pleased with the sales volume growth over the prior year, indicating a strong start to the spring building season. We believe that sales were benefited by the milder winter as well as the strong building fundamentals. We grew in all categories despite the negative impact of commodity deflation on our sales. Average market prices for framing lumber in the quarter were down 11% versus the first quarter of 2015. Despite this deflation, our lumber and lumber sheet goods sales were up 8% versus the first quarter of 2015. Our value-added sales of manufactured products, windows, doors and millwork in the quarter increased 14% versus 2015 and mix in these products increased 160 basis points over prior year. We believe our company is well-positioned to help homebuilders mitigate the impact of well-publicized labor shortage and increased cycle times through our manufactured and value-added products across our national footprint. Before turning it over to Chad, I'll give a brief recap of our results for the first quarter. Sales were $1.4 billion, up 9.1% as compared to last year, excluding the impact of closed locations, and we grew adjusted EBITDA by almost 200% or $41 million. I am pleased with the growth in sales and profits over the prior year, especially considering the $86 million or 6.7% negative impact of commodity deflation on our first quarter sales. Excluding the impact of deflation, our new residential volumes sales grew 16% in the quarter and repair and remodel grew 15% versus the prior year. Of the total 15.8% sale volume growth in the quarter versus 2015, we attribute approximately 1.5% growth to the extra sales day. Additionally, lumber prices have rebounded 11% over the last eight weeks and we hope this trend continues. I'll now turn the call over to Chad who will review our financial results in more detail.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning, everyone. I will first discuss the quarter results on slide nine. As a reminder, we have reflected pro forma adjusted figures to include ProBuild's financial results prior to the closing date and adjusted for one-time integration, closure, and other costs. For the first quarter, we reported net sales of $1.4 billion, a 9.1% increase compared to pro forma sales for the first quarter of 2015 excluding the impact of closed locations. Total sales volume grew 15.8% over pro forma sales for the first quarter of 2015, but was offset by 6.7% as a result of the negative impact of commodity price deflation on our sales. We estimate that sales volume grew 16% in the homebuilding end market and 15% in the repair and remodel end market. Breaking down our first quarter 2016 pro forma sales by key product categories excluding the impact of closed locations, manufactured products were $237 million, up 15.6% from 2015. Windows, doors and millwork were $312 million up 12.4%; lumber and lumber sheet goods were $466 million, up 7.9% from $431 million in 2015 despite commodity deflation. Our other building products and services categories were collectively up 4% compared to last year on a pro forma basis. From a product mix standpoint, our value-add product categories made up a higher percentage of overall sales, as our prefabricated components, windows, doors, and millwork categories accounted for 39.3% of sales in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 37.7% last year. Our lumber and lumber sheet goods declined, as a percentage of sales, from 33.7% in the first quarter of 2015 to 33.3% this quarter. If composite framing lumber and panel market prices stay at current levels, we anticipate the full year impact of commodity inflation or deflation to be minimal on a year-over-year basis. As you may remember, commodity deflation negatively impacted our sales somewhat in the second quarter last year and to a much greater extent in quarters three and four of 2015. If commodity prices hold, we hope to recoup the sales impact of commodity deflation in the second half of this year. Our gross margin percentage was 25%, up approximately 90 basis points from 24.1% last year. Our gross margin percentage increased largely due to improved customer pricing, commodity price deflation and a higher mix of value added sales. Our procurement savings initiative has just begun to materialize. Our SG&A, as a percentage of sales, excluding D&A, and one time integration, and acquisition expenses decreased by a 190 basis points as a percentage of sales This was largely attributed to the synergy savings realized in the quarter as well as leveraging our fixed cost on increased sales. Interest expense was $35.2 million in the quarter. In February 2016, we entered into debt exchanges, which reduced our long-term debt by $14.8 million and annual cash interest by approximately $9.9 million. As a result, a net gain of $7.8 million related to the extinguishment of debt was booked in the quarter, which reduced our interest expense. We have provided a normalized view of cash interest in our earnings release financial schedules. Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31 2016 was $4.5 million, primarily relating to deferred tax expense arising from the amortization of goodwill for tax purposes. We currently estimate our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. The company had a federal net operating loss carry-forward balance at year end 2015 of over $280 million against which the company has a full valuation allowance recorded. We do not anticipate paying any federal taxes in 2016 and expect to pay roughly $5 million to $6 million in state and other taxes. Adjusted net loss was $11.6 million or $0.11 per diluted share compared to a loss of $55.9 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015. We produced another quarter of strong adjusted EBITDA totaling $61.8 million or 4.4% of sales compared to $20.8 million or 1.6% of sales for the first quarter of 2015. This represents an increase of $41 million or 197% over the first quarter of 2015. The company was able to realize $17 million in synergy savings in the current quarter before one-time cost to implement, which is in line with our previous guidance. We continue to grow our business in a profitable manner as evidenced by the approximately 90 basis point expansion in our gross margin percentage and the approximately 280 basis point adjusted EBITDA margin growth we achieved this quarter. We have provided an adjusted EBITDA reconciliation on slide 12 of the presentation. Turning to slide 10, cash flow in the current quarter was in line with our expectations and annual guidance. Total liquidity at March 31, 2016 was $623 million consisting of net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand. As of March 31, the company had $59 million of outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility generally flat with the yearend 2015. While we expect to continue to borrow under the revolving credit facility for seasonal working capital and other operating needs, we do expect to pay down additional debt in 2016. Adjusted pro forma EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis was $354.3 million and net debt was just under $2 billion as of March 31, 2016. This implies a multiple of 5.5 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. The company reduced its net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio by over one-half turn in the first quarter of 2016 and a full-turn since the third quarter of 2015 from 6.5 times to 5.5 times. Assuming the full realization of our expected annual cost savings synergies of $110 million, net debt-to-adjusted pro forma EBITDA would be 4.5 times. We are intent on making significant strides in reducing the absolute levels of debt and deleveraging the balance sheet over the next few years. We intend to do so through cash generation and paying down debt although we may from time-to-time enter into opportunistic transactions that lower our interest expense and otherwise address our capital structure allowing us to even further de-lever the balance sheet. In February of 2016, the company exchanged $282 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2023 notes for $268 million of our 2021 notes to reduce its annual cash interest expense by approximately $10 million. We have provided an interest reconciliation to provide a normalized or ongoing view of interest expense and current debt levels. Turning to slide 11, there are about five years until our first debt maturity and we expect free cash flow generation will enable us to meaningfully reduce the absolute level of debt between now and then. We believe this will be driven by EBITDA growth including projected annual cost savings realization of $100 million to $120 million by the end of 2017 and a focus on working capital efficiencies, which we believe, will run between 9% and 10% of incremental sales. We will invest in our business through capital expenditures at approximately 1.5% of sales and we plan to utilize our carry-forward NOLs, which were in excess of $280 million at year-end to shelter us from paying federal taxes through 2016 and much of 2017. In 2016, we expect one-time cost of $30 million and cash interest of approximately $157 million. As a result, we continue to expect to generate approximately $75 million to $85 million in cash flow in 2016. This is consistent with the guidance provided last quarter. Once we have these synergies fully realized and one-time cost behind us, we expect the company's cash flow will significantly increase on a go-forward basis. We are focused on reducing debt and are optimistic about our cash generation opportunities. Should market conditions unexpectedly accelerate or decelerate, we have the ability to quickly adjust our capital spending and working capital accordingly to largely mitigate the impact on our cash flow. I'll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thank you, Chad. I'd like to take a moment to send our thoughts and prayers out to those in Houston who have lost their homes and more to the tragic floods. As you know, Houston is a very important market to us representing 4.5% of our sales and we have longstanding ties to the market. Thankfully, all of our employees are safe and our facilities, equipment and inventory were not damaged. I want to personally thank all of our associates in Houston for their efforts in getting our business back up and running so quickly so we can help our valued customers and the Houston community start to rebuild. Turning to our outlook, I remain very positive about the future of our company. I believe our industry remains on a trajectory of solid growth. I'm encouraged by the recent framing lumber composite price inflation, an increase of 11% since early March, and we expect to grow profitably and realize our synergy cost savings. Our company is well positioned to be the building supply company of choice for builders around the country, thanks to our geographic reach, enhanced product offerings, and national manufacturing capabilities and very superior customer service. Our focus will be to leverage our national scale and sales capability to grow faster than the market with a focus on profitable growth and value-added products. These strengths – our scale and the potential leverage provided by the synergy savings combines to make Builders FirstSource an industry leader with significant opportunity to drive profitable growth. We've demonstrated our ability to reduce debt again this quarter and we're committed to continue to reduce leverage through annual cash flow generation. We will continue to create value for our shareholders and customers by executing against our synergy and growth plans. I attribute the success we have achieved in both the integration efforts as well as the impressive results that we posted every quarter since the acquisition close to all of our hard working and dedicated associates. Thank you. I look forward to building on what was a very successful quarter continuing to grow our revenues, gain share and improve our operating margin. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Rob G. Hansen with Deutsche Bank.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. So last quarter you gave EBITDA guidance of $50 to 60 million. You came in a little bit ahead of that. I guess, what kind of changed towards the end of the quarter? Was there anything that accelerated? What gave the upside versus what you were kind of originally expecting?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: A couple of things. Generally, I would rather under-promise and over-deliver, so I would like to always stay a little on a conservative side. And I think our sales growth probably ended on a little stronger note than we have thought and as we disclosed the cost savings that we're able to realize certainly came in at/or slightly above our expectations. So I think it was just a combination of those things.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, exiting March, and April how do trends look? Obviously, there is going to be a little bit of drag from Houston? How do things look into May here?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Starts in the first quarter were obviously very strong. And so I would expect, you generally have a lag of starts before it becomes an opportunity for our business. So I would expect that to carry over into Q2 and create some incremental demand. Our backlogs at our plants are strong. So far, all things are pointing toward additional sales growth in the second quarter. You're right that we had lot of rain in a few markets which made April a little choppy because the job sites were so wet they really delayed or really it eliminated our ability to get to some other jobs sites for a couple of weeks. So April was a little choppy, but we're still very optimistic about how things are lining up for the second quarter.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah and we certainly are continuing to see a high level of builder confidence. Our people reporting from the field still good business and building activity does not appear to be slowing down. And I think we're right on the trajectory that we had anticipated seeing in the improvement of housing starts this year. And we're seeing that the housing start improvement over a broad range over all of our areas and there is no one particular part of the country that really are lot stronger than others. We're seeing very, very good growth in all of our areas.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. One last one is just on the repair and remodel strength. I mean, that was a extremely strong number. Was there some sort of market share gains or was there certain pull forward of demand or something like that. Yeah, how did that kind of shape up with what's driving that?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I would agree with you. They we were very, very impressive results in the remodeling area, In fact I'm not really aware of any of the traditional repair remodel companies that came anywhere close to our type of results. But I think this is a reflection, number one, we had certainly not nearly as bad a winter quarter as traditional in our strong remodeling areas, which are the Midwest, the Northwest, and West Coast. The other thing is that I think we're seeing the benefits of we put money into improving the displays and the product offerings in our locations and this certainly is paying off. And I think it's really revitalized a lot of the markets for us and people are again recognizing that we are a good place to turn for their home improvement projects and I think that's the reason for the real improvement in the R&R area for us.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, guys.
Operator: And next from Sterne Agee, we have Jay McCan (sic) [McCanless].
Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to clarify on the $157 million in cash interest, when we're putting that into the model we need to deduct the $7.8 million gain, which would get it to around what $148 million to $149 million for what you're going to show in the financials?
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: No, Jay since you have to add in the unamortized debt non-cash cost of about $8 million as well, so....
Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee: Okay. So those would net out?
Jennifer Pasquino - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah.
Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee: Okay, perfect. And then the second question I had on SG&A, you guys were a little bit above what we were looking for on a dollar basis. How should we be thinking about that for the second quarter and was there any other one-time or maybe not one-time, but items you don't expect to recur in the SG&A numbers from 1Q?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Nothing terribly significant. A couple of smaller things come to mind but nothing that I think would impact your modeling as far as one-time costs that hit the first quarter.
Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee: Okay, okay. And then I was going to ask you guys is there a range of adjusted EBITDA we should be thinking about for 2Q, as I believe, and also maybe you can frame any commentary you would want to give around that versus what the pro forma numbers were last year?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I figured you'd back me into a corner, Jay. It's early in the quarter, but I'll do my best here. We commented a little bit on sales already. I think from a gross margin perspective in the second quarter I think it will be similar to what we saw in the first quarter, somewhere in that 25% range. From an EBITDA perspective last year on a pro forma basis we did right at $100 million. I think, as things sit today, I think we'll be somewhere in the $120 million to $125 million EBITDA range for the quarter.
Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee: Okay, fine. That sounds great. That's all the questions I had. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning. Hi. Congrats on a good quarter.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Hey, thanks Trey.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks, Trey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: So can you – and I appreciate the color you just gave Chad on the EBITDA range and all of that. So, just to be clear, I know you talked about a little bit of color on sales and how to think about the top-line there and you talked about starts and the lag and that sort of thing. If we were to kind of take a look at the starts from last quarter, which were obviously very good, but then we combine that with a little bit of softness in April or choppiness, as you called it, from weather and things, and then there will probably be some catch up. Just not understanding exactly how quickly that catch up can occur. Any more color you can give us on how to think about may be just the absolute volume number there. And then I know you said on lumber that it should kind of equal out this quarter I think is the way I understood it from a lumber impact. So, any other color you could help us with on that front to kind of sort out the numbers?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I've looked at the consensus that's out there and I think the consensus is a reasonable number for us in the second quarter, which I think is around 5%. So, again, it's very early in the quarter. So, I can give you my best guess now, it's probably somewhere in that 5% to 7% range.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, fair enough. And then, have you – so, I guess, trying to get a sense for what you're seeing on the labor front for framers and other skilled labor. Are you seeing any improvement there, obviously not for you guys workforce necessarily, but more from like on a, from a framer standpoint or other skilled workers out there? And also do you – with that, do you guys expect completions to continue to narrow at all as far as the gap between starts and completions that we saw really come about last year?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. Trey, the labor situation is still very tight out there. I think it is one of the major inhibitors against – that's really keeping and slowing down the housing from even being better than the pace that we're currently seeing. We're also seeing tight labor within our operations. It's not just restricted to the job site. We're finding ways to solve the problem obviously, but it's much tighter than what anything that we've seen here over the past several years. I would say that it's not getting any worse out on the job side, but it is still very tight and it still is slowing down that house going from start to a unit completed.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Right. And I think there is some confusion out there as it kind of relates to that and what that relationship is to your business? And, Chad, you noted that there is a bit of a lag from the time you see a start to when you guys start to benefit from it or start to see that kind of business. What is that lag currently from a start to – when you guys start to get folks out on the job side and then has that, I guess, that lag is probably a little longer than what you've seen in the past and how is that impacting things?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, it is a little longer. Generally a start is when they start pressing the dirt and they're working on the foundation and then it becomes a unit under construction once the foundation is set and that's when our opportunity for business arises. And so for several reasons, it can be rain, it can be – there is -- in many markets a delay in getting slabs poured. So, it could be a two or three months lag right now between a start and then a unit under construction. And then the other thing you need to keep in mind post acquisition is we're about 25% R&R and so that – first quarter was a little unusual as far as the growth we had in R&R, but typically you're looking at R&R growth in the 3% to 4% range. And so, when you look at our new business going forward and you're just trying to baseline that off of starts, it would be very difficult for us on a go forward basis to keep up with single family starts as a consolidated company because we are heavily, more heavily weighted towards R&R now.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Correct. That makes a lot of sense. And then the last one from me is maybe a little bigger picture longer term thinking here on the synergy guidance. The overall synergy guidance that you gave of $100 million to $120 million, where do you guys see the most opportunity for upside or downside to that number as you could. It seems like you're very confident in that number. So, I wouldn't think there'd be a whole lot of risk at the downside, but given your confidence, just wondering where you guys could see the different leverage moving that could create numbers outside that range?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I think you said it correctly, the downside risk I look at as very minimal. I think it's appropriate to talk about some upside and the $100 million to $120 million was really what we expected to achieve in the first two years. Beyond that two-year window as we get more of the company on to one ERP system, I do expect to have additional cost savings that will primarily come in more of the back office functions and the efficiencies we gain by being on one ERP system. And so, as we've talked about in the past, that's a three to four-year process. So I think the upside to that $120 million is real, but it's going to be more of a year three or four as we get on more of the company on one ERP.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, that makes sense. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Good luck, guys.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: All right. Our next question comes from Will Randow with Citi.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: You bet.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): In terms of pricing for your non-commodity categories, could you go through that in terms of dry wall roofing and some of the other I'll call it ancillary products?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: As far as changes in...
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Exactly.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think (35:55)?
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Correct as well as the benefits you're seeing from procurement savings?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, from the procurement savings we've wrapped up our engineered wood RFP and those results came in as we had hoped they would and right now we're going out to some of the other specialty products; doors and windows for example. Those are currently in process. So that all feels like it's tracking as we expected. As far as price increases we've seen this year, I think most of the windows and doors guys are somewhere in that 5% range I think on average.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah, thank you for that. And then as a follow up, you mentioned the flooding in Houston. Obviously the results show fair amount of storms in North Dallas. Have you seen any benefit in April or May from that inclement weather?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: It's still very wet and so those markets that you just mentioned, I would say, construction is still lagging a little bit as the logs are drying out. So we have had a break in the rain in the last week or so. So, I would expect that to start picking up more in the coming weeks.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. And anything – you don't lose business by the wet weather. All it does is push it out. And we definitely are seeing now when – as things are drying out and we're definitely the – the shipping schedules are rapidly picking up and it will – all it does is move a little bit further out for us, but the business is there.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right. Thanks for that guys and good luck in the next quarter.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Next up from Thompson Research we have Nick Coppola.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Hi. Good morning.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning, Nick.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Can you add some more color on what your thoughts are around lumber pricing and it was certainly nice to see the rebound in recent weeks that you've talked about. I guess what are your thoughts around pricing and what are your go-forward expectations?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Certainly my feelings are that we will see a slowly improving lumber pricing lumber and lumber sheet goods pricing. We certainly are experiencing that now. If I look at over the last eight weeks and do on an eight-week average comparing this present time to last year same time, then we're seeing, we've seen an improvement that's about 5%, little over 5%, the last four weeks that's almost like a 6% improvement over the same time last year. I think this is, the market is really starting to correct itself. I don't see a runaway market in pricing, but I can see a continually improving situation for us. The mill capacities are coming up. We saw one here recently it was in their earnings report, one of the major OSB producers are now up to a 93% capacity. I suspect many of the manufacturers are getting up into that high 80%, low 90% capacity. That can only mean – and there is going to be no real new mills coming on stream that I'm aware of. So that means I would expect to see a slowly improving pricing and I think for the rest of the year we'll probably be in an inflation mode versus last year. And I think that's going to be somewhere in that 5% to 10% improvement over last year over that period of time though. And I think we're going to see – continue to see into next year as long as housing continue to improve, which our feelings are very much that it will. We don't see anything certainly at this point that's going to cause housing to slow down or falter, and we see a continual gradual improvement in housing. We think all the elements are there in place to support it. And I think the mills in the future, as we got into the future, I think we're going to start seeing lumber and lumber sheet goods pricing get back to more of their – the normal level of pricing that we saw back in the 2005-2006 period of time.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then shifting gears a bit, can you just talk about any weather benefits in the quarter? And so likely something difficult to quantify there. But apart from the flooding you talked about, there was also unseasonably warm weather in a lot of the regions in the country. And so what was the benefit there? And do you think there was any related pull-forward demand?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, you're right. Some of the major flooding we were talking about, Houston in particular, was an April event, so that wasn't a first quarter event. In most markets, the weather in the first quarter was much better than it was a year ago.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah it was much milder winter.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. And less snow and ice. And so I think that's why you saw the 22% increase in starts and that's why our demand in the first quarter, to some degree, was stronger than we had expected and some of that was weather driven. So I think, overall, it was a very favorable quarter from a weather basis. It was more April where we kind of got the negative impact.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: But we are seeing the level of housing activity and what builders are projecting and planning for the coming months is staying right on that pace that we think in 8% to 10%.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. And I would expect the benefit in the first quarter was more catch-up than it was pulling business forward. That's what my gut says.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for taking my questions.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: All right. And next from BB&T Capital Markets, we have Matt McCall.
Reuben Garner - BB&T Securities LLC: Good morning, everybody. This is Reuben in for Matt.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Hey, Reuben.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Good morning, Reuben.
Reuben Garner - BB&T Securities LLC: Good morning. So you gave free cash flow guidance in the same range you gave before. I just wanted to make sure I understood the components. You beat on the EBITDA side in the first quarter and you've got lumber moving in the right direction. I just wanted to see if I'm – and it seemed like D&A was a little higher than we thought in the quarter. So I just wanted to see if you could run through the components for this year and maybe offer any insight as to your outlook on cash flow for the next couple of years?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, the major pieces are going to be whatever you want your EBITDA starting point to be for the year, but I think CapEx will be around 1.5% of sales, cash taxes will be minimal, $5 million to $6 million. Working capital – and I would refer you to slide 11 in the presentation. Working capital would probably be in that 9% to 10% range on incremental sales, and then cash interest in that $157 million range, so that should get you somewhere in that $75 million to $85 million of free cash flow this year. And as we pointed out in the opening comments, as we get deeper into next year and we get the one-time cost behind us and get full realization of the cost savings, those two things right there would add another $75 million or so in free cash flow, even assuming a flat housing environment. So that's why we made the comment earlier that once we get those items behind us we would expect free cash flow to pick up even more.
Reuben Garner - BB&T Securities LLC: Okay. And then how much of that will go towards just sheer debt reduction? And then can you just update us on what your thoughts are on the net leverage for the next couple of years?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Well, it's hard to say exactly how much will. It will depend on the opportunities we have to attack the debt. But we're going to continue to be aggressive at it and look for opportunities. I would expect by the end of this year, we should be well below five times levered and then by the end of 2017, we should be well below four times would be my estimate at this point.
Reuben Garner - BB&T Securities LLC: Okay. And then one last one. You, in the past, have given a full-year or incremental margin target on the EBITDA line of about 12% to 15%, I think you said, ex-synergies. And this quarter, you just did about 19%. Does 12% to 15% for the full year still make sense? And...?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think it still makes sense. We had year-over-year gross margin expansion, which certainly helps your flow through. As we get deeper into this year, as we alluded to you earlier, we won't have the benefit of commodity deflation. And so some of that benefit of the gross margin expansion will probably go away. So I still think we will end up for the year somewhere in that 12% to 15%.
Reuben Garner - BB&T Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: All right. And, ladies and gentlemen, we have time for two more questions. Next up we have Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my questions.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: You bet.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Wanted to go back to – I think in response to Will's question earlier about procurement. And I think you outlined engineered wood RFPs complete, doors and windows in process. Just wanted to confirm, first. So is engineered wood the only one that's complete, as far as the supplier reviews, at this point? And then could you just talk us through the timeline for some of those other big categories, once doors and – when are doors and windows going to be complete? And then some of the other areas?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: On a daily basis, we're obviously going after our suppliers on price and using the benefit of our scale. But when you start talking to some of these specialty products and there's fewer suppliers that can serve you in all your markets and so those were a much more structured RFP process. I believe we've also completed wallboard and, as I said, windows and doors are in process right now. Those are going to be your major categories where we'll go out and do full-blown RFPs and have a structured process around that. But the other categories, we're chipping away at a daily basis. And in some of those categories, you really don't put in one, two year pricing or rebate type programs. Those are more just taking opportunities that are available in the market at the time you're going out and making buys.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then shifting gears to the sales side, just some of the category sales. So if I look at gypsum, roofing and insulation, up 6%. I think if you look at some of the other industry players, either your peers or your suppliers seeing some numbers well north of that. So curious if you could give any color on what you were seeing in those areas? And do you think you were – how do you think you fared relative to the market in terms of end demand?
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. I think for us in our markets, most of our roofing and gypsum products are going into single-family remodeling projects. We're not really doing the larger commercial projects that drives and certainly that is a driving factor for some of the other companies who were reporting, who are pure play roofing guys or gypsum guys. I think our market performance for those products was very good. Could it be better? Yeah. And we're working on that. We're also expanding some of the areas and adding some new areas to help drive our results in those products. We like those products. They are a good contributor to our overall package and they certainly have a lot of attractiveness to us for the future. And so that pretty much sums up all I can say about the products and the performance in the first quarter.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Then last question, just maybe another clarification, and Chad, for you. Just going back to the debt reduction comments from before, I think there's a footnote in the slide on interest forecast that's talking about excluding annual principal pay-down of $5.5 million. Just want to confirm, that's just a normal annual required pay-down, and not a comment on – that you only expect to reduce principal another $5.5 million?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: That's correct. That's the required pay-down.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've time for one more question. We'll hear from Dillard Watt with Stifel.
Dillard Watt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. Chad, maybe just lastly, if there's any way you can break out the gross margin improvement? I know you broke out the three buckets. Was there any one that was more material than others? And then secondly, related to that, is the commodity price deflation, is that all related to lumber? Or were there some other benefits related to maybe fuel or energy costs?
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think we have about $1 million or $2 million favorable variance on fuel quarter-over-quarter. I can't think of any other commodity products where it would have been meaningful. As far as your other question on the margin enhancement, I would say probably – I would say those three are fairly evenly spread on the margin improvement, probably about a third, a third, a third would be my best guess.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: I think it was pretty much spread across all of the major value-add category.
M. Chad Crow - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah. And we've probably got about a 30 basis point tailwind on the margin, of the 90 basis points, from deflation.
Dillard Watt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Simple question, simple answer. Thanks, guys.
Operator: All right. And with no further questions at this time, I will turn things back to Mr. Sherman for any closing or additional remarks.
Floyd F. Sherman - Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Okay. We appreciate everyone joining the call today. We look forward to updating you on the progress of the integration and our business initiatives in the months ahead. If you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to give Chad or Jen a call. Thank you and we hope you have a good day and a good weekend.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Builders FirstSource's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be archived at www.bldr.com. It is now my pleasure to introduce Ms. Jennifer Pasquino, Senior Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Jennifer Pasquino: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Builders FirstSource fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call is Floyd Sherman, Chief Executive Officer of Builders FirstSource; and Chad Crow, President and Chief Financial Officer. A copy of the slide presentation referenced on this call is available on the Investor Relations section of the Builders FirstSource website at www.bldr.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. Any reproduction of this call, in whole or in part, is not permitted without prior written authorization of Builders FirstSource. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, March 4, 2016. Builders FirstSource issued a press release after the market closed yesterday. If you don't have a copy, you can find it on our website at bldr.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we may make statements concerning the company's future prospects, financial results, business strategies, and industry trends. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 199, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Please refer to our most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other reports filed with the SEC for more information on those risks. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. The acquisition of ProBuild closed on July 31, 2015, the closing date. As a result, ProBuild's financial results are only included in the company's GAAP financial statements from the closing date forward and are not reflecting the company's historical financial statements. We have, therefore, provided supplemental financial information of the combined company in this press release that is pro forma or adjusted to include ProBuild's financial results for the relevant periods prior to the closing date. The company will discuss these pro forma adjusted results on this call. We've provided reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents in our earnings press release and detailed explanations of non-GAAP financial measures in our Form 8-K filed yesterday, both of which are available at our website. At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Floyd Sherman.
Floyd Sherman: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 earnings call. Before I give a brief recap of the 2015 results, I want to provide an update on the integration and progress against the cost savings initiatives outlined when the acquisition of ProBuild was announced. And then I'll give a brief recap of 2015 and turn the call over to Chad who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions. Let's begin our discussion on slide 4 with an overview of the key benefits of the ProBuild combination. On July 31, 2015, we completed the acquisition of ProBuild, one of the largest distributors of building materials to professional builders, contractors and project-oriented consumers in the United States. The combination creates a clear industry leader with expanded growth and margin opportunities. We believe that the benefits of the acquisition include increased scale and diversification, enhanced cross-selling opportunities for value-added products, better customer penetration, and projected $100 million to $120 million of targeted annual cost savings before one-time expenses. Now that we're a few months past the acquisition close, I'm eager to share with you an update on our integration efforts. We're very pleased with the progress of the integration efforts thus far. We're making great strides in combining our organization into one company. All aspects of the integration, including system conversions and facility consolidations, are in full swing and progressing as planned. Management and operating teams are collectively driving our business goals. The company has achieved several key milestones to date in the integration process, including closing 12 of the planned 18 overlapping locations, completing ERP conversions at 16 locations, including our Dallas-Fort Worth market, with seven more in process this month, and transitioning all associates to the new benefit plans. We all have a strong focus on customer service to sustain and grow local market relationships. So far, employee and customer attrition has been very minimal. Moving to slide 5, we believe that we will deliver the $100 million to $120 million in annual run rate cost saving synergies that were outlined when the deal was announced. Synergies are expected to be captured through network optimization, procurement, and general and administrative costs, with a breakout of about 20%, 30%, and 50% targeted for each area, respectively. Within five months of the acquisition close, we've already implemented cost savings initiatives that are projected to yield almost $45 million in future run rate savings. This include $12 million in projected procurement initiatives, $9 million in projected network consolidation savings and $24 million in projected overhead and SG&A savings. Additionally, benefit plans were put in to effect January 1, 2016, which are projected to yield approximately $20 million in annual savings. We expect that our ongoing cost saving initiatives will benefit fiscal 2016 by $60 million to $70 million. As part of the integration process, we expect to incur $90 million to $100 million in onetime costs to achieve these synergies. Approximately $43 million of these onetime costs were incurred in 2015 and $30 million are expected in 2016. Our integration efforts and cost savings realization are the highest priority for us. I remain convinced that the combination of Builders FirtsSource and ProBuild will create value for our shareholders and customers alike in the years to come. Please turn to slide 6. Through the acquisition of ProBuild, we have created a more diversified company with enhanced scale and an improved geographic footprint. We're the leading distributor of building products to the professional building channel. This allows us better customer reach and less exposure to any one market. Our national scale facilitates strategic partnerships to customers and suppliers. We're leveraging our presence in 40 states and 74 of the top 100 MSAs to become the national supplier of choice for large-production home builders. We believe our scale improves our purchasing leverage. Our national footprint and end market diversity reduces our dependency on any one market or segment. By way of example, sales in Texas accounted for 17% of our 2015 pro forma sales, with sales split roughly evenly between the Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio/Austin markets. Dallas-Fort Worth and San Antonio/Austin markets have very strong growth trajectories, while Houston has been impacted by falling oil prices, most notably in the higher-end homes. However, Houston represents only about 4.5% of our 2015 pro forma sales. No other state accounts for more than 8% of our sales. Other states showing strong growth, including California, Florida, the Carolinas and Georgia, are top markets for us. As a result of the acquisition, 23% of our sales now come from the repair/remodel customers. This business has proven historically to provide a more stable revenue base, with strong growth in profit margin and good returns. We feel the geographic diversity and enhanced customer base has added both stability and value to our business model. Turning to slide 7, I'm pleased with the growth in sales over the prior year despite the negative impact of commodity deflation on our 2015 sales. Average market prices for framing lumber have fallen approximately 13% in 2015. As a result, our full-year 2015 lumber and lumber sheet goods sales were down 5% versus 2014. However, our value-added sales of manufactured products, windows, doors and millwork increased 6% versus 2014. We believe our company is well positioned to help homebuilders mitigate the impact of well-publicized labor shortages and increased cycle funds through our manufactured and valuated products across our national footprint. Before turning it over to Chad, I'll give a brief recap of 2015 results. We ended 2015 with pro forma sales of $6.1 billion, up 1% as compared to last year, excluding the impact of closed locations but grew adjusted EBITDA by 22% or $56 million. I am pleased with the growth and profit over the prior year despite the negative impact of commodity deflation on our 2015 sales. Excluding the impact of deflation, our new residential volume sales grew 6% in the year and repair and remodel grew 5% versus prior year. Lumber prices have stabilized a bit since the low point in September 2015 but still representing headwind for us in the first half of 2016 at current levels. I'll now turn the call over to Chad who'll review our financial results in more detail.
Chad Crow: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning, everyone. I will first discuss the current quarter of pro forma adjusted sales results on slide 9. As a reminder, we have reflected pro forma adjusted figures to include ProBuild's financial results prior to the closing date and normalized for onetime integration, closure and other costs. For the fourth quarter, we reported pro forma net sales of $1.46 billion, down 1.1% compared to pro forma sales for the fourth quarter of 2014 excluding the impact of closed locations. Total sales volume grew 7.1% over pro forma sales for the fourth quarter at 2014 that was offset by 8.2% as a result of the negative impact of commodity price deflation on our sales. Sales volume grew 8.1% in the home building end market and 3.8% in the repair and remodel end market. This growth was largely in line with new single family construction and repair and remodel market growth. Immediately following an acquisition of this size, concern exists that either integration destructions or customer reaction would impact sales in the short term. I am pleased that has not been the case as our volume growth [indiscernible] with market growth this quarter. From a product mix standpoint, our value added product categories made up a higher percentage of overall pro forma sales as our prefabricated, components, windows, doors and millwork categories accounted for 38.6% of adjusted sales in the current quarter compared to 37.6% in the quarter – fourth quarter of last year. Our lumber and lumber sheet goods declined as a percentage of sales from 33.8% in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 31.7% this quarter. Our other building products and services categories were up slightly compared to last year. Our pro forma gross margin percentage was 26.3%, up approximately 150 basis points from 24.8% last year. Our gross margin percentage increased largely due to improved customer pricing, commodity price deflation and a higher mix of value added sales. Our procurement saving initiatives has just begun to materialize. Interest expense was $43 million in the quarter and in February 2016, we entered into debt exchanges which reduced our long term debt by $14.8 million and reduced annual cash interest expense by approximately $9.9 million. Adjusted net loss was $0.3 million or $0.00 per diluted share compared to a loss of $14.5 million or $0.14 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA on the fourth quarter of 2015 was $76.3 million or 5.2% of sales compared to $67.1 million or 4.5% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2014. This represents 14% growth on a year-over- year basis. We have provided an EBITDA reconciliation on slide 13. I will now move to the annual results on slide 10. Pro forma net sales were $6.1 billion for fiscal 2015, an increase of 1% compared to pro forma sales for 2014 excluding the impact of close locations. Total sales volume grew 5.8% over pro forma sales for fiscal 2014 that was offset by 4.8% as a result of the negative impact of commodity price deflation on our sales. Sales volume increased 5.9% in the homebuilding end market and 5.3% in the repair and remodeling market. Breaking down our 2015 pro forma sales by key product categories, excluding the impact of closed locations, manufacturing products were $997 million, up 4.3% from 2014. Windows, doors, and millwork are $1.27 billion, up 6.8%. Lumber and lumber sheet goods were $1.99 billion, down approximately $100 million or 5.2% from approximately $2.1 billion in 2014. From a product mix standpoint, our value-added product categories made up a higher percentage of overall pro forma sales as our prefabricated components – windows, doors, and millwork categories – accounted for 37.3% of adjusted sales in 2015 compared to 35.7% last year. Our lumber and lumber sheet goods declined as a percentage of sales from 35% in 2014 to 32.8% this year. Our other building products and services categories were up slightly compared to last year. Pro forma gross margin percentage was 25.6%, up 130 basis points from 24.3% in 2014. Our gross margin percentage increased largely due to improved customer pricing, commodity price deflation, and a higher mix of value-added sales. Pro forma interest expense was $180.9 million in 2015, excluding certain onetime financing costs and normalizing for the incremental debt issued to finance the ProBuild acquisition. Adjusted net income was $17.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to an adjusted loss of $69.4 million or $0.64 adjusted loss per diluted share for 2014. Due to accelerated depreciation and amortization being taken on assets acquired, the pro forma presentation shifts approximately $21 million of pro forma D&A expense from 2015 to 2014. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $115 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA in 2015 was $313.3 million or 5.2% of sales compared to $257.2 million or 4.2% of sales for 2014. This represents 22% growth on a year-over-year basis. Turning to slide 11, total liquidity at December 31, 2015 was $684 million consisting of net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand. As of December 31, the company had reduced the amount outstanding on the revolving credit facility to $60 million. While we expect to borrow under our revolving credit facility for seasonal working capital and other operating needs, we expect to pay down additional debt in 2016. In February, the company exchanged $282 million of aggregate principal amount of our 2023 notes for $268 million of our 2021 notes to reduce its annual cash interest expense by approximately $10 million. We have provided interest reconciliation to provide a normalized ongoing view of our interest expense and current debt levels. We have about five years until our first debt maturity. We are intent on making significant strides in delivering the balance sheet between now and then. We intend to primarily do this through cash generation and paying down debt although we may from time to time enter into opportunistic transactions that lower our interest expense or otherwise address our capital structure allowing us to even further delever the balance sheet. We expect free cash flow generation will enable us to meaningfully reduce the absolute level of debt over the next several years. We believe this will be driven by EBITDA growth including projected annual cost savings realization of $100 million to $120 million by the end of 2017 and a focus on working capital efficiency which we believe will run between 9% and 10% of incremental sales. We will invest in our business through capital expenditures at approximately 1.5% of sales. We plan to utilize our approximate $260 million of NOL to shelter us from paying federal cash taxes through 2016 and much of 2017. In 2016, we expect onetime integration cost of approximately $30 million and cash interest of $155 million. If you factor all these items in, we expect to generate approximately $75 million to $85 million in cash flow in 2016. We are focused on reducing debt and are optimistic about our cash flow generation opportunities. Should market conditions unexpectedly accelerate or decelerate, we have the ability to quickly adjust our capital spending and working capital accordingly. As we move to slide 14, we have provided a quarterly review of 2015 pro forma and adjusted sales, gross profit margin, EBITDA and net income. This presentation assumes the ProBuild acquisition closed on January 1, 2015, and should provide investors the baseline to model our business and its seasonality. As we are now two months into the year, I would like to provide some color on the first quarter of 2016. We expect sales to grow 6% to 7% with gross profit margin in the 25% range, approximately 90 basis points over the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the $50 million to $60 million range versus $20.8 million in the first quarter of 2015. We expect synergies to benefit the quarter by approximately $15 million and EBITDA conversion on incremental sales for the base business, so excluding synergy savings and onetime costs to implement, in the 15% to 20% range. I'll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd Sherman: Thank you, Chad. I remain very positive about the future of Builders FirstSource. While global macroeconomic unease has recently weighed on the homebuilding outlook, I believe our industry remains on a trajectory of steady but positive growth. We expect to grow profitably and realized our synergy cost savings. Our company is well-positioned to be the building supply company of choice for builders around the country thanks to our geographic reach, enhanced product offerings, national manufacturing capabilities, and superior customer service. Our focus will be to leverage our national scale and sales capability to grow faster than the market with the focus on profitable growth and value-added products. These strengths, our scale and the potential leverage provided by the synergy savings combines to make a Builders FirstSource that is greater than the some other parts. We've demonstrated our ability to reduce debt again this quarter and are committed to continuing to reduce leverage through annual pay it flow generation. Our integration efforts with ProBuild are progressing as expected and I attribute this success to the great associates that I have the pleasure to work with every day. To all the associates, I'd say thank you. I remain convinced that the combination of Builders FirstSource and ProBuild will create value for our shareholders and customers alike in the years to come. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Over to Andrew Casella, Deutsche Bank.
Andrew Casella: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess within two parts of this question, can you talk about I guess the genesis of the exchange offer, was this company led or was this led by bond holders. And I guess the second part of the question would be why do the exchange versus potentially use some of what looks to be a pretty big sum of liquidity, substantially buy back bonds in the open market and just reduced cash interest overall instead of just – or being a few percentage points on cash carry?
Chad Crow: Yeah. To answer your first question, it was company-generated and really just looking to take advantage of where the bonds were trading and the arbitrage between those two. To your second question, we were able to do this fairly quickly without using any liquidity and got a little bit of interest savings and brought the debt down some. But to your point, as we get deeper into the year, we might very well look to reduce debt and other matters which could include paying down debt with cash flow and the liquidity that we have.
Andrew Casella: Got it. And when you think about total liquidity, I mean, $700 million seems to be higher than what you would need for working capital swings. I mean, what's kind of the way you think about minimum liquidity and therefore kind of that dry powder to go after, whether it's market mispricings on your bonds or whatnot for debt reduction?
Chad Crow: Yeah. That's a good question and a subject that gets bandied around here a lot. I do feel very comfortable with the amount of liquidity we have. To some degree, everyone in the industry is still licking their wounds from what happened over the last five to seven years. And so it's hard to know – you never really know how much liquidity is enough, right? But I do feel good about our liquidity level. I do think we have some excess liquidity to play with to improve our capital structure. But we're probably going to wait until we get deeper into the year in the spring selling season before we take any action that would use up some of our liquidity.
Andrew Casella: Got it. And then just, again, just housekeeping, how much left of that basket do you have left to do those exchanges?
Chad Crow: Well, we didn't use any baskets. We really just used the four times secured debt ratio as part of the secured notes. But as far as that calculation goes, I think there's maybe another $50 million or so.
Andrew Casella: Right. That's helpful. And then just thinking about synergies, this is a question on slide 5. When we look at that $45 million of incremental cost savings, how should we think about that running through the numbers during the year? I mean, is it going to be front-end loaded? How should we kind of model that?
Chad Crow: The $45 million should be spread fairly evenly. So, the good chunk of that was changes that went into effect January 1.
Andrew Casella: Got it. And then to your comments, opportunistic transactions, if you could just elaborate a little bit what would that be – what would that constitute size-wise? What would you be comfortable kind of taking down if the opportunity presents itself?
Chad Crow: Well, that goes back to how much base liquidity do we think we need. And to be honest, I just don't – I don't have the answer for that yet. That's still kind of a work in process.
Andrew Casella: All right. Got it. And then just final question, I apologize if I missed it. What is the CapEx expectations for the year? And then if you could just repeat what you had said on the integration cost and when those are expected to be realized.
Chad Crow: The CapEx this year will probably be somewhere around $90 million, $90 million to $100 million. The one-time integration cost that we expect to incur in 2016 is about $30 million.
Andrew Casella: Got it. Thanks so much and good luck. I'll get back in the queue.
Operator: We'll go next to Drew Lipke with Stephens.
Drew Lipke: Yeah. Good morning, guys.
Floyd Sherman: Hey, Drew.
Chad Crow: Good morning.
Drew Lipke: First question I had, on your gypsum, roofing and installation sales, we did see those down 2.6% for the second quarter in a row. That's in a bit contrast to some trends that we've seen from others, just curious what are you guys attribute that to and sort of what's going on there?
Floyd Sherman: I think some of it, some of it we saw some softening in the pricing in the marketplace for us. Lot of the commercial projects, I think a lot of people started getting concerned whether there was going to be a gradual slowing down in that particular area. The competitiveness I think really affected some of the pricing. We're seeing that coming back. The roofing really – we didn't have any really good hailstorms to help us that we had in previous years and I know that sounds pretty catalyst a way to put it, but hailstorms are very, very good for the – for our roofing business and particularly in the areas that we have very strong roofing sales. It definitely affected the year-over-year comparison, but those are the main reasons.
Drew Lipke: Okay. That's helpful. And then, as it relates to ProBuild sales specifically, I mean, overall you guys are tracking pretty in line with the end markets. I'm curious what are you seeing with ProBuild's standalone specific sales? How are they tracking and sort of what steps are you guys taking to allow ProBuild to better compete in the market?
Floyd Sherman: I think their tracking pretty close to ours. I think we've discussed in the past, prior to us acquiring ProBuild. Their strategy was more going after margin and maybe walking some of the lower margin business, was this in some ways in contrast to some of our strategy and as you know, our mix of large national builders was historically higher than ProBuild. And so we've simply acquired them. We've loosen the range a little bit and told them, hey, with the changes we're making to their cost structure, we should be able to sell the large homebuilder profitably and so we've loosened the range a little bit to let them go after some of that business that prior to us acquiring them than they may have passed on.
Chad Crow: Yeah. I think you could really see the effects of that as we've been accelerating since the acquisition was closed, the fourth quarter in particular. We saw a really good improvement in the sales on the ProBuild side and we were able to overcome a very, very tough commodity deflation effect. And we look at on a quarterly basis, the commodity effect we had with negative 100 – it cost us about $121 million in sales. So, that will give you some indication of the strength that came back in the other parts of our business and certainly the ProBuild locations are contributing strong to that.
Drew Lipke: Okay. That's helpful. Then just last one from me, we've yet to see it in the census data, but it sounds like the unseasonably warm and dry weather we've seen year-to-date has allowed a lot of builders to close the gap on [indiscernible] completion. I'm curious, are you guys seeing that year-to-date? And I appreciate the initial Q1 commentary that you gave. But I was just curious what you're seeing there. And then as a follow on to that, what are you seeing in terms of the competitive environment around sort of pricing as we sort of kick off spring season?
Chad Crow: I think we are seeing that so far in our first quarter. As I've said, I think our sales are going to be up 6% to 7% and that's facing another pretty stiff commodity deflation headwind. And so that should be a good indication that we have seen some acceleration in this quarter.
Floyd Sherman: We're really pleased with the way things are progressing in the quarter. There's a lot of – we're seeing good activity out on the job sites. Still very active in homebuilding. The biggest problem issue that we still face is labor out on the jobsite. It probably – if you look at completions versus starts, you can really see that. So, that's the only thing that's really hold – that I can see that's holding anything back, but we're really pleased to see the way the quarter is going right now.
Chad Crow: And on your second question about pricing, I mean, pricing is still tough. It's still very competitive out there. When you look at where we are from a starts level, we're still well below any sort of normal building environment. So, it's still pretty tough from a pricing standpoint.
Drew Lipke: All right. Well, that's helpful, guys. I appreciate it. Thanks and best of luck.
Chad Crow: Thanks, Drew.
Operator: We'll go next to Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse.
Anthony Trainor: Hi. You have Anthony Trainor filling in for Mike. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter and congrats on the progress.
Chad Crow: Thank you.
Anthony Trainor: My question – yeah. My question – on slide 5, you have the estimated run rate cost savings. So, relative to, I think, the expectations you laid out, on 3Q, it looks like the actions taken to date are probably running $5 million light 4Q versus what you're expecting last quarter. And then on the flip side, it looks like your year one expectations are now $90 million versus $80 million last year. So, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about whether the – maybe the sources of the change and how much timing played a role in this?
Chad Crow: Well, as you can imagine, there's a lot of moving parts. We've got a lot going on from an integration standpoint. And so yeah, I think we said in the third quarter might be around $85 million. We're being probably a little conservative. We got the range back at the $90 million to $100 million where have had it originally. The biggest moving parts is largely on the ERP conversion efforts, the cost associated with that, and then a little bit of give and take on the some of the employee-related cost, relocation, severance, retention bonuses things like that.
Anthony Trainor: Thanks. That's helpful. And as a follow up on the ERP, could you talk little bit about what the result is of once you switch over to the new ERP systems and kind of how much of a difference that – how much of a change that makes to your ability to manage the cost savings?
Chad Crow: Well, the $100 million to $120 million cost savings that we laid out were, for the most part, independent of ERP conversions. Now as we get deeper into the conversion process and as we said before, this is going to be – it could be a four or five-year process to get through all these. And we went through a similar process at Builders over the years as we grew through acquisitions. But as you get everyone closer to being on one ERP system, the savings you can generate and the efficiencies you can gain just by really having real-time access to consolidated information to manage your inventory, to manage your credit, to manage your payroll and your overtime cost and then reduce head count in the back office, as you get everyone on one system just as far as APE payroll, all the back-office functions are much more efficient. So, some of those savings we will realize beyond that two-year window as we get more and more of the company on to the same ERP system. But it's really just an overall efficiency in having real-time consolidated information at your fingertips to run the company.
Anthony Trainor: Great. That's helpful. And then, shifting gears here a little bit to the value add penetration, nice progress there. Could you talk about – is this still coming – the increased ventures, is this still coming at the legacy FirstSource side of the business or how has the sales synergy started applying the techniques on the ProBuild side of the business? How is that progress going?
Floyd Sherman: Still progressing well on both fronts, and I think we will continue to see that. Labor is still an issue out on job sites. And so, I think the builders will continue to demand the [indiscernible] components. A lot of our capital spend that we have slated for 2016 involves expanding that opportunity on the ProBuild side. We've got some facilities that were increasing the capacity on through additional equipment and automated equipment. We're relocating some facilities to increase capacity and opening a couple of new truss and panel facilities. And so, it's something we'll continue to work on. It's not something you can turn around in a month or two, but we're putting a lot of effort into that, just like from the Builders FirstSource side we've done for the last decade.
Anthony Trainor: Great. Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Rob Hansen with Deutsche Bank.
Rob Hansen: Thanks. I just wanted to kind of return to the leverage topic here. How much of a seasonal draw should we expect to see in 1Q or 2Q and then how much debt do you want to pay off in 2016, right? I think you mentioned $80 million of free cash flow. Should we expect all of that to go straight towards debt repayment?
Chad Crow: I think we may speak out at the maybe $150 million, $175 million out on the revolver and it's peaked during the year. And then obviously, we'll see that comes back down towards the end of the year as the building season slows. To answer your second question, I don't know if I'd say all of the $80 million to $85 million of cash flow. But certainly a significant portion of it, I would expect to be used to take some debt off the balance sheet.
Rob Hansen: Got it. Okay. And then can you just give us maybe some sort of stats or something that we could kind of – you could maybe quantify in terms of being able to sign up new builders on to the value-added products side of the business or maybe some sort of anecdotes or something like that?
Floyd Sherman: I don't – we don't have anything like that handy, Rob. I can work on pulling something together for you. We don't have anything like that at our fingertips right now.
Rob Hansen: Okay. And then just on the 8% volume increase, obviously aside from lumber, right, like what other categories do you feel that the most on that volume piece?
Floyd Sherman: That's going to be your manufactured products and probably the millwork side of the business, I would say will be the top two.
Rob Hansen: Okay. And then you mentioned the new truss and panel facilities, where are those going to be? I know you guys have been thinking about the California market as an opportunity. Is that – are you kind of looking there more to?
Floyd Sherman: Yes. That's where one of them is going in.
Chad Crow: And then there's another one up in the Northeast where we got a pretty good expansion project under way.
Rob Hansen: All right. Well, I appreciate it, guys. Thanks.
Chad Crow: You bet.
Operator: We'll go next to Matt McCall with BB&T Capital Markets.
Matthew McCall: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Chad Crow: Good morning.
Floyd Sherman: Good morning.
Matthew McCall: So, let's see. Chad, you talked about the Q1 guidance held up 6% to 7% in the face of a pretty stiff commodity headwind. Can you quantify what that expectation is from a commodity headwind perspective?
Chad Crow: Yeah. Bear with me here one second. If prices stay where they are today, we estimate that that could be somewhere around the 6% or 7% negative impact on our sales in the first quarter. And then that comparison gets easier as we go on through the year. If pricing stays where it was today, I think by the end of the year, it would be somewhere around a 2% or 3% negative impact on full-year sales.
Matthew McCall: 2% to 3% per year. Okay. And then – so we're not – you talked about in the deck commodity price deflation, but then in the gross profit commentary, you talked about improvement in pricing. So, when you think about – you quantified the commodity price, but can you talk about pricing and the net impact in other categories? I think Floyd answered the Q4, the gypsum and roofing installation, the pricing was softer. But can you put some numbers behind the impact? And where does that show up in the bridge on page 10?
Chad Crow: I'm sorry. It's not page 10.
Floyd Sherman: Yeah. Page 10. Well, I'll speak from a quarterly standpoint for the fourth quarter and our margin. I estimate that the commodity deflation obviously impacts our top line, and so it robs some gross margin dollars from us. Now, we do get a rate improvement as prices are falling, as you know, so I estimate the net impact on gross margin due to commodity deflation was about $15 million to the negative if you're trying to bridge from Q4 last year. And then all the other non-commodity-related products added about $28 million of gross profit dollars. So the net of those two would get you to your $13 million change in margin quarter-over-quarter.
Matthew McCall: Okay. Okay. Let's see, the D&A number you gave was a little lower than we expect. Has something changed there, or did we just model it poorly? We had $98 million in depreciation, $32 million in amortization. We were at about $9 million a year for new CapEx. What did we – [indiscernible]?
Floyd Sherman: No. You didn't model it poorly. But we – after the hand-to-hand combat of going through all the purchase accounting for the year-end audit and getting it all finalized, we ended up putting more to goodwill than the amortizable and tangible assets than we have thought. So that's probably where your difference is coming from.
Matthew McCall: Okay. And then a similar modeling question, the share count was a little bit lower at 109 million. Is that the right way to look at it going forward?
Floyd Sherman: No. I think it's going to be little higher than that.
Chad Crow: Yeah.
Floyd Sherman: Let's see here.
Chad Crow: It's going to be around 113.
Floyd Sherman: Yeah. I think on a fully diluted basis, it will be somewhere around 113 million, 114 million.
Matthew McCall: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.
Floyd Sherman: You bet.
Operator: We go next to John Baugh, Stifel.
John Baugh: Thank you. And Floyd, Chad, Jennifer great start to the integration and year. I was wondering there was a comment in there about incrementals I think you made, Chad, this 15% to 20%. I guess two questions on that. One, how is deflation playing with that number I guess in the first quarter, how do you think about that for the balance of the year? And it seems like a fairly high number overall at least I've seen ProBuild would be of lower incremental than that. Was that just a vast assumption that maybe you could discuss the incremental between ProBuild and Builders FirstSource? Thank you.
Chad Crow: Well, I'll discuss the incremental in total. Yes, when your period of commodity deflation, your incremental is going to be higher because you're generating more margin dollars on a lower sales number essentially. So, it's just the way the map works. Your incremental are going to be higher. And so that's a primary driver as to why that's in the 15% to 20% range and not in the typical 12% to 15%. And then I also think we'll probably get a couple of million dollar benefit in the quarter for lower fuel prices. So that's adding to it as well.
John Baugh: So, Chad, you think more 12% to 15% as commodity deflation evens out or just closer breakeven for the balance of the year?
Chad Crow: That's right.
John Baugh: Great. Thank you. Good luck.
Chad Crow: Thanks.
Operator: We go next to Nick Coppola with Thompson Research Group.
Nicholas Coppola: Hi. Good morning.
Floyd Sherman: Good morning.
Nicholas Coppola: Just to start with a high level question, can you just talk more about your expectations for end markets in 2016, particularly given that economic uncertainty out there? What are customers telling you, and what are you looking for, for the year in terms of new construction and R&R activity?
Chad Crow: Was your first question on margin? Market?
Nicholas Coppola: No. End market expectations.
Chad Crow: Okay. In my opinion, I think we're going to see more of the same. I think we're going to see somewhere in that 8% to 10% growth in single-family starts. I think repair and remodel will still hang in, in that 3% to 5% range. The oil will impact some markets, but we've got plenty of other markets that are not impacted by oil that are showing some great strength. And so, in my opinion, it's going to be more of the same. It's probably similar to what we saw last year. I don't know what your perspective is, Floyd.
Floyd Sherman: Yeah. I think we're also going to be seeing, I think, more movement to the starter home. Certainly Horton with their Express line is definitely showing a lot of strength in this area. I think there are other builders who are following along in the same line. Right now, I think we are seeing it as a steady improvement. We've got the traditional markets in the Southeast. They're still going very well. The Texas market is still very healthy for us. Houston, while it's down 10%, 12% right now, but that's mainly in the upper-end home. We're seeing still a healthy growth in the lower-priced, middle-priced homes in Houston. The Dallas-Fort Worth market, San Antonio or Austin market. They're really, really going strong. The other parts of our country, West Coast, North West, looking very healthy at this point as is the North East. So, I don't see all the pessimism that seems to be prevalent in the press. I think, job growth is looking well. And I think, we're seeing, certainly, more jobs being created in the middle to higher income levels. And so, we feel good about this year. As Chad said, 8% to 10% improvement in housing. I'll take that every year. And I've seen nothing out there, even on the horizon that causes me to feel that we're not going to see that again this year in the improvement in housing.
Nicholas Coppola: Okay. That's helpful. And then second question here. You guys have closed some branches post acquisition. So, can you just add some color about what those markets have looked like? How has volumes trended in those markets? Were there any disruptions in that kind of thing?
Floyd Sherman: I've heard of minimal disruptions.
Chad Crow: No disruptions.
Floyd Sherman: Yeah. I know people look at us and kind of what cock their eyes when we say minimal to no disruption, but that's the truth of it. We are operating very well. Our people have come together extremely well. We did a very good job of preplanning and then the execution of our integration plans and go-to-market plans. So, from our view point, things couldn't be going better.
Chad Crow: Yeah. And it's a credit to the guys in the field and the markets where we overlap. They have really come together and are working as one unit to making sure the customers – there's no customer disruption and whatever we're doing whether it's an ERP conversion or a facility consolidation. The guys out in the field have really done a great job.
Floyd Sherman: And really worked well at supporting the customer from the best and closest location which is working out extremely well for us. And so we've been able to provide and keep up a very high level of service to our customers.
Nicholas Coppola: Okay. That's great to hear. Thanks for taking my questions.
Floyd Sherman: You bet.
Operator: We go next to Will Randow with Citigroup.
Will Randow: Hey. Good morning and congrats on the progress.
Floyd Sherman: Good morning, Will.
Chad Crow: Thanks, Will.
Will Randow: Just I guess these points have been hit on, but just a couple more point and follow ups. When you look at regional demand, what markets are you seeing I'll call it incremental strength versus weakness? And kind of implicitly what I'm asking is taxes has kind of allowed the builders or building companies in general to outperform relative to new home sales pace. How do you think that trend shakes out as we go forward and again what are kind of the strong regions versus the weak regions?
Floyd Sherman: I really can't say that we have any weak regions. All of our regions are at this point are meeting or exceeding my expectations and for what we have set for our budget this year. I guess you could say, is Houston as strong as it was last year? No, but it's far from being a disaster or a problem area. The other markets in Texas is very good, Northeast very good. The Florida market, Georgia, the Carolinas all operating well. We're having some issues in the Vulcan with the – in the Dakotas, but they're also very close to budget. So not enough below it to make me have any real heartburn. Our business in Alaska, still strong, California going very well, as is in the Northwest. So there's always going to be, and when you have 450 locations, you're always going to have some that are lagging for one reason or another, might be a little behind, but then other locations within that general geographic large market state makes up for it. And so I would say Florida and the Carolinas probably are the strongest areas in terms of building health right now, but Colorado certainly would fall in that classification as well. Our business in Colorado looks really, really good at this point. So that's the best way I can answer you. I wish I could tell you that I had problems, but I don't.
Will Randow: And just more pointedly in terms of the California locations you do have particularly in SoCal. There's been some concern about Builders' absorption rates are, if you will, same-store sales volume. You haven't been seeing any sort of slowness in activity in those markets. Is that what you're viewing?
Floyd Sherman: I guess maybe our people aren't reading the press or whatever. But now we're – things are going very well right now in the California markets for us.
Will Randow: Okay. And then, on the operating leverages, it's been asked a couple of different ways. But you talked about a 15% to 20% conversion to EBITDA rate for the first quarter. Excluding some of the headwinds you might get from either lumber inflation or deflation through the year and excluding synergies, how should we be thinking about modeling the operating leverage through the year? And then, obviously you provided the synergy piece and we can figure out where lumber runs.
Chad Crow: Yeah. I think excluding all that and just on the base business, you're going to be somewhere in that 12%, 14%, 15% range.
Will Randow: And just the last thing on free cash flow conversion, meaning from net income net of free cash flow conversion, what pieces – so you're thinking about outside of the standard working capital and incremental run rate. I think you had actually run the tweak down the ratio as a percentage of sales and obviously gave CapEx guidance. Anything else we should be thinking about in terms of the dropdown of free cash flow?
Chad Crow: Probably just $3 million to $5 million or so of taxes. And then, make sure you got the one-time cost in there of about $30 million.
Will Randow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you and congrats again.
Floyd Sherman: You bet. Thanks.
Operator: We'll take one additional question from Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee.
Jay McCanless: Hey. Good morning, everyone. The first question I had, on that 6% to 7% sales growth target that you gave for 1Q 2016. Could you tell me, one, which number you comp it against in the prior year? And also, does that 6% to 7% include the effect of lumber deflation?
Chad Crow: If you look at the presentation deck, we're [indiscernible] on the $1.284 billion...
Jay McCanless: Okay.
Chad Crow: ...Q1 2015 sales. And yes, that includes the expected impact of deflation.
Jay McCanless: Okay. You guys include it. Okay. Second question I had, on stock comp, what should we model for the year?
Chad Crow: That's a good question. I have to get back to you on that. It's still a work in process for Q1.
Jay McCanless: Okay. And then, the last question I had and I apologize if I missed it, did you guys give a target for 1Q 2016 what we should expect for the SG&A ratio?
Chad Crow: No. But I think we probably gave you enough to back into it.
Jay McCanless: Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
Chad Crow: Okay. Thanks, Jay.
Operator: And due to time constraints, that was our last question. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Sherman for any additional or closing comments.
Floyd Sherman: Okay. We appreciate everyone joining the call today. And we look forward to updating you on the progress of the integration and of our business initiatives in the months ahead. If you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to give Chad Crow or Jen Pasquino a call. And thanks for joining us today.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you again for your participation.

Please refer to our most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other reports filed with the SEC for more information on those risks. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. The acquisition of ProBuild closed on July 31, 2015, the closing date. As a result, ProBuild's financial results are only included in the combined company's financial statements from the closing date forward and are not reflected in the combined company's historic financial statements. Therefore, we have provided supplemental financial information of the combined company in this press release that is pro forma or adjusted to include ProBuild's financial results for the relevant periods prior to the closing date. The company will discuss these pro forma and adjusted results on this call. We've provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents in our earnings press release and detailed explanations of non-GAAP financial measures in our Form 8-K filed yesterday, both of which are available on our website. At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Floyd Sherman.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Thank you, and good morning. We welcome you to our third quarter 2015 earnings call. Before I give a brief recap of the current quarter, I'd like to discuss the acquisition of ProBuild and provide an update on the integration and progress against the cost savings initiatives, then I'll give a brief recap of the current quarter and turn the call over to Chad who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions. Let's begin our discussion on slide five with an overview of the key benefits of the ProBuild combination. On July 31, 2015, we completed the acquisition of ProBuild, one of the largest distributors of building materials to professional builders, contractors, and project-oriented consumers in the United States. Through the – its lumber yards, component facilities, millwork, gypsum yards and retail stores across 40 states, ProBuild generated approximately $4.5 billion in sales in 2014. The combination of Builders FirstSource and ProBuild creates a clear industry leader, with expanded growth and margin opportunities, enabling a broader more efficient platform of manufacturing and distribution capabilities going forward. We believe the benefits of the acquisition include increased scale and diversification; a market presence in 74 MSAs of the top 100 MSAs, and 24 MSAs of the top 25 MSAs; opportunity to expand sales of higher margin products and services; a $100 million to $120 million of targeted run rate cost savings before one-time expenses; and certainly favorable timing given the projected housing market recovery and long-term growth potential. Now that we're a few months past the acquisition close, I'm eager to share with you an update on the ProBuild integration efforts. We're making great strides in combining our organization into one company. All aspects of the integration including system conversions and facility consolidations are in full swing and progressing as we had planned. Management and operating teams are in place and are driving our joint business goals. All six ProBuild Senior Vice Presidents of Operations joined Builders FirstSource management to run six of our nine large regions, bringing 33 years of average industry experience to the combined company. Additionally, three legacy Builders FirstSource Senior Vice President of Operations, bring an average of 36 years of industry experience to the role. We're having a very strong focus on customer service to sustain and grow local market relationships. So far, employee and customer attrition has been minimal. Moving to slide 6; the combination of Builders FirstSource and ProBuild is expected to generate approximately $100 million to $120 million in annual run rate cost savings synergies in the first two years following the close. Synergies are expected to be captured through network optimization, procurement and G&A cost, with a breakout of about 20%, 30% and 50% targeted for each area respectively. Within two months of the acquisition, we've already implemented changes that are expected to yield over $30 million of annualized cost savings. These initiatives were designed to generate go-forward savings, which we expect to start benefiting our fourth quarter 2015 financial results. We believe that we're on pace to achieve additional annual run rate cost savings of approximately $50 million within one calendar year of the deal close, bringing the anticipated run rate saving to $80 million by August 2016. As part of the integration progress, we expect to incur $80 million to $90 million in one-time costs to achieve these synergies. We believe approximately two-thirds of the one-time costs will be incurred in the first year following the acquisition and the remainder incurred in the second year. Our integration efforts with ProBuild are the highest priority for us in the coming months. I remain convinced that the combination of Builders FirstSource and ProBuild will create value for our shareholders and customers alike in the years to come. And, now before turning over to Chad, I'll give you a brief recap of our third quarter results. We ended the third quarter of 2015 with pro forma sales of $1.7 billion, flat as compared to last year, excluding the impact of closed locations, but grew adjusted EBITDA by 19% or $18 million. I'm pleased with the growth in profit over the prior year, despite the negative impact of commodity deflation on our current quarter sales. Average prices for framing lumber have fallen approximately 22% since the beginning of the year. As a result, our third quarter 2015 lumber and lumber sheet goods sales were down 6% versus third quarter 2014. However, our value-added sales of manufactured products, windows, doors and millwork, increased by 6% versus the third quarter of 2014. And the – I'd also like to point out that the category – the value-added sales – accounted for 37% of our Q3 sales, and this compares to the lumber and lumber sheet goods share of only 32.6%. So, very definitely, we continue to expand our offerings and our sales in the value-added category. We believe our company is well-positioned to help homebuilders mitigate the impact of well-publicized labor shortages through our manufactured and value-added products across our national footprint. Adjusting for deflation, our new residential volume sales grew 7% in the quarter, and repair and remodel grew 3% versus prior year. Lumber prices have started to rebound over the last four weeks, and we hope that the – this trend continues. We've also seen 16 straight weeks of improving 7/16 OSB prices and we also hope that this trend continues. I'll now turn the call over to Chad, who'll review our financial results in more detail.
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning, everyone. As a reminder, we have reflected pro forma adjusted figures to include ProBuild financial results prior to the closing date. Turning to slide eight; for the quarter, we've reported pro forma sales of $1.7 billion, which were flat compared to the third quarter of 2014. Sales volume grew approximately 7% in the homebuilding end market and 3% in the repair/remodel end market, which was offset 6.1% by the negative impact of commodity price deflation on our sales and 0.1% from closed locations. Breaking down our pro forma sales by key product categories excluding the impact of closed locations, manufactured products were $284.6 million, up 5% from $270.9 million in the third quarter 2014. Windows, doors, and millwork were $342.7 million, up 6%; lumber and lumber sheet goods were $554.4 million, down $34.3 million or 5.8% from approximately $558.7 million in 2014. From a product mix standpoint, our value-add product categories made up a higher percentage of overall pro forma sales. As our prefabricated components, windows, doors and millwork categories accounted for 37% of adjusted sales in the current quarter compared to 35% last year. Our lumber and lumber sheet goods declined as a percentage of sales from 35% in the third quarter of 2014 to 33% this year. Our other building products and services categories were relatively flat compared to last year. Our pro forma gross margin percentage was 25.9%, up approximately 160 basis points from 24.3% last year. Our gross margin percentage increased largely due to improved customer pricing, commodity price deflation, and a higher mix of value-added sales. Pro forma interest expense was $43.2 million, excluding certain one-time financing costs and normalizing for the incremental debt issued to finance the ProBuild acquisition. Pro forma income tax expense in the third quarter of 2015 was $1.2 million, compared to $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2015 was $34.7 million or $0.31 per diluted share compared to $15.9 million or $0.14 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2015 was $113.6 million or 6.7% of sales, compared to $95.9 million or 5.6% of sales in 2014. This represents 18.5% growth on a year-over-year basis. We've provided an adjusted EBITDA reconciliation on page 10 of the presentation. Turning to slide nine, total liquidity at September 30, 2015 was $686 million, consisting of net borrowing availability under the 2015 revolving credit facility and cash on hand. We had $135 million in outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of September 30. In the third quarter, we paid down approximately $160 million on the 2015 credit facility subsequent to the acquisition close. Given the cyclical cash flow of our business, we do not plan on – to begin paying down our fixed or term debt before mid-2016. As I've stated earlier pro forma net interest expense was $43 million excluding certain one-time financing costs and normalized for the incremental debt issued to finance the ProBuild acquisition. Interest expense, as reflected in our GAAP financials in the quarter, included several non-recurring items. We have provided an interest reconciliation to provide a normalized or ongoing view of interest expense. I'll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Thank you, Chad. We continue to believe the long-term outlook for the housing industry remains positive. Our focus will be to leverage our national scale and sales capability to grow faster than the market, while maintaining a focus on improving overall profitability. By leveraging our sales expertise and national manufacturing capabilities, we believe our company is well-positioned to help homebuilders mitigate the impact of well-publicized labor shortages. Specifically, our value-added products provide alternatives to on job site construction and associated labor delays. I remain convinced that the combination of Builders FirstSource and ProBuild will create significant value for our shareholders and customers alike in the years to come. We're fortunate to now have the industry's largest professionally trained sales force, the greatest depth and breadth of products in the industry, and state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities. These strengths, our scale and the potential leverage provided by the synergy savings combines to make Builders FirstSource that is a greater than the sum of the parts. This combination represents important opportunities to enhance our growth potential. And, we expect to be further assisted by the continued recovery in the housing market along with the strengthening of lumber and lumber sheet goods pricing. I've never been more excited about the future prospects for our company, as well as our industry. In my travels over the last few months, I've had the pleasure to meet with so many of the great associates from ProBuild. I'm impressed with the exceptional pool of talent we have across our combined organization and I'm confident that we will together form the strongest team in the industry. I must thank all of our employees not only for all their hard work and dedication in making the integration a success, but for continuing to produce the solid financial performance that they have in spite of the many headwinds and distractions they've had to deal with. And now, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We'll take our first question from Rob Hansen with Deutsche Bank.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. So the first question I would ask about was just the prefabricated business. With a lot of the builders talking about delays and labor shortages and whatnot, what are your sales people telling you in terms of builders making enquiries to you and possibly increasing that business?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah, we are continuing to see an increasing demand for our products. Certainly, the builders are much more receptive to the use of the manufactured components in the construction cycle. This goes for both single-family, multi-family, light commercial, and the – so, we're seeing a continued increase in interest as well as use of our products.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And I think, this – in this business, right, you're somewhere around 60% capacity. Can you just kind of talk about where you have a – you are a little bit lower on that capacity utilization, where you are higher; does the demand for the pre-fab business kind of match on a market basis?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: You know, Rob, I would say the traditional markets that would use pre-fab more consistently would be kind of the Mid-Atlantic area, it's not a product that has over the years at least historically had a lot traction in Texas, but we are starting to see that pick-up. So I would say right now our plants at max – or not maximum, but at the most capacity utilization would be more in the Mid-Atlantic region, and then maybe some of the lesser utilization would be West of the Mississippi, right now.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And you folks aren't seeing any shortage of labor on year-end, is that correct?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: The struggle for us has been drivers, which has eased up a little bit. I would say the biggest issue for us right now is still truss designers. That's where we see the biggest labor shortage right now.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then one last quick one was just on the – just more of a housekeeping question on the – what's your LTM pro forma debt? I'm sorry, EBITDA, on an adjusted basis?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Let me get back with you on that. I don't have the LTMs in front of me.
Rob G. Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Okay. Next we'll go to Matt McCall with BB&T Capital Markets.
Matthew Scott McCall - BB&T Capital Markets: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Good morning.
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Matthew Scott McCall - BB&T Capital Markets: Maybe follow-up on the last one. When we think about the shift that you've seen toward more value-add, away from lumber, and you think about the inclusion of ProBuild, maybe some continued mix shifts in – at Builders. Can you talk about how we should think about that number as we head into 2016, what that mix should look like as we exit maybe next year?
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: I think, we'll continue to see strengthening in the truss and panel components. I would say by the end of next year, just kind of rough guess, we might be up as a percentage of total sales another 2%, something like that.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. I think, long-term, we certainly are looking to get that percentage over 40%. A lot of the percentage, if you look at it, is going to be how strong a recovery are we going to see in commodity pricing and what that does then to the mix, on a mix percentage, but certainly on a anticipated commodity basis, I would hope we're up closer to the 40% by the end of next year; 38% to 39%, I think, would be a number that we ought to be able to achieve.
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Of total value add.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah.
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Not just truss and panel.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah.
Matthew Scott McCall - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: No work there. (21:16)
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah.
Matthew Scott McCall - BB&T Capital Markets: And, maybe tying that into the gross margin improvement. You have that 160 basis points. You – I think, you broke out some of the benefits; I wrote down pricing deflation, and I missed the last one or last couple, but can you talk about what drove – maybe breakdown that 160 basis points – what drove the gross margin improvement, how much mix moving toward value-add helped. Just some of the components there and then anything that we should keep in mind as we're modeling the future?
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: I would say, of the 160 improvement, you're probably looking about 65 basis points of that was due to commodity price deflation, because we do get a tailwind from that. And then I would say – that leaves us 95 basis points. I would probably say, yes, two-thirds of that is more mix-generated.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Mix. You're right.
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: And then you'll have a little bit of volume in there.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: And then also the rest that we have seen, a conservative effort on the part of the sales force to improve their pricing...
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Right, in pricing.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: And as the market has expanded, we also have the ability to get better pricing. So, I think those are the – combination of those factors.
Matthew Scott McCall - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. Okay. And then the last one I have – seeing a bit of a divergence between the growth of starts and the growth of completions and a lot of that obviously could be tied to the labor issues that were discussed in the last questions. But are we to the point now where this has become enough of a trend that maybe we should start to look at the combination of these two or the average starts growth in – with the average completions growth to get an idea of what your growth rate is going to look like, because I think your growth rate was 7%, that would be about an average of what we saw from a growth rate, from a starts perspective and completions kind of together. Is that making any sense? Is that the way you're starting to look at it or is it still starts that you're focused on?
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: I think that the delay in construction is certainly impacting the cycle time. And so, I think, what you said – what you just said makes sense, because there is definitely an extended time now from a permit to a start to a completion.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. And I think you've also got to look – continue to look at units under construction. So, that units under construction is really where the building process, where most of our products are starting to go on to the – to the job site. And then that flows through to a completion and a sale.
Matthew Scott McCall - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. All right. Thank you guys.
Operator: Now, we'll go to Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to follow-up on the last line of questioning. I mean, obviously if we look at some of the homebuilder results, it's – these delays are really extending to the point, where a lot of volume is getting pushed out into at least early next year and it sounds like, the builders are kind of planning for this to continue through most of next year. So, in that context, I guess, could you give us any color around current trends or fourth quarter expectations for growth rates? Should we be looking for anything different than what you've just seen, I guess, from a volume standpoint, obviously some differences in commodity lumber pricing. But any color you can give on more near term?
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: I think, you'll see volume growth fairly similar to what we saw this last quarter, but unfortunately, I think, with the deflation we're facing, that's going to wipe out a lot of the volume growth we get from a top line basis. So, I would say, it's probably going to be more the same.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. And then just, it's – since so many puts and takes around the margin and mix, and the commodity deflation, I guess, same question I know was asked, but, just any more granularity or color around just in terms of the near-term? What's realistic to think about in terms of just like the go forward margins, because there's obviously then also seasonality involved right now?
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Right. From a gross margin standpoint, we – the commodity deflation that we have seen this year, as you know, provides a little bit of a margin tailwind although long-term we would certainly like higher lumber prices, and it's much better for business, and then EBITDA growth. So, I would say, if we continue to see flattening and improving commodity lumber prices, I would say from a gross margin standpoint, we're probably looking at something 50 basis points or so lower than the quarter we just had.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. I think, low 25s.
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay.
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: But again – I'll take the short-term margin compression to get strengthening commodity lumber prices any day.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Right. Right. And then final one from me, just housekeeping. Any change to run rates on items like D&A and also, I know, you provide the snapshot saying pro forma, interest expense would be $174 million for the year. Is that kind of how we should think about that for next year or two years, since there's no real debt pay down until the second half?
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I think that's pretty close from an interest standpoint. Go forward D&A on a quarterly basis, you are looking at about $25 million of depreciation and probably $8 million or so of amortization. That looks like where the amortization and depreciation is going to shakeout after we do our step-up in our acquisition accounting.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Just real quick to follow-up on Rob's initial question, I'm running about $305 million of the adjusted LTM EBITDA right now. So, we can go to the next question now.
Operator: Okay. We'll take the next question from Will Randow with Citi.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: You bet.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): In terms of your Texas exposure, can you talk about your experience there in terms of demand in light of obviously strength in DFW seems like Austin is soft, and are more soft, and then the latest Houston permits being down 40% for August and September?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: So, what was your question for – just as far as Texas in general?
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. What are you experiencing there in the market? I mean, are the...?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. Dallas-Fort Worth is still very strong. You are correct. In Houston, seeing some slowdown there. I think, through September in Houston, we're showing single family permits down around 3%. The biggest slowdown so far in Houston has been on the multifamily side, but obviously overall on a relative basis, Houston is still very strong for us. Maybe some softening in Austin and San Antonio, but from what I'm seeing all-in-all Texas is still a very strong market for us.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And what was your total exposure to Texas, I forgot?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: About 17% of our sales.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And, then just one follow-up in terms of synergies, can you talk about the progress you've experienced there since July particularly with regards to procurement savings?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Well, at the end of the third quarter, we were on about a $30 million run rate. I think, by year end, we'll be close to $50 million. Best guess now of that $50 million, it would be about $15 million of procurement.
Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks for that. And, congrats on the quarter.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Thanks.
Operator: We'll next go to Kenneth Williamson with JPMorgan.
Kenneth L. Williamson - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had – just wanted to get a little bit more detail on what exactly you're seeing in the way of commodity deflations, is this only affecting your lumber side of the business or are there other products that are being affected by deflation?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Primarily, with the lumber and lumber sheet goods, we have seen a little bit of back-off in pricing on roofing as well as gypsum, but it's been very small, the rest of our products, we have seen some inflation. The – so, but the real effects of deflation are all centered around the lumber and lumber sheet.
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. When you go through an extended period of lower prices it will start to impact your components as well.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah.
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Since, you obviously use those same products in your trusses and panels.
Kenneth L. Williamson - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Got you. Okay. So, what do you view as the biggest driver for that or what do you view needs to change for prices to start to move the other way?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: I think, it's strictly a matter of the manufacturers of – especially now in the lumber category to get their output close or match to what the demands of the marketplace is. I think, one of the things certainly that has affected our pricing here has been the fall off of the China market and that has caused the Canadian mills to push a lot more material down into the U.S. market and that has really contributed to some of the problems that we've had. The U.S. mills have done a better job from what we can see in trying to get their production matched up with the demand for housing, I think, a lot of people got way ahead of themselves. I think, some of the forecast for housing led to the mills adding additional shifts and adding people. And they were reluctant to, I think, back away from and absorb those costs that they had for starting up the increased production. OSB manufacturers have certainly done a much better job of getting their output in line with the demands of the market, and I think, we've seen 16 straight weeks of improving OSB pricing. That's very encouraging to us, and it looks like – we're all hopeful that we at least hold it and not start back, that we still have a long ways to go to get up to traditional levels of pricing. But I think that will come as the demand in housing continues to increase and the mills become – get better at matching up their output to the demands of the market, and a return of – and certainly a return of the China market will help pull away some of the excess capacity.
Kenneth L. Williamson - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Thanks. That's very helpful. I guess just someone who's fairly new to following your business, just – when you look at the supply – you mentioned key suppliers in particular pushing some of that supply down into the U.S., they would have normally gone to Canada. What percentage typically from those Canadian suppliers is exported to China?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: The – you really probably should get that number from the Canadian sources, but from what we have been able to see, somewhere close to 30% of the Canadian lumber output was going into the China market. And what made it really a lot more difficult is that a lot of that material is lower grade material. And when that got cut off, they really pushed the number three grade into the U.S., because they had to have a place to go with it, and it really drove the pricing on number three to extremely low levels; half of what it was a year ago. And that was a real major contributing factor to the fall in lumber prices.
Kenneth L. Williamson - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful.
Operator: Okay. Now, we'll go to Nick Coppola with Thompson Research Group.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Hi, Nick.
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Nick.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: So, any further read you can provide on expectations for revenue synergies? So maybe, I think you talked about initiatives to get more value-add sales through the ProBuild footprint and maybe any success in getting them into new customers?
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Nick, that's just such a soft number and you'd have to make a lot of assumptions in coming up with some calculations. As we've talked about before, we obviously do feel like there are revenue synergies, but to try to put a number on that, I just wouldn't be comfortable.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Is there anything quantitative, like to point to progress there.
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: We continue to look at ramping up their sales efforts on the truss and panel side, and looking at expanding some of the other product categories, for instance gypsum and roofing into the BFS side, but we're still so fresh into the acquisition that so far – thus far it's just been more discussions with the sales force and getting them up to speed on some of the newer products that they may be required to sell, but I would say so far that any progress has been minimal.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. I think, all of our focus really has been on retaining our sales force, retaining the customers. That's a – that was a very, very important part of the – of your first six months or so, and that's got to be stabilized and you want to make sure that your sales force is – has been retained, and that we haven't lost any bleed-off of customers to competitors. And after – once you're through that initial phase then you'll begin looking at how do you increase the sale of the value-added products throughout the organization. The – that is a longer-term proposition, but one in which we've been very successful in the past in Builders FirstSource, as has ProBuild. We've had a higher concentration of it in our mix, because there a lot more emphasis was placed on it and we'll do the same and that's going to be the direction as we go forward.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then, also wanted to ask just about regional highlights in the quarter. You talked about Texas a bit, but any other areas of strength or weakness in volumes across your business, especially now with your larger footprint?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah, there's certainly – North Carolina and Florida continue to be very positive to our business. We've seen, from ProBuild, the California market is certainly showing some good strength this year. The Northwest, Alaska, again, we've seen improvement and good sales gains in those areas. So, I think it's coming from a combination of factors. Certainly the largest states that we do business with, as Chad has said, was Texas and the Carolinas, Florida; they certainly are the largest states.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: You bet.
Operator: Now, we'll go to Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Good morning, Trey.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: I guess, my first question is on – probably for Chad. On SG&A, how should we be thinking about that with the combined company now, with any seasonality into the fourth quarter? How should we think about SG&A I guess for fourth quarter and then as we look into next year as a percent of sales, any changes you'd expect there?
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Well, the business will be more seasonal now, obviously, with a greater presence in the northern regions. So, it will drag our results in Q4 and Q1 a little more than historically it would have at Builders. But, we do have a lot of the cost saves that we're going to be putting in as well. So, all-in-all, I think we're still going to be able to do a very nice job of mitigating a lot of the seasonality with some of the cost saving initiatives that we're going to put in place.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: But as far as SG&A specifically, I understand that there's puts and takes right now with lumber deflation and that's kind of a headwind as far as leveraging that SG&A. What is – should we see a sequential change though? I think, this quarter it was at 22% or 23% of sales somewhere at ballpark. Should we be thinking about it differently in 4Q or no?
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: I would say due to the seasonality, it will probably increase as a percent of sales, but with some of that being offset by the cost saving initiatives that we've put in place.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: (40:05) that's got a lot of one-time cost flowing through that – in that number.
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I'm talking on a excluding one-time cost, integration cost basis.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Right, right. Okay, got you.
Jennifer Pasquino - SVP Investor Relations, Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Do you remember that – Trey, just remember that Builder – ProBuild had a much larger presence in Alaska, in the Midwest and the Northeast where there is less building activities. So, your fixed cost do drive your percentage of SG&A up a little bit more in the first quarter and fourth quarter than what you would have historically seen in Builders.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: I understood.
Jennifer Pasquino - SVP Investor Relations, Builders FirstSource, Inc.: Yeah.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: And, that shift from – I guess from the third quarter to fourth quarter, it is going to be more seasonal, but it is there when you're looking at that is there other things that are contributing that could help offset some of that seasonality like the prefabricated components piece or anything else that would be a positive as we look into the 4Q, a positive contributor?
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. The cost saves as they begin to take more effect will be positive, and then hopefully we'll continue to see strengthening in lumber prices, which obviously helps us lever our SG&A even better.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: And I think we're going to continue to expand the value-add products. They are certainly the higher margin products for us.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And thanks for that. And then on the better pricing that you noted, can you just kind of give us a sense of what's going on in the competitive environment? Are you seeing some improvement there that's allowing for better pricing?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: I think really overall, Trey, I think, it's – the environment is similar to what we experienced back in the second quarter. Certainly, as the starts improve and there's more work available, it does ease somewhat and the builders become more concerned as to getting their – the products that they need and services on-time and complete. I would say, there's been a slight improvement in the competitiveness. It's – we're not seeing nearly some of the way off the reservation pricing that we had been going through, that seems to have abated. I think that's a positive. So yeah, it's certainly better than what it was last year, and I think that is going to continue to improve, and that certainly has helped us in our ability to increase margins. And I think at the same time, I think our people probably feel that a little bit more aggressive when they're going into pricing that, they're not going to be just totally shot out of the saddle. So, I would say overall, yeah, it's the environment has continued to improve. Chad, you might?
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: No, that's consistent. I would agree with that.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: That's good. That's encouraging. And then, outside of lumber, windows, doors, gypsum, roofing, all the other exciting, the other things that you have now, where you've got, I think, a little more exposure to these other things, now with ProBuild. What are your expectations for pricing outside of lumber going into next year as far as you know from your suppliers there? Any indication of kind of what to be expecting there as we look into 2016?
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Yeah. Our suppliers, I think, everyone is looking to have some increase in their price of the manufactures of products. I think we have shown and we have seen some of that certainly this year, and we've been able to pass those increases on, where in the past that wasn't the case, when vendors were increasing prices. But at the same time, we are really – we've already started working very closely with all of our suppliers and certainly the major suppliers, and showing them the attractiveness of our package and giving people the opportunities to look at increasing their involvement with the company, and hopefully we're going to see some benefits that spin out of that, at least that's what we're anticipating. So, all-in-all, I think we're going to see – we're going to see higher prices from the vendors. I think we're going to be able to pass it on. And but I – and I think we're going to be able to negotiate for ourselves some improved programs and so forth that will enable us to really help in the sale of those products. There's a lot of things that vendors can do to help you improve your share of the market and be more aggressive in the marketplace. So...
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: All right, makes sense. Thanks for that, Floyd. And then my last one is, Chad, I think historically, you've given us kind of what the sensitivity is to lumber on a 10% change. I think you gave it to us on a standalone basis. I don't have the, or haven't heard the new sensitivity to lumber. So, a 10% change equals X dollars of change in EBITDA for the combined company. Do you have that or could you share that with us?
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, if you had a 10% change and everything else being equal and that 10% change being in effect for an extended period of time. You'd probably be looking on a combined company basis about a $35 million impact to EBITDA.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's all I needed. Thanks a lot, guys. Have a – good luck with the rest of the quarter and have a good weekend.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Okay, you too.
Operator: Now, we'll go to Jay McCanless with Sterne, Agee. Mr. McCanless, your line is open.
Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee: Hi. My questions have been answered. Thank you.
Operator: Okay. We'll next go to Fritz Leo with Raj Global (47:12).
Unknown Speaker: Hi, guys. Good morning. Just a quick question. Can you give me any idea what your cash taxes are going to be like over the next quarter and into 2016?
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Cash taxes will be close to zero. We're sitting on a fairly large NOL right now, and so in any given quarter, you may have $1 million or $2 million in cash taxes, it's going to be small.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. And you had mentioned this on the road show, but can you remind me kind of where your target leverage is kind of – I know you're obviously in delivering mode at the moment, but long-term what's your target leverage?
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I would say 3 times, 3.5 times.
Unknown Speaker: And that's net or gross?
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Net.
Unknown Speaker: Net, okay. Thank you very much. That's all. Thank you.
M. Chad Crow - President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. So, I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Floyd F. Sherman - Chief Executive Officer and Director: Okay. We – I certainly appreciate everyone joining the call today. We look forward to updating you on the progress of the integration and our business initiatives in the months ahead. And if you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to give Chad or Jen Pasquino a call. And again, thanks and have a good day.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.

Floyd Sherman: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me from our management team is Chad Crow, President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer as well as Marcie Hyder, our Vice President and Controller. After I give a brief recap of the current quarter, I’ll turn the call over to Chad who will discuss our financial results in more detail. And after my closing comments regarding our outlook, we’ll take your questions. Builders FirstSource made good strides in the second quarter 2015. The Company was able to grow top-line results despite the negative year-over-year impact from commodity price deflation and the abnormally wet weather conditions we experienced in many of our markets. We increased our gross profit margins to levels that we haven't seen since the third quarter of 2007. Thanks, to great execution by our people in the field and a higher percentage of sales coming from our value-added segments. We also exceeded our stated goal of 15% adjusted EBITDA flow-through on incremental sales by delivering flow-through of 21% in the quarter, resulting in our highest adjusted EBITDA since the third quarter of 2006. When single-family starts were more than two times what they are today. The results reinforced our belief that we are continuing the benefit from a strengthening of the housing market and that Builders FirstSource is well-positioned to take advantages of improving condition. With that I'll now turn the call over to Chad who'll review our financial results in more detail.
Chad Crow: Thank you Floyd, good morning everyone. For the current quarter we reported sales of 461.5 million compared to 426.5 million for the second quarter of 2014, an increase of 35 million or 8.2%, which includes a 2.4% negative impact of commodity price deflation. We estimate sales volume increased approximately 10.6% of which 4.3% related to recent acquisitions and 6.3% related to volume growth at legacy locations. Breaking down our sales by product category, prefabricated components were 102.6 million, up 12.8% from 91 million in the second quarter of 2014. Windows & doors were 100.6 million, up 10.7%. Lumber and lumber sheet goods were 140.3 million down 3.6 million from approximately 143.9 million in 2014. Our millwork category was 48.6 million, up 21.4% and other building products and services were 69.4 million, up 14.3% from last year. From a product mix standpoint our value-added product categories continue to make up a higher percentage of our overall sales as our prefabricated components windows & doors and millwork categories accounted for 54.6% of overall sales in the current quarter compared to 52% last year. Our lumber and lumber sheet goods declined as a percentage of sales, while other building products and services category was 80 basis points higher. Our gross margin percentage was 24% in the current quarter, up 200 basis points from 22% last year. Our gross margin percentage increased largely due to improved customer pricing and a higher mix of value-added sales. For the current quarter our SG&A expense increased 18.1 million. Of the 18.1 million increase in SG&A 6.4 million related to expenses associated with the recently announced ProBuild acquisition, 1.5 million related to an increase in depreciation and amortization and 700,000 related to an increase in stock comp expense. As a percentage of sales SG&A expense increased to 20.5% compared to 17.9% for the second quarter of 2014. Of this 260 basis point increase, 140 basis points related to acquisition expenses and approximately 50 basis points related to increases in stock comp expense and depreciation and amortization. Excluding these expenses our SG&A expense expressed as a percentage of sales was 18.6% in the current quarter compared to 17.9% last year. This remaining increase was further affected by a negative impact of commodity price inflation on our sales. Interest expense was $12.6 million for the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 6.1 million from last year. The increase was primarily related to a 5.9 million increase in the non-cash, fair value adjustment related to stock warrants, issued in connection with our 2011 financing. During the second quarter of 2015 all of the remaining stock warrants were exercised and there were none outstanding as of June 30, 2015. We recorded $200,000 income tax benefit compared to 200,000 of income tax expense in the second quarter of 2014. We recorded a reduction of the after-tax, non-cash valuation allowance of our net deferred tax assets of 1.3 million and 4.1 million in the second quarters of '15 and '14 respectively. As of June 30 our federal gross income tax NOL available for carry-forward was approximately 257 million. Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of ’15 was 3.6 million or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to 10.6 million or $0.09 per diluted share last year. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the second quarter of ’15 was 14.3 million or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to 9.4 million or $0.09 per diluted share last year. Adjusted EBITDA was 27.6 million or 6% of sales, compared to 20.4 million or 4.8% of sales in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA flow through on our incremental sales for the current quarter was approximately 21%. Operating cash flow was 7.7 million in the second quarter compared to negative 13.1 million in the second quarter of last year the difference is largely due to a higher working capital build in the second quarter of 2014. Capital expenditures were 5.2 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to 6.8 million last year. Total liquidity at June 30 was 143.8 million, including 40.2 million of cash and 103.6 million in borrowing availability under our revolver. We had 55 million in outstanding borrowings and 16.4 million in outstanding letters of credit under our revolver as of June 30, 2015. I’ll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd Sherman: In summary I think I am very pleased with the results this quarter. Where we were able to grow top-line results in spite of the negative impact from a commodity deflation and wet weather conditions and reached the level of profitability that we haven't seen in years. The future of our company looked very bright indeed and given the trends that we see in the business today and our positioning within our markets and recent improvements in the fundamental drivers of our business such as job growth, consumer confidence suggests that new home construction activity should continue to improve. With the acquisition of ProBuild scheduled to close in early August, Builders FirstSource stands ready to benefit from this increase in construction activity as the nation’s largest build and supply company. And lastly I’d like to express my gratitude to the hard work in men and women of this company. Preparing for the eventual integration of ProBuild while maintaining a focus on the day-to-day responsibilities is no easy task, but based on our results this quarter it’s clear that our people were up for the challenge. I am very appreciative of your efforts. And I’ll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms: First off could you guys talk a little bit about what you’re seeing and what you mentioned the trends are positive but could you go into a little bit of more color about kind of the demand trends you’re seeing since the weather has started cooperating through the end of June and into the third quarter in your different markets?
Floyd Sherman: Yes Trey, we are definitely seeing an accelerated pace as builders are making up for the time that was lost due to the weather and waiting for jobs like conditions to dry out so that they could get the homes construction process started. Definitely seeing that but we’re also seeing what I think is very encouraging is definitely an upbeat feeling among our customer base. They’re looking for the second quarter I mean the second half to be a lot stronger than the first half and it’s not just weather related they are gaining and they are seeing good attendance some of their model home programs I think the interest is definitely out there, the lot of optimism that we haven’t I haven’t personally seen or felt imply some time, so I think there is a positive feeling about where housing is going. I am not saying anyone expects a hockey stick recovery but I think it’s still a glitch solid 5% to 7%-8% increase on an ongoing basis and so I think that’s very healthy. The other issue that we definitely continue to face out on the job side really plays into our strengths is the labor shortage. Labor shortage problems are still very -- are extreme and I think that is definitely helping move and the reason for the nice increase is that we have seen in our component products when you look at where our business is coming from the fixed advertising components those sales were up almost 13%, the windows and doors up almost 11%, mill work up over 21% and the other products installed up 14% the only negative was in the lumber and lumber sheet good category and lot of that is due to price deflation which we continue to face and that was down about 2.5% over the second quarter of last year. So the trends of our business are very-very good obviously the healthy trend is being accelerated by the labor conditions and the tight labor conditions and the builders are definitely looking for ways to reduce the labor content at the job site. And we’re in a very good position to serve it. We’re seeing very strong our backlogs are continuing. I think I have mentioned on previous call about how in our trust operations we were seeing record backlogs. Well that’s continuing. And so that means we got a lot of new business coming in and as well as stepping up the deliveries for on an outgoing basis. So, I feel really good about what’s happening in our building margins. And this seems to be what we are hearing the same type of story from the ProBuild people as -- and I think that’s reflected in their business as well.
Trey Grooms: And I know you guys have a lot of boots on the ground in Texas specifically given the pullback in the energy markets and things like that, can you talk about what you’re seeing specifically in Texas now because I am understanding it was a very cold quarter from a weather standpoint in the June quarter. But are you seeing any slowdown across Texas anywhere or is it -- can you just comment on that please?
Floyd Sherman: No, in the beginning in the first quarter Houston was the most impacted market that we had because of oil and gas issues definitely the Houston market where they lost 12% to 14% by the end of the second quarter the Houston building market is gotten themselves almost even with last year, all of our customers are telling us and we see this especially through the window operation where the builders are very-very sensitive to making sure where they're going to have their needs covered or by when does it get those openings closed. They really would indicate based on what we're seeing is that by the end of the year they're looking to have their overall market up 3% to 5%, so it is good recovery it is taking place in the Houston market. As you said the water and rain in fact those estimated that with all the rains that we had the entire State of Texas was left would have been under 7 inches of water. So record rainfall really affected us, but towards the end of June as the things started drying out, to get on the job site, and boy the work pace really accelerating. The Saint Antonio market, Austin market, DSW market very-very solid, really hot markets, we're not in West Texas so we have a very little exposure I think the Midland Odessa love it, Amarillo areas have been more impacted by the oil and gas, but I really can't -- so I can't comment on what's going on in those operations. And ProBuild also very little exposure to the West Texas markets, so you have to find that what's going on in those markets from somebody else who does operate in those areas.
Trey Grooms: And then I am going to sneak one more and then I am going to jump back in queue. Chad this must be for you obviously you guys did a great job on the margin, how should we be thinking about margins in 3Q and kind of the back half, I know you're putting up some good incremental with the moving pieces of where you guys are kind of expecting the demand level to be the product mix as well as the move that we've seen in Lumber? What do you thinking or how should we be thinking about margins as we look out into the next quarter or two?
Chad Crow: I think Q3 the margins will look very similar to what we just saw in Q2 somewhere in the gross margin somewhere in that 24% range give or take 50/50 their side. And I think from an EBITDA margin perspective it should look pretty similar as well.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Baugh with Stifel.
John Baugh: I wanted to -- you've mentioned the labor tightness and I am just curious on this whole value add mix shift which is significant has been going on for awhile, if anything seems to be accelerating and certainly helpful with margin if the labor shortage really driving that and any color Floyd on may be what inning of that gain we're in not just for Builders FirstSource but I know ProBuild has dramatically less exposure here so I am just trying to get a sense for tailwind the margin overtime if you could continue to drive this higher?
Floyd Sherman: Yes we're definitely the labor issues out at the construction site and it is being tight and is definitely helping drive the component business and other forms of value add products whether it be installed millwork and so forth. I won't say that is the only driver because we've also put a lot of focus on increasing the sale of our value add products and put a lot of emphasis our people are really responding to that, and so also our pricing discipline most of the business you walk from today is in the area of lumber pricing and commodity product pricing, and so that you've got to start driving those other parts of your business. But we while it's tough to find truck drivers and the qualified CDO license holder. More people to work in the operations it's a lot of easier to do that, we don't have the same problem it's out on the job site where you have the building skills required. So it's a labor replacement obviously for us. I think it's a good combination of the labor issues on the job site and our people’s focus on selling the more value-add products.
John Baugh: And Floyd are you -- I know it's something you are going to work on with ProBuild, is that something that just has to wait post-merger or there are things underway there to influence that currently?
Floyd Sherman: No I think they definitely have had some number of very good programs that are underway. I think the under Rob Marchbank and their management group they have been focused on many of the same things that we've been focused on, the -- we're going to -- but to the end it'll be a continuation of those programs but I think they're seeing the same benefits for the same reasons that we are.
John Baugh: And last two questions quickly, one any color on kind of how lumber deflation might influence numbers in the second half of the year. And then secondly as you look it on per minute starts then project completions in the regions that matter to you. How that number kind of looked year-over-year in the second half? Thank you.
Floyd Sherman: Yes John I really anticipated that we would begin seeing a slow but steady improvement in commodity pricing. By my count and as the way I've known it I think we potentially had affected our sales by almost little over $8 million. If you look at what that means almost 90% of that floods right to the bottom-line. So, our EBITDA would have been significantly improved and with any type of pricing similar even to what we had last year. I think the commodities, it's going to be a slow recovery, I don't look for a lot of change and in fact maybe little bit more deflation in this third quarter. I think as we go into the fourth quarter, I think hopefully we're going to start seeing some pick up. I definitely believe that -- and the mills are trying for that -- we really are seeing effected their OSP guide, there is lot of adjusting now of their output schedules. We're getting some of that with the lumber guys. I think a big issue is going to be what's the Canadian lumber guys are going to do, especially with the dollar exchange difference between our currency and theirs. Are they going to push a lot of excess material into the U.S. just to make up for that and also to cover some of the weakness in the China market? I don't know, but I know everyone on the commodity producing side is experiencing financial results that are not long-term acceptable. So they got to start changing, they just to have to get their supply more in line with the demand. I think the industry is trying and we desperately need to see inflation come into this side of the business. And it would make such a huge difference in our operating results. And I think 2016 we will begin to see, really see that trend. Don't really think we're going to get a lot of help out of it, the rest of this year.
John Baugh: And the starts, completions by region, kind of how do you see that in the second half? Thanks.
Floyd Sherman: I'm really -- in our region ProBuild right now I think we're going to see that good steady recovery and the Mid West is maybe a little bit flatter than other parts of the country but for the most parts, I think it seems to be a uniform recovery all over the country.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Matt McCall with BB&T Capital Markets.
Reuben Garner: Good morning, this is Reuben Garner in for Matt. I just wanted to -- if you could -- if we look at the combined entity of ProBuild and Builders over the last couple of years on a pro forma basis, revenue per housing starts kind of been increasing low to mid single-digits. What's your outlook for that post the closure of the deal?
Chad Crow: I think it will be similar trends. I think both, as Floyd mentioned earlier both companies in the recent quarter's really has been focused on profitable sales and not necessarily as much on market share gains but -- and I think that trend will continue, we're both certainly going to go after the more profitable business. And at times that maybe at the expense of some share gains. But I think those trends will be pretty similar to what you've just quoted.
Reuben Garner: And then just a sort of a follow-up to Mr. Baugh’s question, the Builders sort of exceeding a higher margin products. What level do you think you can get the ProBuild locations to I know it is about 55% in the business now. And it’s, I think grocery is third last I saw for ProBuild. Is it something that you can get that closer to 50%, how quickly do you think you can do that?
Floyd Sherman: I think it's not going to happen overnight definitely it is where you place your focus and your emphasis -- that we'll be starting on that -- on obviously right out of the gate. It took us five-six years to really build our business and I think we will see noticeable changes in our first year but I think it will be one of those things that takes a little bit to get going and then as you gain the momentum you’re going to move in that direction, they have got good facilities they certainly have the really good people. Everything is in place for it and I think a lot of it is where you placed the direction and the emphasis and how you structure the salesforce to sell it. So all of those things we will be working and obviously that’s one of the real keys and one of the things that we really liked about this -- the combination of our two businesses is the ability to bring in some large skill sets to match up with also their skill sets in other areas. And so I think we overtime we’re not going to get it up to right away up to 54% of the business but I think what you will see noticeable improvements.
Reuben Garner: And then my last question is now that you’re getting a little closer to closing on the deal. How confident are you in the initial synergy projections you gave? And I know you kind of gave the timing for the synergies as a whole. Is there different timing for each of the three buckets you gave and then is there a particular area no other ex procurement or the SG&A that may have more risk than the others?
Floyd Sherman: The work we continue to do and the planning that we’ve done has been extensive and I would say if anything it has increased our confidence in being able to achieve those numbers. I think the majority of them as we stated will be achievable in the first 12 months, I don’t really think our picture on that has changed from what we have previously announced. The biggest risk, there is a lot of people involved anytime you bring two companies together like that from the personnel standpoint I think that’s where the most risk is. But I feel like we have done a good job of identifying those areas and we have plans in place to address those risks. But if I had to point to one particular area that I would say would contain the most risk it’s more on the G&A side and the people management side of things.
Operator: And we’ll next to Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee CRT.
Jay McCanless: The first one I had, I wanted to pick up on what Floyd was saying with Canada. With the dollar strength, is that giving you guys the ability to maybe go in and buy -- do some larger buys in Canada and help protect some of the gross margin?
Floyd Sherman: Because again more is it part of the reason why the overall market is priced where it is I am sure it is because it’s -- they're trying to push as much as their product into this country as they can. And I think it’s still going to come down if we want to get an improvement we’ve got to start getting the demand and supply in balance. And the lumber side is a lot further from getting this done I think right now than the panel guys are.
Jay McCanless: And then the second question I had is on ProBuild and Builder post transaction. If you think about the seasonality and how we should be modeling the combined company, is there going to be a dramatic shift for how Builder and ProBuild look post deal versus the way that we model Builders FirstSource as a stand-alone company?
Floyd Sherman: I think there will be an increase in seasonality just because of their footprint versus ours to what degree I’d probably say an incremental 15% or so of seasonality would be my best guess right now.
Jay McCanless: And then in terms of, all right. So seasonality, I asked that. And then the lumber, are you seeing any curtailments? You said, Floyd, that people were changing production schedules a little bit. Are we seeing actual shutdowns in the lumber producing market yet or are people just try to put a little less product onto the market?
Floyd Sherman: No, I think what we’re seeing is shorter schedules I know with the lot number of the panel producers they’ve started reducing the number that they are beyond four, all four working reduced number of hours, 32 hour shifts and that type of thing. And I think that’s how they’re bringing it in. The lumber guys we don’t have as much visibility and we don’t hear as much what they’re doing other than some of the U.S. producers we have definitely have heard that they’ve been adjusting their production schedules. The Canadians we don’t have as much of the insight into that but I got to believe they’re starting to do the same thing. I don’t think anybody is going to walk away from any of the mills that have been opened, I think the and especially some of the new mills that were opened in 2000 and then towards the end of 2012-2013, they are such great investment that went into the start up of those operations and that's certainly contributed a lot of the excess that we're, but I don't think we're going to see any mill shutdowns. I think it will all be adjusted work schedule.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Paul Carrolls of Whitebox Advisors.
Paul Carrolls: Most of the questions actually I had were answered. Can you just step through just on the timing? What is left to get done and the timing again on the deal? What is left, if anything, to get completed before the deal does get closed?
Floyd Sherman: Well we expect to price our bonds this afternoon we still hope to close around the end of the month first week of August so between now and then we would have to go out with and raise the additional equity that should be it.
Paul Carrolls: Between now and then, get out and raise -- say that again?
Floyd Sherman: Well raise the additional equity that we've disclosed that we will be raising prior to closing the transaction.
Paul Carrolls: And has that been sized up yet?
Floyd Sherman: In our original projection it was $100 million additional new equity.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go now to Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company.
Justin Bergner: I do have a few questions some of them are just quick factual questions. On the quick factual questions, do you have the quarter-end share count, basic and diluted?
Floyd Sherman: I do not have that. Are you talking other than what's in the press release already?
Justin Bergner: Well, that has the average share count. I know you mentioned all the warrants were exercised. I'll wait for the Q, then on that. Secondly, in terms of the synergies and the timing, when you say that the majority are expected to be realized in the first 12 months post close, you are referring to kind of the run rate of the synergies 12 months post close, right? You're not referring to the total synergies in year one?
Floyd Sherman: I still think from a majority standpoint we'll be able to achieve probably more than half, but you're correct on a run rate basis that's probably going to be closer to 75% or so we'll achieve on a run rate basis. But I still think even on an actual basis we'll be able to grab a significant amount in year one.
Justin Bergner: And then in terms of the SG&A, if we pull out all the factors that you called out, I guess SG&A still increased 70 basis points year on year. Is part of that tied to just a slightly higher SG&A composition for value-added sales or how should we think about that remaining 70 basis point increase in SG&A?
Floyd Sherman: I think 40 to 50 basis points were due to commodity price deflation and the impact it had on our top-line. The only other real outlier was a little bit higher on the group health expense that was another 30 basis points or so. I don't really think the increase in prefab will have an impact on the OpEx.
Justin Bergner: So SG&A over sales shouldn't be impacted by the value-added mix materially?
Floyd Sherman: No.
Justin Bergner: And then finally, I'm not sure if you can answer this question, but in the 8-K that you put out a week ago, you offered some preliminary results for ProBuild. And the margins looked good, but I guess the sales pattern was a little weak, I guess -- down 1.5% to 3%, excluding facility closures, but some commodity price deflation there. It seems like ProBuild might be sort of undergrowing the housing start pace a bit. And I was just curious if there's anything you could offer to provide perspective around that?
Floyd Sherman: As you mentioned, they did have an impact on a year-over-year basis from the closed facility. The commodity price deflation impact for them is a little greater than it was for us, so I think by the time you factor those two in you're probably looking at somewhere around 2% sales growth for them and then combined with that as we've discussed from the builder standpoint a continued focus on really going after the more profitable business and walking away from some of the lower margin business. So when you take those three things into consideration their numbers came in about right where I'd expect them to.
Chad Crow: I think you also have look behind it. This whole question is that ProBuild, the offer is a higher cost operation than we are and the large builder segment is a segment then obviously is a larger piece of our business and it is of theirs. There are higher cost on operations has really pushed them away and not entirely it is still there but they had most of their direction now is towards the smaller builder, the custom builder, they really have done well because their cost -- their net set of operation and their cost of operation says that that's a more profitable business for them to go after than the large scale builder. And I think so a lot of what you're seeing is really the result of their concentrated efforts to improve their margins and they have been dramatically improving their margins and a lot of that is driven by -- you got to go after the type of business that fits your business model. We obviously are looking to change that and put them into a position where they can be fully competitive in the major builder area. And that is obviously one of the really strong points that we are looking to gain in this -- the combination of the business. So, but I think they've done a really good job in highlighting it and working on the areas of business that will improve their profitability and their profitability is definitely showing dramatic improvement.
Operator: And we'll take a follow-up from Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee CRT.
Jay McCanless: Just one follow-up question, on the value-add sales, could you remind us how much or what you all have given in the past in terms of how much of those sales are done on a fixed-price basis, where -- and what I'm getting to with that is if lumber prices continue to move down and you guys can hold the pricing on there, it seems like gross margin certainly could stay at current levels or level in Q2 and maybe go higher. How much of your sales are done on a fixed price basis for those value-added items?
Floyd Sherman: Probably on the prefab components, the -- on our process we've probably 40% to 50% of that business is on 60 day and 90 day pricing. The rest of it's done on 30 day pricing, so it's very similar to what you do in quoting a lumber packet. And we have to make sure that we cover our cost and which we've been able to do and either through inventory or ranges of mills or et cetera. And so, it's still is the business that you have to really stand top of and make sure that you cover whatever price theories you're calling for. Millwork and so forth because those prices tend to be much more stable the typically for us -- you're going to be looking at 90 plus days in a lot of that pricing but we don't have any -- we don't have the same issues in that area that you do with lumber.
Operator: And we'll take another follow-up question from Justin Bergner of Gabelli & Company.
Justin Bergner: Just want to perhaps delve a little bit deeper. I guess six months ago, it seemed like there was too much supply in the market, and now things have tightened up a bit in terms of your industry. I realize that labor is an issue, but it was sort of an issue to a certain extent for Builders six months ago. So what really changed over the last six months to improve the pricing environment that you are seeing?
Floyd Sherman: I think a lot of it is we said was our shift in the -- to more than a higher mix of the value-add products and anytime you can go to a builder with a more complete package as both the commodity lumber and the value added products, it's just the overall a better value to the builder. And I think gives us more leverage from our pricing standpoint now. It is still a very competitive market. And from our standpoint there's still too much supply out there chasing a relatively low level of demand still, so while things have gotten better and as they do get better, gives a little more opportunity to get a little bit better pricing. I feel like there's still a lot of upside to that I think we're going to continue to see as homebuilding continues to improve, but just kind of a steady improvement in our gross margins.
Justin Bergner: I'm inferring from your comment, then, that part of the pricing improvement is sort of an industry phenomenon and part of it is sort of a Builders FirstSource-specific phenomenon? Is that -- how else do you think…?
Floyd Sherman: That's a fair statement, certainly the -- as I said the higher mix of our value-add products you are becoming more desirable supplier to the customer which should give you a little bit better opportunity for pricing.
Operator: And we will go next to Phillip Pennell with Mariner Investment Group.
Phillip Pennell: You mentioned that the footprint obviously doesn't exactly overlap, which is a good thing, because it gives you some…
Floyd Sherman: We can’t hear. Can you get a better connection?
Phillip Pennell: Yes can you hear me now?
Floyd Sherman: Yes.
Phillip Pennell: You guys had mentioned that the footprints really don't overlap much on obviously the ProBuild versus Builders First. And that gives you white space to move into. I guess I'm curious if you're trying to the ProBuild guys don't have the prefab kind of value-added products, so who has been supplying those products in the areas in which they operate? I guess my point is how do you then move into those areas and take that business from somebody else without, say, having to negatively impact margins on a competition for sales?
Floyd Sherman: Well obviously they have for us the panel operations and they’re involved in those products it’s not as large a percentage of their overall mix as it is with us. There are many trust operations out there and we have the same thing as we think this is the way it’s a lot of it is, is the quality of your service, the dependability of your service, the aggressiveness of your salesforce in getting the business and as Trey had said tying it in with a lot of other products. We’re not just a trust manufacturer and the more you can bundle or package for a builder then more important you become as a supplier. It’s a matter of really just saying I want to sell trust I want to sell panels instead of taking the easier approach on some which is selling a strict timing package so any time we are competing to take somebody’s business away and you say and there is going to be price competition but it is not only decided on price with components not nearly as much as what you get into lumber. So, I don’t see a more concentrated approach on components deteriorating the price schedules. The other thing is that you have a lot of builder this is a real growing part of the building material supply industry. There are many builders that have been conventional stick primers that are turning to the use of components to alleviate some of the labor issues that they’re having out on the job site. So you also have a building market and certainly I don’t see any new trust plans being built and I don’t see lot of people going into the trust business or not already in it, so from that standpoint the demand and supplier are going to be coming more in balance. So actually that’s what I can answer that for you.
Phillip Pennell: Do you see that that move that you have with ProBuild then basically increasing the penetration in those areas that they previously were in by themselves? Increasing that penetration in terms of the trusses et cetera?
Floyd Sherman: Right, and I’d say it -- and I think of more a substitution of lumber with components.
Phillip Pennell: So do you guys view -- I know there's been some dislocation in the high-yield market. Has what's going on in the market -- and I know you mentioned earlier in the call that you expected to price the bonds. And I guess there's a bank loan component of this financing as well. Has what you've been led to believe where pricing is going to be, has that changed the return profile in this acquisition at all for you?
Floyd Sherman: No, from our standpoint this is great for Builders FirstSource I think it’s going to be great for ProBuild I think it’s going to be very good for the industry. So, no, the value duration I can see coming out of this I still feel like is quite significant and now nothing we’ve seen in our financing efforts to-date with lead me to believe that’s going to be significantly different.
Phillip Pennell: And so pro forma, we're still on the same schedule in terms of the sources of funds for the acquisition as before. We don't expect to have to up the share component of it at all?
Floyd Sherman: No I don’t expect that.
Operator: And with no further questions in the queue, I’d like to turn the conference back to Mr. Sherman for any additional or closing remarks.
Floyd Sherman: Okay. We appreciate everyone joining the call today. If you have any follow-up questions, don’t hesitate to give Chad or Marcie a call here in Dallas.
Operator: Again, that does conclude today’s presentation. We thank you for your participation.

Floyd Sherman: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me from our management team is Chad Crow, President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer as well as Marcie Hyder, our Vice President and Controller. After I give a brief recap of the current quarter, I’ll turn the call over to Chad who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we’ll take your questions. I’m extremely pleased with our start to fiscal 2015 as our first quarter sales of $371 million, our gross margin percentage and our adjusted EBITDA of over $11 million, all exceeded our first quarter 2014 results. We were able to achieve these positive results despite the relatively flat single family housing starts in the south region and the negative impact of commodity depletion on our current quarter sales as average market price for framing lumber have fallen 11.8% since the beginning of the year and are down 13.6% when compared to the first quarter of 2014.  As a result our lumber and lumber sheet good sales were down 1% versus first quarter 2014 sales in the same product category. However, our value added sales of prefabricated components, windows & doors, and millwork increased 12.8% versus first quarter 2014 sales in the same product categories, largely due to our recent acquisitions. I’ll now turn the call over to Chad who will review our financial results in more detail. 
Chad Crow: Thank you Floyd, good morning everyone. For the current quarter we reported sales of $371 million compared to $345.9 million for the first quarter of 2014, an increase of $25.1 million or 7.2%. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, we estimate sales volume increased approximately 2.2% for the quarter, which was offset 1% by the negative impact of commodity price deflation on our sales. Breaking down our sales by product category, prefabricated components were $78.8 million, up 11.8% from $70.5 million in the first quarter of 2014. Windows & doors were $85 million, up 11.4%. Lumber and lumber sheet goods were $114.3 million down $1.2 million from approximately $115.5 million in 2014.  Our millwork category was $39.5 million, up 18.1% and other building products and services were $53.4 million, up 6.4% from last year. From a product mix standpoint our value added product categories continue to make up the higher percentage of our overall sales as our prefabricated components windows & doors and millwork categories accounted for 54.8% of overall sales in the current quarter compared to 52.1% last year. Our lumber and lumber sheet goods declined as a percentage of sales, while other building products and service category was relatively flat compared to last year.  Gross margin percentage was 22.6% in the current quarter, up 90 basis points from 21.7% last year. Our gross margin percentage increased largely due to improved customer pricing and a higher mix of value added sales. For the current quarter our SG&A expense increased $13.5 million. Of $13.5 million increase $5.5 million related to expenses associated with the recently announced ProBuild acquisition, $800,000 related to an increase in stock comp expense and $1 million related to an increase in depreciation and amortization.  As a percentage of sales SG&A expense increased to 22.3% compared to 20% in the first quarter of 2014. Of this 230 basis point increase 150 basis points related to acquisition expenses and approximately 50 basis points related to increases in stock comp expense and depreciation and amortization.  Excluding these expenses our SG&A expresses a percentage of sales was 20.4% in the current quarter compared to 20% last year. This remaining increase was largely due to the result of investments made in employees and equipment to support current and future sales growth and to a lesser degree the negative impact of commodity price deflation on our sales.  Interest expense was $7.6 million for the first quarter of 2015, a decrease of $1.2 million from last year. The decrease was primarily related to $1.4 million reduction in the non-cash, fair value adjustment related to outstanding stock warrants, issued in connection with our 2011 term loan. We recorded $200,000 of income tax expense compared to $100,000 million income tax benefit in the first quarter of 2014. We recorded an increase in the after-tax, non-cash valuation allowance of our net deferred tax assets of $3.1 million and $1 million in the first quarters of 2015 and 2014 respectively. As of March 31, 2015 our gross federal income tax net operating loss available for carry-forward was approximately $264 million. Loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of ’15 was $7.2 million or a $0.07 loss per diluted share, compared to $3.3 million or a $0.03 loss per diluted share last year. Adjusted loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of ’15 was $2 million or a $0.02 loss per diluted share, compared to $2.1 million or a $0.02 loss per diluted share last year.  Adjusted EBITDA was $11.3 million or 3% of sales, compared to $8.6 million or 2.5% of sales in the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA flow through on our incremental sales for the current quarter was approximately 11%.  Operating cash flow was $9.9 million for the first quarter of 2015, compared to $13.8 million in the first quarter of 2014. During the first quarter of 2015 we used approximately $5.8 million of cash on hand to acquire Timber Tech Texas, a manufacturer of roof and floor trusses located in the San Antonio metro area.  Capital expenditures were $9.1 million for the first quarter, an increase of $3.8 million over the same quarter of 2014. Total liquidity at March 31 was $141.2 million, including $36.8 million of cash and $104.4 million in borrowing availability under our revolver. We had $55 million in outstanding borrowing as of March 31.  I’ll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments. 
Floyd Sherman: Thank you, Chad. Demand for our new housing continues to slowly, yet consistently improve and we look to use this momentum to grow our revenues and market share, while continuing to improve our operating margins.  Our recently announced transaction with ProBuild, which we expect to close in the second half of 2015, will be a high priority for us in the coming months, and we look forward to being able to bring the best talent in the industry together as one team. We believe this transaction significantly enhances our opportunity for growth, and we have never been more excited about the future prospects for our company. I’ll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we’ll first go to Rob Hansen from Deutsche Bank.
Rob Hansen : Thank you, guys. So the first question I had was, I just wanted to ask about the revenue growth and get kind of what the acquisition impact would have been on revenue during the quarter. So just trying to kind of get an organic growth figure outside of lumber for prefab and millwork and what not. 
Chad Crow: Well for the quarter the acquisitions contributed 6% of our 7.2%. Core BFS or legacy BFS if you will, volume was up 2.2%, but that was offset by about 1% due to the commodity deflation. 
Rob Hansen : Got it, okay. And then in terms of, were there any weather impacts during the quarter and have you seen any kind of rebounded volumes since then and kind of how has April been so far?
Floyd Sherman: Okay, during the first quarter we obviously had some impact form the winter weather that we experienced that primarily ran all through our operations. We probably lost five to six shipping days, but again that volume is not necessarily lost. We pick it up then in following days when weather allows us to get back on the road again.  The problem that we had was that delayed construction, a lot of concrete work did not get done in the first quarter that normally would have been done. That issue has been somewhat complicated now as we move into April and April I think is definitely being affected by the large amount of rain that we are experiencing, at least through our building areas that’s slowing things down.  But overall we are seeing an improved flow in April. I think the builders are continuing to report the continuing improvement in their backlogs, I can tell you, we are seeing in our truss backlogs, in our millwork backlogs, in the other panel backlogs, we are seeing almost record levels for us in work that’s out ahead of us and that is a good indication that we have some strong building ahead of us. I think it’s just all now predicated on getting the improvement in weather, where we can get on the job sites and where the builders can get progressing with the homes that they got to deliver.  So I’m looking forward to April being a better transition. I think right now slightly better than what we experienced in March. I shouldn’t say slightly, better than what we’ve seen in March and I think the momentum is going to carry on through the rest of the quarter. So I’m looking for a pretty solid second quarter. 
Rob Hansen : That’s really helpful commentary. Wanted to just follow-up on that is in terms of the backlog that you are seeing, and I think you mentioned it was probably a little bit more on the prefab side and millwork and what not, the kind of value added products. Is this in relation to – the builders are looking more towards using these kind of value added products, so your essentially kind of gaining share within your customer base or are you adding – or is it more like your adding some smaller regional builders and they are recognizing the benefits of the value added package.
Floyd Sherman: I think we are definitely adding a good mixture of the large financial builders, as well as regional builders and local market builders, semi custom and custom builders. There is a growing trend towards the value added products in the construction cycle. Certainly with the shortage that exists in labor today on the construction sites are helping to increase the sales on those products, but we’re continuing to add new customers, as well as continuing to take expanded positions with existing customers and the backlog for us is really a good I think forward picture of what we can expect in the way of housing construction from our customers throughout our building area.  And as I said, the backlog, whether it be trusses and panels, whether it be installed millwork, whether it be windows and doors, all of those items we’re seeing and expanding backlog and its all predicated on being able to get onto the job sites.
Rob Hansen : Great. I really appreciate the color. Thanks guys.
Operator: We’ll now go to Trey Grooms from Stephens.
Drew Lipke: Hi guys. This is actually Drew Lipke on for Trey. The first question, you continue to do a really good job in terms of the margins and I know this is also a tough comp; you’re in this first quarter. This level of margin expansion that we’re seeing, do you think that’s pretty sustainable as we look out through the rest of the year?
Chad Crow: No, we certainly look to continue to increase our margin as we go throughout the year; pretty difficult to quantify that. A lot of that depends on volumes, commodity lumber prices, but yes. The short answer is yes, we definitely will look to continue to expand our margin as the year progresses.
Floyd Sherman: And typically our first quarter margins, is the lower quarter for us in terms of our margin performance. So we are very pleased with what we saw in the first quarter. Our people are responding extremely well to improving not only the sales of value add products, but we’re continuing to try to improve the pricing on all of our products to the construction markets that we serve. We still have ways to go, we’re still not back anywhere close to what we’ve been on the historical past, but at least we’re closing that gap and I think we’ll continue to close that gap.
Drew Lipke: Okay. And then on the Texas market, are you seeing any – you talked about kind of Houston, you saw a slowdown on the high end last quarter. Have you seen any noticeable changes there as you look at the different regions within Texas and have you seen that sort of slowdown maybe triple down to some lower price to the kind of lower end homes at this point yet.
Floyd Sherman: We have seen in Houston in particular, we’ve seen – the improvement has been, I would say slowly but consistently getting better. We’re now looking at our Houston market. It looks like it’s down 8% to 10%. Initially that number was running considerably higher than that in the beginning of the year. We’re starting to see some building in the lower side, lower end of the market, so that’s encouraging to us.  The other market, San Antonio, Austin, Dallas are all looking good right now. We really have not seen anything in the way of a fall off. In fact we’ve really seen some nice improvements in our business quarter-over-quarter in those markets.
Chad Crow: Other than some of the weather delays that we had already addressed.
Floyd Sherman: Yes.
Drew Lipke: Right, okay. And then last one from me just on SG&A. I know previously we kind of excluding the one-time costs associated with ProBuild you know, I think you guys have pointed to sort of mid to upper 18% sales range. Any update on what we should be expecting there? How much more do you see in terms of the investments with employees and equipment needed and then maybe how should we think about this with ProBuild as well?
Chad Crow: Well, we haven’t changed our long term outlook on our ability to leverage our OpEx. The headwinds we faced recently here is the commodity deflation, which has a negative impact on your top line, so you can be delivering more volumes, but you’re not getting the dollars running through, so that’s a tough headwind at times. And then just the overall, the slower growth on the housing starts side.  So our long term thesis has not changed. I still think we’re going to be able to drive that number down into those ranges that you’ve just suggested and long term I still think even as a combined company going forward with ProBuild. We should be able to be at least that efficient from an OpEx side once we get through the integration process.
Floyd Sherman: And of course with ProBuild it’s going to also largely determined getting on getting down from one operating system where they now have sort of multiple operating systems. 
Drew Lipke: Got it. All right, thanks Chad, thanks Floyd.
Floyd Sherman: You bet.
Operator: We’ll now go to John Baugh from Stifel.
John Baugh: Thank you. Good morning. I was curious about between now and when ProBuild closes, will you be able to have any at all meetings and work towards your synergies and how you plan to hit the ground running or are you prevented in any way from doing that?
Chad Crow: Well, we do have to keep running as separate companies, but we are able to have integration meetings, planning meetings. You can do all the planning you want. You just can’t start actually implementing anything and that’s a great question, because we just got back from Denver for a couple of days this week and had those initial pick up meetings with ProBuild’s management team and it went really well and we’re just now starting to lay the ground work for figuring out where we want to get to and building that road map to get there and putting the teams together to do it, but we have started that process. 
Floyd Sherman: But John, as you probably know, any data involving any overlap areas or even non-overlap areas; anything related to customers, product sales, market sales, anything in that area, we cannot exchange data whatsoever. That all has to be done through a clean room and an independent third party to do any analysis work, but other than that we can do as Chad said, all the planning and so forth, getting ready for execution as the data transaction closes.
John Baugh: Right. And Chad, do you have any – could you give us your best guess quarterly maybe over the next three quarters, how south east housing starts might play out?
Chad Crow: I wish I had that crystal ball. South east is essentially our markets and we’re kind of budgeting internally for slow and steady growth. So I think I would except to see somewhere in 8% to 10% starts growth over the next couple of quarters in our market.
John Baugh: Okay, super. Good luck. Thank you.
Chad Crow: Thanks John.
Operator: And we’ll now go to Trey Morrish from Barclays.
Trey Morrish: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. 
Chad Crow: You bet.
Trey Morrish: Could you describe what you think the on-time in-fold delivery rates are between Builder and ProBuild?
Chad Crow: We haven’t gathered that information yet. That’s probably something I’d have to get back to you on.
Trey Morrish: Okay. And then could you describe what will you feel your technology and systems provide a competitive advantage in the industry?
Chad Crow: Well, I think as Floyd alluded to a moment ago, the fact that we are one system is certainly an advantage to several of our larger competitors. I also think the fact that we own the source code over the years has been highly customized that’s hit our business. I think our results have proven. Its allows us to be one of the more efficient operators in the industry and so I certainly see that as an advantage and being on one system, not only can you be more efficient from the headcount standpoint, but just the real time access we have to our business on a day-to-day basis to be able to make decisions quickly I think is also very important. 
Trey Morrish: All right, awesome. And following up on that, how long do you think it could take you to implement one system between Builder and ProBuild?
Chad Crow: That’s something we’re still trying to get our arms around. It’s going to be a multiyear process. I’d probably say you’re looking at two to four years, something like that.
Trey Morrish: Okay. I got it. Thanks guys, I appreciate the insight.
Floyd Sherman: You bet.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll not go to Justin Bergner from Gabelli & Company.
Justin Bergner: Good morning Chad, good morning Floyd. 
Floyd Sherman: Good morning.
Chad Crow: Good morning.
Justin Bergner: My first question relates to sort of an interesting factor in your 10-K, where you talked about I guess the largest customers growing in 14% to 25% of your revenue versus I think it was 22.5% the year before. I was wondering if you might just be able to flush that out for us and also speak to whether or not that’s a favorable mix development for the business.
Chad Crow: Floyd may have something to add to this as well. We’ve always kind of hovered around that 22% to 25%. I do think part of that is as Floyd mentioned earlier, our ability to provide the components as a higher mix of our products. Our ability to scale in general with the larger builders I think has been important as we’ve come out of the housing recovery. We have the infrastructure; we have the liquidity to grow as fast as we need to, to keep up with the pace of the large builders. So off the top of my head that would be the first two items I would say would attribute to that growth.
Justin Bergner: Okay, great. My second question relates to just trying to better understand sort of the incremental margins and some of the puts and takes. My first question is, are you able to quantify how much EBITDA came from acquired properties in the quarter and my second question is how much of a headwind should we think about from sort of the lumber deflation at the EBTIDA level this quarter?
Chad Crow: Well, on the acquisitions we made, obviously they were heavily weighted towards value ad and so their EBITDA contribution was higher than the company as a whole, so they are still performing very well and is obviously part of our strategy to improve our mix in those categories.  From a commodity deflation standpoint, it is a headwind for us. The simple math I do says, let’s just say we had a 10% price deflation over an entire year and so we feel the full impact of it. I think a 10% price decrease would probably result in about a $10 million decrease in gross profit dollars and so it would have a fairly significant impact on EBITDA. That’s why we’ve always said, the higher prices and the stable prices are the best environment for us. So this is – it’s a challenge right now.
Justin Bergner: Okay, that’s helpful. I mean as a rule of thumb, could someone just sort of take the lumber deflation and apply a 10% incremental margin to it or something thereabouts to get a rough sense as to what the headwind would be?
Chad Crow: Yes, you could. I usually go about it by just looking at our product mix and kind of calculating it from the top down. If you figure out what it might do to our cost and then the fact that we typically mark up those commodity lumber products to get somewhere in the neighborhood of a 20% margin you can pretty quickly do the math to see how that might flow through.
Justin Bergner: Okay. My third and final question relates to the competitive environment in your industry given what looks like a less optimistic view of housing starts now versus three months ago. I know that you were sort of planning around 10%, maybe some of your competitors were planning for a little bit higher and it seems like 10% is sort of in the high end of what we might expect now for ’15. What is the competitive dynamic like? Had the price pressure started to subside or you’re seeing yourself having to walk away from less business?
Floyd Sherman: We are still continuing to walk from business to where we just don’t feel that – and this is especially true in the commodity side of the business. That’s where we have done most of our walking from the business to where it just doesn’t pay us to chase that business at both price points.  I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that when commodities are continuing to go into decline, people are stuck with inventories and they start trying to move their inventories at whatever prices they can get out of it, rather than sit and hold on it. They need to turn those dollars to continue to support the business and for a number of other reasons, but there’s always been pricing and we certainly have strong competition for even that value add products and we lose some of those business, because we don’t get what we think are appropriate margins, but most of the business loss is coming out of the lumber, lumber head good category.  My feelings about building and the activity in building, I’m not maybe as pessimistic as you are. I think the first quarter was definitely influenced by weather. I think we’ve seen I think above normal rain conditions through much of our building area that’s affected and even slowed April somewhat, but I’m very encouraged by what I see in backlog of business that’s building up.  The feeling among our builder customers are still very positive. They certainly don’t seem to be backing off of their building plans and for what they are giving us for forward planning is still in the range that will meet the targets that Chad said, that 8% to 10% and I feel that’s going to be the level of activity that we’re going to see.  So as building conditions continue to improve, then I’ll take some of the capacity over supply conditions out and gradually we’re going to see a steady improvement in the pricing that we have in this business. So I’m very optimistic as I look forward and in fact I feel certainly better this year than what I did last year at this point in time.
Justin Bergner: Great, that’s very helpful. Would it be fair to say that the competitive environment has not worsened from a quarter ago, even the start numbers in the first quarter were pretty modest.
Floyd Sherman: No. I don’t think Texas has worsened, certainly not from the business that we’re seeing and in all of the markets that we serve and Houston seems to be recovering from initially I think that was maybe an overreaction and I though certainly there was job loss and it certainly impacted Houston more so than our other markets in the state, but I think that seems to be subsiding and Houston is coming back.
Justin Bergner: Great. Well, best of luck with ProBuild and the rest of the year.
Floyd Sherman: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Matt McCall from BB&T Capital Markets.
Matt McCall: Thank you. Good morning guys.
Chad Crow: Hey Matt.
Matt McCall: So Floyd you mentioned the growing trends for value ads and then Chad I think you were talking about the acquisitions being named at value ad. So tying this back into you margin commentary, if I look over the last few years and it looks like Q2 to Q4 averaged about 50 basis points better than Q1. Given this trend for more value ad and the acquisitions are obviously going to help that, could the improvement be a little bit better than that. I mean not quantifiable, but directionally could it better than what you’ve been seeing in previous years?
Chad Crow: I think it certainly could be, especially with the backlog we’re looking at. I’m as optimistic as Floyd, both the top line and from a margin standpoint, so absolutely, there could be some upside there.
Matt McCall: Okay, the backlog, what you see in backlog in terms of mix, how does that compare and I’m specifically looking at the value ad, but how does that compare to what you were seeing in Q1 of last year? 
Floyd Sherman: Our backlog is a lot better that what we saw in Q1 of last year. In fact look I said we are almost at the best levels we’ve seen in a long time in the backlog of our value added products and the pricing is also equal or I mean better than what we say in the first quarter last year. 
Matt McCall: Okay and then finally Chad on the SG&A line, you talked about the impact of investments and stock comp. Same type of question, relative to the deleveraging you saw in Q1, what’s the expectation for the remainder of the year, specifically with those two items?
Chad Crow: On the stock comp that, charge you saw in the first quarter will be representative of what we would see the rest of the year, was that your question?
Matt McCall: Yes, and then the investments kind of in people I think you talked about some machinery, different things like that…
Chad Crow: Yes, I think we are still a little heavy there, as we talked about on some prior calls. We carried a little bit of extra people cost and facility cost through the winter in anticipation of the spring selling season. So we got a little cushion there to take on more volume, but once we get to a certain point the variable side of our business will kick in again as volume increases and that’s typically the delivery side of the business where you are needing more drivers to deliver product, some more equipment and then the salesmen commission piece of our business is variable as well. But we have some room to grow there. 
Floyd Sherman: Some of the reason that we, in addition to what Chad has said, he’s definitely very accurate, but another reason why we have taken on additional drivers and additional health in our operations is due to the fact the drivers are very, very scarce, very hard to find and any opportunities we can, where we can hire additional drivers, we’ve done it, so that we could make sure that were fully covered when it came to the busy months, because the last thing you need is to have a good improvement in business and not be able to get it out, either from pulling the loads and pulling all various products, loading their crops and so we’ve continually been beefing up labor in order to make sure that we can take care of the volume when it comes our way in the better building season. 
Chad Crow: And I think the same logic applies to truss designers. It’s really hard to, truss designers are in tight supply these days as well and so we head on to our design capacity and that’s certainly going to payoff as Floyd mentioned, because we do have a very large backlog that we see coming. So I think that was a good move as well. 
Floyd Sherman: Good point. 
Matt McCall: Okay, perfect. Very helpful, thank you. 
Operator: And we will now move to Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee CRT.
Jay McCanless: Good morning guys. 
Floyd Sherman: Good morning Jay. 
Jay McCanless: Two questions from you. First one, what should we think about for legal costs for 2Q and I know the rest of the year maybe tough, but any guidance you could give us on how to frame 2Q?
Chad Crow: Oh! Gosh, that’s a tough one. A lot of that depends on the timing on the transaction and how things progress. I guess the way I would answer that now is, best guess there is maybe another $15 million or so of expected transaction type cost that will come over the next couple of quarters, but exactly how that will play out, I don’t know yet. 
Jay McCanless: Okay, all right, that’s helpful, thank you. The second question I had and this also relates to ProBuild, but a different way. What are you seeing right now from suppliers and more importantly, what are you seeing from competitors? How are they responding to the deal, how are they positioning themselves relative to what should become a very large company pretty soon?
Floyd Sherman: Our interaction with the suppliers has been strictly, its business as usual. For the two companies we have not tried in any way to start getting into advanced talk with the suppliers, to talk about the future of the company on a combined basis, got to stay away from that and we will respect the legal requirements that we have in that area and so any attempts that have been made to engage us in those type discussion we said have to be put off unit the transaction is closed and it’s really hard to do, because you want to be able to jump in and see what advantages we can produce, but we have stay away from it and I think the same thing is probably is true from ProBuild side.  As far as the completion, this business has always been right with people who know all of the answers before they see any of the data and we are going through some of that now. We have a couple of competitors who just really feel that they can attract people and they can built their business doing it in a traditionally and a legitimate ways. They got to try to create issues and build their business off of creating problems for somebody else, but I guess that may be sometimes the way competition is. They are trying, but I think there will be very limited success.  I think both of our companies have enough strong points going for us that our people are smart enough to read between the lines. 
Jay McCanless: Got it, okay. And then I think you already answered this one, but lumber thus far in 2Q looks like Southern Yellow Pine moving higher, but some of the other species continue to move lower. Do you guys expect a similar deflationary impact from lumber this quarter as to what you saw in 1Q?
Floyd Sherman: I would like to say no, but where I sit right now, the weather right now and I just follow on a weekly basis, we are continually following the production incoming orders on lumber at the mills levels, the shipments. The weather is really impacting it and especially the Southern Yellow Pine guys and they certainly have seen while their prices have head up better, it’s still not really good, but they have recently with all of this rain, they certainly are seeing some – we are seeing the price fall in Southern Yellow Pine.  I really think we are going to – I think we are close to seeing a bottom and I think we are going to start – my feeling is we are going to start seeing a gradual, but slow improvement on the commodity pricing side. I just can’t see how the mills can continue operating at the type price points that they have right now, especially the OSP guys and my feelings is the second quarter and third quarter, we are going to see better pricing than what we are going to see right now. 
Jay McCanless: Okay, perfect. Thanks guys. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take our question from Rob Hansen from Deutsche Bank. 
Rob Hansen: Thanks. I just had one follow-up. In terms of your customers, you’ve probably been out and had a bunch of conversations with customers. I just wanted to see if you had any kind of early feedback and I realize you are not out there trying to run the companies as combined companies or anything like that and there is strict separation, but just kind of any early feedback from customers that you have, where you kind of talked to them yet. Here is the combination and obviously what it looks like and have there been any fears or anything like that. So anything along those lines would be great, thanks?
Floyd Sherman: I think the feedback that we certainly have had has been positive. I think the customers feel that, hey it’s interesting. They are obviously going to be watching it closely, to see how it might affect them long term. I think they understand the value proposition and what this combination can do in the market place for makings us a more efficient provider and overall I think it’s been a very positive reaction. 
Rob Hansen: Great, thanks guys. 
Operator: And it appears there are no further questions. I’ll turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional and closing remarks. 
Floyd Sherman: Okay. We appreciate everyone joining the call today. If you have any follow-up questions, don’t hesitate to give Chad or Marcie a call here in Dallas. Thanks and have a great week.
Operator: This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.

Floyd Sherman: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014 earnings call. Joining me today from our management team is Chad Crow, President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer as well as Marcie Hyder, Vice President and Controller. After I give a brief recap of our fourth quarter and fiscal year, I will turn the call over to Chad who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we’ll take your questions. So the level of new construction activity was not what we had expected in 2014, we were still able to deliver profitable top line growth while also expanding our product offerings and customer base by a multiple acquisition within very attractive housing markets. We reported sales of approximately 397 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 up 7.5% from a year ago. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions our fourth quarter sales increased 3%. Quarter-over-quarter commodity price fluctuations had minimal impact on our sales. For fiscal 2014 we reported sales of approximately 1.6 billion up 7.7% over 2013 excluding the impact of acquisitions our sales for fiscal 2014 increased 5.8% compared to last year as sales volume grew 7.9% before 2.1% negative impact of commodity price deflation on our sales. From a single family housing start perspective, the Census Bureau reported 2014 actual starts in the South region which encompasses all of our markets increased 6% compared to 2013. I would also like to point out fiscal 2014 marked the first year of positive net income for us since 2006, the continued execution of our core strategies has helped us weather the worse housing downturn since the Great Depression and significantly improved our results. I feel honored to be working with what I believe is the best group of people in this industry and I'm very product of what we have accomplished over the past few years. I will now turn the call over to Chad who will review our financial results in more detail.
Chad Crow: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning everyone. For the current quarter we reported sales of 396.7 million compared to 369.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, an increase of 27.6 million or 7.5%. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, sales increased 3% largely due to higher sales volume as commodity price fluctuations had a minimal impact on our sales. Breaking down our sales by product category, prefabricated components were 79.1 million, up 9.8% from 72 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Windows and doors were 92 million, up 11.2%, lumber and lumber sheet goods were 121.6 million down 1.5 million. Our millwork category was 44 million, up 25.1 million and other building products and services were 60 million, up 7% from last year. From a product mix standpoint, our value added product categories continue to make up a higher percentage of overall sales while lumber and lumber sheet goods declined as a percentage of sales. Our other building products and services category was relatively flat compared to last year. Gross margin was 22.8% in the current quarter, up from 22.4% last year, our gross margin percent increased largely due to improved customer pricing versus the fourth quarter of 2013. Increasing our gross margins as we continue to grow our top line was a focal point for us this past year and I'm very pleased to say we improved our gross margin percentage sequentially each quarter of 2014 resulting in an 80 basis point increase year-over-year. For the current quarter, our SG&A increased 9.4 million or 13.5%. Off the 9.4 million increase in SG&A 1.3 million related to stock comp expenses and 1 million related to depreciation and amortization both of which are non-cash items. The remaining 7.1 million increase was largely due to investments made in employees, equipment and facilities to support current and future sales growth. This includes incremental salaries and wages, equipment lease expense and facility rent along with expenses associated with acquisitions. As a percentage of sales SG&A expense increased to 19.9% compared to 18.8% for the fourth quarter of 2013. Off this a 110 basis point increase, 50 basis points related to stock comp expense and depreciation and amortization again both non-cash items with the remaining 60 basis points being associated with the aforementioned investments in growth infrastructure. Interest expense was 8.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013. We recorded 500,000 of income tax expense compared to 200,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013. We recorded a reduction of the after tax non-cash allowance on our deferred tax assets of 900,000 and 2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013 respectively. As of December 31th, 2014 our gross federal income tax net operating loss available for carry-forward was approximately 245 million. Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 2.5 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared to 4.6 million or $0.05 per diluted share last year. Our adjusted EBITDA was 17.7 million or 4.5% of sales compared to 16.2 million or 4.4% of sales last year. Operating cash flow was negative 3 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 8.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The primarily difference relates to a 12.3 million increase in our working capital in the current quarter while working capital was flat in the fourth quarter of 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we used approximately 36.2 million of cash on hand to acquire Trim Tech of Austin and Empire Truss Ltd, marking the fourth and fifth acquisitions by the company since mid-2014. Capital expenditures were 11.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, an increase of 5.5 million over the same quarter of 2013 and primarily relate to the relocation of an existing facility in San Antonio and the opening of a new facility in North Houston. Total liquidity at December 31, 2014 was a 147.2 million including 17.8 million of cash and a 129.4 million in borrowing availability under our revolver. We had no new borrowings under our revolver during the quarter and had 30 million in outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2014. I’ll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd Sherman: Thank you, Chad. Our outlook is for a steady recovery in the housing market due to factors such as continued job growth, favorable mortgage rates and lending guidelines that appear to be easing. As the economy expands and the housing market moves back towards a stronger level of activity, our focus will remain on profitably growing our revenues while continuing to look for ways to gain share either organically or through acquisitions and to ultimately to improve our operating margins. I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc.
Trey Grooms: Couple of questions, first off I mean you guys are doing a great job on the margins, congrats on that. It looks like that is starting to cut into your share a little bit, your organic growth up 3%. Single family starts were up I think 9% in the quarter in the south. First off do you think that’s the case, do you feel like you’ve lost some share in the quarter or is there something else going on and then secondly how do you think about balancing out margins in market share as we look through the next several quarters just going forward?
Floyd Sherman: I know the amount of business we’re walking from, it's definitely an indication that as we continue to try to move our margins up that we’re maybe flattening out, I think on an overall basis and then still for the year we gained a little bit of market share or just about flat. So we continue to really evaluate the position, we really don’t feel that we can start cutting prices and be able to hold the margin gains that we have made and that we currently are enjoying. We think it's very important to get our margins up, as the housing continues to recover, as conditions get better it's a heck of a lot hard to pull your margins up from 20% and get it back to a normalized rate of 24 to 25 than it is pulling it up from 23% and that’s what we really feel is the reason and the important reason why we want to continue holding our position on margins. If we feel it really starts taking away from our market share we may then decide to look at it. If you look at where the loss has come from it's primarily you will see it in our commodity products, the commodity products for the quarter were down actually 1% or 1.2% over where it was a year ago. Our gains we continue to make in prefab components they were up almost 10%, windows and doors were up 11%, mill work up 25% and then our other products were down about flat with market growth. So the big area that we are trading off is in the area of the lumber and panels or the commodity products and we’re trying to push our efforts into the higher margin products which we feel ultimately will be a lot better for us. We know we can get the lumber and panel business back if we want to go after it but it can also work against you in some of the other higher margin product areas that we have been concentrating in. So that in the long way around is hopefully answers your question.
Trey Grooms: Shifting now, Chad, you talked I guess in prior quarters kind of your thoughts on kind of how things are progressing in the current quarter. Would you mind giving us your view on kind of what you’re seeing right now and how you’re thinking about the March quarter and Spring selling season and in general any color that you can give us on that?
Chad Crow: It's really too soon to say exactly how the quarter might shake out, I will say that in January things were relatively flat with how we kind of ended the year. We started to see some moment a year or two in our daily sales and then we got slammed by the weather this past week in a lot of our markets and still have some locations that are even closed today. So it's a little too soon to try to guess, you know what top line might be. I think one thing you need to keep in mind Trey is on a sequential quarter basis. We do get hit with some extra SG&A, some extra pay roll taxes with the reset [ph] of social security.  On a sequential quarter basis we start out in the whole about 50 basis points on gross margins just because the pay roll taxes alone and then on the SG&A side of things we would expect to pick up an incremental 3.5 million on SG&A between pay roll taxes and the fact that we have to start accruing for vacations at the beginning of the year. So just something to keep on mind on the sequential quarter basis, I still think Q1 of this year will be better than last year but it's really hard to say exactly where it all may fall out.
Trey Grooms: But just a point of clarity on that, when you said relatively flat with 4Q do you mean on an absolute sales basis or do you mean similar growth year-over-year growth is what we saw in the fourth quarter.
Chad Crow: Our sales per day at the end of the year where we were running was pretty consistent with how we entered the first of the year and how January played out and then we did start to see a pick up as I said till we got hit by some of the snow and ice.
Trey Grooms: My last question and then I will turn it over, it's going to be -- I know you guys are all over the Texas market, you know feet on the ground and really understand that market I think as well as anybody. You’ve been doing some acquisitions there, some greenfields with the new distribution facility in North Houston. Can you give us just some color on what your Texas exposure like as a percent of revs and then if you can help break that down as much as you can anyway into the specific markets between Texas that you’re in, that would be helpful. And then as the follow-on to that, what you got seeing out of that market, are you seeing any slowdown in any of these markets? What are your expectations there as we look into the next several quarters given the announcements we have seen from the energy companies and with the commodity and so forth?
Chad Crow: Right now our sales in Texas are probably 20% - 25% of our total revenue. I'm not going to try to break that down by market. I will say we have seen a slowdown in Houston on the more expensive homes, say 450,000 and up, those orders have seem to have slowed a bit. Really haven't seen much of a pull back on the lower cost homes in Houston or another markets in Texas at this point. So we’re all still kind of waiting to see if the other shoe is going to drop and a lot of that is going to depend on for how long a period of time the oil prices may stay depressed?
Operator: And our next question is from Philip Volpicelli with Deutsche Bank.
Philip Volpicelli: My first question is with regard to the acquisitions, you mad the two acquisitions in the quarter -- can you give us any indication on what the revenue or the EBITDA is for those acquisitions so that we can figure out what the leverage is on a pro forma basis or the multiple you paid for them?
Chad Crow: Timber Tech was 15ish million I believe on an annual basis and Trim Tech was a little bit higher than that on an annual basis.
Philip Volpicelli: And that’s revenue Chad or that’s EBITDA?
Chad Crow: That’s correct, that’s revenue.
Philip Volpicelli: Okay. And should we think that the margin profile is similar to your margin profile or how should we think about that?
Chad Crow: Those are very heavy value adds, so their margin profile is going to be a little heavier than our overall Builder's FirstSource margin profile. But I would that consist with similar operations within our company.
Philip Volpicelli: So can you give us like an aggregate multiple -- what I'm trying to do is obviously you have spent the 30 million of cash in the quarter so your net debt looks like it's gone up but in fact you know all you’ve really done is added the EBITDA, so I'm trying to figure what the impact is on your net leverage?
Chad Crow: No we’re not going to give EBITDA on those acquisitions.
Philip Volpicelli: And then I think Trey, was trying to get to this point the revenue per start in the region is down about 4% in the fourth quarter and that accelerated from the negative 2.9% in the third quarter. Is that because your building lower priced homes, is that a mix issue, what's driving that decline in revenue per start?
Chad Crow: I think part of it as Floyd mentioned is the fact that our [inaudible] lower margin business, so anytime you do that you’re going to lose some share. Commodity deflation, the impact on the quarter was minimal, it was slightly negative, we just didn’t feel like it was worth disclosing. You know you talk to our guys in the field and they will tell you they don’t feel like they are losing any share that they didn’t want to lose because of price and so I don’t know if there is a little noise in the starts number, I don’t know if it's our mix of customers that maybe aren't pulling as many permits as others in the region. You know it's really hard to tell on a one quarter basis and even sometimes two quarters for that standpoint. So I think the spring and early summer selling season will really be the fruits in the pudding to see how we’re doing on a share basis.
Floyd Sherman: But I would even say, Chad, on a year basis our loss in revenue per start is all coming out of our lower lumber cheap good. For the year our prefab components, the sales growth was up almost 13%, windows and doors up almost 16%, mill work 17%, if you look at lumber, lumber sheet goods down 8/10ths of 1% and so that -- and that’s a third of your business. If you look at the other building products which is primarily install and we definitely have pull back on our install because of difficulties of acquiring labor, keeping labor, being able to price labor and so forth that was only up 4.3%. So while we maybe have lost a little bit of revenue per share we were totally able to make up [ph] in those products. We have been able to move up our margins substantially, 80 basis points and a highly competitive market. I think it's an indication that our strategy is good, we still produced more bottom line EBITDA, we still produced a gain in sales. So if I saw it's losing it across the board and all those categories I will be a lot more worried than I'm now. Anytime we want to go and get a lumber sales and panel sales you can do what if you want to drop your doors.
Philip Volpicelli: And then on the windows and door space, the manufactures there have been announcing price increases, one have those price increases being sticking and two have you had any problem passing them along to your customers on specifically windows and doors?
Chad Crow: The price seem to be sticking, it's always the bottom to raise prices but we have been pretty successfully in passing those along.
Philip Volpicelli: Okay. And then last one for me, with the potential headwinds in Texas from what's happened with oil and gas, would that make you more conservative on the acquisition front or how you’re thinking about acquisitions in 2015?
Chad Crow: We’re still certainly interested in acquisitions, the pipeline still seems pretty full. We would probably give a little harder thought to more acquisitions in Texas right now until we see how the oil situation is going to pan out. But we’re going to prudently aggressive no matter what the situation is or what the economy is like. So I don’t know that it is really going to change our strategy all that much other than maybe like I said given opportunities in Texas a little bit more thought.
Floyd Sherman: And I think you also, as Chad -- we’re looking harder for acquisitions that can maybe move the needle more than some of the acquisitions that we have done takes a tremendous effort and time on a lot of people's part on some of the smaller acquisition, you’re going to put in that same effort and time on a larger acquisition and so we’re looking harder for those type of acquisitions that we feel can give us a lot more scale than what we have been doing.
Chad Crow: Yes. And then we have tapped the breaks the last couple of months and we’re just trying now to digest and integrate the six that we have done recently.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee.
Jay McCanless: First question on the comments that were in the release about lumber deflation, not having an impact this quarter? I was surprised to see that and just wanted to find even with OSB still down year-over-year and framing lumber up a little bit, is that finally getting to the point now where OSB is not going to be a drag on numbers going forward and how are lumber prices right now cash prices looking?
Floyd Sherman: I would like to have been able to say that, we saw a strengthening of the commodity pricing in the fourth quarter. Lumber started moving up, panels started moving up and then towards the end of December the market started following again. If you look at currently where we’re in the midpoint in February, we’re now looking at the framing lumber composite is down versus where it was a year ago by almost 8%, panels are down close to 11%. I don’t know how much the extreme weather that we’re experiencing in the mid-west and north-east is effecting the pricing on Lumber panels right now. I suspect it is having a significant effect. Our feeling is still that we’re going to continue to see a commodity pricing during 2015 that’s going to be very similar to what we had seen in 2014. We probably saw the tightest band of trading within the year that I can ever recall. It stayed within about a $40 band on lumber and even a little bit tighter band on panels. We didn’t have the extreme volatility that we have seen in the past and I think that’s going to be more of what we’re going to see through 2015. There is still is adequate capacity, in fact still too much capacity chasing too little demand. So, I think what we’re seeing right now is more weather driven than it is what we’re going to see in market pricing. I really suspect that we’re going to see some increase in lumber panel prices as we run out through March.
Jay McCanless: The second question I had was on the fourth quarter SG&A number and I apologize if you’ve already talked about this but were there any onetime items in there that we can take out for next year?
Chad Crow: I don’t know if there is anything in there you can take out about on a percentage of sales basis about half of our increase quarter-over-quarter was stock comp and depreciation and amortization. So obviously non-cash items but those numbers will carry on into 2015. The others as I’ve said were more investments in our current growth -- our future growth, investments in employees, delivery equipment, facilities and so those will carry through 2015 but obviously the hopes there is we’re able to leverage those against increasing sales as the year goes on.
Floyd Sherman: For the quarter our salary and wages if we look at that, we flexed about 66% variable to sales growth. The [inaudible] also can that I would hope that we can see an improvement next year with our health insurance. We really got clouded [ph] again in the fourth quarter with an increase in group health, almost a 1.2 million over fourth quarter a year ago. The last couple of quarters have been really, really tough. I don’t know whether we’re seeing some of the what we may be seeing on long term basis that’s been created through the Health Reform Act. I suspect that’s part of it but it also just maybe, it was our time to really experience some very, very cost claims. But our professional services and that will probably continue as long as we continue doing our -- the acquisitions and we’re active in that area, that added over a $0.5 million of unusual cost to us. So just so couple of items. You’re looking at right around $2 million or so of what I would say is unanticipated or unexpected cost.
Jay McCanless: And then the last question I had Floyd, was going back to making an acquisition that would actually increase your scale and give you guys a bigger footprint, what has to assuming that the market continues to trend up a little bit in the south-east. Are you just going to have pay more if you want to get that scale or do you think it's more of a situation where the market needs to roll over a little bit and slow down where those people are ready to sell? Can you give us some more color around what you’re thinking on that?
Floyd Sherman: I think it's probably going to be a combination of both of those things, the -- I know there is -- there appears to be some situations developing where people are trying to get what they think will be a better trailing 12 EBITDA I think we will see some things maybe loosen up in the Spring. Well we’ve to pay more typically -- you’re willing to pay a little bit more if the value is there and we have to really see that the value is there, we got to see that there is good expansion take abilities in the business and if we can expand the profitability in the business that we don’t have to put in a lot of capital expenditures, those things will probably say that we’re going to have pay more. But so far on what the businesses we have bought, I think we bought a very good value propositions. I suspect the larger ones we’re going to probably have to raise the bar somewhat. Chad do you have any different views in that?
Chad Crow: I think that’s right, I think the fact that the market is not growing at the rate that maybe year ago folks thought it would is certainly one of the reasons we have seen the pipeline fill up even more from an opportunity standpoint.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our next question from Sam McGovern with Credit Suisse.
Sam McGovern: Just following up on the M&A theme, to the extent that you do see increased opportunities with the pullback in Houston, is it, would that be some place you would go further into and then also would you guys be looking to sort of expand geographies or would it just be sort of in-fill in your current footprint?
Chad Crow: We’re certainly not going to rule Houston out, if something interesting came along we would definitely take a look at it. As far as expanding geography, the most likely scenario will be to strengthen our share in our existing markets or maybe expand into adjacent markets. We’re not opposed to going outside of our current footprint. I think that would require an acquisition of a little more size. I wouldn’t make a whole lot of sense for us to acquire one or two locations that were a significant distance from our current footprint but something of more size we would certainly look at other geographies as well.
Sam McGovern: And just on the window side, can you update us in terms of what you guys are seeing in terms of demand there and any updates in terms of vinyl pricing?
Chad Crow: Demand on windows are still very strong.
Floyd Sherman: The big thing that we’re seeing in the window arena, most of the manufactures announced price increases typically ranging from 4% to 5% to as high as 9%. We certainly have seen these increases, we are in the process of passing them on because especially where we purchase for resale we don’t have any choice. We got to pass those increases on or we will suffer real margin hit. Where we manufacture windows here in Texas, we also increased our prices. We started putting those price increases at least informing the customers late last fall and so they are going in during the first quarter. We should have probably 80% of our customers on the new pricing and then the rest will fall into the second quarter. But it's tough to get to price increases and you’ve to be prepared to welcome some business. If you can't get what you believe is a responsible price and something that you need to go forward with. The build throughs [ph] are not taken price increases at all favorable but if your service is good, your quality is good the representation with your people on the job site, if you’re doing it better than other people then you can hold the business. So far for the most part we’re holding the business.
Operator: And our next question is from Rob Hansen with Deutsche Bank.
Rob Hansen: I just wanted to ask about acquisitions in a different way, more in terms of how long does it take to integrate one of these companies, you guys have done six deals and to get linked on your IT systems so everybody is all on the same page.
Chad Crow: Typically we can get that done in a couple of months, we have got three of the six done that we acquired since June 30, and they have been working on the other three. We had to pause a little bit just because of our fiscal year end and other activities that are involved with that but usually a couple of months for each of them.
Rob Hansen: And then in terms of acquisitions just, how do you look at -- what is the criteria for generating value in acquisition and how does that change in a larger style acquisition?
Chad Crow: Well the criteria is certainly customer mix, product mix, the strength of the market they are in play into all decisions as far as comparing a small deal versus a large, with a large deal you’re probably going to have more home office type synergies that you can achieve as opposed to a small deal. Hopefully on the purchasing side you will get a little more leverage there. Those are probably the two main differences between a large and small deal.
Floyd Sherman: Yes, and then in the smaller deal you probably have far less potential for customer overlap because you’re looking at a specific niche to maybe strengthen yourself in the market in the area that you’re not serving, in a larger you’re definitely going to have some overlap. This is such a highly fragmented business and there is so many competitors that customer has to choose from that really isn't a significant problem, I don’t think that we will see going forward.
Rob Hansen: And then one last one, just on the six acquisitions that you’ve done, what percentage of kind of the revenue would you say is on the commodity type lumber products versus the higher margin, more value added products?
Floyd Sherman: Well for the six do very little in the way of lumber and commodity type products. So I would say of the six acquisitions their commodity lumber mix may only be 10% to 15%. So we only have got some in Houston and some in Orlando [ph].
Operator: And our next question comes from Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company.
Justin Bergner: Most of my questions have answered, I think on the last call you indicated that you were planning the business around 10% housing start growth in 2015, does that remain the case and do you think competitors are sort of planning their businesses around similar levels?
Chad Crow: That’s still the case for us, we’re budgeting for about 10% increase in starts. I don’t know I really can't speak to what our competitors are doing but folks have had the chance to talk within the industry. I would say 10% is more than norm. Some are little higher than that but I would say 10% to 12% is probably what I’ve heard from most folks.
Justin Bergner: And then secondly what would need to happen for you to stop walking away from some of the business that you’re walking away from? What has to happen in the marketplace for that business to become attractive again?
Floyd Sherman: Better pricing. The business that we’re walking away from is strictly an issue of price and the margin contribution that we can get out of it and it's primarily in the commodity area and in the install area. Install we got to see some stabilizing in area of labor and labor cost, labor availability and labor cost and in commodities it's a matter of pricing. When time in and time again we’re seeing commodities being priced on a delivered basis to a job site for low single digit margins, hell, we can't even get our croc [ph] out of the yard for what we see in some of the pricing. And so I think the level of housing activity as it begins to eat up and put supply in a tighter constraint, I think you will see the commodity pricing come up and to where people start getting will be more realistic in what they are looking for in a way of pricing for lumber, lumber sheet goods.
Operator: And our next question is from Paul Betz with BB&T Capital Markets.
Paul Betz: Sorry if I’ve missed this, the investments that we’re seeing in SG&A, I think it's kind of an incremental over the past two quarters. Do you see that continuing in maybe the first half of next year or have you invested enough to accommodate that 10% growth that you’re looking for next year?
Chad Crow: I would expect the adds to certainly slow. I think we’re in pretty good shape and we should be able to leverage our cost structure very well against the anticipated volume next year. So it is an investment for this next year for 2014 but I do think it was necessary, we made the decision -- to cut certain folks loose, not to give rid of extra equipment, to go ahead and put some investments into some new facilities and I do think we will start to see pay off this year.
Paul Betz: Do you think you will get your -- I think you’ve had a long term goal of maybe 18% SG&A, do you think you will get back down to that in 2015?
Chad Crow: Probably not all the way down to 18 but certainly a good chance of getting back around mid to upper 18s, a lot of that is going to depend on commodity lumber pricing as well because certainly higher lumber prices makes it much easier to leverage our SG&A.
Paul Betz: And one last SG&A question, you said something about 3.5 million sequential increase in SG&A, what was that from?
Chad Crow: Payroll taxes, the reset [ph] in the first quarter and vacation expense. We’ve a use it or lose it policy, so we have to accrue for vacation the first couple of quarters of the year and then we’re able to reverse that accrual and that alone will be probably a $1.7 million increase in Q1 SG&A versus Q4, combined the payroll taxes and vacation will be about 3.5 million.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we now go to Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms: Just a couple more real quick ones, Chad, would you expect to see any benefits from the lower diesel prices or increased driver availability there in Texas. I know it's a challenge for a lot of folks but any thoughts on that, any benefits you could see?
Chad Crow: We could see some free up some drivers which could help from a fuel standpoint. Our fuel typically runs 1% to 1.1% of sales, so there is the potential there to pick up 15 or 20 basis points I would think on the fuel side of things if these prices stay down.
Trey Grooms: And over the last few years has the driver availability really been a headwind, as far as wages?
Chad Crow: Yes, constantly having to make a decision. Our drivers are being poached from competitors, other industries and we’re constantly having to evaluate whether to bump their pay to keep or let them go but that’s still the case, it's still very tight.
Trey Grooms: Okay. One last one and you mentioned, Floyd, I think you talked about some price movements you’ve seen in some of your material like window specifically, can you comment on any other price movements you’re specifically maybe in doors? I know there was quite a bit of movement last year but just anything that you’re kind of expecting for this year?
Floyd Sherman: Yes we’re definitely seeing it indoors, that’s announced -- found in the marketplace. Your trim mouldings, interior finish out items signing all of those things seem to be [inaudible] right along with one another. The insulation even though we really don’t do a great business in insulation or cheap rock [ph] those items have also had significant increases. So in the -- some of those items have done a year or two without and really had not gotten the increases that they have needed and it almost seems like most of the manufacturers have taken a position. We either get it now or we got to begin looking for another approach to the business. And so lot of desperation [inaudible] are getting better pricing.
Trey Grooms: And then my last one is just housekeeping and I may have missed it in the comments already but Chad, D&A and CapEx for this year given the acquisitions that are in place?
Chad Crow: I think our D&A will be 15 million to 16 million for the year. CapEx we’re probably looking at around 25 million, about half of that will fleet delivery related and then the rest is investments in equipment and some facility expansions.
Operator: And we have no further questions in the queue at this time.
Floyd Sherman: Okay. We appreciate everyone joining the call today. If you’ve any follow-up questions don’t hesitate to give Chad or Marcie a call here in Dallas. Thanks and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Floyd Sherman:  Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today from our management team is Chad Crow, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Marcie Hyder, Vice President and Controller. I will start with an overview in the third quarter. I’ll then turn the call over to Chad who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we’ll take your questions. We ended the third quarter of 2014 with sales of approximately 435 million and on a same store basis increased our sales by 5.3% compared to the third quarter of 2013. Our sales volume excluding the impact of recent acquisitions grew 6.6% before a 1.3% negative impact of commodity price deflation on sales. For the current quarter, the U.S. Census Bureau reported actual single-family housing starts in the south region, which encompasses all of our markets, increased 10.5% compared to the third quarter of 2013. On a September year-to-date basis, actual single-family starts increased 4% in the south region compared to 2013 while our sales volume grew 9.9% before a 3.1% negative impact of commodity price deflation on our sales. In addition to our focus on profitable organic growth, our focus has also been on growing through acquisitions. Our recent acquisitions in Orlando, Houston, Dallas and Austin markets should allow us the opportunity to expand our product and service offerings to a more diverse customer base in what we consider very attractive housing markets. On a trailing 12-month basis, as of the respective acquisition date, these recently acquired companies had generated combined revenues of approximately 67 million. I will now turn the call over to Chad who will review our financial results in more detail.
Chad Crow:  Thank you, Floyd. Good morning, everyone. For the current quarter we reported sales of 434.9 million compared to 402.9 million for the third quarter of 2013, an increase of 32 million or 7.9%. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, we estimate sales increased approximately 6.6% due to increased sales volume which was offset 1.3% by the impact of commodity price deflation on our sales. Looking to our sales by product category, prefabricated components were 90.2 million, up 8.8% from 83 million in the third quarter of 2013. Windows and doors were 97.7 million, up [Audio Gap] up 3%. Our millwork category was 42.7 million, up approximately 14% and other building products and services were 62.6 million, up 3.4% from last year. From a product mix standpoint, our value added product categories made up a higher percentage of overall sales while lumber and lumber sheet goods and other building products and services declined as a percentage of total sales. I will also point out that revenue related to installed material and labor fell almost 5% compared to the third quarter of last year. This is representative of our willingness to log business when pricing is not acceptable, especially in the area of installed services. Our gross margin percentage was 22.5% in the current quarter, down from 23% last year, largely due to more favorable trends in market prices for commodity lumber and lumber sheet good products in the third quarter of last year. Our gross margin percentage has shown continual improvement this year and is up 90 basis points on a year-to-date basis. For the current quarter, our selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9.6 million or 13.3%. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, SG&A increased 7.5 million, of which approximately 3.3 million was attributable to higher sales volumes. The remaining 4.2 million [Audio Gap] up to 300,000 per claim and have had an usually high number of large claims hit us in the back half of this year. We also have 1 million of incremental non-cash stock comp expense related to equity grants earlier this year. Going forward, our quarterly stock comp expense will be consistent with the 2 million expense in the current quarter. While this is one of our add backs to adjusted EBITDA, it will be reflected as incremental SG&A on our P&L. We also had approximately 1.6 million of incremental expenses I would classify as infrastructure investments that remain in anticipation of stronger housing starts this year, specifically an additional 600,000 in lease expense on delivery equipment and approximately $1 million in incremental personnel cost largely related to hiring and retaining truck drivers. I want to give you a little more color on this. We have budgeted single-family starts this year to be up approximately 18% from last year, which at the time was below other industry estimates [Audio Gap] we had budgeted for. So you’re left with the choice, do we strip things down again in response to slower growth knowing that we may be left short on equipment and personnel when things pick up or do we hold to some of the incremental investments made in anticipation of stronger growth. Well, we’re doing a little of both, but the bottom line is our money says housing will continue to get better over the next couple of years, not worse, so we may be a little heavier in some areas than we need to be over the next couple of quarters in anticipation of this growth. But we’ll continue to weigh the risk reward of reducing these costs and will make adjustments that we deem necessary. And as an example, as of today we are currently having to decide what we [Audio Gap] for growth in the business. Our SG&A expenses expressed as a percentage of sales were 18.8% compared to 18% in the third quarter of 2013. The incremental unfavorable expenses I outlined increased our SG&A expense as a percentage of sales approximately 90 basis points in the current quarter. Interest expense was 6.4 million, a decrease of 1.1 million. The decrease was primarily related to 1.1 million reduction in the non-cash fair value of stock warrants issued in connection with our 2011 term loan. We recorded 500,000 of income tax expense compared to 100,000 income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2013. [Audio Gap] respectively. Absent the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate inclusive of discrete items would have been 40.7% and 25.8% in the third quarters of '14 and '13 respectively. As of September 30th, our gross federal income tax net operating loss available for carry-forward was approximately 247 million. Income from continuing operations was 8.7 million or $0.07 per diluted share compared to 13 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2013. Our adjusted EBITDA was 20.2 million or 4.7% of sales for the current quarter compared to 23 million or 5.7% of sales in the third quarter of 2013. We ended the current quarter with total liquidity of approximately 197 million consisting of 67.8 million of cash and 129.4 million in borrowing availability on our revolving credit facility. In July 2014, we borrowed 30 million under our senior secured revolving credit facility and still have 30 million outstanding as of the end of September. Operating cash flow was 29.8 million for third quarter of 2014 compared to 29.7 million last year. During the third quarter of 2014, we used approximately 24.4 million of cash on hand to acquire West Orange Lumber Company and Truss Rite, LLC and October 1st we used approximately 19.4 million to acquire Trim Tech of Austin. Capital expenditures were 2.4 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared to 4.8 million for the same quarter of 2013. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter [Audio Gap] built in the State of Texas. I’ll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd Sherman:  Thank you, Chad. We continue to believe the long-term outlook for the housing industry remains positive and that the pace of the recovery will accelerate as consumers gain more confidence in the economy and pent-up housing demand gets released. We will continue looking for ways to improve our profitability while still growing our market share, including seeking additional strategic acquisition targets in order to be even better positioned for such a rebound. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) It appears our first question comes from John Baugh with Stifel.
John Baugh – Stifel Nicolaus:  I wanted to probe on the acquisitions. You mentioned you expanded customer base. What you’re really getting both financially and strategically through the acquisitions? And I guess what I’m trying to get at is, is it simply just getting larger in good markets at an attractive financial or is there something specific about any of these companies that brings management or product line some kind of expertise?
Floyd Sherman:  Well, I think John, when you look at the acquisitions that we made with the trust manufacturing companies, those companies will enable us to become more involved with the multifamily sector of the business. That’s where the primary focus is on. We think the multifamily business will continue to be very good. It looks like the multifamily construction over next several years will be more robust than single-family. These operations will certainly allow us to gain better penetration into that particular market and in the areas where we acquired the plans. And so we look at that strategically as being very, very important to this company to get into more involved in a multifamily. We like the multifamily business where we can deliver a product without getting involved in a lot of installed work. We like trusses, we also like the millwork category and those areas in particular are of real interest to us. We also really wanted to be able to get into the Houston market. We think the Houston market can be really expanded. We are involved -- at the current time up until the acquisition, the only product [Audio Gap] Houston, Texas plant. This particular acquisition that we did in the Houston will enable us to really expand our presence. We think that this will be a very, very large market for us going forward. And this acquisition gives us a chance to enter the market with a company that had excellent reputation, very high quality people, we're well established in the market and in fact we've already acquired another facility to enlarge that company's operations within the Houston market. So we see the Houston market as a long-term major market for us to participate in. The acquisition that we did in Orlando, that gave us not only a building products distribution, but it also enabled us to get into a commercial door arena which we have not participated in at all and as well as with a Truss manufacturing operations. So that we’re not only increasing our exposure to the Orlando market with the traditional business products, but also opening up added venues for us with roof trusses and commercial door products. So, I think that pretty much sums up what we’ve done so far and this is what we’re going to continue to look for. We want to add more manufacturing content to the company. We want to add more value added products and we think that in the long term is what will produce a better earnings stream for us.
Chad Crow:  And I will just add on -- the Trim Tech acquisition certainly gives us deeper penetration into a strong market in Austin, but it also gives us a little more exposure to some high end custom builders and also comes with a very experienced management team as well.
John Baugh – Stifel Nicolaus: I’ll get into modeling details with you later, Chad, but how do we think about these 67 million of revenues and what you paid? How do we think about that in total financially for the next 12 months or so?
Chad Crow:  Obviously, the plan is to [Audio Gap] content. There is certainly very high EBITDA margin acquisitions as well. So I think there is a lot of good opportunities there. We can -- like you said, we can talk more specifics later if you like.
John Baugh – Stifel Nicolaus: And my final question is just on the housing start number. You commented that year-to-date it’s up 4% in your area. Latest quarter it was up 10% and of course your revenues are a little bit lagged to all of that. Should we take this to mean if the revenue may accelerate with the recent quarters strength in the single-family, Floyd?
Floyd Sherman: Yes. We've definitely done the restarts in our area [Audio Gap] is a lag from the time a start is taken out and until the actual construction process begins. That could be 60 to 90 days. So we think that this will -- should produce stronger results for us looking forward. But as I look at the fourth quarter, I think the fourth quarter of this year is going to resemble a lot like our third quarter. We had indicated on the last call we thought the third quarter was going to look very much like the second quarter and I think we are pretty much spot on as it turned out. As Chad said, we do feel -- and looking forward to next year, I think in our [Audio Gap] that’s what right now we’re building our budgets around. I know there are some higher numbers, some lower numbers. But our feeling is that housing is continuing to improve, continuing to strengthen. Certainly some of the actions that have been -- and the conversations that have come out of the Federal Housing Finance Agency as it relates to loosening rules on mortgages certainly is positive for us. I think it will start helping bring back the first time home buyer into the market. So we’re feeling better as we look forward in the business and I think the fourth quarter business wise, trend wise I think is going to have a lot of similarities to what we’ve seen in the third quarter. Chad, you may...?
Chad Crow:  It will obviously have some seasonality impact in Q4. I think the last year from Q3 to Q4 our sales dropped about 8% due to that seasonality effect, probably see a similar drop this year Q3 to Q4. I think our growth margins should hang in there pretty close to where they were in the third quarter of this year. We will be a little heavier, as I discussed earlier, on the operating expense side. So I would expect our Q4 EBITDA to come in somewhere pretty close to where we were in Q4 last year.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Philip Volpicelli with Deutsche Bank.
Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank:  Chad, unfortunately when you were talking about the items that caused SG&A to be up year-over-year, my line cut out. Could you just go over those once again? And then could you talk a little bit about how we should think about SG&A for 2015? Is it best to think about it on a percent of revenue or is it best to think about it as a fixed versus variable and how should those components change?
Floyd Sherman:  Excluding the impact of acquisitions in the third quarter, our SG&A increased about 7.5 million, of which about 3.3 million was attributable to higher sales volume, which again we’ve said in the past that our OpEx would be 65% to 70% variable to increases in sales volumes. So that's consistent with what we’ve said. But on top of that, we had just over 4 million of what I would consider unfavorable flex. 1.1 million of that was some unexpected group health expense cost. We had quite a rash with higher dollar claims this year. We’re probably on pace this year to be at least 2 to 2.5 times as many what we call higher dollar claims, claims over $50,000. So that was an incremental 1.1 million in the quarter. We had the 1 million of incremental stock comp expense that’s non-cash. It’s obviously an add-back to our EBITDA, but it does increase operating expense on the P&L. And then we had another 1.6 million or so that I was saying were more infrastructure type investments in delivery equipment. 600,000 of that 1.6 million is incremental lease expense on delivery equipment and about 1 million of incremental personnel cost, investments we’ve made in personnel in anticipation of the higher growth largely in the area of delivery and retaining qualified drivers. So that’s the bulk of the change in the operating expense. So some of this to a degree is an investment on future growth. I still think long-term our OpEx is going to trend very well with growth in sales. And I would probably – and you can look at it both ways. I think you can look at it at 65% to 70% variable to volume growth which obviously should drive down our OpEx as a percentage of sales in future years.
Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank: And when you look about in your regions now, clearly the third quarter starts were up much better than what you’ve seen in the first six months of the year. What’s the tone that you’re getting from your builder customers now?
Floyd Sherman:  Say that again. You were breaking up, Phil.
Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank: I was just wondering what the tone is from your builder customers now in the Southern region in terms of starts because you had a weak start to the year, a pretty good third quarter at 10.5% increase. Are you feeling that momentum to continue?
Chad Crow:  Yes. I definitely feel the momentum is continuing. The builders are feeling very confident. We're getting – we continue to get very encouraging reports from our builder customers. I think their outlook going into next year is certainly a lot better than what we saw earlier in the year and a lot more positive and I think it’s going to reflect in a continually improving housing market. Even coming off of a year that looks like it’s going to be, for the year, a relatively flat 5% growth on starts, where next year we’re really saying we think it’s going to be somewhere in that 10%, give or take a point or two, and that’s the way we’re budgeting and that’s largely based on the feelings that we’re getting from our customers and the confidence that they’re showing as I look to next year’s building plans.
Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank:  Two questions on acquisitions and I’ll pass it on. What were the EBITDA contributions from the four acquisitions you’ve completed and what's your appetite for the rest of the year in terms of how much more you might consider spending?
Chad Crow:  We are not going to disclose the EBITDA contribution on those. I think as Floyd laid out earlier, we’re -- we do certainly have an appetite to go after some additional companies especially those with the mix of value add products.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Lee Brading with Wells Fargo.
Melissa McGuire - Wells Fargo:  This is actually Melissa McGuire on for Lee Brading. Thanks for taking the question. We were looking at another good quarter growth in your prefab business and I was hoping you can discuss its impact on market share. It looks like it went down as a percentage of total mix a little from Q2. But I was hoping to get any color you have on flow-through from that business into any of your other product lines?
Chad Crow:  The demand for those products is still certainly strong and we anticipate that that demand will continue to grow. We did have a very strong quarter when you look at the windows and doors category. And sometimes when you see some growth in one category that kind of outpaces others, it obviously pushes the other down as a percentage of total. But the growth in that category is still very strong.
Melissa McGuire - Wells Fargo:  And then was curious, is that growth driving kind of increasing share of wallet with your existing customers? I think you’d mentioned in the past maybe getting in the door on the prefab side and then that expanding outward to other lines?
Chad Crow:  Well to the extent that starts haven’t been what we had hoped this year, the additional penetration on that product line with some customers hasn’t played out like we had hoped. But I think as long as we continue to see an increase in starts, that’s when the demand for that product category will continue to accelerate. So I fully expect the starts growth that there will be higher demand for that product and more penetration with existing customers.
Melissa McGuire - Wells Fargo:  And then you just mentioned the strength in the windows and doors category. I know some of the other window and door manufacturers have been announcing price increases. Is that driving a lot of the sales growth you guys are seeing or what’s -- maybe some color on the magnitude of pricing benefit versus just volume increases.
Chad Crow:  Well, it’s both. Certainly price increases, as long as we’re able to pass those along, can help the top line in those categories. So that is part of it. part of it is also, as Floyd mentioned that we have a window plant in Houston and that plant continues to perform really well and continues to take share down there. So it’s a combination of both. I don’t have any more of a breakdown of that for you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Seth Yeager with Jefferies.
Seth Yeager - Jefferies:  I don’t know if it was just me, but just as a heads up, at least at the beginning of the call it was cutting out quite a bit. I respect that you’re not giving specific margins or multiples on the acquisitions. Can you maybe talk about the percentage of the mix, like what’s commodity versus value add just roughly? I apologize if I missed that before.
Chad Crow:  Well certainly a higher weight to the value add, just trying to add it up here in my head. I would probably say it’s 60% to 70% value add versus distribution.
Seth Yeager - Jefferies:  And the multifamily exposure that you had mentioned, what sort of mix does that look with the recent additions?
Chad Crow:  Well, the multifamily is going to be almost 100% value add. That’s primarily supplying roof trusses and floor trusses.
Seth Yeager - Jefferies: And is there anything you can share around how you position your inventories going another quarter? I think there is about $10 million I guess versus the prior year. How much of that was from the acquisition versus any strategic purchases that you guys may have made?
Chad Crow:  I would say probably the bulk of it is due to the acquisitions. Commodity prices have been pretty flat this year. We really don’t expect to see a whole lot of movement in them. And so while we may have taken advantage of a few opportunities on the buy side, I think most of that’s going to be the acquisitions.
Seth Yeager - Jefferies:  And the additional group health expense, is that going to be run rated going forward or is that more of like a one-time item during the quarter?
Chad Crow:  Well, I do think we have some more larger claims that have yet to come through in the back half of the year. But no, I don’t think it’s going to be a run rate from here on. I hope when we get past this wave we’re seeing in Q4 that we’ll see that settle down a little bit.
Seth Yeager - Jefferies:  And then just last one from me in terms of cash flows. How are you prioritizing -- you obviously mentioned some acquisitions. Are there still some mothball facilities that you can bring back online that are maybe a little more accretive? And how quickly do you anticipate paying down the borrowings under the ABL?
Chad Crow:  Well we do have one or two facilities that are still mothballed. Right now the demand in those particular markets do not justify reopening those. But I really don’t see that happening in the next quarter or two. As far as the revolver goes, yeah, we’ll pay it down as soon as we can. But a lot of that will depend on that if we’re able to come across any attractive acquisitions in the mean time.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company.
Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company:  I just want to start and understand the dynamics of the market that did better. Has anything sort of meaningfully changed over the last three months in terms of labor availability or competitive behavior in the housing market as it relates to the products you supply? And I guess I’m also wondering about the decision to exit certain business which might have been attractive a couple of months ago -- or not exit certain business, but sort of pull back from certain installation business.
Floyd Sherman:  Well, the labor situation still remains very tight. The entire construction industry, and it's not just limited to our sales, is still – the very tough feeling finding the skilled labor that’s required and also being able to control the cost of that labor. But it’s not getting any worse. It hasn’t gotten any better. But it still is a major issue that we have to deal with. So I can’t really say that the labor is a deteriorating situation for us. And so I guess we’re all learning to live with it and we’re taking care of the business that we have to take care of. I really don’t believe at this point that it’s holding back construction. There may be some occasional delays that you’re running into, but that’s about the extent of it. Chad, you have any other color?
Chad Crow:  No, that’s right; it’s still pretty tough from a labor standpoint. The decision to exits on the installations -- or anytime you install something, you’re taking on a little bit of additional risk and we need to be paid for that risk. And so there's situations out there where we don’t feel like we’re getting paid for that risk and that’s why we've made the decision to reassess whether we do some of that business or not.
Floyd Sherman:  And I think that when you look at what took place in our business third quarter of this year compared to the same period last year, when you look at the important segments of our business, the value-add seg in some of the business, prefab components were up almost 9%, windows and doors up almost 16%, millwork up about 14%. They were really major increases and that was offset by only a 3% gain in lumber, lumber sheet goods and about 0.3% and 0.4% for the other building products and services which are heavily weighted towards install. We've put a lot of focus on increasing our efforts where we could get better margins, certainly in the areas of the lumber, lumber sheet goods, extremely price competitive. We recognize we've got to do this, this is still an important part of the business. But we’re willing to walk from business where we can't get what we think is fair pricing for our services and the products that we supply to the job site. The same thing holds true in install. If we don’t feel we can get the margins, the pricing that justifies the risk that we have to take on, then we’re going to pass on some of that business and we’ll wait till conditions improve. We’re not exiting from the business, we’re just redeploying some of our efforts in a direction that will give us a better positive result. So I feel really good about the gains that we made in the value-add sectors of our business. If you look at those, we had double digit increases and what brought our overall sales gain down was we backed off and we walked from a lot of dollars of business in the commodity area of the business as well as on the installed side where we just didn't feel that there was a reason to pursue it.
Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company:  I had one other question which is, the 1.6 million of SG&A that was sort of defined as infrastructure spending, is that spending that was put into place in Q3 in anticipation of sort of a second half pick up given that it didn’t hit prior quarters?
Chad Crow:  No, it was in place in Q2 as well. It was bleeding in, in Q2 and continued to come in in Q3, especially on the equipment side, some of that equipment is trickling in as the year goes on because like I said earlier, we ordered some of that stuff six months ago. And then on the wage side of it, especially as it relates to driver salary, we had major increase just like we had to pay out to our drivers' salaries in order to keep our drivers there. As you know, there is a major shortage of CDL drivers in this country. Every trucking operation is open to pirating from the competitors and drivers are absolutely essential for us and the skill that's required when you are delivering building materials to a job site and having to place materials on a job site is more difficult and takes a lot longer for people to get those skills than it is just driving point A to point B which many of the over-the-road drivers have to do in their job. So, we really have been concerned with being able to hold on to our drivers and afford, because that’s going to determine to a great extent your ability to take advantage of an expanding housing market as we go forward. Just as a salesman is important, those drivers are absolutely critical to us in getting the materials to the job site and maintaining a high level of service for the customers. So, the drivers' salaries were -- increases were very much unexpected and this has been something that really started accelerating. We started seeing a little bit of it in the second quarter and it really developed during the third quarter in particular.
Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company: So when I think about sort of the SG&A spend sequentially third quarter versus second quarter, that 1.6 million wasn’t so much of a step up sequentially, it was more the other factors that you talked about?
Chad Crow:  That’s right. It was primarily the stock comp and the group [indiscernible].
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Sam McGovern with Credit Suisse.
Sam McGovern - Credit Suisse:  Again, I may have missed this just given the phone difficulties earlier. But in terms of the pricing pressure that you guys have seen from some of your just smaller private competitors, obviously that’s driving [indiscernible] here. What do you think it takes to really get that out of the system? Is it just the pickup in demand will eventually take care of that or is it just sort of waiting guys out until they sort of dry up from liquidity and they have to get back to market? What gets you to a point where this is a little bit more balanced in terms of supply and demand?
Chad Crow:  I think it’s really a combination of both of those things. We’re definitely -- Sam, this year was a year we entered the year with very high expectations and I think so did the rest of our competitors. Everyone was anticipating a much more robust housing market. People put in CapEx, expanded their business, increased the supply and then unfortunately the market hasn’t developed to anymore close to anyone's expectation. So, there still is a lot of supply chasing the demand. As we move into more -- as the housing continues to move up, that begins to eat up that. I think people are going to be less anxious to get out and throw themselves, similar to what we did here in this company, going forward. I think that there are a lot of competitors that are really experiencing issues with getting the necessary working capital to expand their business, take care, properly servicing their customers. And so I do believe that we’re going to continue to see people fall out and pull back in this business, which will ultimately help ourselves and others who are better prepared to take advantage of an expanding housing market. But very definitely an improved housing market is the number one answer to improving and minimizing the competitive situation that we find today.
Sam McGovern - Credit Suisse: And just as a follow-up at just some of the M&A questions that were out there, can you talk a little bit about the process? Is it an auction typically? Are there a lot of other bidders? And specifically I’m curious as to one of your sort of larger national private competitors has expressed an interest in expanding more into the U.S. sales primarily through M&A. So I’m just curious whether you’re seeing any competition from them on the M&A front?
Chad Crow:  So far we've, for the most part, avoided an auction situation. And one of the deals there was a few other interested parties, but even in that deal we were able to kind of lock down a 90-day exclusivity period. So for the most part, we’ve been able to kind of get in there and do our diligence and avoid the whole auction process.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.:  I’m sorry if I missed this too given the phone situation. It was very choppy on early into the call. But, so given some of these headwinds in SG&A that you’ve detailed out, Chad, kind of looking into next year -- and I know you said longer term you expect to continue to see that, kind of as a percent of res, that ratio come down. But as we kind of look into next year though and your expectation for about 10% increase in starts, I believe is what Floyd said, in that environment and given the current situation with SG&A, would you expect that SG&A leverage to kind of return to the type of labors we’ve been seeing in periods before or is there anything going on now that would kind of meet that somewhat looking in the next 12 months?
Chad Crow:  No, my outlook hasn’t changed on our ability to leverage our OpEx, even in the next year. Like I said, some of it I think we’ve just pre-paid to a degree where our infrastructure is just out in front where the starts right now. But if we can get the improvement we see or we hope to see in starts next year, then I think it will all fall back into play.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.: And then with your approach that you – with you guys needing to or taking the approach of walking away from some of this lower margin business and if you have starts up 10% on average next year, do you think -- you’ve got market share gains in place from years past and you’ve done some acquisitions, but organically do you think in that type environment that you should exceed the end markets, the non-performing end markets as you have in the past or should we expect more of an inline type of performance?
Chad Crow:  I think it’s going to be in line to outperform to some degree, somewhere in that range. I think the acquisitions we have made are certainly going to begin to pay off in that environment. And as Floyd said earlier, I think our ability is to grow our business without the constraints of liquidity is going to be to our advantage in an environment where starts are growing. So I think kind of the base case is maintain and I think there is certainly some upside to that.
Floyd Sherman:  And I think still at the end of the day, the one thing we are going to continue to look to push our margins up. And so that – and it’s very difficult to continue to improve your margins when you have as competitive a situation as we do, And when you’re taking market share and still building your margin, that’s a tough thing to do. But it can be done and we’ve shown that. And I really think that as we go forward, we have got to get our sales position so that ultimately on a much smaller housing start basis -- and when I talk about that, I’m saying 1 million single-family starts -- I want to see our margins back up in that traditional area 24.5% to 25.5%. And so that would indicate that we have to continue to move it up as the housing market slowly expands and I think we can do that. We’ve shown this year we’ve been able to -- right now we’re 90 basis points ahead of last year on a housing market that's relatively flat and I think we can continue the same trend of improving margins and still slightly continuing to improve our market position.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.: No doubt, you guys have done a great job in this environment with your margins. Hats off to you on that. In that scenario, Floyd, where you’re talking about 24.5%, 25% type gross margins and then also kind of looking at the operating leverage that you have on SG&A, what does that mean for kind of a EBITDA margin range and at least goals that you guys have in place for that type of environment?
Floyd Sherman:  I’ll just say, certainly my belief is that we can be north of 8% EBITDA, north of even where we were at our height. But if I were to give a rate, I’d say north of where we were in 2005, 2006.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Jim Fowler with Harvest Capital.
Jim Fowler - Harvest Capital:  Your comments on the compensation to your drivers, could you give a magnitude of change? I think you mentioned that it’s hard to go up in the second quarter and started to ramp more materially in the third quarter. But could you give us some context around how much you’d increased say in the third quarter from the first quarter? And then do you think there is more to go as we go through the fourth quarter and into next year? And then even further if you might comment at what you think the directionality might be if housing market does pick up? I mean does that put more pressure on compensation for drivers before more drivers come back to the market or what’s your thoughts there?
Chad Crow:  I think if the housing starts pick up, you will continue to see [indiscernible] market. So there will probably be some ongoing compensation [Audio Gap] first quarter to third quarter?
Jim Fowler - Harvest Capital:  Yeah. This call is [indiscernible] it is very frustrating with the technology hopefully you'll fix that for next quarter. I’m just interested in when you comment on the third quarter versus the second quarter, could you put some numeracy around that [indiscernible]?
Chad Crow:  From a compensation standpoint?
Jim Fowler - Harvest Capital:  For drivers, yes.
Chad Crow:  Well, as I said, about $1 million was incremental -- that’s on a quarter-over-quarter basis. It wasn’t as big of an even impact on Q2 to Q3, but we do have over 600 drivers in this company. So, it’s an important and fairly large part of our headcount.
Jim Fowler - Harvest Capital:  And will that -- do you expect driver compensation to continue increasing in the fourth quarter and to start next year or do you think you've reset it at a level that accommodates the current market?
Chad Crow:  I'd probably be fooling myself to say there won’t be continued pressure on drivers. I think we have a lot of that behind us now. But I think there will probably still be some pressure, just not to the same degree.
Operator:  It appears we have no further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sherman for any additional or closing remarks.
Floyd Sherman:  Okay. We appreciate everyone joining the call today. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to give Chad or Marcie a call here in Dallas. Thanks and have a great day.
Operator:  That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Floyd F. Sherman: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Joining me from our management team is Chad Crow, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Marcie Hyder, Vice President and Controller. I'll start with an overview of the second quarter and then I'll turn the call over to Chad, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions. We achieved our highest quarterly sales since 2006 as we ended the second quarter of 2014 with sales of $426.5 million. We were able to achieve this high level of sales even though lumber and lumber sheet goods sales were reduced by 15.4% due to commodity deflation this quarter. We estimate that the -- this negatively impacted our total sales for the current quarter by approximately 5.8% or approximately $22.9 million. In addition, the U.S. Census Bureau reported actual single-family housing starts in the South Region, which encompasses all of our markets, increased just 6/10 of 1% compared to the second quarter of 2013. Our results are a prime example of how our market share gains of recent years and the tremendous efforts of our employees continues to have a positive impact on our business. From a sales-per-start perspective, we ended the quarter with $4,755 of sales per South Region single-family start, up from $4,464 in the second quarter of 2013 and $4,390 on a sequential quarter basis. Another highlight of the quarter was our acquisition of Slone Lumber. This acquisition affords us the opportunity to expand our presence in the Houston market, which is currently the #1 homebuilding market in the country. Evaluating attractive acquisition opportunities such as Slone will continue to be a key strategy of the company. I'll now turn the call over to Chad, who will review our financial results in more detail.
M. Chad Crow: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning, everyone. For the current quarter, we reported sales of $426.5 million compared to $398.1 million for the second quarter of 2013, an increase of $28.4 million or 7.1%. We estimate sales increased 12.9% due to increased sales volume, but was offset 5.8% due to decreased market prices for commodity lumber products. Looking at our sales by product category, prefabricated components were $91 million, up 16.4% from $78.2 million in the second quarter of 2013. Windows & doors were $90.8 million, up 16.8% from $77.8 million last year. Lumber & lumber sheet goods were $143.9 million, down 3.6%. Our millwork category was $40.1 million, up approximately 14%, and other building products & Services were $60.7 million, up approximately 5%. From a sales mix perspective, lumber and lumber sheet goods were 33.8% of total sales, down from 37.5% of total sales in the same quarter last year. As Floyd pointed out earlier, this was largely due to commodity lumber price deflation. Prefabricated components made up 21.3% of total sales this quarter, which is the highest mix of this category since the downturn began. All other product categories were fairly consistent between periods from a mix standpoint. Our gross margin percentage was 22.0% in the current quarter, up 130 basis points from 20.7% in the same quarter last year. On a sequential quarter basis, our second quarter gross margin was up 30 basis points. Improved customer pricing drove our overall margin increase. [Audio Gap]  13. The 60 basis-point increase was primarily due to the impact of commodity lumber price deflation on our sales. Based on our growth in sales volume, absent the negative impact of price deflation, our growth and operating expense was in line with our expectations. For the current quarter, our salaries and benefit expense, excluding stock compensation expense, was $48.3 million or 11.3% of sales compared to $44 million or 11% of sales last year. Delivery expense increased $1.7 million and other G&A expense increased $1.2 million, primarily a result of increased sales volumes. Interest expense was $6.5 million, a decrease of $54.6 million when compared to the second quarter of 2013. This decrease relates primarily to our second quarter 2013 refinancing, which included $4.2 million of interest expense on our then-outstanding term loan, the write-off of $6.8 million of unamortized debt discount and $2.1 million of debt issuance costs and the $39.5 million prepayment premium related to the early termination of our term loan. We recorded $200,000 of income tax expense in the second quarter of 2014 compared to $400,000 in the same quarter last year. We recorded a reduction in the after-tax noncash valuation allowance of $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared to an increase of $17 million in the second quarter of 2013. Both were related to our net-deferred tax assets. Absent the valuation allowance, our effective tax rate would have been 39.5% and 34.6% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. At the end of the current quarter, our gross federal income tax NOL available for carryforward was approximately $258 million. Income from continuing operations improved to $10.6 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to a loss of $48.3 million or a $0.50 loss per diluted share in the second quarter of 2013. On an adjusted basis, our income from continuing operations was $5.4 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared to $500,000 or $0.01 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2013. Net income for the second quarter of 2014 was $10.6 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $48.2 million or $0.50 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2013. Our adjusted EBITDA was $20.4 million or 4.8% of sales for the current quarter compared to $16.7 million or 4.2% of sales in the second quarter of 2013. We ended the current quarter with total liquidity of $194 million, consisting of $34.5 million of cash and $159.4 million in borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility. We had no borrowings during the quarter under our revolver. From a working capital perspective, our working capital as a percent of sales improved to 9.3% of sales, down from 10.2% of sales in the second quarter of 2013. Operating cash flow was negative $13.1 million for the second quarter of '14 compared to negative $60.7 million for the same period last year. The difference was primarily related to our second quarter 2013 refinancing. Also during the current quarter, we used approximately $8.7 million of cash on hand to acquire Slone Lumber company, a building materials supplier based in Houston, Texas. Capital expenditures were $6.8 million for the current quarter compared to $3.6 million for the second quarter of '13. I'll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd F. Sherman: Thank you, Chad. Though the growth in housing starts along with the commodity pricing this year has not been what most people expected, we still have been able to drive improved year-over-year results due to our market share gains and operating efficiencies. We will continue leveraging those strengths and also look for ways to expand our footprint and market share through acquisitions as we did with our recent acquisition in Houston, Texas market. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Trey Grooms from Stephens.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: First question is can you talk a little bit about lumber prices currently, or I guess more for the third quarter of this year versus where you were last year, how we need to think about the margin impact for lumber? I know you guys are tough -- facing a tough compare in the third quarter. If you could just give us a little bit of color on how to think about that as we look into the third quarter.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, I think, Trey, the -- right now, I think we're going to see a very similar quarter in the third quarter as compared to what we had in the second quarter. The -- right now, we're seeing a little bit of improvement on -- in the lumber market, but this is really being offset by even further weakness in the panel market. But all in all, I think it's going to be a very similar effect to what we had and what we saw in the second quarter. Chad, do you have any...
M. Chad Crow: Yes. Right now, I don't see anything that makes me think Q3 will look a whole lot different than the quarter we just finished. From a year-over-year basis, Trey, you're right, we do have some tough comps. Our margin in Q3 last year was 23%. I think that's going to be tough to match. This time last year, we had commodity lumber prices that were moving in our favor a little bit that gave us a little bump on gross margin. So I think Floyd is right, Q3 right now is likely going to look a lot like Q2.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: And from a top line perspective, given kind of what's going on with pricing in lumber, I mean, you guys put up a really good quarter, in my opinion, from a volume standpoint given what's going on in your end markets. But from a top line standpoint, would we expect to see a negative impact or a positive impact given the lumber? Or kind of how should we be thinking about the top line impact as well, I guess, is the question?
M. Chad Crow: Well, on a sequential quarter basis, I think it will be fairly consistent. From a year-over-year basis, I still think our volume is going to be up and so I think our sales for Q3 are certainly going to be better than Q3 last year.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And so volume has been up 12% this last quarter. Can you talk about kind of how that -- how volumes trended through the quarter and into July?
M. Chad Crow: It was remarkably consistent. Our sales per day during Q2 grew through most of the quarter, but it seems to kind of be -- the rate of acceleration seems to be slowing a little bit, and I think we've probably kind of settled into the rate of sales we're going to see in the third quarter. That's why I think, at the end of the day, Q3 is going to look a lot like Q2.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, I think, Trey, one of the -- we certainly -- one of the things that's going -- that continues to affect our overall sales is our willingness to walk from business that just doesn't meet our pricing criteria or margin criteria. That was a significant amount of business that we walked from in the second quarter and have already been making those decisions again in the third quarter. We are seeing some extremely predatory pricing that's taking place. I think it certainly has a lot to do with the level of housing and people's concern for the lack of growth in housing and there -- people have added capacity this year. The -- certainly, there was a heightened optimism as to where this year was going, and I think some people are starting to panic. We're not. We are continuing to search out, look for new customers, look for opportunities where we can get fair -- at least fair pricing under these circumstances and yet continue to grow our business. And I think when you look at the growth that Chad spoke about in our product categories such as our prefab components, the millwork categories, windows & doors, we had good double-digit growth in those markets -- those product areas, and we're going to continue to drive that type of business. And I think our people are really focusing in those areas because we have a better chance to deliver not only sales, but keep our margins up. And so I think that overall, I think we will exceed last year's third quarter in sales. The -- we may not quite hit it in margins, but I think we'll have a -- I think we'll deliver a good performance in the third quarter in spite of the headwinds that we're facing.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from Rob Hansen with Deutsche Bank.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I wanted to ask about acquisitions since you've got the Slone acquisition here. What does this take your market share in Houston to and what are you -- and then kind of broader, speaking a little more broadly, what is the most important aspect of a target that you look for? Is it market share? Is it product overlap? Customer overlap? How do you kind of think about acquisitions overall?
M. Chad Crow: Well, I would say, first of all, regarding the Houston market, this will be our first distribution facility in that market. We have a window facility there and we provide windows directly to builders. But this will be our first distribution facility there, so we'll just be scratching the surface on our market share in Houston with the Slone acquisition. But the more broad question on what do we look for in an acquisition, I think you hit a lot of those items. We look for their product mix, how much of their product is what we call a value-add product. We look at their customer base. We look, is it a market we want to gain a foothold in that we're not presently in, or maybe it's a market we're already in, we want to increase our share in. So there's quite a few things we'll look at, and I think, as Floyd was mentioning a moment ago, the pause in housing, if you will, or the deceleration of the growth that we're seeing, I think is going to be a great opportunity for us to continue to look at good acquisition opportunities. I think there's folks out there that are still struggling with liquidity and I think this slowdown this year may cause some of them to rethink whether they want to continue or possibly sell their business to folks like us with a better liquidity position, someone they can partner with to help them grow their business. So we're excited about the opportunities that may lay ahead on the acquisition side.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: What's the kind of ideal size you'd take? Or I guess, looked at another way, like what's the largest kind of size you'd take on? And I guess I'm thinking in terms of a revenue perspective.
M. Chad Crow: I think -- I'm open to anything. I wouldn't be opposed to someone with $400 million or $500 million in revenue.
Floyd F. Sherman: But I think most of what we're going to be seeing, especially when we're looking for tuck-in acquisitions, acquisitions that really strengthen our presence in a market, especially in markets that we feel have a good long-term potential, those acquisitions are going to be somewhere in the $10 million to $40 million range, $10 million to $50 million. But put several of those together and it can have a very meaningful impact on our business.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from Seth Yeager with Jefferies Investment Bank.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research: When we look at your non-lumber business, did you guys go along with the price increases that were out there for your builder windows? And can you maybe just talk about trends in gross margins for the product segments? Are you seeing some of the traction in windows & doors pricing sticking out there?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, we -- definitely on some of the product areas that you mentioned where we saw some price increases and their -- they varied quite widely. The -- but yes, we obviously implemented those price increases. And whether we always got our full margin mark up on those price increases, I would like to be able to say yes to that. That wasn't always the case, but we definitely look to avoid eating the cost. The -- unfortunately, our builder customers would very much like us to eat the cost and keep them from seeing the cost increases, but we've been able to get pass through.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research: Okay. That's good to know. And you've been having -- you've had a nice pickup in the prefab top line year-to-date. I know that historically, that was a pretty high margin business for you. Are you starting to see some expansion in margins there now that activity is picking up or -- and maybe as a follow-up, are you starting to see some competition come up from guys that may have left the market during the downturn, specific to that business?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, but definitely, we are seeing margin pick up. The -- we've done a lot to improve the efficiencies within our plant. Our people's level of performance is definitely part of the reason we're seeing improvements in margins in the component area. I would say we're about halfway back to where we were at the height, so we've made good progress in margin improvement in the component products. The demand is certainly increasing for components due to the real labor shortage issues that exist out there in the construction industry. The -- this is really playing into the -- well into the strategy that we've had of developing our component business. We have seen some -- a limited amount of entrants come, of people who had exited, have come back in a small way, but don't really see -- hasn't really had a meaningful effect to-date on our business. The -- where the pricing is very competitive, we'll back away from, but there's been some really good opportunities for us to get attractive business, and I look for that part of our business to continue expanding and improving its margin over the rest of the year.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research: And just last quick housekeeping. The -- I apologize if you -- if I missed it somewhere. The acquisition you made, did you break out any sort of revenue or EBITDA impact there? And I didn't see it broken out, but did you guys incur any additional costs that weren't broken out in the P&L related to that?
M. Chad Crow: No. We disclosed the purchase price, and any additional cost related to that acquisition would have been insignificant.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from John Baugh from Stifel.
John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: I was wondering on Slone, could you just tell us sort of the composition of their business? What are they good at? What can you improve? And yes, if there is a rough annual run rate of revenue for them.
M. Chad Crow: They're primarily a lumber distributor and they have a nice millwork facility. Their mix of millwork is pretty heavily weighted towards millwork, and so we're excited about the opportunity to get a foothold in the Houston market.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, John, one of the things this acquisition really does for us is it gives us an entrance into the market with a business that already has an established reputation, a good reputation for service and especially millwork sales. The Houston market, as you know, is -- and as we've said, is the largest single market in the country. If you look at the housing starts for last year in Houston, there was as many housing starts in Houston as I believe there was in the entire state of California. So it is a huge market. This really opens the door for us to get in with an established name, good quality people and where we can really build upon some of the relationships that we have through our window program, as well as that relations that we have with some of the major national builders from our DFW market, Austin market, San Antonio market and be able to now capitalize on that in the Houston market. So we are looking to aggressively build our business in that market.
M. Chad Crow: And just to answer your other question, their revenue last year was about $17 million.
John A. Baugh - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And Floyd, I apologize for my ignorance here, but you say enter the Houston market. You've had some revenue though, had you not, in the Houston market before? I guess you're talking more about getting a physical presence there with these guys?
Floyd F. Sherman: The Houston market through -- we have a window manufacturing plant in Houston, and that is obviously -- we intend to leverage off of that. But we also intend to leverage off of the relations that we have with many of the national builders, as I've said, in the other Texas markets where we're selling a full range of building material products, whether it be lumber and lumber sheet goods, obviously, millwork, et cetera. And so we think that the combination of our relations that we have within the state with the national builders, along with our -- the leverage that we can gain with customers with windows, plus what they have, will really help us develop a very, very attractive business position in Houston.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from Paul Betz with BB&T Capital Markets.
Paul T. Betz - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: For clarification, did you say lumber commodity inflation was down 15.4% year-over-year and it impacted sales by about $22 million?
M. Chad Crow: The price deflation impacted our lumber and lumber sheet goods category by a negative 15.4%, and that in turn, it impacted our total sales by about 5.8%.
Paul T. Betz - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And then do you have a CapEx projection for this year?
M. Chad Crow: Probably $18 million to $20 million.
Paul T. Betz - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: So that's kind of gone up, I guess, from previous estimates? So even though it has slowed down, you guys are still going to spend some more?
M. Chad Crow: Yes. It's gone up since the beginning of the year, primarily due to the relocating of a couple of facilities and some CapEx related to that.
Paul T. Betz - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And then you mentioned SG&A, part of the reasons of the increase kind of broke up, but I guess with -- as you increase sales, you're going to have increased delivery expenses, so this $76.4 million in the quarter is probably not a base level that should -- your SG&A should kind of increase as sales goes on. Is that true?
M. Chad Crow: Yes. The most variable part of our SG&A would be the delivery side. Obviously, we need more pullers, more drivers as our sales volume goes up. And then the salesmen commission, they're paid a percentage of gross profits, so that goes up as well.
Operator: Next, we'll take our question from Justin Bergner from Gabelli & Company.
Justin Bergner - G. Research, Inc.: You mentioned labor tightness as a continuing driver of demand for you guys. Can you talk about -- has that labor tightness increased over the last year as unemployment has declined? And does that sort of bode well for sort of margins once some of this extra capacity is absorbed that was put online?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. The -- from our perspective, we -- labor is probably a little bit tighter now than it was last year. We are not seeing the entrants into the construction fields for a lot of the general labor that maybe some of the other industries have seen. I'm not really sure. I'm not a true believer of the labor stats that come out of Washington, so I'm not completely in agreement that our employment situation has really improved that much. But aside and apart from that, the -- no, labor is, if anything, a little bit tighter right now than it was a year ago. We are certainly encountering a lot of temporary holdups, missed schedules and so forth because there just aren't the -- whether it be framers, whether it be the concrete people, whether it be the masonry people and other construction trades just not available to keep up with the level of housing that we're seeing, even though it's on a -- about on par with where we were a year ago. The -- our industry, it's hot out there. It's dirty. It's dusty and it seems that a lot of people don't want to come get off their couch because they can sit at home and get entitlements that allow them to have the equivalent of about a $17-an-hour job and pay no taxes and have free health care. So why the hell do they want to work out there in the mud, in the rain and everything else? But I'm sorry, I got to get on my soapbox sometimes.
Justin Bergner - G. Research, Inc.: Okay. I enjoyed that color, but I mean, it's good for Builders FirstSource to the extent it drives further prefabrication demand.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. We definitely see builders, who in the past have not been willing to consider the use of components, definitely turning to them now because it cuts down on the labor requirements to build a house.
Justin Bergner - G. Research, Inc.: Okay. My second question relates to what I perceive to be acceleration, sort of the volume metric trend per housing start in the second quarter versus the first quarter. Is that sort of an accurate assessment from your vantage point? If so, despite your being selective in your business that you're taking on, what's driving that improvement?
M. Chad Crow: Well, as I've said earlier, I think we still have a lot of competitors out there, especially the smaller ones who are struggling from a liquidity standpoint and that they don't have the liquidity to grow their business. And so that's enabling us to move in and take share. We did quote sales-per-start on a South Region basis. For whatever reason, the June numbers in the South Region lagged a little bit behind the rest of the country, so that obviously played into the sales-per-start calculation. But our sales are also driven by units under construction. So you really need to look at a combination of what's going on throughout the construction chain, from starts to units under construction, to the units being completed. But the short answer is yes, I do feel like we're still gaining market share.
Floyd F. Sherman: But I think a lot of it also comes from -- we have got -- we have been increasing the size of our sales force. I think we have a very, very good quality sales representation out in the field, and in this type of environment that definitely is an added plus to gaining new business. We opened close to 600 new accounts last quarter, so we're continuing to increase the number of people we do business with. So I think all of those things, combined with what Chad said and these other points, is the reason that we're continuing to gain market share. And yes, if you look at the housing starts on the U.S. basis, where in the South it was virtually flat with last year, on the U.S. start basis we're only up, I think, something like 1.2%. So essentially housing is kind of flattened out, and so we're not getting any real help out of a growing housing market right now.
M. Chad Crow: And I think as we discussed earlier, our strength in prefab has also allowed us to increase market share as builders are turning to those products. And if you can get in the door on the prefab side, it opens the opportunity to start selling the rest of your products as well.
Operator: And moving on, we'll take our next question from Matthew Dodson from JWest, LLC.
Matthew Dodson : Guys, congratulations on a great quarter in a tough environment.
Floyd F. Sherman: Thank you, Matthew. I really appreciate you saying that because it was one hell of a tough quarter and I think our people really delivered a heck of a good result for the challenges that we were facing.
Matthew Dodson : Can you help me understand a little bit about your sales trends that you talked about earlier in the call? I think you guys said that it accelerated through the quarter, and then it moderated. Was that an acceleration month-over-month or was that year-over-year? I believe in April, you were up 8% to 10%, and you finished only at, what, 7.1%?
M. Chad Crow: It was both. On a sales-per-day basis, we saw our sales increasing during the first part of the quarter and then, as we said earlier, it kind of started to flatten out. And that's kind of what we're seeing right now.
Matthew Dodson : And so it's kind of up in the 6% to 7% range in June? Is that fair?
M. Chad Crow: Right.
Floyd F. Sherman: Right.
Matthew Dodson : June and July, excuse me, perfect. And then I assume with the labor shortage, your prefab is going to grow faster than your overall business, as with your millwork? What kind of delta is there in your margins between your overall margins and then your prefab and millwork?
M. Chad Crow: In a normal environment, you can see prefab being 600 to 800 basis points higher than our overall gross margin. Right now, it's not quite that big a spread. As Floyd mentioned, we've not regained all of our margin loss back from where we were pre-downturn. But right now, it's probably 200 to 400 basis points.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, and the millwork and components, the prefab, are very similar.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from Philip Volpicelli from Deutsche Bank.
Sean Wondrack: Sean Wondrack here on the call for Phil. Just going back to Rob's question on acquisitions, is there a leverage ceiling at which point you would not undertake an acquisition?
M. Chad Crow: I think as time goes on, we'll look at it on what our feeling is on housing over the next couple of years combined with what our overall liquidity is. There's obviously a minimum amount of liquidity we're going to want to keep in the company, so we're not going to go crazy.
Sean Wondrack: Right. Is there a range of, like, minimum liquidity you can provide, whether that's $30 million to $50 million, just in order of magnitude?
M. Chad Crow: Well, historically, we've kind of used $50 million as kind of our minimum. But again, we'd have to look at that in relation to our outlook on housing, as well.
Sean Wondrack: Right. No, that makes sense. And is there a target leverage profile, I mean, that you'll seek out in the next few years?
M. Chad Crow: No, I wouldn't say there's an absolute target. We're just going to evaluate our liquidity over the next couple of years in light of where we think housing is heading and what opportunities we have to grow the business from an acquisition standpoint or a greenfield standpoint.
Sean Wondrack: Okay. All right. And then shifting focus, we've been hearing that non-res construction has been accelerating in Florida and in other pockets of the South. What do you think the reason for the slowdown in growth in the res side has been? And is there a big variance in single-family home demand from state to state?
M. Chad Crow: What was the last part of your question?
Sean Wondrack: Is there a big variance in single-family home demand from state to state? Obviously, Texas is very strong.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, there's quite a large difference. We're seeing a lot of strength in Texas. Florida has definitely been coming back. It's kind of flattened out during some of the earlier months, but seems again to be rebounding. The Atlanta market, definitely coming back, but at the same time, we've seen a real falloff in the Baltimore, Washington market. South Carolina is weak yet as compared to North Carolina. So -- but Texas and Florida, still the states for us that have the most activity and the biggest increases going on.
Sean Wondrack: Okay. And do you anticipate single-family starts to pick up in the second half of the year here?
Floyd F. Sherman: We're -- the -- overall, we really anticipate -- our view is right now, it's going to be flat. Our projection for the year at best, I really don't see on an overall U.S. single-family actual start rate, maybe 650,000, but I think it's going to be pretty hard. We've got a -- that would mean almost an 8.5% increase in a start rate over what we've seen in the first half. And right now, I can't really say that I see anything that is going to really meaningfully improve the housing start rate. But I think it's going to be more of the same.
Sean Wondrack: And is there anything in particular that you think is really holding back demand? Is it mortgages? Is it employment?
Floyd F. Sherman: I think -- I definitely feel employment has a lot to do with it. I think the ability of the first-time homebuyer to be able to get the financing so that they can again start participating in home ownership, I think that's probably the weakest part of housing right now. I think that you've got a lot of the younger-age-group buyer who's getting out of school, who's carrying a lot of student debt and other forms of debt. I think it's -- right now, they're not in a position to get in the market or have the necessary qualifications for a mortgage and they're choosing to go into the rental market. And the -- but I think there's also -- some of the builders are also having lot shortages, and they have to wait for development to catch up of lots. So I think it's a combination of many factors from where we see.
Sean Wondrack: Right. And do you think that's more specific to the South? Because, I mean, the rest of the country is still continuing to grow on the res side. That's why I'm just a little curious why the South is so much weaker.
Floyd F. Sherman: Well, when you say the rest of the parts of the country are growing, if you say 1%, on an overall basis, that's not a heck of a lot of growth. I'm sure there are states where there are -- or within a state that there may be pockets where the growth is, but I don't think the South is a great deal different than -- the South Region is a great deal different than the other markets in the country. The -- when I look down over the numbers on -- with the other regions on single-family, Northeast for the time is down 4% for the year, is down 4.7%. Midwest is up, but that's primarily in those states where there's a lot of frac-ing, oil and gas work going on and the housing shortages. But then South was down 1/10 of 1 point, and West was up a little over 3% for the year. So on an overall basis, I don't see that there's a great deal of difference from region to region in the country.
Sean Wondrack: Right. No, I mean, you also have a lot of the growth in the Gulf Coast region coming from the petrochem and a lot of the non-res that's going on there. But I appreciate your color.
Operator: And at this time, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. We'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Floyd F. Sherman: Okay. We appreciate everyone joining the call today. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to give Chad Crow or Marcie Hyder a call here in Dallas. Thank you, again.
Operator: Thank you. That will conclude today's conference. We thank everyone for their participation.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-04-25 11:00:00) =====
Executives:  Floyd Sherman – CEO Chad Crow – SVP and CFO Marcie Hyder – VP and Controller
Analysts:  Trey Grooms – Stephens Incorporated Rob Hansen – Deutsche Bank Jack Kasprzak – BB&T Justin Bergner – Gabelli & Company Matthew Dodson – JWest LLC 
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Your host for today’s call is Mr. Floyd Sherman, Chief Executive Officer.

Floyd Sherman: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me from our management team is Chad Crow, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Marcie Hyder, Vice President and Controller. I’ll start by giving a brief recap of our first quarter and then turn the call over to Chad who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we’ll take your questions. Despite the extreme winter weather that slowed construction activity across our markets and housing starts at relatively flat, we successfully grew sales and adjusted EBITDA on a year-over-year basis. Our sales increased 8.2% and adjusted EBITDA increased 59% when compared to the first quarter of 2013. For the same time period, the U.S. Census Bureau reported actual single-family starts for the south region declined slightly by one tenth of 1%. In addition, commodity deflation had a negative impact on our sales for the quarter. Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods prices were on average, 14% lower compared to a year ago, which we estimate negatively impacted sales for the current quarter by 2% to 3%. From a sales per start perspective, we ended the current quarter with $4,357 for South region, single-family start, up from $4,021 in the first quarter of 2013. For the record, during the year, worst of the weather, there were days where we had 75% to 80% of our locations closed. On a companywide basis, I estimate that we lost 5 to 6 total ship days which equates to about 8% to 9% of our total ship days for the quarter. I believe our employees did a great job managing through the difficult weather conditions and again delivered strong financial results for the quarter. I’ll now turn the call over to Chad, who will review our financial results in more detail.
Chad Crow: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning everyone. For the current quarter, we reported sales of $345.9 million compared to $219.7 million for the first quarter of 2013, an increase of $26.2 million or 8.2%. We estimate sales increased 10.5% due to increased sales volume and was offset 2.3% due to decreased market prices for commodity lumber products. Breaking down our sales by product category, Prefabricated Components were $70.5 million, up approximately 16% from $60.8 million in the first quarter of 2013. Windows & Doors were $76.3 million, up 19.9%. Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods were $115.5 million, down 1.1%. Our Millwork category was $33.5 million, up approximately 15% and Other Building Products & Services were $50.1 million up approximately 2%. From a sales mix perspective, Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods were 33.4% of total sales, down from 36.5% of total sales in the same quarter last year, largely due to lower market prices for commodity lumber products. All of the product categories were fairly consistent between periods from a mix standpoint although weighted more towards value added products versus a year ago. Our gross margin percentage was 21.7% in the current quarter, up 220 basis points from 19.5% in the same quarter last year. Our gross margin percentage increased largely due to improved customer pricing as well as less inter quarter price volatility in the commodity lumber markets compared to the first quarter of 2013. Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods prices rose sharply during the first quarter of 2013 while prices fell during the first quarter of 2014. From an SG&A perspective, the disruptions caused by the severe winter weather negatively impacted our operational efficiencies as selling, general and administrative expenses expressed as a percent of sale increased to 20% in the first quarter of 2014 compared to 19.1% last year. On a sequential quarter basis, total SG&A dollars were flat with the fourth quarter of 2013. For the current quarter, our salary and benefit expense, excluding stock compensation expense, was $43.5 million or 12.6% of sales compared to $37.7 million or 11.8% of sales last year. Delivery expense increased $1.5 million and other G&A expenses increased $1 million, primarily a result of increased sales volumes. Interest expense was $8.8 million, a decrease of $3.7 million, when compared to the first quarter of 2013, as a result of our second quarter 2013 refinancing. For the current quarter, interest expense included $6.7 million related to our senior secured notes due 2021, a $1.2 million non-cash fair value adjustment related to outstanding stock warrants and $600,000 of amortized deferred loan cost. Interest expense in the first quarter of 2013 included $6.5 million related to our term loan and $4.5 million related to our floating rate notes due 2016. In addition, interest expense in the first quarter of ‘13 included $400,000 non-cash fair value adjustment related to stock warrants and $600,000 of amortized debt discount. We recorded $100,000 income tax benefit in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $300,000 of income tax expense in 2013. We recorded an increase in the after-tax non-cash valuation allowance of $1 million and $4.4 million in the first quarters of 2014 and 2013 respectively. Both were related to our net deferred tax assets. Absence of valuation allowance, the effective tax rate would have been 33.1% and 36.3% in 2014 and 2013 respectively. At the end of the current quarter, our gross federal income tax NOL available for carry-forward was approximately $270 million. Loss from continuing operations improved to $3.3 million or $0.03 loss per diluted share compared to $11.6 million or $0.12 loss per diluted share in the first quarter of 2013. Excluding the fair-value adjustment for stock warrants and the tax valuation allowance our adjusted loss from continuing operations with $1.1 million or a $0.01 loss per diluted share compared to $6.8 million or $0.07 loss per diluted share for the first quarter of 2013. Our net loss was $3.4 million or $0.03 loss per diluted share for the current quarter, compared to $11.8 million or $0.12 loss per diluted share for the first quarter of 2013. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.6 million or 2.5% of sales for the current quarter compared to $5.4 million or 1.7% of sales in the first quarter of 2013. We were cash flow positive during the quarter and ended with total liquidity of $223.9 million consisting of $62.8 million of cash and $161.1 million in borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility. We had no borrowings during the quarter under our revolver and no interest payment due on our 2021 notes. Our working capital as a percent of sales, remain fairly consistent at 10.5% of sales. Operating cash flow was positive $13.8 million for the first quarter of 2014 compared to negative $25.2 million for the first quarter of 2013. The difference primarily attributable to our improved financial performance and reduction in working capital during the first quarter of 2014. Capital expenditures were $5.3 million for the first quarter of ‘14, compared to $1 million for the same quarter of 2013. I’ll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd Sherman: Thank you, Chad. Harsh weather disrupted construction activities during the first quarter. However, we believe the underlying demand for new housing remains strong and with the weather problems from earlier this year behind us, the pace of construction should accelerate over the coming months. We also remain confident in our ability to use our scale of market share to continuing delivering strong financial results. I’ll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Mr. Sherman, pardon the interruption. This is the operator, we can’t hear your audio any longer.
Marcie Hyder: Can you hear us?
Operator: Yes, I can hear you now.
Floyd Sherman: We’re ready for Q&A.
Operator: Okay, thank you very much. (Operator Instructions). And we’ll take our first question from Trey Grooms of Stephens Incorporated.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Incorporated: First of all, can you maybe give us a little bit more color on how demand trended as the quarter progressed. I know the weather was an issue obviously. But as the quarter progressed, how demand has looked and then also how has it been trending in April, if you could give us any color there?
Floyd Sherman: Trey, this is Floyd. January and February were flat, the slight improvement over 2013, March we saw a pretty good up-tick and we finished March on a really good note. April, while it is better than it was in March, and better than April of a year ago. It’s a little bit short of our expectations of what we were hoping we would see. It’s still good but maybe not as strong as we were hoping. We thought we would see a real surge that after following the bad weather. Part of the issue, I think that we are facing, maybe we got a little bit ahead of ourselves, is that it takes a while for some of the construction sites to dry out so you can get back on the building side. So I think that probably is slowed us down a little bit. But we’re encouraged with what we see. We’d always like to see things stronger but April is – we’re going, we’ll finish ahead of last April. I think the quarter will probably follow the same trends as what we’ve seen. I think it looks like housing, instead of a real hockey stick rebound is probably looking more like a gradual improvement. And we’re going to have some fall in the market. And I think the – we’ll continue to turn in and pull results.
Chad Crow: Trey, just to add a little.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Incorporated: It’s said to say that I mean, you are seeing some improvement year-over-year. And you said April is better than March.
Floyd Sherman: Yes.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Incorporated: Okay. Is your expectation know that with – as things dry out and so forth that you should see May better than April?
Floyd Sherman: Yes, I would definitely – I definitely feel that would be the case.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Incorporated: Okay. And then, Chad, if you could comment on given where the lumber prices are – where you guys think volume is trending. How should we be thinking about gross margins in the quarter relative to of course – lumber looks like it might be finding a bottom here, I haven’t seen the numbers today yet, but for this week. But your thoughts on that and how to think about lumber prices and margins that would be helpful?
Chad Crow: And I’ll add a little bit more color on sales as well. Through today, we’re trending about 8% to 10% over last April for the current month to date that I give you any additional color on what we’re seeing currently.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Incorporated: And that’s volume, Chad, just to be clear?
Chad Crow: No, that’s just dollars.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Incorporated: That’s dollars. And that’s on a lumber price environment that’s down year-over-year?
Chad Crow: That’s correct.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Incorporated: Okay.
Chad Crow: We see the same lumber numbers you do. And we’re all certainly hoping that lumber has found a bottom and we’ll start ticking back up as we’ve said before. We like higher lumber prices that can certainly benefit our EBITDA flow-through. So, anytime we have a depressed lumber price environment like we’ve had in the first quarter, it does hurt our overall results. From a margin perspective, really all I can right now is through April we’re consistent with or up slightly from our Q1 gross margin. Certainly our margin in Q1 was hurt a little bit by volume, probably in the neighborhood of 20 basis points or so. So, any up-tick in volumes is going to help and as we’ve said in the past just a healthier building environment in general is going to help. So, hopefully we’ll continue to see the positive trends that we’ve started seeing in March and April and continue to accelerate through the Spring and Summer.
Floyd Sherman: And Trey, I think some encouraging signs at least for me. The last couple of days, some of the large builders have been giving their first quarter numbers. And for the first time for the last several quarters, as you know, there are number of, when you look at by unit count, their new contracts were going down, the new sale contracts, the backlog was coming down. But now that same story will be reversed and they all were reporting a nice up-tick in new orders. And the backlog growing in that that can only be a very positive sign for us as we look down the road.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Incorporated: Okay. And one just last question, just more on just to get some clarity. So, lumber segment was down 1% year-over-year and you put in the release that on average I guess it’s – lumber pricing being down 14%. Is that the read through there that volume in the segment was up 13%, is that how you take that or is there other moving pieces there?
Chad Crow: Volume was certainly up, and but as we said, it was offset certainly by price. So yes, I think that that’s directionally correct.
Trey Grooms – Stephens Incorporated: Okay, thanks a lot guys. And good luck.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Rob Hansen of Deutsche Bank.
Rob Hansen – Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Floyd, I just wanted to get your thoughts on lumber prices. You’ve always had a good kind of read into what’s going on. And where you kind of see them added from here in terms of the kind of supply and demand dynamics?
Floyd Sherman: We, my view on lumber, I think we as Chad said earlier, really feel robbed that we’ve seen the bottom. We’ve seen a nice improvement on the Southern Yellow Pond, especially on the west side, here in the last week. Prices really started moving up, not quite as strong on the east side. SPF, market looks like it’s really trying to firm up and that’s very encouraging, that’s the first encouraging signs to me that I’ve seen. It looks like the order rate is definitely improving. I don’t think anybody is starting to jump in and take long positions yet. But they certainly have stepped up their buying activity. The mills are showing a lot less willingness to the back half of the prices. And I think that’s encouraging. I think that indicates that their order files are getting a much better shape. One of the issues that you have still is the transportation railcars out of Canada continue to be a nightmare. The allocation of cars are definitely still going to – the agriculture, grain movement as well as the oil shipments. The lumber guys continually are still confirming with not being able to get cars and not being able to get cars moved anywhere quickly as they would like. But I spent – I think we’re going to start monotonously a sharp rebound on lumber but definitely an improving pricing structure as we go into the summer months. Unless BS is certainly starting to firm up, it looks like the LSP market is continuing to interrupt a couple of box at a time, per thousand on a weekly basis. So, I view overall the commodity markets are going to be better than what we have seen probably not anywhere near at the highs that they got to in the first quarter or first four months of last year.
Rob Hansen – Deutsche Bank: Okay, that’s great color. And we probably shouldn’t – and kind of thinking about it from a quarterly perspective, we probably shouldn’t really expect much – too much of like – of a gross margin hit in terms of what you’re buying and structuring the contracts. Is that a good way to put it as well or?
Floyd Sherman: Yes, I think so. Chad, anything you want to add to that?
Chad Crow: No, I think in that type of environment of prices slowly recovering that should not be a negative to our gross margin.
Rob Hansen – Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then, I wanted to see if I could I get a little bit of color in terms of the health of the construction market in the South, a bit single family starts were flat during the quarter. How did true volumes look overall for you guys, and was the out-performance driven by an increase of sales within existing customers that you gave share, how did that all kind of look?
Floyd Sherman: Well, our gain is coming yes, we have been increasing our share, the wallet with existing customers. But we’ve continued to add new customers at pretty similar rate to what we’ve been doing in the past. I think for the quote, they were close to 500 unique new customers that we sold to for the first time. That continues to be a very important part of the direction – the sales direction of our company. And that definitely contributed to our increasing our market share. So it’s a combination really of both of those factors.
Rob Hansen – Deutsche Bank: Okay, well, that’s all I had for now. I’ll talk to you guys later. Thanks.
Floyd Sherman: Thanks Rob.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Jack Kasprzak of BB&T.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T: Thanks, good morning guys.
Floyd Sherman: Good morning.
Chad Crow: Good morning.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T: Hi, just one small question I guess or small item. Shares outstanding, diluted shares in the fourth quarter were about 99.5 when you reported in the first quarter, they were 97.6. Is that just a function of slipping into a small loss from Q4 to Q1?
Chad Crow: Yes, that’s right.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T: So, we go back to a profit in the season’s stronger period, we should probably its 99.5 or so for the fully diluted share-count?
Chad Crow: Yes, I think that’s right.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T: Okay. And some other, your window sales were strong in the quarter, some of the window manufacturers we know have announced price increases, have you guys seen that that was benefit do you think, your window sales in the quarter?
Floyd Sherman: There was some benefit Jack, we really – the timing of the increase of when it went into effect, that was partially responsible but overall our window sales again are – we put a lot of emphasis on that product category. And I think it’s more due to the fact that we continue to take market share and continue to take business in that category. And I think with our service levels with our, certainly I think our competitive pricing and the manufacturers have kept competitive position in the market. And so that’s more than I think those are the reasons that have accounted our gain in the window market share percentages.
Chad Crow: And our window playing at Houston continues to perform extremely well that manufacturer for Texas.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T: Right, great, okay. And the press release your comments on lumber pricing I appreciate Floyd, the press release also mentions improved customer pricing. I mean, there is something I think you guys have talked about for a while for the downturn. Can you just elaborate maybe there is, is this just to ongoing discipline by you guys or people sort of filling up and feeling better about overall pricing environment in terms of what maybe the competitors are doing or maybe some color there would be appreciated?
Floyd Sherman: We are still saying that very, very competitive ramp there. I think everybody went into the first quarter this year, expecting a housing market that was going to be mirroring what we saw in the first quarter of first half of last year. And everybody’s expectations for continual improvement and housing, is certainly there. So, as a result, you’re beginning increase your output capabilities. And the increase didn’t materialize and so, we have been saying no to a lot of business that before we would have taken, where we just are not yet in the pricing that we feel that we can live with. And so, I think we’ve been – ourselves better margins and certainly that went for the commodity products as well as other products. So I attribute most of the pricing gains to our people being very disciplined in what they’re doing in the market and willingness to walk from substandard business. Chad, anything you want to add to that?
Chad Crow: No, I agree. I just echo Floyd’s comments. Our guys are doing a really nice job, kind of holding the line on pricing. And when we need to we’ll pass on the pricing. I think what Floyd said is dead on.
Jack Kasprzak – BB&T: Okay. Thanks very much guys, I appreciate it.
Operator: And we’ll take our next questions from Justin Bergner of Gabelli & Company.
Justin Bergner – Gabelli & Company: Hi, good morning Chad, good morning Floyd.
Floyd Sherman: Good morning.
Chad Crow: Good morning.
Justin Bergner – Gabelli & Company: My first question related to the I guess matter of I guess lag time between housing starts and your activity. One of the major home improvement companies yesterday talked about an increasing lag time between starts in their activity. What are you seeing in your business in terms of that lag?
Chad Crow: I would guess its two to three months maybe it’s probably a little slower in the first quarter due to the weather. But I think we’ve got to settle into a two or three month lag.
Justin Bergner – Gabelli & Company: And that was compared to sort of normal lag time that’s a little bit less in that or about the same?
Chad Crow: Well, that’s certainly less of a lag then I would have said a couple of years ago. And probably back at the peak of housing in ‘05, ‘06, you were probably talking one to two month lag.
Justin Bergner – Gabelli & Company: Okay. So, two to three months is probably a decent number to use going forward?
Chad Crow: I think so.
Justin Bergner – Gabelli & Company: Okay. And can you give an estimate as to internal estimate as to sort of how much weather impacted the dollars per housing start that you may have realized in the first quarter to the extent that there were starts underway but you just weren’t able to sort of do the activity that you wanted to do?
Chad Crow: No, I think the best way to calculate that might be just to take our average sales per day in the first quarter. And based on the five or six days that Mr. Floyd said we were closed. So it probably would have been I don’t know another $25 million or so let’s say relatively may have had without the weather issues. So, you could divide that by the number of starts.
Justin Bergner – Gabelli & Company: Okay. That’s very helpful. And then, just finally, yeah, I was certainly expecting that without the weather, your dollars per start would have looked better. I mean, conversely if I sort of look at housing starts in a lag basis, towards the growth in dollars per housing start, doesn’t look quite as strong as sort of the 8%, is that sort of a fair assessment that you observed in your own data?
Chad Crow: I haven’t to be honest I haven’t looked at that in that much detail. I can tell you the numbers that go into these queues in the first quarter, whether you look at starts or units under construction. The bottom line is activity, construction activity came to a grinding halt to a large degree on a lot of markets for multiple days. So, I think it’s going to be tough to try to read too much into some of those numbers to be honest with you.
Justin Bergner – Gabelli & Company: Okay. But sort of a clean number without sort of the impact of weather probably would have booked decently a better than the plus 8% dollars per start?
Chad Crow: Right.
Justin Bergner – Gabelli & Company: Okay. Great. Thank you very much for giving that.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And we’ll take our next question from Matthew Dodson of JWest LLC.
Matthew Dodson – JWest LLC: Hi Chad. Can you just help us understand a little bit better kind of the sequential movement in your gross margins? So, in the fourth quarter, your gross margins were 22.4, they were 21.7. And you had lesser the commodity, the Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods, as a mix. So, can you help us understand just maybe why that happened and then – do you take gross margins there kind of active level or do they rebound back above 22?
Chad Crow: I think as volume picks up and the construction activity picks up in the coming quarters, I wouldn’t fully expect to see our margins improve. During the first quarter, the follow-up in volumes certainly had a negative impact on our gross margin. And as Floyd mentioned there were several days we were closed. And even days, some days when we were open, we weren’t as productive as we could have been. And probably we reassigned the times to clear snow off the yard and up the drives and walk-a-ways and builders were holding up shipments, we couldn’t ship orders to the job sites due to the weather. So, I would fully expect gross margins to improve as we move into the second and third quarters.
Matthew Dodson – JWest LLC: Okay, got it. And then, can you help me understand just a little bit that you guys did a phenomenal job on the SG&A, only at about $800,000 sequentially. How do we think about kind of the SG&A dollars going forward sequentially over the next couple of quarters?
Floyd Sherman: Well, it was a rough quarter for us from an efficiency standpoint, certainly with disruption caused by the weather and managing our workforce, very difficult during the first quarter. And also on a sequential quarter basis, as I’ve said this time every year, we get hit with additional payroll taxes in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. And then we have to restart our vacation accruals, the first part of the year which we don’t have in Q4. Those two items can bind with the $3 million delta Q1 to Q4. So, the fact that we were flat on a dollar basis versus Q4, I think we get a pretty damn good job of managing it, given everything we were dealing with. Going forward, I fully expect to start driving that operating expense down as a percentage of sales. And I still think, I still think we’ll be lower to percentage of sales than we were last year. It was just a difficult quarter to manage it from an efficiency standpoint.
Matthew Dodson – JWest LLC: Okay. And then just a last question, to get a little clarification again. So, you said you guys were up about 8% year-over-year in April. And then, you expect an acceleration of that percentage in May and June, correct, is that right?
Chad Crow: Well, we certainly expect volume to accelerate.
Matthew Dodson – JWest LLC: Right, that’s normal seasonality right, I mean, May and June go up, so I’m just?
Chad Crow: No.
Matthew Dodson – JWest LLC: You think that year-over-year, do you see an acceleration in the year-over-year percentage?
Chad Crow: Yes, I think we’re all kind of waiting to seeing. And a lot of that would depend on housing activity of the year-over-year comparisons, and the commodity lumber prices are going to have an impact as well. So, I do think we’ll continue to see sales accelerate but to what degree and how that’s going to look on a year-over-year basis, I think we’re all just kind of waiting to see.
Matthew Dodson – JWest LLC: Okay, great. Thanks Chad, I appreciate it.
Chad Crow: You bet.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We have no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn it back over to our speakers for any other remarks.
Floyd Sherman: Okay. We appreciate everyone joining the call today. If you have any follow-up questions, please don’t hesitate to give either Chad or Marcie a call here in Dallas. Thanks and have a great day.
Operator: And that does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Floyd F. Sherman: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013 earnings call. Joining me from our management team is Chad Crow, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Marcie Hyder, Vice President and Controller. After I give a brief recap of our fourth quarter and fiscal year, I'll turn the call over to Chad, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions. Our fiscal 2013 concluded with a strong fourth quarter. Our top line growth of 28.3% for the quarter once again exceeded the increase in residential construction activity, as actual single-family housing starts in the south region increased 14.2% and single-family units under construction increased 23.9%. In addition, our fourth quarter sales for U.S. single-family housing start were $2,576 and were $4,948 on a south region single-family start basis, both of which are the highest quarterly figures in our company history. Our gross margin percentage increased to 22.4% for the current quarter, up from 20.2% for the fourth quarter of 2012. Higher sales volume and better customer pricing were the primary drivers of our overall margin improvement in what is still a very competitive pricing environment. We ended fiscal 2013 with sales of approximately $1.5 billion, a 39.2% increase over fiscal year 2012 sales. From a U.S. single-family housing starts perspective, 2013 ended with 618,400 actual starts, up 15.5% over 2012, but still well below the 50-year average of 1 million single-family starts. When coupled with the ongoing recovery in U.S. housing, our market share gains of recent years have helped accelerate the pace of our sales growth. In turn, this enabled us to end fiscal 2013 with positive earnings before taxes of approximately $6.8 million when excluding the effects of charges related to our May 2013 debt refinancing. I'll now turn the call over to Chad who will review our financial results in more detail.
M. Chad Crow: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning, everyone. For the current quarter, we reported sales of $369.1 million compared to $287.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2012, an increase of $81.5 million or 28.3%. We estimate sales had increased 26.5% due to increased sales volume and 1.8% due to price. Breaking down our sales by product category, Prefabricated Components were $72 million, up approximately 36% from $52.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Windows & Doors were $82.8 million, up approximately 33%. Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods were $123 million, an increase of $26.6 million. Our Millwork category was $35.2 million, up 24.3% and Other Building Products & Services increased $8.4 million to $56.1 million. From a sales mix perspective, Prefab Components were 19.5% of total sales, up from 18.4% in the fourth quarter last year. We continue to see increased demand for this product category, as homebuilders continue to look for ways to reduce construction cycle time while dealing with labor shortages on job sites. Other Building Products & Services were down slightly, primarily due to the roofing component within this category. We saw no significant changes in mix on our remaining product categories. Our gross margin percentage was 22.4% in the current quarter, up 220 basis points from 20.2% in the same quarter last year. Our gross margin percent increased largely due to improved customer pricing, with the remainder due to leveraging fixed cost within costs of goods sold and improved sales mix. From an SG&A perspective, we continue to leverage our operating expenses as selling, general and administrative expenses expressed as a percent of sale decreased to 18.8% in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 20.1% last year. For the current quarter, our salaries and benefits expense, excluding stock comp expense, was $43.6 million or 11.8% of sales compared to $36.8 million or 12.8% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2012. Delivery expense increased $2.1 million and other general and administrative expenses increased $2.5 million, primarily a result of increased sales volumes. Interest expense for the current quarter was $8.6 million, a decrease of $2.4 million, which relates primarily to our refinancing in the second quarter of 2013. For the current quarter, interest expense included $6.6 million related to our outstanding senior secured notes due 2021, a $900,000 noncash fair value adjustment related to stock warrants issued in connection with our previous term loan and $600,000 of amortized deferred loan cost. Interest expense in the third [ph] quarter of 2012 included $5 million related to our term loan and $4.5 million related to our floating rate notes due 2016. In addition, interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2012 included a $600,000 noncash fair value adjustment related to stock warrants issued in connection with the term loan and $400,000 of amortized debt discount. We reported $200,000 of income tax expense in the fourth quarter of both 2013 and 2012. We recorded a reduction of our after-tax noncash valuation allowance of $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. We recorded an increase in the after-tax noncash valuation allowance of $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, both were related to our net deferred tax assets. At the end of the current quarter, our gross federal income tax net operating loss available for carryforward was approximately $268 million. Income from continuing operations was $4.6 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared to a loss from continuing operations of $11 million or a $0.12 loss per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding facility closure costs, the fair value adjustment for stock warrants and the tax valuation allowance, our income from continuing operations was $3 million or $0.03 per diluted share for the current year quarter. Excluding facility closure cost, litigation settlement proceeds, the fair value adjustment for stock warrants and the tax valuation allowance, our loss from continuing operations were $7.2 million or an $0.08 loss per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2012. Our net income was $4.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share for the current quarter compared to a $0.13 loss per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was $16.2 million in the current quarter compared to $3.4 million last year. For fiscal year 2013, adjusted EBITDA was $61.3 million, up $54.9 million over fiscal year 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $6.4 million. We were cash flow positive during the current quarter despite making the first required semi-annual interest payment of $13.5 million related to our 2021 notes. We ended the year with liquidity of $211.8 million, consisting of $54.7 million of cash and $157.1 million in borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility. We had no borrowings during the quarter under our revolver. Our working capital as a percent of sales also improved from 10.9% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 9.6% of sales in the current quarter. Operating cash flow was $8.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 and working capital was flat during the quarter. Operating cash flow was negative $18 million for the fourth quarter of 2012, which included a $12.2 million increase to working capital. Net capital expenditures were $4.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to $1.2 million for the same quarter of 2012. I'll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd F. Sherman: Thank you, Chad. We certainly closed 2013 on a strong note as indicated by our fourth quarter results. However, winter weather across our markets thus far in 2014 has caused disruptions and has delayed construction activity. Nevertheless, we still believe a growing demand for housing exists in our markets and that once the weather abates, increased construction activity will return. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: I'll have to say, solid quarter given the pretty challenging weather in some of the fourth quarter as well. I guess, Chad, first off on -- sequentially, from 1Q to 4Q, we typically -- you guys typically see a slight sequential pickup in sales, but like Floyd mentioned here and as we've all seen, weather has definitely been much worse in the beginning of this quarter here, January and into February, than it was in the 4Q. With that being the case, should we be expecting for this quarter, for 1Q, sales to be down sequentially from 4Q to 1Q?
Floyd F. Sherman: Trey, this is Floyd, and I'll answer that. I think -- let me just kind of walk you through this. Through February to date, we estimate it's going to have -- the weather probably is going to put us 10% to 15% off of our expected pace. If we can make up half of that shortfall in March, which I think is reasonable because we certainly have the capacity to do so, that will leave us somewhere 5% to 7% off our expected pace for the quarter. The -- we think for the quarter that we will still outperform housing start activity in last year's first quarter. So all in all, I think that under the circumstances that we've had to deal with, our performance for the quarter will be pretty darn good. I can tell you that on days where we weren't contending with the weather, our shipping volume was about what we had anticipated or budgeted it to be. I think this indicates housing construction activity is still very good and that the weather is a major factor behind the shortfalls and with weather, the good part about that is you don't lose the business, you only get it delayed. I think that we certainly have a chance of coming out close to the quarter, maybe slightly ahead of the quarter of where we were last year. I would give the range of somewhere 0% to 10%, something in that magnitude. Chad, what -- you're playing with the numbers.
M. Chad Crow: Yes, I would say the way things look today, we'll be plus or minus 5% of where we were in Q4.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay, all right. That's very helpful. And then just as a follow up to that, Floyd, on some of the commentary you had there, what are your thoughts on any pent-up demand that may have been created by this deep freeze we've been dealing with here, especially here in the southeast? Would you expect this to help the spring building season to some degree?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. The -- all the work [ph] from all of our reporting markets, we're getting -- still getting very, very positive feedback from the builders. Builders' anticipation is still high. The -- we still get good reports of model home traffic. The -- so I think building activity is going to be pretty much where everybody's forecasting it to be this year. I think the -- I still feel very good with everything that I'm saying that we're going to look at 15% to 17% increase in single-family construction.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Great. And the last question, I guess, it might be for Chad. Last year, in the first quarter, I think you guys had some negative impact from lumber prices that at least for now it doesn't look like we're dealing with that. Can you remind us about how much of an impact you guys saw from lumber last year and how we think about that relative to where we are in lumber prices this year?
M. Chad Crow: Well, we did have -- we did get squeezed on margin in the first quarter of '13. If you remember, commodity prices were still -- there was still quite a bit of inflation going on then. If I remember, it was probably around 150 basis points or so we estimated the margin impact in Q1 of '13. So that shouldn't take place this year. So hopefully that will give you a little indication of kind of where we're sitting this quarter.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jack Kasprzak with BB&T Capital Markets.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Just a kind of mechanical question regarding your NOL and taxes. As things improve in the housing market, you guys should continue to show better results and with that, better profits and higher tax expense. What sort of effective or cash tax -- sorry, cash tax rate would you think you would pay as things continue -- and if things continue to improve? Do you have any guidance there?
M. Chad Crow: Well, from a federal tax standpoint, there really won't be any cash until we've blown through the NOL, which I don't think will be till deep into 2016.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: It's pretty much a one for one kind of...
Floyd F. Sherman: Right, yes. We still have some -- a small amount of cash taxes related to some state taxes, I think a couple hundred thousand a quarter, probably.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. You mentioned roofing having an effect on your -- the sales of your other segment. Are you just referring to some deflation in shingle prices?
Floyd F. Sherman: I think it was just more due to storm activity in some of our markets in late '12 and '13.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: On comparison, got you.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. The roofing sales were higher a year ago and that was probably primarily up in Eastern Tennessee and Alabama.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And lumber prices, I guess, have been pretty benign for the last number of months or a few quarters in this environment. I mean, we -- you should still be getting some good gross margin leverage. I mean, your gross margins are up nicely already. I mean, is there any reason to think you won't continue to be able to drive improved gross margins on the volume gains if housing's up -- single-family housing's up 15% to 17%? I mean, is that still a reasonable expectation?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, I think so.
M. Chad Crow: Yes. I think going forward, we should see continued margin improvement.
Floyd F. Sherman: The only commodity, really, that I would anticipate seeing some pretty sharp movement in here in the coming months is OSB. As you know, the OSB prices have been really depressed over where they had been and even where it was, the year average was in 2013. The -- I think a lot of that right now certainly is weather-related and that once the weather begins no longer being a factor, we're going to start seeing some upward push on OSB.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Seth Yeager with Jefferies.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research: It looked to me as if your dollar share, and I measured under homes under construction as opposed to starts, but it's continuing to grow, which is obviously good, but it was -- the pace was a bit slower, I guess, versus what we've seen over the past year. Is there anything to read into that? I know there's been some pricing pressure. Can you just give us a sense as to what's going on from a competition standpoint on what you're seeing out there?
M. Chad Crow: I don't think there's anything to read into our sales based on unit under construction other than the weather slowed up a lot of the construction in our market. And from a pricing standpoint, competition standpoint, it's -- as Floyd said earlier, it's still very tough out there. I would say it gets a little bit better as the pace of construction picks up, but it's still pretty darn competitive.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research: Got it. And just when I look at the days inventories, did you guys make any -- I know in the past you have, just anticipation of inflation, any prepurchases on inventories or strategic purchases?
Floyd F. Sherman: We really haven't changed our strategy the last few quarters. I do feel like we're well covered this quarter and if you're looking at our inventory turns in the fourth quarter, those over impacted somewhat by the weather as well. But we've been into a good quarter [ph], we ended the quarter in good shape. So our strategy really hasn't changed, but I feel good about where we are right now.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research: Okay. All right. And then just a last one in terms of cash flow as in some unforeseen event. If we hit the sort of housing start expectations that people are anticipating at this point, you should be generating some nice free cash flow for the full year. I had penciled in, I think, $15 million or $20 million of CapEx. Beyond that with minimal cash taxes, what's the expected use of free cash flow? Do you guys have any plans on expanding the business? Can you just maybe talk about the capital you should be generating?
Floyd F. Sherman: Well, I think the numbers you just said were on target. We really don't have any plans at the moment for what we might do with some of the cash flow we're generating. We're always looking for opportunities to expand, whether it's greenfield or through acquisitions, and we've looked at a few acquisitions recently and then we'll continue to do so. If we can find some that makes sense, we'll certainly pursue those. But I don't think we're going to have a problem with ending the year with so much cash that we don't know what to do with it. But I do think we'll be free cash flow positive this year and then we'll look for ways to put that cash to use.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research: Okay. And maybe just a follow-up. Where do you see here, what's the lowest level of cash balance you guys would feel comfortable with in just operating the business at this point?
M. Chad Crow: During the downturn, once our liquidity got below, say, $75 million or so, then we started getting somewhat concerned. I certainly wouldn't want our liquidity to get below $50 million. So we're in good shape at the moment.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Robert Kelly with Sidoti & Company.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: I understand the weather-based comments in respect to 1Q, but it sounds like there was some weather impact in 4Q as well. Could you help us quantify that a little bit?
M. Chad Crow: Well, if I remember right, the biggest impact was in -- Texas got hit with a heck of an ice storm in December, pretty much shut things down in North Texas anyway for about a week. I would say in general, the first quarter has certainly been much more difficult from a weather perspective than Q4. I don't really recall Q4 being all that unusual. But I would say Q1 this year is the worst I've seen in the 14 years I've been here as far as the impact in our markets.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. You had just referenced the previous question, the turns being slower because of weather in 4Q...
M. Chad Crow: Right. It did slow turns up a bit, but not near as much of an impact as it was so far this quarter.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. And our -- the weather impact really was as far south as Houston, from Atlanta north all the way through our markets. We've really been seriously hit with some -- as you know, the papers are full of the reports, but we have really had to deal with a lot of weather-related problems so far this year. We -- in our fourth quarter, we just had a smattering of some weather issues that Chad said the most serious was here in North Texas, but it was not widespread through all of our markets.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay, okay. Got it. Just -- okay. As far as the EBITDA flow-through that we saw, particularly in 4Q and the second half of '13, it seemed like you've reached the point here where some of the price competition has eased a little bit and I know it's always intense in your business, but did something take place at some point in 2013 where either competitors were a little bit more disciplined with their pricing, your customers were more willing to accept price increases. The margin flow-through, especially on the EBITDA and the gross margin line, was much better than what we saw over the previous 6 quarters. And then a follow up to that, any reason why we shouldn't expect that 15% to 20% goal you laid out for incremental margins to be sustained in 2014?
Floyd F. Sherman: Well, from my viewpoint, we really haven't seen any change in the competitor behavior regarding pricing. The -- it's still very, very tough out there, very aggressive. There's -- depending upon the situation, you have people who will take business at any cost and the -- I really think the -- one of the major factors that are helping us improve our margin is our willingness to walk away from business. We have continued to walk from business where we just didn't feel the margins were what we wanted to live with. And I think that's beginning to really have an effect -- a positive effect on our business. Obviously, with improving business conditions, maybe you have a few more alternatives and our sales force is responding extremely well to that. The -- very honestly, after a while, you get damn tired of working for nothing and our people are -- and our sales force who are compensated on 10% of gross margin, they're hungry and -- but at the same time, they're doing everything possible to get the margins up and when we can't get the minimum margin levels that we have established and set and expect, then we're walking from that business and we'll continue to do so. And we obviously have been still taking very nice market share and I will continue to say, when you take market share in a very tough market, pricing becomes the primary tool that is used to take market share. And we intend to keep growing our market, taking all the share, but we're going to do it more prudently than we did back when you had to have business at any cost when we were back in the 2010 and '11 times.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Great. So -- I mean, do you feel like there's enough "good business" to sustain the margin improvement in 2014?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay, great. And then one final one. You talked about the OSB pricing being fairly depressed over the past few months. What's your exposure to just OSB?
Floyd F. Sherman: Probably our single largest SKU that we purchase in what would be 7/16 or the flooring items, a lot of specialty items of OSB other than just the exterior sheathing. But it is a major product category. It probably accounts for close to 30% of our commodity makeup in dollars.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Rob Hansen with Deutsche Bank.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I wanted to see if you guys could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the shortage of labor from the builders and where you're seeing the biggest impacts on your business in that respect?
Floyd F. Sherman: Well, from what we hear and we see the same builder commentary that you do and also hearing from our guys in the field, I think labor is going to be another issue this year. It's going to continue to be an issue this year. So the way that impacts our business, as we've said in the past is, there's more of a demand for us to install our products, which we've done more of the last couple of years than ever before. And then it increases the demand on the Prefab Components side of the business, which we've said all along is a favorable sales shift for us that typically will move sales from the Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods category to the Prefab Components category. So as far as the impact on our business, that's a favorable shift.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: What kind of increases in kind of just a rough magnitude have you seen over the last couple of quarters on a year-over-year basis in the, just specifically the installed component of that?
Floyd F. Sherman: Our installed business in 2013, if you include the labor portion and the material portion, was around 22% of our sales, 23%. Pretty consistent with where it was in 2012. But if you go back prior to 2012, say, 2005, 2006, it was less than 5% of our business. So that part of the business has certainly grown.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just one other one. On the Windows business, you've been growing pretty rapidly. You've talked about adding some capacity there. A lot of window companies have had kind of issues in terms of managing the labor and having labor inefficiencies and more scrap and whatnot. Have you seen any of that? How have you been able to kind of manage around that?
Floyd F. Sherman: As far as our window manufacturing facility?
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes.
M. Chad Crow: We really have not experienced those problems. We have obviously -- we've grown our window business. We've been able to acquire the labor, get it trained, get it productive and we're very pleased with how our window operation is going and the -- some of the other issues that other manufacturers are having, because of the quality of our management in that operation, we've been able to avoid. So I'm happy, while many others are not happy with their window situation.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Scott Levine with Imperial Capital.
Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Listening to you talk about the prefab and the growth that you're seeing there on an underlying basis. Would you say that you're more pleased with the way things have progressed there than you would have expected, say, 6, 12 months ago and the trends are accelerating in that particular area? And then what are your expectations with regards to the trend there going forward? Because it certainly sounds like you're encouraged by what you've seen in the market the last 6 to 12 months?
Floyd F. Sherman: I would categorize us as very pleased with how that product line is progressing. It's still not back to where it was pre-downturn, but we probably made up close to half the ground and it was still very low levels of starts. So I think we're happy with where we are, but I also think there's still quite a bit of upside.
Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Got you. And then with regard to -- not to belabor the pricing point, just to kind of push for the incremental here, it does seem, reading the press release, like on the margin, things are getting better. Not to make more of it than it is, but would you say things are getting better on the margin and maybe, I would ask for a little bit more color for specific regional trends, within your footprint, which markets relatively speaking are underperforming or outperforming and/or getting better on the margin versus those that are -- or maybe falling a little bit behind?
Floyd F. Sherman: Well, as we've said in recent quarters, we do expect gross margin to continue to improve, but it's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take homebuilding getting healthier and as each quarter goes by and homebuilding gets stronger, then I think we'll continue to see gradual gross margin improvement. From a market perspective, everyone's certainly still up year-over-year. I would say some of our strongest EBITDA performance markets have been Texas, Florida, Western Tennessee, the Baltimore, Washington area and Atlanta and Charlotte are performing well. I would say some of the weaker environments are still Central Alabama and Central Georgia. But again, everyone's certainly performing better than they were a year ago.
Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Got you. And one last one, if I may. Quickly on SG&A, came in a little bit below what you were looking for in the quarter. It continues to -- are you -- can you get some operating leverage off the overhead? Any additional color you can provide regarding how we should think about that line item going forward and whether you'd expect to see the same degree of operating leverage or maybe even more as we move through 2014?
M. Chad Crow: I think 2014 will look similar as far as the leverage and the variability of SG&A, probably somewhere in that 60% to 65% range variable. We are having to add drivers and adding to our delivery capability, but that's part of the variable component but I still think we have a lot of potential there to leverage very well.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Matthew Dodson with JWest, LLC.
Matthew Dodson : Can you kind of help us understand or one, just clarify, you guys are talking about plus 5%, minus 5% over -- was it Q4 or was it over Q1?
M. Chad Crow: We're still on a sequential quarter basis, so Q1 versus Q4.
Matthew Dodson : Got you. And then because of that, would we expect gross margins to grow sequentially if you do get that plus 5% sales growth?
M. Chad Crow: No. I would probably categorize the margin as being fairly consistent with where we were in Q4. But from an OpEx perspective, we do typically have some higher costs in the first quarter from a payroll, tax standpoint and some other accruals that start over at the beginning of the year. But if you go back and look historically at our OpEx in Q1, it's typically a little higher than Q4, the previous quarter.
Matthew Dodson : And then can you help us kind of understand the mix going forward? Do you expect your prefab and your window business to grow faster than everything else or can you kind of just help us understand the puts and takes there, as well?
M. Chad Crow: Certainly I would expect prefab, yes, to continue to gain momentum and also the window plant in Houston, I think, that they're going to have another great year. I wouldn't say they're going to grow, but they'll probably grow a little bit faster than the rest of the business. But I think the most potential we have right now is on the prefab side.
Floyd F. Sherman: But you also have to remember the Houston window plant only supplies the Texas market. So the rest of [ph] the markets are -- we purchase for and resell the windows. But we try to grow all aspects of all of the major components of our business, we try to keep it on an equal basis. We're putting a lot more emphasis on the engineered products side of the business, processed wall panels, engineered floor and so forth, but the -- we still would hope that we can keep the growth up in all of the other products and so far, we've been successful doing that.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Howard Weinberg with UBS.
Howard Weinberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about content per home. So are homes getting larger and -- so are you just adding the prefab, wall work, windows to each home that you're selling? I'm just trying to get an understanding of how you're actually capturing this incremental market share.
Floyd F. Sherman: I don't know that the size of the homes has changed all that much, maybe slightly bigger. And certainly, we're getting a bigger share of the wallet with existing customers, but we've also added a lot of new customers the last couple of years. So it's certainly a combination of things. Another way we look at it is -- and it varies by the size of the home and the type of home, but I would say if we were to sell our entire product offering into a home, we're probably talking $25,000 average, something like that in, say, maybe a 2,500-square foot home. But it's really just been a combination of increasing our wallet with existing customers and adding a lot of new customers.
Howard Weinberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then just on expansion opportunities that you might embark on. Will it be mostly adjacent locations, reopening some of the closed locations that you closed over the years or would you be interested in extending to new regions?
Floyd F. Sherman: Well, we've only got a couple of mothballed locations that we could potentially reopen. We're certainly always looking for ways to strengthen our presence in existing markets or in adjacent markets, whether that be through greenfield or acquisitions. But I would say that the likely path in the near-term is to grow within our existing markets or within the adjacent markets.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Philip Volpicelli with Deutsche Bank.
Philip Volpicelli: Questions regarding pricing. You mentioned that OSB prices, you're expecting some increases there. We've heard from some of the window and door manufacturers that they're also trying to push price. Have you seen anything in the marketplace on Windows & Doors?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. We have definitely seen the announcements on -- from the window companies, as well as the interior/exterior door companies. They -- their intentions are to increase the prices to the market. The -- we have on products that we buy for resale, it's our intention then to pass the increases on with our markups. The -- I can't really say at this point that the increases have gone into effect, but they will be here over the next 60 days, but we have discussed these things with our customers, customers are aware of it and we'll just have to wait and see if they stick. And right now, I would say from everything that I'm seeing and hearing, they're pretty much going to go into place.
Philip Volpicelli: Okay, great. And what magnitude are they -- the price increases that have been announced?
Floyd F. Sherman: Say that again. You broke up.
Philip Volpicelli: Sorry. What magnitude, what size, 1%, 5%, 10%?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. Most of those are running anywhere from 4% to 7%, that's what we're seeing on those particular products.
Operator: And at this time, there are no additional questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sherman for any additional or closing remarks.
Floyd F. Sherman: Okay, thank you. We appreciate everyone joining the call today. If you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to give Chad Crow or Marcie Hyder a call here in Dallas. Have a good day.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation.

Floyd F. Sherman: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2013 earnings call. Joining me from our management team is Chad Crow, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer. After I give a brief recap of our third quarter, I'll turn the call over to Chad, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions. Our trend of improving financial results continued as our topline growth and gross margin increased helped us achieve positive net income and positive cash flow in the current quarter. As we have previously stated, our focus has been on increasing market share while expending gross margins. To that end, our third quarter sales were $402.9 million, an increase of 38.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2012. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth above 30%, and shows our sales growth is still outpacing the increase in residential construction activity. Our gross margin percentage increased to 23% for the current quarter, up from 19.8% for the third quarter of 2012. This margin increase was accomplished in spite of the continuation of a very competitive pricing environment, and was largely due to better customer pricing, an increase in sales volume and a lower rate of material cost inflation. I'll now turn the call over to Chad who will review our financial results in more detail.
M. Chad Crow: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning, everyone. For the current quarter, we were reported sales of $402.9 million compared to $291.8 million for the third quarter of 2012, an increase of $111.2 million or 38.1%. We estimate sales increased 29.6% due to increased sales volume and 8.5% due to price. Breaking down our sales by product category, Prefabricated Components were $83 million, up 47.8% from $56.1 million in the third quarter of 2012. Windows & Doors were $84.4 million, up approximately 37%. Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods were $137.5 million, an increase of $40.2 million. Our Millwork category was $37.4 million, up 33.5%. And Other Building Products & Services increased $12.1 million to $60.6 million. From a sales mix perspective, Prefabricated Components were 20.6% of total sales, up from 19.2% in the same quarter a year ago and represents our highest mix of this category since the fourth quarter of 2008. Our gross margin percentage was 23% in the current quarter, up 320 basis points from 19.8% in the same quarter last year. We estimate our gross margin percent increased 280 basis points due to improved sales price and 40 basis points due to increased sales volume. On a sequential quarter basis, our gross margin improved 230 basis points. Turning to SG&A. Our selling, general and administrative expenses were $72.3 million, an increase of $13.7 million or 23.3% from the same quarter last year despite the 38.1% increase in sales over the same time period and shows we continue to leverage our operating expenses very well. For the current quarter, our salaries and benefits expense, excluding stock compensation expense was $46.4 million or 11.5% of sales compared to $35.6 million or 12.2% of sales in the third quarter of 2012. This increase is primarily related to higher sales commissions and additional staffing needs to service our increased sales volume. Delivery expense increased $1.3 million and other general and administrative expenses increased $1.4 million, both a result of increased sales volumes. Interest expense for the current quarter was $7.5 million, a decrease of $3.1 million, which relates primarily to our recent refinancing. For the current year quarter, interest expense included $6.7 million related to our outstanding senior secured notes due 2021 and $600,000 of our amortization deferred loan cost. Interest expense in the third quarter of 2012 included $4.7 million related to our current loan and $4.5 million related to our floating rate notes due 2016. In addition, interest expense in the third quarter of 2012 included a $700,000 noncash fair value adjustment related to stock warrant issued in connection with the term loan and $200,000 of amortized deferred loan coasts. We recorded a $129,000 income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2013 compared to $33,000 of income tax expense in the third quarter of 2012. We recorded a $3.4 million reduction of our tax valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2013 versus a $4.6 million increase in our tax valuation allowance in the third quarter 2012. Absent the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate would have been 25.8% and 37.6% in the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of the end of the third quarter, our gross federal income tax NOL available for carryforward was approximately $270 million. Our income from continuing operations was $13 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $12.3 million, or a $0.13 loss per diluted share, in the same quarter last year. Excluding the facility closure cost, the fair value adjustment for stock warrants and the tax valuation allowance, our income from continuing operations was $9.2 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the current quarter, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $6.5 million, or a $0.07 loss per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2012. On net income for the third quarter of 2013 was $12.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $13.6 million, or a $0.14 loss per diluted share, in the same quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was $23 million or 5.7% of sales for the current quarter compared to an adjusted EBITDA of $3 million or 1% of sales in the third quarter of 2012. For the current quarter, we had positive cash flow of approximately $25 million, which resulted in liquidity at September 30 of $211.5 million consisting of $50.4 million of available cash and $161.1 million in borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility. We had no borrowings during the quarter under our revolver. Operating cash flow was $29.7 million for the third quarter of 2013, which included a $14.5 million reduction in working capital. Our new senior secured notes due 2021 require interest payment semiannually in June and December. Therefore, our third quarter 2013 operating cash flow does not include an interest payment pertaining to these notes of approximately $6.7 million, which is included in accrued liabilities. Operating cash flow was negative $11.1 million in the third quarter of 2012, and included $4 million related to working capital build. Capital expenditures were $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared to $5.2 million for the same quarter of 2012. We expect capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2013 to be approximately $8 million and expect 2014 capital expenditures to be between $15 million and $20 million, as we continue to invest in our fleet and truss, panel, door and window capabilities. I'll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd F. Sherman: Thank you, Chad. Despite the challenges we still face within the industry, such as the historically low rate of housing starts, availability of credit for homebuyers, shortages of skilled construction labor and the competitive pricing environment, we believe the demand for housing continues to strengthen and the outlook for continued industry improvement remains positive. We saw our financial results accelerate through the third quarter, and are optimistic regarding our outlook, taking seasonal differences into account for the remainder of the year. I'm extremely pleased with our recent financial performance and know it would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of all of our employees. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Scott Levine.
Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: So we heard you say there, Floyd, at the end that activity accelerated throughout the quarter. Just looking for maybe a little bit more color, doesn't sound like the recent turbulence in mortgage rates has had any real impact on your business. But if you could just provide a little bit more color. And also maybe a little bit more color by region within your footprint, which markets are looking the strongest or maybe weakest on a comparative basis?
M. Chad Crow: We really haven't seen the positive that you've seen a lot of the homebuilders refer to. Our business thus far this quarter has remained fairly consistent with the way it ended in the third quarter. And then our guys are really optimistic about what they're seeing for the remainder of this year. Now, I will say that if new home orders were slowing, it would take several months for that to trickle through -- to impact our business, so maybe there is a pause coming but we haven't seen that yet. As far as weaker or stronger markets right now, certainly, Texas is still one of our stronger. Nashville, Tennessee is strong. The Charlotte, Baltimore, Washington markets are performing well. And everyone's up, obviously, on a year-over-year basis. I would say right now, the -- still the most challenging would probably be Alabama and Atlanta to some degree.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, I -- just to add to what Chad had said, we see the same reports that you do from the public builders. While the contract signings maybe show -- are showing a decrease in the rate of increase over the prior reporting quarter or on a year-to-date basis, they still are ahead, obviously, of last year. The backlogs are still very healthy that the builders are showing. If you do your math, it's anywhere probably from 5.5 months to 7, 7.5 months of backlog. The -- it's still -- we're still seeing a good flow-through as the builders are pushing to get the homes turned over. The -- and so we feel confident and good about our fourth quarter. I think the builder -- what we're starting to hear is that they're slowing down on the price increases. They're also starting to come back in a little bit more in the way of incentives to get people, to get contracts closed out. But still, nothing like what had been done in the past. So, overall, I think what it's saying is that on a national basis, single-family starts probably are going to come in somewhere around 625,000, 630,000 for the year. It's still a nice improvement over last year. And it's -- we're taking market share. We continue to build our market share, and I think our performance in the field is certainly helping keep our rate of sales up as compared to what maybe is now being reported by some of the builders as to their sales performance.
Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Understood. And one follow up as well, I think you mentioned 8.5% price increase in the quarter that I think is down sequentially from 17.5%. If you could just comment on competitive trends versus what's going on with lumber pricing in terms of what you're seeing out there on the pricing front.
Floyd F. Sherman: From a competitive standpoint, we're still seeing very, very competitive conditions in the field. The -- everybody is very attuned to the commodity markets. We're starting to see -- OSB has leveled out and we're not really seeing a lot of volatility right now in OSB. We've done, I think, a good job of protecting ourselves for the remainder of the quarter. Lumber, however, is a little bit different case. There's more volatility. There's more upward push to the lumber pricing. And the -- and we would anticipate as we look towards through the first quarter of next year, that we will probably see a continual inflationary curve to the lumber commodity side of the business. And people are going to take that into account in their pricing. And as we've said, overall, it's a lot better for us when we have high commodity prices so long as that pricing is stable. The -- but we've -- I think we've done a very good job of covering the volatility that we've seen this year, and I think our margin performance reflects it. And I think people in the industry are getting, I think, a lot more sensitive to making sure that their pricing is more reflective of the commodity prices that are out there.
Operator: And we'll go next to the line of David Williams.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: I wanted to ask you a little bit about the margins. You were clearly well ahead of where we thought you guys would be and a little surprised at how well those came in. But if we think about the 280 basis points that you've gotten off the pricing, how much of that is sticky? And we can expect that to go forward? And then, maybe how much of that is just capitalizing on a onetime event? And then, maybe what are you seeing on pricing across-the-board maybe on the different products or group of products? Is there anything specifically that you could point to on -- maybe the Prefabricated Components you're getting better pricing on or anything of that nature?
M. Chad Crow: If you look at commodity prices, during the third quarter, they didn't behave all that differently than they did in the third quarter last year. We actually saw inflation during both those quarters. I think the bigger difference is how prices were behaving heading into the quarter. Heading into Q3 of this year, prices were falling quite sharply. And this -- that did allow us to benefit from some pricing that had been set towards the end of Q2, that didn't ship till Q3. And so during that period there, we were able to lower our average cost a bit. And this is, obviously, the opposite of what we've been facing in the last 1.5 years or so with the commodity inflation. I will also say, however, that the rapid fall in prices heading into the quarter left us with an average cost on hand that was above the current market because it takes a little longer for our average cost to catch-up. And our sales force did one hell of a job of quoting prices based on on-hand cost when the temptation would've been to price off replacement at that time to avoid risking losing some business. So, my hat's off to the those guys for helping us manage through that volatility. But all that's just part of the puzzle. Obviously, and there are several other factors that can impact our margins. As we stated in the release, our margins are up 320 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to price but breaking out the components of that price can be difficult. The competitive environment, changes in sales mix, obviously, the commodity inflation or deflation, and then our inventory cost position going into the quarter has a lot to do with it as well, as Floyd just alluded to. So all those things play a part. I will say going into Q4, you're asking about how sticky that margin is. We'll see a seasonal slowdown. We would expect to see a seasonal slowdown in the business. So from that standpoint, I think maintaining 23% margin will be difficult. And commodity prices are behaving a little different now heading into Q4 than they were in Q3 although they're still relatively stable. So I would expect Q4 margins to be lower than they were in Q3, but also certainly higher than they were in Q4 of last year. I think that it's going to fall somewhere in between there and it's just a little early yet to pin it down any more than that.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Perfect. And then maybe on the -- on any of the products, are you seeing better pricing in the Prefabricated Components or the Window segments yet? Or has that really begun to flow-through?
M. Chad Crow: We saw some fairly nice improvement on the prefab margin this quarter. I would say that was the biggest change and that -- and the commodity lumber had the biggest improvement in margin.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Great. Are you seeing any volume increases on the prefabs?
M. Chad Crow: Yes.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Yes. All right, can you put a number around that, maybe?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, our -- we saw an almost, what, 46% increase over the Q3 of last year.
M. Chad Crow: Yes, it was up 48% quarter-over-quarter. I haven't done a price volume analysis on that specific category, but the 48% year-over-year is a good indication of the volume we're seeing.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. It's heavy, the volumes are. And pricing.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Great. And one more if I could here, looking at where we are on the southern starts and your dollar content into those southern starts, and of course, we don't have the September data yet, but kind of estimating that, we're up about 20% year-on-year in the dollar content and lumber prices were only up about 5%. So, to me, that kind of points that you're definitely gaining some market share and getting some deeper penetration, but is there anything specific that you could point to that maybe it's giving you the ability to drive that dollar content a little higher than maybe with just the pricing?
M. Chad Crow: Well, I know just from recent discussions, there's quite a few small competitors out there that are still struggling from a liquidity standpoint. And really struggling to have the liquidity to grow their businesses like they need to. So I think that's been a definite advantage for us.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, I think -- but I will continue to keep going back to the one factor, I think, that separates us from so many of our competitors, is the quality of our people servicing the business and the number of our people servicing the business. We're are able to take advantage of the improving market condition I think a lot better than any of our competitors. And we're doing a better job of servicing it. I think the builders recognize the quality of our services that we provide. Certainly, the install component of our business has strategically really helped us open some doors and improve the total mix of products going into our customers and I think all of those factors are what's really enabling us to drive our superior market growth and market share gain.
M. Chad Crow: And I know in the Prefab category, I've also heard that lead times are getting extended with a lot of our competitors, and we're having folks come to us for the truss and panel because we can take the volume and our lead times are shorter, so that's obviously, helped us as well.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Trey Grooms.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions. Here on -- coming back to the margins, I mean, 23%, obviously, very strong and of course, you would expect a seasonal slow or pull back a little bit in that just from a seasonal standpoint, I mean. But outside of that, looking forward, say, fast forward to next spring, when demand should be better and we could continue to see higher sales numbers, is there any way -- any reason why we shouldn't -- why you couldn't perform in a similar or even maybe higher margin kind of fashion in that type of sales environment?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, I think there's always a possibility that we can, but there's a lot of -- as you know, Trey, there's a lot of unknown factors that we have to deal with in this business, the volatility of our commodities, maybe the change in pricing attitude with your competitors and so forth. Do I expect or anticipate us having a better margin through the year, next year, than we have this year? Yes, I do. And we certainly are expecting that performance out of our people, and I believe our people will deliver it. But it's -- some of it is also a factor of how aggressive do we want to be in continuing to take market share at the rate that we have been taking because in a -- we're still in a very, very bad housing environment as compared to what we've historically seen from a construction standpoint. And any time you are increasing market share, price certainly enters in to and is a very important determinant of the gain that you might take on. And that's something that we monitor. We try to keep it controlled. We -- in the past quarter, we walked from, I think, a significant amount of business because it just didn't meet our pricing guidelines and requirements. And we're going to continue to do that, but I think next year, I'm anticipating a better year next year than we've seen this year.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Right. Yes, I understand there's a lot of moving pieces here for sure. Chad, on SG&A, as a percent of sales, again, very impressive. How do we think about this going into the kind of slower seasonal periods? And then also, kind of further out, looking to improve sales next year, I mean, would we expect this kind of a similar kind of percent of sales, SG&A number? Or how should we think about that as we look to next year as well?
M. Chad Crow: Well, if we do see a slowdown in Q4 in business, we'll be able to pull back on the SG&A, the variable portion of it. So I still think we'll be able to flex that as we need to in Q4. And I really haven't changed my stance on OpEx going forward. I still think we can be somewhere in that 65% -- the 65% variable range on the increased sales volume next year. So if that is the case, I would anticipate that as a percentage of sales, we should still see that number tick down as our volume picks up.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Right, okay. And just on the prefab, highest mix since 2008. I would think that, like you guys mentioned, the demand for that part of your business would continue to grow and become more important as these builders get busier and busier, and labor becomes tighter. But where -- from a capacity standpoint, where can that go? Where can the prefab as a percent of revs -- I mean, where can I really go before you have to start thinking about putting on additional lines and that sort of thing? And then also, if you could comment on the expansion on the Windows & Doors?
Floyd F. Sherman: I think the -- our truss and panel, I think we can get it up to, close to 25% of our overall business with not only the facilities that we have currently open, but we still have some mothballed facilities that we can and will open as the demand requires it. The trusses that we are building today and especially the wall panels that we're building today are, Trey, much more complicated and require a lot more production time than they did back in 2005 and 2006. There have been design changes, the local code requirements and so forth, the insurance requirements have really brought about some very significant changes in the component business. That will -- has taken away some of the output capacity that we have for our current plants, but I think we can get it up to about 25% of our business before we have to start either greenfielding plants or acquiring maybe some other unused capacity, some plants that might be out there available for us to acquire. But so -- they -- we have opened up here in the past 6 months 2 facilities and both of those have really gone up and running. They're doing well. The plants that were in those -- those areas of those plants were already operating at close to capacity, and that's the reason we brought those 2 plants up. And we'll do the same for the other remaining facilities.
M. Chad Crow: And some of the CapEx that we referred to in the earnings release, does relate to additional truss and panel equipment, as well as door and window equipment. Some of that's replacement, some of that equipment's old, but some of that is also to add additional efficiency, getting some more up-to-date.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. And at our window operation, we're definitely adding substantial capital dollars. There's -- probably $4.5 million will be going into that plant for capacity enhancements. They have -- they're operating right now at close to theoretical maximum. And we're anticipating another good year of expansion. That -- the window operation is doing very nicely for us, and we don't want to do anything to -- that might inhibit the continued growth of that part of the operation.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Kasprzak.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Chad, is $7.5 million of quarterly interest expense the right number to model? Or are some of those smaller items roll off at some -- in the near future?
M. Chad Crow: That's probably the right number. I think we'll be about $30 million a year in expense and about $28 million of cash interest.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And Floyd, is there a number you could give us around capacity utilization, say, in Prefab components where you guys might be running right now?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, I would guess, overall, we are probably running now in the -- of our theoretical capacity, we're probably in the mid- to high 70s.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And you guys are, obviously, running at a sales rate per start much higher than where we've been over the years and you've talked about market share gains quarter in and quarter out here. But you're -- also, your cost performance has been good and is trending better than what it was in previous upturns in the housing market. So on a similar level of starts, how much better will SG&A as a percent of sales be, do you think, than it was in the last cycle?
M. Chad Crow: I think our best in '05 or '06 was around 18.3% of sales. I think we can get that down below 17%, somewhere in the 16s.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay, great. And last question is, you've talked also about the competitive pricing environment, that's been ongoing, obviously. But you -- the press release also mentions margin improvement due to better customer pricing. Can you talk about that dynamic a little bit?
M. Chad Crow: Well, I think some of it, as what Floyd already referred to, is where we continue to be more and more selective of the business we're taking. And we're able to -- as our results improve, we're able to kind of raise the bar as to what the minimum requirement is on pricing. So that's certainly some of it and I would say it does seem that some of our competitors are getting more price-conscious and being a little more rational, not to anyway, say, it's not still very competitive because it is. As Floyd mentioned earlier, we're still at a historically low level of housing and so it is still a very competitive environment. But I think we're starting to see it soften a little, and as you've all read, the homebuilders are getting price increases pushed through, which over time can give us a little bit of wiggle room as well.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Philip Volpicelli.
Philip Volpicelli: My question is with regard to some of the mothballed facilities that you might still have or any ideas you guys might have in terms of either greenfielding or buying a weak competitor in terms of growth here. Clearly, the business has turned much strongly positive and you got $50 million of cash. Just wondering if that makes any sense to go out and do some M&A, do some greenfield or bring some more facilities out of mothball?
M. Chad Crow: Well, we certainly do have the balance sheet now to start considering M&A and I would probably categorize it as that's where we are right now. We'll consider it if something attractive came along. We're not on a mission to just go out and start buying people, it's got to make sense. As far as mothballed facilities go, we do have a couple that we're kind of waiting to see how business kicks off next year, as to whether we reopen those or not. But we could certainly do that and have them up and running in a relatively short order, if the demand is there.
Philip Volpicelli: And those are production facilities or are they distribution facilities?
Floyd F. Sherman: No, we've got a truss operation and we've got a panel operation that we're going to be looking at very closely. And probably, I would anticipate that we will be opening those facilities in 2014.
Philip Volpicelli: Yes, and then in terms of greenfields, is that something you guys are considering at all?
M. Chad Crow: I wouldn't rule it out. We did a little bit of that last year as we expanded in Austin and Clarksville, Tennessee. So certainly, if there's opportunities to expand into adjacent markets or new markets, we would look at it. Preference, probably would be a little bit more related towards acquiring someone to get into a new market rather than greenfield.
Philip Volpicelli: Great. Got you. And how much -- I mean, what size would you be willing to spend, or I guess, the other way to ask is how much cash would you want to have on the balance sheet once you do it?
Floyd F. Sherman: I don't think we have any real criteria for saying size. A lot of times, you can look at maybe a smaller operation and then their sales. They may be smaller because they haven't had the liquidity to really expand their business and to where -- but they have a facility that can do a lot more than they may be doing through that facility, or we might be able to add products to their mix that would really enhance their sales performance. So sometimes, the smaller guys will be more attractive maybe than a larger size operation. The -- a lot of it's -- I would expect most of our -- if you look at tuck-in acquisitions, which are really most important to us because we think any time we can enhance and take a larger market share of one of our existing markets, that will be long-term financially, more beneficial to us than going out and starting up in an all together new market that we can't fully support. The -- most of these acquisitions will fall somewhere probably in the $20 million to $75 million a year sale category.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from David Guarino.
Unknown Analyst: I know a lot of questions have been asked regarding the Prefabricated Comps category. I was wondering if you could shed a little bit more light on how you guys forecast demand internally for that?
Floyd F. Sherman: Our forecasting of forward demand is really based upon what we think the builders might be doing within the markets in which we serve. We get very little in the way of solid guidance from the builders as to what their building outlook is going to be. This business has traditionally over the years, always been a day-by-day situation. And then reacting to very, very short term demand forecast. So we -- you get pretty good at trying to anticipate the -- what the builders are going to be doing and where -- and consequently, how that may affect all the different products that we sell, and in particular, the components. Right now, an additional factor that is helping us with components and accelerating the use of the components is the shortage of really good trained experienced labor in the field. The -- especially for traditional framing. That gives rise to increasing the usage rate for trusses and panels, and it reduces the skill levels that are required out of the job site to build that house. And so we're seeing -- and you try to estimate what you think that, that conversion rate might be from traditional stick framing to component -- use of components, but it's our best estimate of the situation. We really don't have good, concrete for -- advanced forecasting from the builders.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Robert Kelly.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: You have said historically, your EBITDA margin flow-through should be 15% to 20%. If the trends continue to decelerate with respect to the new order book for the public builders and private builders, what are the levers you pull to maintain that kind of flow-through? This assumes, of course, lumber is relatively steady.
M. Chad Crow: I think it's just really going to be more of the same. It's going to be managing the OpEx to what your sales volume is, and it's going to be pushing to get every last dollar you can on price. I don't know that a pause or a deceleration is going to really change that strategy.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Does the -- do you have enough visibility into their order book to make those OpEx changes quickly?
M. Chad Crow: Yes, we can react fairly quickly. I'm not -- I don't -- I'm not going to say we have a lot of visibility, but as the business, if it we were to start to slow, yes, our guys are well-equipped. They've been through the drill before to kind of flex their cost structure. We use a lot of temp labor in our truss and panel plant that allows us to flex that as needed, and then a good chunk of our SG&A is variable, the delivery. And obviously, the salesman commission is variable. So, yes, we would be ready to flex that down if conditions warrant it.
Floyd F. Sherman: We also run weekly FTE reporting by location, by operation. The -- what standard is and what your actual FTE count is. And that give you your guidelines and you can react fairly quickly to -- -- if there is a significant and a real trend in decelerating level of business activity.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Got it. You might have touched on this, the reason for the bump in CapEx 4Q and into 2014? What's driving that?
M. Chad Crow: In the fourth quarter, we've got a couple of facilities we're relocating. And then as Floyd mentioned earlier, we're expanding the capacity of our window plant in Houston. And so, a lot of that equipment we'll be ordering this year to get it online next year. And then as far as next year goes...
Floyd F. Sherman: And we've also had, Chad, we're putting some dollars into our truss and panel operations and into our -- the millwork area. And because of the lead times that are now being required on the equipment, we're having to put in the initial down payments in some cases up to 1/3 of the acquisition costs in order to get our place in the schedule, so we can get that equipment in and put into operation by early spring of next year.
M. Chad Crow: Yes, we've got deposits we're putting down on that equipment as well as lead expansion for next year. And then, the rest of that will flow through in 2014, plus we have one more facility we're looking at relocating next year.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: With the Houston window expansion, what's the new capacity when that's all said and done? Sales capacity?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, the -- if you're asking what we will be able to get out of that operation?
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Yes.
Floyd F. Sherman: It'll be in excess of $100 million, annually.
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions at this time. So I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any closing remarks.
Floyd F. Sherman: Okay. We really appreciate your tuning in today, and following our company. The -- if there's any follow-up questions that you have, don't hesitate to either give Chad or Marcie Hyder a call here in Dallas, and we'll be glad to try to answer your questions for you. We hope you have a good day, and a very nice weekend. That concludes any of our remarks -- further remarks. So.
Operator: This concludes today's program. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect at any time.

Floyd F. Sherman: Thank you, and welcome to our Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Joining me today from our management team is Chad Crow, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll start by giving a recap of the second quarter and then I'll turn the call over to Chad, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions. Our sales for the second quarter of 2013 were $398.1 million, an increase of 46.4% when compared to last year's second quarter sales of $271.9 million. Over the same time period, actual single-family housing starts in the South Region increased 14.5% and single-family units under construction increased 27.4%. We continue to experience strong year-over-year sales increases despite the tough sale comps from 2012. From a sales per start perspective, we ended the current quarter with a new high of $4,504 per South Region single-family start compared to $3,522 in the second quarter of 2012 and $4,021 in the first quarter of 2013. Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods prices were, on the average, 21.5% higher during the second quarter of 2013 as compared to those in the same quarter last year, though prices did fall approximately 30% during the course of the quarter. Falling prices in the back half of the quarter relieved some of the gross margin pressure we have been experiencing from commodity inflation, and we were able to improve our gross margin by 100 basis points for the current quarter due to both improved pricing and higher sales volumes. These factors helped us achieve adjusted EBITDA of $16.7 million for the current quarter, an improvement over $14 million when compared to adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 million for the second quarter of 2012. I'll now turn the call over to Chad, who will review our financial results in more detail.
M. Chad Crow: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning, everyone. For the current quarter, we reported sales of $398.1 million compared to $271.9 million for the second quarter of 2012, an increase of $126.2 million or 46.4%. We estimate sales increased 28.9% due to increased sales volume and 17.5% due to price. Breaking down our sales by product category, Prefabricated Components were $78.2 million, up from $51.2 million in the second quarter of 2012. Windows & Doors were $77.8 million, up approximately 31%. Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods were $149.2 million, an increase of $61.3 million. Our Millwork category was $35.2 million, up 33%. And Other Building Products & Services increased $10.6 million to $57.7 million. From a sales mix perspective, Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods were 37.5% of total sales as compared to 32.4% of total sales in the second quarter last year, with the increase due primarily to commodity lumber price inflation. Excluding the impact of price inflation, Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods were down slightly as a percent of total sales, while manufactured products were up slightly. All other product categories were fairly consistent between periods from a mix standpoint. Our gross margin percentage was 20.7% in the current quarter, up 100 basis points from 19.7% in the same quarter last year. We estimate our gross margin percent increased 60 basis points due to increased sales volume, with the remaining 40 basis points coming from improved pricing and sales mix. On a sequential quarter basis, our gross margin improved 120 basis points. Our selling, general and administrative expenses were $69 million, up $14.1 million or 25.6% from the same quarter last year despite the 46.4% increase in sales. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense decreased to 17.3% in the current quarter from 20.2% in the same quarter 2012 as we continue to leverage our cost structure extremely well against the increase in sales. For the second quarter 2013, our salaries and benefits expense, excluding stock compensation expense, was $44 million or 11% of sales compared to $34 million or 12.5% of sales in the second quarter of 2012. This increase is primarily related to higher sales commissions and additional staffing needs to service our increased sales volume. Delivery expense increased $2 million, and other general and administrative expense increased $1.4 million, both a result of increased sales volumes. Interest expense for the current quarter was $61.1 million, an increase of $50.6 million. This increase relates primarily to our recent refinancing transaction and includes $6.8 million of unamortized debt issue discount write-offs, $2.1 million of debt issue cost write-offs and $39.5 million prepayment premium related to the early termination of our term loan. We recorded $400,000 of income tax expense in the second quarter of 2013 compared to $100,000 in the second quarter of 2012. We recorded an after-tax noncash valuation allowance of $17 million and $4.3 million in the second quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to our net deferred tax asset. Absent the valuation allowance, our effective tax rate would have been 34.6% and 34.9% in the second quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of the end of the second quarter, our federal income tax NOL available for carryforward was approximately $295 million. Our loss from continuing operations was $48.3 million or a $0.50 loss per diluted share compared to a loss of $12 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Excluding the refinancing costs, the fair value adjustment for stock warrants and the tax valuation allowance, our income from continuing operations was approximately $500,000 or $0.01 per diluted share for the current quarter. Excluding the fair value adjustment for stock warrants and the tax valuation allowance, our loss from continuing operations was $7.1 million or $0.07 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2012. Our net loss for the second quarter of 2013 was $48.2 million or $0.50 per diluted share compared to a loss of $12.1 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012. Our net loss was obviously negatively impacted by the costs associated with our recent refinancing. Adjusted EBITDA was $16.7 million for the second quarter of 2013 compared to adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2012. During the second quarter of 2013, we completed a Rule 144A offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount, 7 5/8% senior secured notes due 2021. At the same time, we entered into a new 5-year $175 million revolving credit facility led by SunTrust Bank. We used the proceeds from the offering, together with the cash on hand, to redeem our 2016 notes, pay off our outstanding term loan, including the prepayment premium, and to pay fees and expenses related to the transaction. Cash used for the second quarter of 2013 was $92.2 million. Of the $92.2 million, we used $53.7 million to pay refinancing costs, $27.4 million was due to working capital build during the quarter and $14.7 million was net cash used to retire our long-term debt. Cash used for the second quarter of 2012 was $24.5 million, with $15.4 million related to working capital build. Capital expenditures were $3.6 million for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $2.2 million for the same quarter of 2012. Total liquidity at June 30, 2013, was approximately $170 million, which included $25.5 million in available cash and $162.3 million of borrowing availability under our new revolver reduced by a $17.5 million minimum excess availability requirement. The $162.3 million of borrowing availability is derived from the $175 million revolver commitment plus current outstanding letters of credit of $12.7 million. As of June 30, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our recent refinancing transaction provides a tremendous boost to our goal of returning to positive net income. For the second quarter of 2013, our interest expense included refinancing costs of approximately $48.4 million. Absent these refinancing costs, we were slightly positive net income for the second quarter. As a result of our new capital structure, our annual cash interest going forward will be approximately $28 million, assuming nothing is drawn on the revolver. I'll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd F. Sherman: Thank you, Chad. As the recovery in the housing market continues, we believe our year-over-year sales growth for the second half of 2013 will be driven by the combination of market share gains and increases in the overall customer demand. We will still continue to maintain our focus on improving our gross margins and further leveraging our operating cost structure. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: First off, the SG&A leverage, very impressive, much better than we would have expected. Chad, is that the level of SG&A, I guess, as a percent of rev, is that something we could expect going forward? Is that a sustainable level? Or is there something particular in the quarter that was unique? Or how should we think about that going forward?
M. Chad Crow: No, there really wasn't anything unique in there, and I'm with you. And I think Floyd will agree. We were both extremely pleased with how we were able to leverage our OpEx. If you go back, our lowest number ever was 2005 and that was 18.2% for the year, and so we're already trending ahead of that on significantly less sales. So that has us very optimistic about what we can do as sales continue to grow. But I still think we're going to be about 50-50 fixed variable going forward. And so I still think there's room to improve on that.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Awesome, great. And then on lumber prices. So lumber prices, obviously, have moved down significantly in the quarter, but it's since started ticking up a little bit. What kind of margin impact could that have in the third quarter with the timing of you guys kind of resetting your contract with customers, the inventory on hand, et cetera? How do we think about that?
M. Chad Crow: Well, if you go back to 2012 and the first quarter of this year, each of those quarters, the inflation we were fighting impacted us at least 100 basis points. So let's hope that during the third quarter, we don't see another 25% or 30% inflation because, if we do, it'll put some pressure on margins. But right now, if things just seem to be ticking up slowly, it would certainly be manageable for us. But really, we just have to wait and see what prices are going to do the next couple of months. I can tell you, so far this quarter, margins are very strong. So thus far, we feel good about the quarter.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then kind of on that, you've seen the lumber price inflation has been manageable, as you noted. What are you guys' expectation for lumber price? I mean, obviously, you don't have a crystal ball, but just looking over kind of the short run given what you're seeing out there with suppliers and balancing that with demand and so forth.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, I think, Trey, the -- we're going to see a slow inflation, I believe, for the rest of the quarter and into early fall for both Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods. It feels to us right now like the panel and lumber manufacturers are trying to find a pricing level that they can live with and that they can sustain. And I don't think we're going to see a real major run-up and a real sharp spike as we had seen in the past. I think it's just -- the feel to us right now is that it'll slowly keep creeping up, and as Chad said, we can manage that, and I really don't believe we're going to see it coming back to the levels that we saw in the -- at -- by the end of the first quarter of this year.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Great. And one last for me and I'll jump back in queue. But just on the competitive landscape, now that, obviously, the demand has really taken off and gotten legs, at least so far. But then again, kind of with the backdrop of lower lumber prices that we have today, is the environment there any more or less competitive than what you've been seeing?
Floyd F. Sherman: No. I -- the -- we're still looking at a very, very competitive landscape. The -- I do have to point out, I think it's -- we got to know that we're still in a very depressed housing environment. If you look at 2012, the starts ended up about 535,000. That was the third worst year of housing. This year, while things are certainly getting better, I don't think it's anywhere near what we would call a healthy or normal environment this year than that number for single-family starts. It's probably somewhere in and around the 650,000 mark. Right now, on an annualized basis, it's 591,000. So while it's better, it will be the fourth worst year on housing on record. There still is a lot of supply chasing the demand so it is still very, very competitive. Our guys are doing a tremendous job, I believe, in trying to get more responsible pricing and still keep the customers. And it's a daily battle out there and we have been successful in pulling up the margins. Some of it came with the easing of the commodity pricing, but that really didn't affect us until very late in the quarter because we're on an average costing basis. So -- and we did very little buying in the first couple of months of the quarter. So we didn't get a lot of benefit from it. And it's -- our people are getting the prices up and we're getting it up across the board in all of the product categories, but it is a damn tough fight every day. And the -- and -- but we're going to continue on the same basis. And right now, as Chad said, third quarter is the start of -- the start of the third quarter for us is really looking very good. We're very pleased with what we're seeing.
Operator: Our next question will come from Rob Hansen of Deutsche Bank.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So I just wanted to ask about the -- with the improvement in your balance sheet and liquidity situation, are you going to have a kind of bigger willingness to take on some of the more larger projects like multifamily projects, or be more aggressive in terms of opening new locations and new markets, or not?
M. Chad Crow: We're obviously still doing multifamily and light commercial work, and we'll look at it like we always have. If it's a project that makes sense for us from a profitability standpoint and a liquidity standpoint, then we'll certainly go after it. So I don't know that that's really changed. From a location standpoint, we've -- with our current footprint, I think we can handle close to $2 billion in revenue. And so in the near term, our main focus is going to be on getting those facilities up closer to full capacity. I think that's going to be the biggest bang for the buck in the near term. But with that being said, we'll certainly look at opportunities to go into new markets, whether it's a new location or acquisitions, but I'll say that's not -- certainly not the top of our list right now. As you know, last year, we opened a new location in Austin and one outside in Nashville, Tennessee, and those were opportunities that came along that made sense. And so if we have opportunities like that, we'll certainly take a hard look at it. But I don't know that, just because we did the refinancing, that our strategy really is going to change all that much.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, and I agree with all that Chad had to say.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then you mentioned that $2 billion figure. I just wanted to confirm. That would mean that when housing starts in kind of a normalized environment like $1.4 million or so, that's where you'd reach that $2 billion in sales on the current footprint?
Floyd F. Sherman: No, I think if you look at our current sales per U.S. single-family start, if we want to look at it on that basis at our current penetration rate, it would take a little over 870,000 single-family starts. We have really increased our market share and I think a lot of people haven't really focused on that where, in the past, when we did the $2 billion in sales, we had a 1.7 million single-family housing market. We can now do that same number, I think, somewhere at half that amount.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And in terms of that market share, sales per start penetration there, what categories have you seen the largest increases?
Floyd F. Sherman: I think it's pretty much right across the board. Right now, Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods has increased a little bit more because inflation helped drive that. But our component products are really gaining very nicely, the Windows & Doors, the Millwork categories. So we tried to go in with a full package proposition to our builder customers, and for the most part, we're successful in doing so. And so I think it's very broad-based for us.
Operator: And next, we have Seth Yeager of Jefferies.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research: So I think Floyd might have alluded to it a little bit, but are you able to help us quantify the gross profit or margin benefit that you had with just the timing of your contracts versus the decline in prices during the quarter for lumber goods?
M. Chad Crow: Well, not any more than we already stated in the earnings release and on the call already.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research: Okay, great. But maybe just the quarter, can you talk -- in May, I think you had, with the debt issuance, you had given some guidance. Can you talk about how trends move as rates sort of fluctuate? Do so you see any change in overall builder activity?
M. Chad Crow: For us, we just wrapped up a meeting with our area Vice President and they will tell you that on the East Coast and our markets, we had a tremendous amount of rain the last couple of months. And if anything slowed activity in our markets, it was the weather, it was the rain. And that's 1 reason we are very optimistic about how Q3's shaping up, is they really feel like there's a lot of construction that got to put on hold because of the weather.
Floyd F. Sherman: And I would also add to that, just as important as weather has been, there's definitely labor-related issues becoming more and more -- a larger problem out in our marketplaces.
M. Chad Crow: In a lot of subdivisions, you got slabs just sitting, waiting for framers, so that's kind of kept the lid on some of the growth as well.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research: And that kind of leads into my next question. You guys have seen some nice increases in your Prefab business as builders are sort of short staffed in trying to turn over homes. How much of that volume are you getting back versus -- I guess, the last couple of quarters versus inflation? What sort of level of activity would it take for you guys to get back to sort of your normal margins that you saw a few years ago in that business?
Floyd F. Sherman: I think it's going to take -- to get back, for us, at the more normal margins, I think we're going to have to start seeing a housing start rate, single-family, above 1 million single-family starts. I think until then, you're going to have a supply/demand imbalance in the distribution side of the business.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research: Got it. And then just maybe one housekeeping item. At this level of business, how should we think about your incremental working capital or maybe where you're at on today's basis? And then just an update on CapEx?
M. Chad Crow: Working capital will continue to trend as it has. It'll be about 10% of sales. And so as our sales continue to grow, you can pretty much count on working capital build at about 10% of that growth. CapEx, I think, this year, we're going to end up somewhere between $8 million and $10 million of CapEx. That's what we're looking at right now.
Operator: And next, we have Jack Kasprzak of BB&T Capital Markets.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Back to the gross margin question, just a little more color there, if I might. Commodity prices sort of stay where they are. Now you mentioned your margins are looking strong. So do you think that borrowing some volatility or a sharp increase in commodity prices, that we could see Q3 gross margins a little better than Q2? Is that kind of what you're pointing to?
M. Chad Crow: I think that's definitely a possibility. I can tell you from across the second quarter, from April to June, our margins improved 200 basis points. And so it's certainly trending in the right direction, and as we've already mentioned, July has started out strong as well.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: All right, great. And on the overall market, you mentioned comments there, too, but there's recently, as in, the past week or so, there's some concern about maybe housing slowing down, some of the home build orders coming in a touch light. It's obviously an ebb and a flow in every cycle. But are you guys seeing any sort of pause out there or anything that, in the underlying market, that would give you a little setback in terms of the outlook?
Floyd F. Sherman: Jack, I really -- we really haven't seen this. We just concluded about 2.5 day meetings area, VP manager and review meetings and we, of course, covered every single market that we're in. All of our people are still seeing a very healthy environment out there. Did not hear any areas that the pace of building was really getting ready to slow down. There is concerns as to -- of that labor is keeping a somewhat of a damper and the weather, up to the same degree, it has slowed down some of the building pace, but the demand for the houses and the builders are so as we get some sunny days and so they're buying some framers. The pace of building is going to be picking up. So from that standpoint, it looks like it's staying pretty good. It doesn't look like the change in mortgage rates when it rose and now it's pulling back. But that really hasn't seem to slow down the builders and on the future sales that we're hearing about. So it still looks very healthy out there for us out in all of our markets. I would say, the only consistent problem that we seem to be hearing is that the smaller builder is still having a very difficult time finding a source of the financing that will enable them to be active in acquiring the lots that they need to build on. The smaller builder is still feeling the pinch a lot more so than the large national or regional builders.
John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Got it. Okay. And Chad, you mentioned CapEx, $8 million to $10 million. Can you just maybe update us on where you think D&A will be this year?
M. Chad Crow: Probably $9 million to $10 million.
Operator: And David Williams of Williams Financial Group has our next question.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: I just had a quick question on the margins. You had not mentioned that there was about 60 basis points from volume and then maybe about 40 basis points from the mix and maybe prices. But what do you think, as far as the 60 basis point growth from the volume, is that something that you think is sticky? Or should we -- can we see that retreat a little bit as we move through the quarter here?
M. Chad Crow: No, I think that's going to be pretty consistent, if we continue to grow our sales like we have been.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then thinking about maybe on the lumber prices and what the top line impact or benefit could be, if we think about prices contributing about...
Floyd F. Sherman: David, you broke up and we lost you in the middle of your question.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: I apologize. Just thinking about the revenue and the comp line, if we think about 17.5% of revs were from pricing, what should we think about it as lumber prices kind of come down here for the top line growth?
M. Chad Crow: It could slow our growth down a little bit from that standpoint, but at the same time we're -- I also feel like we're getting price increases through. So net-net, I don't know that it's going to have a significant impact.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And one last one, if I could. I know that the Prefab Components has got about 60 basis points, I guess, Q-to-Q as a percentage of sales. What do you think is going on there? Is that maybe some pricing? Or is that just deeper penetration? Or maybe what's driving that increase?
Floyd F. Sherman: I think price is one of the factors, but I think even more than that is the labor issues that are cropping up in the field are certainly making components more attractive to the builders. We're seeing a continuation of the trend of builders wanting to make the switch back to components and even recognizing that traditional framing steel may be slightly more favorable from a cost standpoint. But from the -- from a labor standpoint, it definitely is a more attractive alternative, and I think that's probably as large a contributor to our increased sales of components.
Operator: Our next question will come from Scott Levine of Imperial Capital.
Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: So just kind of shifting back to pricing. I can appreciate that it's still very competitive out there, but your pricing growth contribution to your total revenue growth did improve in a period where cost inflation in the lumber side is abating. Would you say that the environment, the incremental data point regarding the pricing environment, is moving in the right direction or things are becoming a bit more predictable? Because I know you've highlighted efforts to go in with shorter pricing commitment periods and had to shift strategy based on what you've seen in the market and just wondering, if incrementally, the pricing environment is improving on the margin or not.
M. Chad Crow: It may be doing a little better from a pricing standpoint. To some degree, the builders, they are getting busier and so they are placing a higher value on service across the board. So from that standpoint, it may be getting a little easier on the pricing side, but certainly, I wouldn't say significantly easier, yes.
Floyd F. Sherman: I think if you talk with our salesman, they would not agree with what Chad is saying. We certainly -- every little bit helps, but we've got a long ways to go before we can really start saying that the pressure is easing.
Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Understood. And then turning to a little bit more color, perhaps, on the cash flow outlook. I know you guys don't give a specific guidance or anything like that, but maybe a little bit more color in your thoughts on the next couple of quarters in terms of operating cash. Are there any -- other than looking at 10% on working capital as a percent of sales, are is there any additional color you can give us in terms of whether you start to see improved operating cash flow in Q3 and Q4 and as you head into 2014?
M. Chad Crow: I think we absolutely will, especially with the lower interest. I think we should be positive cash flow the last 2 quarters of the year. And if we're not, like you said, it's only going to be because of the working capital build and our business continuing to grow. So we should see -- we should definitely see improvement on the cash flow side of things.
Operator: And next, we have Sam McGovern of Crédit Suisse.
Samuel McGovern - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I just had a couple of quick questions. Just -- I know you guys talked earlier about sort of the outlook for lumber prices and you guys hit upon working capital. But has something changed out there and you guys felt that the lumber prices were going to accelerate again and that you could possibly see a repeat of what you saw in the first quarter? Would you guys be more willing, given the increased liquidity, to sort of take out a longer inventory position in anticipation of that? Or what's your outlook on that?
M. Chad Crow: Yes, we -- I mean, if we really felt that, that was going to be the trend, then we're going to certainly utilize our position and protect ourselves, and that would mean, then, more working capital going into the inventory build. Right now, don't really see the need. We have -- we've gotten ourselves and we put ourselves in a position, I think, to pretty much get through the third quarter with some longer-term commitments that we used to cover our needs, as well as inventory that we've taken in during the month of July. So right now, we're feeling pretty good about our position for the third quarter. But if we felt that we were looking at another major spike that occurred from August or September of last year through March of this year, yes, we would go and buy in heavy in anticipation.
Samuel McGovern - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And could you also remind us about the status of your mothballed facilities? What's in the process of restarting and what's still down and what you may consider to restart in the future?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. We have reactivated 2 of our component plants, one in Florida, one in Maryland. The rest, we're going to as the business develops and as there is a need and where we know we can keep that plant operating at a legitimate level, or more than just a few weeks or months, we're going to -- we will reactivate those facilities. But that -- we keep looking at it and evaluating it, and right now, don't have anything that we're planning to reopen for the rest of the quarter.
Operator: And next, we have Daniel Downes of BC Holdings.
Daniel Downes: The visibility of your business, even if we do hit a bit of a bump in the road here as far as homebuilder orders, a lot of these homebuilders have pretty big backlogs, at least the larger public ones. Just curious, what kind of visibility do you feel like you have into your business as far as kind of months out or -- and then where do you think there's more risk or just more opaque where you can't see out of it, at what point?
Floyd F. Sherman: The -- we -- I -- from as far as visibility, we don't have any more or less visibility than we've always had and that's always been pretty short except for the feedback that we get from the builders in each one of the markets in which we operate. And right now, that continued to be very optimistic, and the projections that they're giving us and talking about what their building plans are for the remainder of the quarter and then into what will be our fourth quarter, their first quarter, still continues to be very healthy. So -- but we'll just have to react to that as we come to it. But the other question concerning our markets, right now, all of our markets are doing very well. I really can't say we have any troubled market other than maybe we have markets that are only seeing a 20% to 25% increase versus other markets that are seeing 50% and 60% and 70% increases, but hell, I don't think 20% increase is anything to be ashamed of. So right now, every one of our markets are looking very strong and very good.
Daniel Downes: Sounds good, yes. I got on the call a little bit late, so you may have addressed this already. But given the sharp decline in OSB and lumber prices recently, have you guys been able to do extend out your orders in order to kind of capitalize on these lower prices? Or to what extent can you, through discussions with the manufacturers, extend those out?
M. Chad Crow: So, it's not only to extend it out, but as Floyd commented on just a moment ago, we do feel like, with the buys that we made this month of July and what we have upcoming in the next couple of months, we're certainly in good shape for the quarter. And he also mentioned that if we feel like we're going to see a sharp run-up in prices, we might tend to get heavier on the buy side. But right now, that's not our feel. So we feel like we're in good shape for this quarter.
Operator: And next, we have Philip Volpicelli from Deutsche Bank.
Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: It's Phil Volpicelli, Deutsche Bank. We've had a lot of discussion on margins. I was just hoping if you could talk a little bit about prices on Windows & Doors. We've, I think, beaten Lumber pretty well. But what's going on with Windows & Doors? Are you seeing price increases to you there?
M. Chad Crow: Are we getting price increases on the input side or on the sale side?
Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: The cost. Well, I guess both. Are you getting input increases from the manufacturers? And are you able to pass them along?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. We are right now. We certainly are seeing increases from the manufacturers. We're doing our best to pass it on. We certainly are making every effort to do so. I would say we've been very aggressive in trying to push our margins, but a lot of that is dictated by what -- the competition that we face and what their pricing strategy is. And in some cases, we've been able to cover it. In other cases, on other materials -- certain materials, we haven't been able to get everything, but we've been able to get some of it. So it's just been, really, a mixed bag.
M. Chad Crow: But on the windows side of the business, our margins are certainly still very healthy.
Floyd F. Sherman: 9 They are still healthy. And for the most part, Windows in particular, we've been able to pass on the increases that we've seen.
Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Can you give us a magnitude of what the price increase from the manufacturers has been to you? Is it both single digits, mid-single digits, high-single digits?
Floyd F. Sherman: From the window manufacturers?
Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Windows and/or Doors, whatever information you're willing to provide, I'll take.
Floyd F. Sherman: If you look at the window manufacturers, most of it has been mid-single digit, to somewhere between 4% and 7%.
Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And on Doors, is it similar -- are Doors similar in range?
M. Chad Crow: On Door, yes, I would say that's been in that range and then you're always going to have certain situations where we have to work with the manufacturer to adjust the pricing to beat a certain situation and -- or from a timing standpoint, as to when that increase goes into effect. But the Doors and Windows, on a combined basis, they've been pretty much the same.
Operator: And next, we have Howard Weinberg with UBS.
Howard Weinberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Most of my questions actually have been asked and answered, so I only have one left, and it really goes back to the market share gains. And could you just talk a little bit about sort of your concentration? Obviously, the larger builders appear to be growing faster -- not appear, but they're growing faster than the rest of the market and whether or not you're able to get any additional wallet share from them. So to the extent that they were only purchasing lumber or prefab, are they able to go and sell Millwork and Windows and so forth and to sort of expanding beyond the market with your existing customer base?
M. Chad Crow: There's always room to improve your share of wallet with customers. Like you said, you may be selling them every product except interior trim for whatever reason. So you're constantly going after better increased share of the wallet, but on the other side of things, as we've already discussed, it's still very competitive out there and a lot of the business you do with the big builders bid every quarter. And so a lot of it is dictated by what happens on a competitive basis within each market as you're going through that quarterly bidding process. But I would say, certainly, a portion of our market share gains has been our ability to increase the share of the wallet with those builders.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Robert Kelly of Sidoti.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: A lot has been covered, but one of the things I wanted to ask was a follow-on to the previous question. A lot of your growth has been coming from basically hedging yourself to the wagon of the larger builder and they own a lot of price leverage against you. Could you just talk about the competition within each of your markets? Are you seeing it -- some of the lesser players either fall in line, discipline-wise, or start to go away or be shunned by the larger builder due to weaker service levels or liquidity constraints, something like that, that would allow you guys to have a brighter future on the price leverage side?
M. Chad Crow: Well, I think most of the pricing leverage we're going to get in the future is, as Floyd already commented on, we just need a healthier building environment. And while everything you read does indicate that bigger builders are taking market share, our mix of sales to the big builders has remained remarkably consistent in the last couple of years. If you look at our top 10 customers, it's been right around that 23%, 24% of sales. And if you look at the Builder 100, it's been right around 33%, 34% of sales. And like I said, it remained remarkably consistent. So it does feel like...
Floyd F. Sherman: There's a lot of that I have to point out. A lot of that, as Chad knows, is we specifically try to design our sales effort towards achieving and keeping the mix that we have. We really have been very, very aggressive and active in going and looking for that smaller builder and developing business with the smaller builder, whether he be a mid-zone priced builder or the high-custom builder. We've been adding significantly to our new accounts on a quarterly basis and this cumulatively has really been the reason for our ability to maintain that mix of 65-35. And that's what we're going to continue putting all efforts into doing and keeping that mix because that's needed in our business in order to be able to get the longer-term profitability that we haven't had.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Right. How about on the competition side? Have you seen some competitors fall by the wayside?
Floyd F. Sherman: Haven't really seen anyone falling by the wayside here for the last 6 months to 12 months. So I would have to say, yes, that's been pretty stable.
Operator: And we now have Shawn Boyd of Next Mark Capital.
Shawn Boyd: The turn in gross margin has been great. I know we talked about a decent amount, so really, I just want to look out a little bit and get away from the quarter. We talked, I think in the past, about getting back to a 24% to 25% level at around $2 billion a year in revenues. Do I have that correct? Or has that changed in any way?
M. Chad Crow: Yes. It could take a little bit healthier environment as far as starts because, at that level, you'll be talking about 850,000 starts or so. And I think we'll certainly see some nice margin improvement at that point. But I think to get all the way up to that, 25%, 26%, we're probably going to be needing somewhere closer to 1 million single-family starts.
Shawn Boyd: Got it. And if we put -- it's probably silly exercise to do it, but if we put lumber prices aside for a second, what would be the #2 and #3 drivers to getting to that level?
M. Chad Crow: I think the main drivers is going to be the construction activity. As Floyd pointed out earlier, we're still at a very, very low level of housing and we just need to get back to a more normal environment.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. And the continual conversion from conventional framing into the [indiscernible].
Shawn Boyd: Okay. And on the comment you made earlier, Floyd, regarding the wet weather we've had in the Southeast, can you quantify how much you guys might have lost in revenues in the quarter -- or not lost, but perhaps...
Floyd F. Sherman: Delayed.
Shawn Boyd: Yes, delayed, deferred, pushed out, just because it has been quite rainy and I'm just curious as to what that might have been.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. And again, you have to take it somewhat, I have to look at it and then go on and base it because I'm not out there, that certainly would belittle all of our people. But if you talk with our people, they would indicate or feel that, that number is probably somewhere between $10 million to $20 million of effect. I am not in a position that I could really say one way or the other how accurate that number is, but I think it is probably realistic.
Operator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does appear that we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sherman for any additional or closing comments.
Floyd F. Sherman: Okay. We appreciate everyone listening in today. And if you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to give Chad or Marcie Hyder a call here in Dallas. Thanks, and have a good day.
Operator: And with that everyone, that does conclude today's conference call. We'd like to thank you again for your participation.

Operator: Good morning,, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Mr. Floyd Sherman, Chief Executive Officer. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, April 26, 2013. The company issued a press release after the market close yesterday.

Floyd F. Sherman: Thank you and welcome to our first quarter 2013 earnings call. Joining me today from our management team is Chad Crow, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll start by giving a recap of the first quarter and then turn the call over to Chad, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions. Sales for the first quarter of 2013 were $319.7 million, an increase of 45.7% when compared to prior year's first quarter sales of $219.4 million. In addition, we reported first quarter 2013 adjusted EBITDA of $5.4 million, a $7.5 million improvement over 2012 first quarter adjustment EBITDA loss of $2.1 million. I'm very pleased to have started our fiscal year with such strong financial results. We were able to achieve top line growth of greater than 30% for 6 consecutive quarters. Even adjusted for commodity inflation, our current quarter sales increase, once again, exceeded the increase in residential construction activity as actual single-family housing starts in the south region increased 27.4% and single-family units under construction increased 23.2%. From a sales per start perspective, we ended the current quarter with $4,047 per south region single-family start, up significantly from $3,539 per start in the first quarter of 2012. As mentioned in yesterday's press release, though our sales growth for the quarter was very positive. The commodity lumber price inflation we experienced during the quarter once again played significant downward pressure on gross margins. Subsequent to setting first quarter customer pricing in late December, commodity lumber prices increased approximately 20% through the end of the first quarter. While we were able to obtain price increases from our customers during the quarter, they were not enough to offset the continued commodity price inflation. For the quarter, we estimate commodity lumber inflation negatively impacted gross margin by 1.8 percentage point. I'll now turn the call over to Chad who will review our financial results in more detail.
M. Chad Crow: Thank you, Floyd. For the current quarter, we reported sales of $319.7 million compared to $219.4 million for the first quarter of 2012, an increase of $100.3 million or 45.7%. We estimate sales increased 29.7% due to increased sales volume and 16% due to price. Breaking down our sales by product category, Prefabricated Components were $60.8 million, up from $43.5 million in the first quarter of 2012. Windows & Doors were $63.6 million, up approximately 28%. Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods were at $116.8 million, an increase of $50.4 million. Our Millwork category increased $7.7 million to $29.1 million. And Other Building Products & Services were $49.4 million, up 29%. From a sales mix perspective, Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods were 36.5% of total sales, up from 30.3% of total sales in the same quarter last year due primarily to commodity lumber price inflation. Excluding the impact of price inflation, Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods were down slightly as a percent of total sales, while Prefabricated Components in millwork were up slightly. Windows & Doors and Other Building Products & Services were relatively flat as a percent of total sales. Our gross margin percentage was 19.5% in the current quarter, down from 20.6% in the same quarter last year. We estimate price negatively impacted gross margins by 180 basis points, largely due to commodity lumber inflation during the quarter relative to fixed customer pricing commitments and was partially offset by a 70 basis point improvement due to increased sales volume. We estimate the commodity lumber inflation during the quarter combined with our limited ability to adjust intra-quarter customer pricing had a negative impact on gross margin dollars of over $5 million. To give you a specific example of one of our main commodity lumber products, at the beginning of the quarter, on average, across the entire company, we were selling this product at a gross margin of 14%. By the end of the quarter, we had raised our prices on this product, 20%. Unfortunately, by the end of the quarter, market prices for this product had increased 30%. So in spite of raising our sales prices 20% during the quarter, we could still not keep up with inflation, and by quarter end, we're selling this product at low single-digit margins. We have seen inflation subside in recent weeks, but only time will tell if this is just a temporary reprieve. Our selling, general and administrative expenses were $61.1 million, up $10.2 million or 20.2% from the same quarter last year, despite a 45.7% increase in sales. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense decreased to 19.1% in the current quarter from 23.2% in the same quarter of 2012. For the first quarter of 2013, our salaries and benefit expense, excluding stock compensation expense, was $37.7 million or 11.8% of sales compared to $31.1 million or 14.2% of sales in the first quarter of 2012. This increase is primarily related to higher sales commissions and additional staffing needs to service our increased sales volume. Delivery expense increased $1.4 million and other general and administrative expense increased $1.2 million, both a result of increased sales volumes. Interest expense was $12.5 million in the current quarter, a decrease of $600,000 from the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was primarily related to a $2.7 million reduction in the noncash fair value adjustment related to stock warrants issued in connection with our term loan, offset by the incremental interest on the additional term loan borrowed in December of 2012. We recorded $300,000 of income tax expense in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $200,000 in the first quarter of 2012. We recorded an after-tax noncash valuation allowance of $4.4 million and $7 million in the first quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to our net deferred tax asset. Absent the valuation allowance, our effective tax rate would've been 36.3% in both the first quarter of 2013 and 2012. As of the end of the first quarter, our gross federal income tax NOL available for carryforward was approximately $245 million. Loss from continuing operations was $11.6 million or $0.12 loss per diluted share compared to a loss of $19.1 million or $0.20 loss per diluted share in the same quarter last year. Excluding the fair value adjustment for stock warrants and the tax valuation allowance, our loss from continuing operations was $0.07 per diluted share for the current quarter compared to a $0.09 loss per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012. Our net loss for the first quarter of 2013 was $11.8 million, $0.12 loss per diluted share compared to a loss of $19.2 million or $0.20 loss per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.4 million for the first quarter of 2013, and as Floyd mentioned earlier, is a $7.5 million improvement over an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2012. Our cash used for the current quarter was $26.8 million. Of this amount, $18.9 million was due to a build in working capital related to our higher sales volume. The remainder of cash used was related to $1 million of capital expenditures, $10.9 million of cash interest offset somewhat by positive EBITDA during the quarter. We ended the quarter with liquidity of $102.7 million, which included $117.7 million of cash reduced by the $15 million minimum cash requirement contained in our amended loan agreement. During the current quarter, we amended and reduced our existing $20 million standalone Letter of Credit facility to $10 million. In addition, we transferred the $12.4 million of LCs outstanding under the standalone facility to our new $15 million LC sub facility. this transfer eliminated the cash collateral requirement for our outstanding LCs, and thus increased our overall liquidity at the time by $13 million. As of March 31, 2013, we had $12.6 million of LCs outstanding under our sub-facility and no LCs outstanding under our standalone facility. I'll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comment.
Floyd F. Sherman: Thank you, Chad. We are excited about the prospects for the homebuilding industry and the outlook continues to suggest favorable opportunities for Builders FirstSource. The National Association of Home Builders is now predicting a 24.2% increase in single-family housing starts for 2013 and an additional 28.8% increase in 2014. We believe Builders FirstSource is well positioned to take advantage of this recovery. Our strategy remains focused on increasing our market share and improving our operating margins as we move into the spring and summer building season. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: First question is on inventory ticking up a little bit. I guess, with the recent pullback in lumber prices, I mean, I would expect you guys are probably continuing to maybe build a little bit there. First off, is that an accurate assumption? And then secondly, if so, is -- how do we kind of think about that as we look forward in the impact to margins that you guys could expect over the next quarter or so, understanding the impact that the higher prices had on your margins here in the first quarter?
Floyd F. Sherman: I would say inventory levels are up, obviously, since year end, some of that's due to inflation. We are trying to make opportunistic buys, as they become available. As you said, prices have pulled back a little bit the last couple of weeks. We'll see what the future holds as to whether they stay at these levels or start to run up again. The buys we've made the last few weeks have certainly helped our inventory and cost position. But really, it's going to -- our margins in the next couple of quarters are going to be more determined on what lumber prices do over the next couple of months. And we'll just have to wait and see.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay, I appreciate that. And then also kind of on the same topic here, just kind of -- and I know it's -- you don't have a crystal ball, but just with a little bit of capacity looking like it's going to come on from -- in the mills here, looking out over the next several months, I mean, do you think that we could be getting into a situation where we could start to see at some point on the horizon, start to see lumber prices settle down as a result of that? Or how do you see the kind of supply demand dynamics within the industry kind of playing out as we look through this year?
Floyd F. Sherman: We don't really see any new lumber mills coming on stream, we see 3 OSB mills that will probably be opening and have already been announced to be open and start production this year.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Yes, OSB, that's what I meant.
Floyd F. Sherman: It's anticipated that those 3 OSB mills this year will probably add somewhere in the neighborhood of -- on a combined basis, somewhere around 700 million square feet. If you look at it, for every 100,000 new homes that are added, it requires over 1 billion square feet of 7/16 OSB to cover that -- the housing increase. The mills were operating close to capacity last year. The combined output of the OSB was about 17.5 billion square feet. So with the increased housing of this year, the new mills opening really aren't going to have much of an effect that we can see on bringing down the price of OSB. I think we have seen the major inflation in both OSB and lumber. And I think we're starting to get a point -- and I think both products are trying to find a point, where they could be more stabilization of pricing in the market. And I think we're going to see that. But I think suppliers are going to still continue to be tight for the rest of the year. Hopefully, those 3 mills will ease some of that, but I really don't think it's going to have a heck of a difference for us this year anyway. Maybe next year, that will begin to get some relief.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Great. And then the dollar per start moved up a little bit, it looked like. Is that just a function of higher lumber prices? Or are you guys seeing more share gains there as well?
Floyd F. Sherman: No, because we still took market share gain, if you look at it, even on the -- on a straight volume basis. And you looked at either from -- based on the single-family starts in the southern region, or if you looked at units under construction. The -- probably, I will say, our market share gain, if we probably slowed down a little from what we had experienced in previous quarters -- and most of that is being due. We are trying to be more selective in our pricing. We are trying to get better pricing in the marketplace and, obviously, there's trade off. It's still a very, very competitive market out there. Housing, while it still is much better than what it was in the past, 2012 was still a worst year on record for housing. Still, pricing is still a very competitive part of the market, and but we still have been able to really continue to increase that market share anywhere from, I guess, depending on what side of it you want to look at units, under construction which is a true measure for us or starts. It's still single -- low single- to high single-digit through market share gain.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Great. And one last one, and just kind of a housekeeping for Chad. The SG&A kicked down a little bit as percent of rev, is that a good run rate or should we expect to see that kind of move back up to the kind of 20% range as we kind of look out here for the balance of the year?
M. Chad Crow: I think that's probably a pretty good run rate.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division: You're not seeing the 19.5% or...
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Seth Yeager with Jefferies Investment Bank.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies & Company, Inc. Fixed Income Research: So can you give us a sense right now on where your gross margins are maybe across the segment? I understand if you don't want to get into too much detail, but particularly on the prefab business, where are you now versus, say the 2006, 2007 time period? And have you been able to sort of push pricing on the builders, particularly, in that segment?
Floyd F. Sherman: We have made up a lot of ground since the low point, which was probably back in 2010. Still have some ground to make up in that product category. That category does get impacted a little bit by inflation as well, not as significant as the Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods category. But we are starting to get better pricing, and then some margin improvement there.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies & Company, Inc. Fixed Income Research: Maybe just at a high level how -- peak to trough, where are you guys kind of sitting right now? Like halfway back, 3/4 of the way?
Floyd F. Sherman: I would say, Chad, we're maybe 1/3?
M. Chad Crow: We're not quite halfway there yet.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies & Company, Inc. Fixed Income Research: Okay, that's helpful then. Okay. And then just maybe a follow-up on a prior question. Now that you're close to $1.2 billion in revenue, incremental cash SG&A at this point? And I recall, if you guys had some additional lease expense that might run through with some further top line improvement, are you going to hit that number? And where is that going to run through your P&L? So if you could maybe just remind us.
Floyd F. Sherman: Any of that would run through -- it would run through SG&A, but that's a very small number. We don't have that many leases that have contingent lease payments based on rev.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies & Company, Inc. Fixed Income Research: Okay. And just your incremental cash at this point, maybe on SG&A? I know at a certain level, it kind of ramps up a little bit. But just to kind of get a sense right now?
Floyd F. Sherman: Are you referring to the variability of it?
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies & Company, Inc. Fixed Income Research: Yes.
M. Chad Crow: No. On sales volume, we're our probably going to be somewhere 50% to 60% variable on just sales dollars. It's going to be less than that if we keep seeing some lumber inflation and our ability to pass on price increases. Obviously, we can leverage our SG&A even better in that environment. So I would say it's kind of a blended rate. It's probably 50% variable.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies & Company, Inc. Fixed Income Research: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on cash flows, are you guys going to still spend, plus or minus $10 million or $11 million this year? Was first quarter sort of a timing issue on CapEx? And is it going to be a little more back end loaded this year?
M. Chad Crow: Yes, I still think CapEx will be probably in the $8 million to $9 million range for the year.
Seth B. Yeager - Jefferies & Company, Inc. Fixed Income Research: Okay, perfect. And then just last one, can you remind us what make-whole and your term loan is currently, and just what the schedule looks like going forward?
Floyd F. Sherman: The make-whole right now, I believe, is about $41 million, $42 million. It comes down around $7 million a quarter. It comes down evenly through the end of December '14.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Daniel Downes with B.C. Holdings.
Daniel Downes: The -- was wondering, have you seen any noticeable divergence between buying patterns in large homebuilders versus small homebuilders? It seems kind of a perception that the large homebuilders are taking share and doing much better?
Floyd F. Sherman: From our standpoint, our mix has remained very, very consistent the last year, 1, 1.5 years, between the larger builders and the smaller builders. So while we are growing alongside the large builders, we're certainly adding a lot of new customers and growing our share with the small guys as well. So for us, it's been remarkably consistent.
Daniel Downes: Okay. You know you're volumes were great, up 30% in the quarter. I was just wondering, did you guys see any distinguishable -- was there any cadence in month-to-month activity, where January was up and February was not up as much? And also any commentary on how business momentum is, and volume's kind of thus far into April?
Floyd F. Sherman: We continue to accelerate the -- on our average daily shipments, all the way starting through January. February was better than January. March was much better than February. And this pace is continuing on through the April. So we are seeing a steady escalation in our business.
Daniel Downes: Would you attribute that escalation just to normal seasonality or was it kind of -- was it escalating as far as the percentage growth on the year-over-year basis?
Floyd F. Sherman: I think it's more than seasonality. So long as we are continuing to take and gain positive market share gain, I think that -- and, obviously, seasonality does figure into it, but still, on a month-to-month comparison, quarter-over-quarter comparison, all those are up and accelerating.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Williams with Williams Financial Group.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: I wanted to ask, we had talked a little bit about you seeing some share gains and just your dollar cost per start, but I wondered if you could give us an idea maybe of if you're seeing anything, any trends in the size of homes or maybe the dollar per -- maybe a package that you guys are shipping out. And is there any contribution maybe from that as opposed to actual market share gains?
Floyd F. Sherman: I really haven't seen any stats that would say that there's been a significant change in the average square footage of home being built. They -- everything we're seeing is still saying it's pretty close to where it was a year ago.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Okay, very good. So you feel pretty confident that, that number is moving maybe in lockstep with market share gains and not some other maybe sizing issues or other maybe outside issues?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. And we really haven't seen, David -- we have not really seen a major change. We're hopeful that this will come, because we're reading a lot about how builders are starting to sell more upgrades and put a lot of extras into the home and -- but we haven't really started seeing it that much. And that will certainly impact us favorably as we go forward, should that trend take place. We're still seeing -- the builders are still very concerned about the pricing of the home, keeping it, making sure that it's affordable and the -- but there's been a lot of talk that the consumer is again starting to turn and look for a more upgraded home. And that will be very positive for us.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Got it. Thanks. And then secondly, I wanted to just see if maybe you could talk a little bit about what's going on in the prefab component part of the business. You said that it was up a little bit, and on an inflation-adjusted basis, I guess, against the Lumber & Sheet Goods. That was down a bit. But what are you seeing as far as trends? Is it maybe increased adoption rates? Or is it just simply a function of increased volume sales?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. We are -- we're definitely seeing an uptick in our component sales. We believe this trend will continue. Right now, our backlog for those items is the largest it's been in -- going back to the '06 -- '05, '06 period, and that's continuing to grow. So I think there very definitely is one of the factors that's impacting that is the labor issues that we have out in our industry. And that then helps the component side of the business. And I think the labor situation is not going to rectify itself very quickly and as that particular problem continues, I think there'll be a conversion more and more to the use of components.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Sure, sure. And then lastly, if I could, we've talked a lot about not being able to change your pricing strategy intermediately during the quarter. But in talking with a few of your peers over the last couple of months, it seems like some of those guys, at least on a regional basis, are doing maybe shorter lock periods, 30 days to 45 days, even with their larger customers. And so I wanted to see, are you seeing anything maybe in that trend? Have you been able to bring any of that pricing back or those contract locks into a shorter timeframe?
Floyd F. Sherman: No. I would like to say that I believe what they are saying, we certainly are not seeing it. We compete with all of the majors for -- especially for the business with the large national builder, and I can say we have not seen that taking place. Hopefully, it will. Because in these highly inflationary times, that certainly is a better approach to pricing than extended pricing. And we certainly have been trying to get it. And we've really been -- put a lot of effort into it. But unfortunately many of our competitors they didn't go along with it and we ended up having to change our approach. So with that said, I'll leave it at that.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: That's very Interesting. And like I said, it was really more of a regional, I guess, phenomenon where there were a couple of folks that we talked to that said, yes, we're really targeting 30 days to 45 days on extreme cases 60 days. So I assume if that was anything you're seeing, or maybe that was very specific case in the regional market.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. I haven't seen that in any of our regions.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Robert Kelly with Sidoti Research.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: A question -- a point of clarification. Someone had asked earlier about the SG&A run rate and you kind of okayed it. What was it the percent of sales run rate or the kind of like the year-over-year increase? Or was it the dollar level? I guess, that wouldn't makes sense?
Floyd F. Sherman: He was asking the percent of sales.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Percent of sales and the 19% range reached for the full year?
Floyd F. Sherman: Right.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: You'd be in the 19% range?
Floyd F. Sherman: I certainly think that's achievable, yes.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Right. I would just think it would be -- just given, what you have in 1Q and what you probably have common in 2Q that you could probably do better than that on the full year.
M. Chad Crow: We will certainly be trying to do that.
Floyd F. Sherman: I don't think it's going to go higher, let's say that.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay, fair enough. As far as the 90-day price locks, were you able to secure additional pricing when you went to your customers at the end of 1Q? I mean, basically, have you caught up to the inflation you saw thus far in 2013?
Floyd F. Sherman: We've certainly put a big dent in it. With a lot of the pricing, you do have some bleed over into the next month following a quarter, especially if a customer turned a PO in, say, at the end of March and we didn't ship until April. So we do have some bleed-over pricing, but we certainly put a dent in it.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Some of the builders in the 1Q calls were talking about intentionally kind of slowing down the pace of sales to focus on price and margin. It seems like they've been doing a great job getting their selling prices up, which would help you guys get your pass through. Has the conversation changed at all as far as them being accepting of price increases?
M. Chad Crow: I would say it's never easy getting price increases, but we are having success. It's a battle. Every time you go out there to price, it's still a battle. Like Floyd said, it's still a very competitive environment. We're still building at historically low levels of housing. So I'm not going to sit here and say it's easy by any means, but we are having some success, and we'll keep pushing.
Floyd F. Sherman: I was going to say, you're always going to have -- in a competitive pricing environment, you're going to have some people who think the market's going to fall and work to their favor and you have other people who believe otherwise. And it affects then, obviously, your pricing strategy. So you're continually contending with those forces out there. And I do believe that the commodities are beginning to maybe level out to where it becomes a more predictable level of pricing. And that certainly will help us, as we go forward in the quarter. We set our pricing at the beginning of the quarter, and we obviously take into account what we think replacement costs are going to be and what our costs and inventory are, and then set that pricing. And hopefully, the inflation that occurs during the next quarter doesn't exceed what has been -- than what we've set in our pricing like it did in the first quarter. These had been very, very unusual times. I've never experienced anything like what we've gone through over the last several quarters as far as market inflation, and -- but it's becoming now more predictable. And I really think it's going to be a lot more controllable. And I think we're going to have a lot better pricing success. And I think our margins are going to reflect it in the coming quarters.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Right, so based on all that, should we expect gross margin compression year-over-year for the balance of 2013? Or should we be thinking more along the lines of the 19.5% you booked in 1Q, will we start to see expansion of that rate as we move forward into the year?
Floyd F. Sherman: I would certainly like to think that going to be our low watermark for the year.
M. Chad Crow: Right.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: That's a good place to think about 2013 being -- in assuming lumber stays where it is?
Floyd F. Sherman: I would expect to see improvement on that in subsequent quarters.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. Okay, fair enough. And then just as far as the CapEx that you are spending this year. I believe you said $11 million was the number. What exactly are we talking about for CapEx? Is it just retooling? Is it your maintenance CapEx?
M. Chad Crow: It's probably going to be $8 million to $9 million, and it's going to be primarily related to expanding our delivery equipment.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Right, okay. But there's no expansion of footprint?
M. Chad Crow: No, there's no new facilities in that number.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: At what point do you need to do capacity expansion?
M. Chad Crow: I think we could push $2 billion in revenue with our current footprint.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: $2 billion with the current footprint, and with the current fleet?
M. Chad Crow: Not with the fleet, but with the facilities.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Whats the next step up for the fleet as far as your revenue level?
Floyd F. Sherman: It's going to be every year.
M. Chad Crow: It's going to grow as long as our revenues grow, and it'll keep growing. To the extent we can, we generally lease that equipment, but there are some -- there's some specialized equipment in some situations where it just makes more sense to buy. And that's the part you're seeing on the CapEx side.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. And just one final one. The assumption is that the lumber inflation, you kind of get hurt from a timing perspective in the commodity products, but there's a detriment to the prefab product right, that's a set price kind of product. What is the competitive pricing landscape in prefab? I mean, we've heard for so many years now, excess capacity and kind of predatory pricing from the guys at the lower end trying to hang onto business. Is that still the case? Or has the rising tide of lumber cost instilled a little discipline in the components business?
Floyd F. Sherman: It has instilled a little more discipline, but there's still -- it still is a very competitive environment, but we are not seeing the -- some of the craziness that we saw 1 year or 1.5 years ago. And I think that the industry is no longer, especially with the labor situation, is no longer fighting that, the issue that you had when you had low material costs and low labor cost. It made it very, very difficult. And people like ourselves, you had to put so much business through your plants in order to absorb the fixed cost that you had in the plant. And so there were some very, very aggressive pricing. But that certainly has improved noticeably over the last 6 months in particular.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Matthew Dodson with JWest LLC.
Matthew Dodson : Just one quick question for you. On your prefab, can you talk about your utilization right now. And then you talked about your backlog being as big as it is, how that will kind of matriculate through the year?
Floyd F. Sherman: Right now, I would say across the board, we're probably operating at about 60% of our capacity or utilization of our facility. We -- in one particular area, we have had to open one of our mothballed facilities in order that we could take care of the demand, and that has already been put in place. And we have now opened that facility and ramping it up, so -- but across the board, we're probably about a 60% utilization.
Matthew Dodson : And as you get to say 80% utilization, can you kind of help us understand the incremental margins?
M. Chad Crow: I think on an overall basis, you'd probably be looking at anywhere from 50 to 150 basis points margin expansion.
Floyd F. Sherman: The vast majority of our margin enhancement is going to come from pricing.
M. Chad Crow: For that particular product category, it will be greater, obviously, but on a consolidated basis, that's probably a good estimate.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Ethan Steinberg with SG Capital.
Ethan Steinberg - SG Capital Management LLC: So I just -- I'm a little confused on a couple of things. I want to make sure I understand. If you set the price at the end or at the beginning of the month, a lot of these prices have come down, at least, in the spot market in this past month. I guess as you cycle through the rest of April, I assume May we'll start to see a cleaner sense of what your gross margin should be?
M. Chad Crow: That's correct.
Ethan Steinberg - SG Capital Management LLC: Okay. So I think through 180 basis points of pressure that created in the first quarter, which was sort of a perfect storm if you look at what lumber input costs did, this is the first time in a couple of years it seems like lumber has started to stabilize and listening to a lot of the folks that make it this quarter, they seem to think it is leveling out, whether it bounces a little from where it is now. I guess, I want to understand a little more what that gross margin for you all should do as we start -- if we do see that input level out. It seems like there's quite a bit of a room from the 19.5% or 20% level?
M. Chad Crow: Yes, there is. And there's, obviously, other factors that impact our margin, the competitive landscape and the pricing competition. But if you look at the first quarter, our margins were relatively strong the first 2 months of the quarter, and then we got slammed in March because of the inflation, and we were out having to replenish inventory. As I said earlier, we had the bleed-over pricing in April. So April started out rough as well, but it had started to improve. And so in your scenario, if lumber prices stay relatively flat the rest of the quarter, then we should see some very nice margin improvement in May and June. And so given the fact that the first quarter had one bloody month in it and the second quarter is starting out that way and should recover, then you could look at the math and say, "Well, if it cost is 180 bps in Q1, maybe we can recover the majority of that in Q2." We'll just have to wait and see how things play out.
Ethan Steinberg - SG Capital Management LLC: And I guess can you help us understand, if, let's say, prices held where they are today, where do you think that normal gross margin would be for you?
M. Chad Crow: If we were selling the commodity lumber products, what I would call a normal historical margin, if you go back over the years in a healthy housing environment, what we could expect to get on those products, I think we could have been around 22% margin in Q1. There's a lot of what-ifs in that. But in a normal environment and normal pricing environment, that's what I would have expected.
Ethan Steinberg - SG Capital Management LLC: Yes, and I guess on -- okay. And if lumber is down now, then you get -- you might actually swing above that for a little, for a month or 2 as you get the other side of that pendulum?
M. Chad Crow: Well, again, I wouldn't call this a normal environment. We're still at very low levels and still very competitive. So I wouldn't go out on a limb, and say it's going to get that strong, that quick. We still need help from the overall housing environment.
Ethan Steinberg - SG Capital Management LLC: Okay. If we -- in today's environment, you don't think it could be a 22% run rate by the end of this quarter, just on stuff that you're buying and, I guess, selling?
M. Chad Crow: No. I think that would be a tad optimistic.
Ethan Steinberg - SG Capital Management LLC: Okay. And then I just jumped off the Weyerhaeuser. call. And I think they said that the engineered wood products business saw the most improvement, I guess, in pricing or strength through the quarter. It was coming off a pretty weak point. Does that have implications for you guys? Or does that -- does it feel like that is happening for you as well?
Floyd F. Sherman: That certainly is a major product item for us, and we are a very good Weyerhaeuser customer. They have been able to push through some price increases, but unfortunately, they don't sell to the builder. And we have to sit and sell the product to the builder and fight with whether it be Boise or LP in competition for that business. And while Weyerhaeuser might be doing a lot better with a product, we aren't. And it's -- we've been able to get some of that price increase, but when you are divorced from having to deal with the builder and when it's a -- when you're in a position, you take it or leave it, and it's -- you have so much of your sales program built around the product, that makes it a lot tougher. Ultimately, I expect that we're going to be able to get it. But we can't move as quickly as Weyerhaeuser does.
Ethan Steinberg - SG Capital Management LLC: Okay. And sorry, just last question. That volume being 30% I thought was great in the quarter. And it sounded like the gentleman who asked the cadence of that was some acceleration on a year-over-year basis, sort of through the quarter through today?
M. Chad Crow: Yes.
Operator: We'll take our final question from Shawn Boyd with Next Mark Capital.
Shawn Boyd: Just two, and if I could, I want to go back to a comment, Floyd, that you made earlier. Can you elaborate a little bit on -- it sounded like you said you did test a different pricing strategy and it kind of didn't work to well, and you had to reverse that. Was that in a particular region, was it just a small point in time, and just tell us a little bit more about that?
Floyd F. Sherman: That was, if we wanted the business, we were going to have to give our 90-day price. And the -- we tried to go, and we had been hearing that the competition in the fields were going with shorter pricing and 30-day and 45-day pricing. We obviously, didn't find that to be the case, and we had to make adjustments in that. And we lost, in fact, to some of the people who are claiming that they are 30-day and 45-day. We walked away from some business, because the pricing was just wasn't acceptable to us. And it was still 90-days, and they were still insisting that they're only given 45. So I have a little bit of a jaundiced view of -- when it comes to listening to what people say versus what they do.
Shawn Boyd: I get it, okay. And so that's where the market is? Is that where you're seeing -- is that what the large public builders and the smaller privates are demanding? Or is it really dependent upon scale...
Floyd F. Sherman: For the most part, it's the large -- national large regional builders who are looking for longer pricing periods. We do, I guess, probably 1/3 of our business -- 30% of our business is probably on less than that 90-day. And we always have done a lot of 30-day, 45-day pricing. There are some large builders who still will price on 30-days and always have, because they feel that they can catch enough variations in the commodity markets that over the long term, that works to their advantage. And I would have to agree with them. I personally think that the 30-day pricing is the better pricing strategies for all of us in the industry. But you have to react to what the customers want and try to accommodate the customers and we do that.
Shawn Boyd: I got it, okay. And the only other question on that is has there been any sort of -- I want to say like a test program. Or could you take a particular region of the country or even a particular state and sort of say, "Okay, I know I'm going to give up x amount -- 20%, 25% of the business. What am I going to see in margins though? And what am I going to see from a cash flow standpoint?"
Floyd F. Sherman: We look at that on an -- and almost all businesses continually -- you are continually evaluating what you walk away points, what are the tradeoffs, and so forth. I can tell you in the first quarter we walked away from in excess of $20 million worth of business because the pricing was just not acceptable to us. I suspect from what I have seen already in the second quarter that, that number will probably be closer to $30 million worth of business. But you can, as business conditions improve, you can be more price selective, and you do have an ability to get better pricing. But the -- we look at it by individual markets and on -- and across regions when we're making those determinations. But I can't -- had we taken that business, almost all of that business would have been low single-digit margin for us, as the quarter played out, had we taken it. So I can't say well, what would the margins have been had we taken it. You can go back and calculate that, but it would've cost us probably somewhere between close to 70, if not 100 basis points.
Shawn Boyd: Right, right, okay. And going back to the comments about the OSB capacity. You want to do some really helpful math, Floyd, in terms of the incremental capacity that's coming on from the 3 mills and what that is relative to the improvement in housing starts kind of on, I think you said,per 100,000 basis. We're seeing these prices level off to correct -- lumber prices level off to come in a little right now. But quite -- to be quite frank with you, given that math that you laid out, it sounds like you don't you really expect them to stay down that long. Is that fair?
M. Chad Crow: Yes. That's fair. I do not expect the prices -- right now, there have been some conditions, because of bad weather in the Midwest, bad weather in the Northeast. It really has slowed down the pace of building in certain parts of the country. Extreme wet weather in the Southeast has also affected it. Some of the mills have temporarily built up an inventory. You had people starting to sit on the sidelines, who normally would've been ordering on a regular basis. We're kind of waiting, because they were saying, "Hey, I can't get the prices at where they -- from my customer, where the market pricing is, so I'm going to sit and see what happens." And the mills have finally have to get to point where they've got to move that excess out. And that's when you get this temporary fall on pricing as they attempt to do that. And I think that has been done. I really anticipate that we are going to see the prices come back up to somewhere near the level of where they were. But I think that will be on a more stable basis and is comparable to where we were back in '05 and '06. And it's from all of our research, and we do very close research on both the lumber industry, as well as on the OSB industry. Right now, these industries are operating, at current level of housing, they're in that 80% to 90% capacity range. They've taken a lot of mills off stream, and they're going to be very slow to add them, and what they're trying to do, I believe, is get to a stable pricing environment. And I think we will see that in during the summer months.
Shawn Boyd: Got it. Last question for me. Chad, in terms of the cash usage, the $26 million that we saw in the quarter, it was certainly a bit of an eye-opener. I understand the working capital constraints. Do you expect to burn a similar amount this quarter? And does this pull in your thinking at all in terms of doing something longer term on the liquidity? And I guess, we have to caveat that with the issues with the make hold. Anything you can give us on that would be helpful?
M. Chad Crow: It's really hard to predict what lumber prices are going do and how much our working capital is going to grow, and our sales continue to increase at a rapid pace. I don't think we'll see as much burn in the second quarter or the third quarter. I'm hoping that the working capital build will start to slow, but we'll see. In any event, I still think we have ample liquidity in the near term. I would still expect in the year with at least $90 million of cash, maybe closer to $100 million. So from a liquidity standpoint, we have no immediate concerns. As far as the refinancing, certainly the refinancing market is still very favorable, and we continue to take a hard look at our options there and what might be available. But for the near term, I'm not concerned about our liquidity needs.
Operator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Sherman, I'll turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.
Floyd F. Sherman: Okay. We appreciate your dialing in and following our company. And we certainly are looking forward to a continuation of the improved financial performance for the company.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Floyd F. Sherman: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Call. Joining me today from our management team is Chad Crow, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer. I'll start with a recap of the fourth quarter and fiscal year, then I'll turn the call over to Chad, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions. Our sales for the fourth quarter 2012 were $287.6 million, an increase of 49.3% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, which helped generate our first quarter of positive operating income since the third quarter of 2007. As a comparison, actual single-family starts in the South Region increased 25.6% during the quarter, while single-family units under construction increased 20.2% over the same time period, indicating we're continuing to grow our market share. For fiscal year 2012, we ended the year with close to $1.1 billion in sales, up 37.4% over fiscal year 2011, and we reported full year adjusted EBITDA of $6.4 million, a $21.5 million improvement over 2011. Since 2007, our company, through hard work and sacrifice and with the unwavering support of our shareholders, has weathered the worst housing recession in our nation's history. To say I'm proud of what our employees have accomplished in recent years would be an extreme understatement. The housing industry continues to strengthen. Our sales per ship day in the fourth quarter exceeded that of the third quarter, which is highly unusual, given the seasonality of our business. And our Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 million was our strongest quarter of the year. On a sequential quarter basis, we were able to improve our gross margins by 40 basis points, in spite of a commodity inflation of over 20% during the current quarter. From a U.S. single-family housing starts perspective, 2012 ended with 534,600 actual starts, up 24.2% over 2011, although that is still well below the historical average of 1.1 million single-family units per year. I'll now turn the call over to Chad, who will review our financial results in more detail.
M. Chad Crow: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning, everyone. For the current quarter, we reported sales of $287.6 million compared to $192.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of $94.9 million or 49.3%. Our quarter-over-quarter top line sales growth was driven by an estimated 38% increase in volume and an 11% increase in price. Breaking down our sales by product category. Prefabricated Components were $52.9 million, compared to $35.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Windows & Doors were up 32% to $62.3 million. Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods were $96.4 million, an increase of $42.1 million. Our Millwork category increased $8.2 million to $28.3 million. And Other Building Products & Services increased 34.2% to $47.7 million. From a sales mix perspective, Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods were 33.5% of total sales, up from 28.2% of total sales in the fourth quarter of 2011, due primarily to commodity price inflation. All other categories were fairly consistent between periods from a mix standpoint. Our gross margin percentage was 20.2%, down from 20.4%, a 20 basis-point decrease. We estimate price negatively impacted gross margins by 120 basis points, largely due to commodity lumber inflation during the quarter, relative to fixed customer pricing commitments, and was offset by a 100 basis-point improvement due to increased sales volume. On a sequential quarter basis, our gross margin increased from 19.8% to 20.2%, despite another quarter of commodity inflation. Our selling, general and administrative expenses were $57.8 million, up $10.7 million or 22.8% from the same quarter last year, compared to a 49.3% increase in sales; included as a reduction to SG&A expense, the $600,000 of proceeds from a litigation settlement during the current quarter. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense decreased to 20.1% in the current quarter, from 24.4% in the same quarter of 2011. For the fourth quarter of 2012, our salaries and benefit expense, excluding stock compensation expense, was $36.8 million or 12.8% of sales, compared to $27.1 million or 14.1% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily related to higher sales commissions and additional staffing needs to service our increased sales volume. Delivery expense increased $1.3 million as a result of the increased sales volume. Interest expense was $11 million in the current quarter, an increase of $2.9 million from the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to the issuance of our term loan in December of 2011. We recorded $200,000 of income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to $300,000 in the fourth quarter of 2011. We recorded an after-tax noncash valuation allowance of $3.6 million and $6.5 million in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively, related to our net deferred tax assets. Absent devaluation allowance, the effective tax rate would have been 31.3% and 38% in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of the end of the year, our gross federal income tax NOL available for carryforward was approximately $237 million. Loss from continuing operations was $11 million or a $0.12 loss per diluted share, compared to a loss of $16.6 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. Excluding facility closure costs, the litigation settlement, the fair value adjustment for stock warrants and the valuation allowance, our loss from continuing operations was $0.08 per diluted share for the current quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2011, loss from continuing operations per diluted share was $0.09, when excluding facility closure costs, debt issue costs write-offs and the fair value adjustment for stock warrants and the tax valuation allowance. Loss from discontinued operations was $1 million or a $0.01 loss per diluted share, compared to a loss of $100,000 for the fourth quarter of 2011. Loss from discontinued operations in the current quarter was primarily related to an adjustment to record held for sale real estate at its fair market value. Our net loss for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $12 million or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $16.7 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.4 million, our strongest quarter of the year, and represents a $6.7 million improvement when compared to a loss of $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of last year. We did not experience the seasonal reduction in working capital we had anticipated, given the robust sales performance we saw during the last 3 months of 2012. This strong sales performance, combined with commodity price inflation, resulted in our working capital actually increasing during the quarter by approximately $12 million. Components of working capital continued to be healthy, however, as our accounts receivable days for the quarter were 36, an indication our portfolio is strong to quite strong. Inventories' turns improved to 9.2 turns, compared to 8.7 turns for the fourth quarter of 2011, and accounts receivable days were 30. Our cash usage for the current quarter was approximately $18.9 million, excluding the net effects of our recently completed term loan amendment. Of this $18.9 million, $12.2 million was attributable to increased working capital needs and $1.2 million related to capital expenditures. The remaining $5.5 million was used for cash interest, offset somewhat by cash provided from operations. On December 17, 2012, we amended our $160 million first-lien term loan agreement to enhance our liquidity position, to support both current and anticipated increases in sales volume. Terms of the amendment, including increasing the principal by $65 million, reducing the minimum cash requirement from $35 million to $15 million, adding a new $15 million letter of credit facility, and increasing the minimum specified collateral value to $225 million, contingent upon maintaining certain levels of qualified cash. These amendments to our term loan increased our year-end liquidity by approximately $80 million. We ended the year with unrestricted cash of $131.4 million and net liquidity of $116.4 million, after giving effect to the $15 million minimum cash requirement contained in our amended term loan agreement. In addition to the $131.4 million of cash, we had $14 million in restricted cash at December 31, 2012, of which $1.9 million was included in long-term assets. Restricted cash consists of approximately $13 million used to collateralize outstanding LCs and $900,000 used as collateral for other casualty insurance obligations. In conjunction with the revisions to our LC facilities made subsequent to year end, we freed up an additional $13 million of liquidity by eliminating the cash collateral requirement on our outstanding LCs. I'll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd F. Sherman: Thank you, Chad. The momentum we gained in 2012 appears to have carried over into 2013. We believe the housing industry will continue to recover even further in 2013 and that Builders FirstSource is well-positioned to take advantage of this recovery. The recent amendment to our term loan gives us substantial additional liquidity to continue growing our business at an accelerated rate. We look forward to building on what was a very successful 2012. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Richard Paget with Imperial Capital.
Richard S. Paget - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about pricing. Is most of that on the Lumber side? Or are you getting it across the board?
Floyd F. Sherman: We are seeing increases just about on -- in all product categories, but by far and away, the most inflationary part of the -- of our businesses is coming from the Lumber side.
Richard S. Paget - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then, I mean, whether you look at it on revenues per single-family housing starts in the South or just in general, your sales per start is -- has been growing pretty substantially. Is there kind of an upper limit to this? Or do you think that fourth quarter level, you guys can continue to achieve that level?
Floyd F. Sherman: Well, I think that as long as we continue doing the job of servicing the market, servicing our customers, ensuring that we have adequate inventories to support our sales, that we can continue growing our market share and increasing our -- the sales per start.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Patrick Cliggett: This is actually Patrick Cliggett sitting in for Trey this morning. Just my first question, with the price of lumber rising so quickly, I would imagine it can be difficult to kind of pass that pricing along to end customers, in time to recoup that margin, particularly this quarter. That said, how should we think about your ability over time to kind of recapture that margin through price increases? And what level of success do you guys have in, say, today this quarter 1Q, in terms of passing along additional price increases?
M. Chad Crow: That's been the biggest challenge for us for the last 4 or 5 quarters. It's like we've been swimming upstream for over a year now. If you look at last year, from the beginning of 2012 to the end of '12, on average, the prices were up over 50%. And so far, in the first quarter of this year, they're up another 8% to 10%. So we're obviously giving price increases pass-through, or we wouldn't even be able to hold our margins flat, much less improve them slightly on a sequential quarter basis. But it's going to continue to be a challenge, as long as we're seeing this inflation, because you're always lagging behind a bit on giving your price increases pass-through, and then if the prices are continuing to -- continue to rise on you, you're constantly chasing that number. But we're still confident once these prices level off, that we're going to -- we'll get caught up on pricing and we'll see margin improvement. But so far this quarter, it's still been a challenge.
Floyd F. Sherman: But I'd like to point out, Chad, in the fourth quarter, we did increase our margins on the commodity side of the business. As slight as it was, it was still, in spite of horrific inflation in the fourth quarter, which exceeded -- was over 20%, we still -- we managed to be able to slightly improve on our margin on the commodity products.
Patrick Cliggett: Okay. And just a follow-up question. How should we think about working capital needs going forward? You mentioned that they were up $12 million this most recent quarter, but you also had that -- the substantial improved liquidity. I just want to get your thoughts, how we should think about this going forward, given that, again, the continued rise in lumber combined with your strong volume performance?
M. Chad Crow: Well, historically, our working capital trend's at about 10% of sales. So I would expect whatever incremental sales we can generate this year, that working capital is probably going to grow at about 10%.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Robert Kelly with Sidoti.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Question on -- you talked about in the release, the momentum continuing into '13. And it seems like what the public builders are saying, especially for 4Q, points to a pretty big percentage increase again in 2013 for single-family construction. When you talk about momentum spilling into 2013, I mean, do you see another year of 25%, 30% unit growth?
M. Chad Crow: I think that certainly -- that could certainly be the case. Yes.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. And then as far as, not only the builders, your customers are starting to see volume pickup, they've also been benefiting from higher selling prices. At what point does the pass-through of inflation get a little bit easier for a supplier like yourselves?
M. Chad Crow: Well, 2 things would certainly help that cause. One would be for the inflation to settle down so we can get caught up, and then second, we're still at a relatively low level of housing starts and so obviously, the more construction activity we can see, that should help lessen the pricing pressure as well.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. And then just one final one. Part of the issue with margin is inflation, but part of it is to the competitive angle. Your competitors are still pricing to win market share. I mean, is that kind of a fair assumption?
M. Chad Crow: Yes, they're still very competitive.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, I think one of the things that you have to look at in our side, and especially on the commodity side of the business, everybody views the market in a different way. It's very, very -- when you're having the type of inflation we're having and you're giving longer-term pricing 60-, 90-day forward pricing, everybody has a different view of where they think that market's going and what the cost structure's going to be and where they bid. And it's still a highly competitive market. We still have more supply than there is demand, and I think that's what really is creating the issues that we've had on improving the margins on this side of the business. I think that we, or at least we would hope, that we're going to begin seeing this issue and this problem begin to subside some as -- at -- because at these higher levels, you just can't afford to make a mistake. And I think people are going to start getting more cautious and being less aggressive in their pricing, in order to prevent that catastrophe from hitting them on -- as they look out and price further and further out.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Right. I mean, that is kind of where I was going with this. $400 lumber on the commodity side, another potentially 30% increase in volume for the industry in '13 after a big year in '12. I mean, at what point have you started to see some of the competitive conditions ease? Is that what we should read into the sequential gross margin improvement during 4Q?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, we are beginning to see some signs of it. We're beginning to hear some -- certainly, some improving pricing conditions in a number of our markets. I think what we're going to probably find and I would hope to be able to -- that we will see, is we're going to see less and less of long-term pricing, 60- and 90-day pricing gets extremely risky under these conditions, and especially on the distribution side, the margins aren't there to really support this type of risk-taking. And I would think that many others are going to begin looking at it at the same way we do and begin looking at shorter-term pricing.
Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC: So one more, if I could sneak it in. Has the sequential gross margin improvement, has that continued in the first couple of weeks of your 1Q?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes, I would say that the margins are looking pretty much like what we saw in the fourth quarter.
Operator: David Williams of Williams Financial Group has our next question.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Ask a little bit about the SG&A and can you maybe...
Floyd F. Sherman: We can't hear David's question.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: I wanted to ask you a little bit about the SG&A line and what kind of leverage you think may be available as we get to more normalized building starts. And I realize that we're away from that, but what kind of real leverage do you think that you can extract from the SG&A line as we go forward here?
M. Chad Crow: Well, we've taken a lot of costs out of the business, so long-term, I think, we should be able to leverage our operating expenses pretty well. I've said all along that we would certainly be more fixed than variable, up to about $1 billion in revenue, and once we got past the $1 billion, which is where we are now, we will, certainly, are going to become more variable, especially on the delivery side of the business. So long-term, I would probably say we'd be in the neighborhood of 50% to 60% variable. And assuming we can get caught up on pricing, I still think that our goal, as a company, is to get somewhere around 13% to 15% EBITDA flow-through on incremental sales. And that's the goal. It's not going to happen every quarter, but if we're not facing the commodity inflation headwinds and the competitive landscape continues to improve, and that's what we're shooting for.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Great. Secondly, I wanted to ask -- I know that we're ways away from this issue, but if you think about your lock of pricing today on -- in an escalating environment, do we have the same types of issues, maybe in a downwards trend in lumber prices? Can you continue to pass your set pricing that you booked maybe 60 or 90 days out? Can you continue to get that same pricing going forward, if lumber prices were to fall? Or is the competitive environment today situated in a way that maybe you'd put some downward pressure on your pricing, if we saw some trends downwards there?
M. Chad Crow: For the most part, I think we stand by our pricing commitment as do our customers. And so in an environment like that, you could have some customers that want to price-shop you. But I think for the most part, they understand you win some, you lose some. And in an environment like that, I think we could be able to hold our pricing and see some margin improvement.
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: All right. One more, if I could. Have you seen any signs yet that maybe some of the capacity that some of the producers have talked about bringing back on? Have you seen any incremental movement, maybe in pricing? I don't know if we're still running high today, but what are your thoughts maybe as we head into the second and third quarter for pricing?
M. Chad Crow: On the Lumber side?
David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division: Yes, on the commodity lumber.
Floyd F. Sherman: I think we're going to continue to look at a very slow increase on the Lumber side. OSB, there are some -- a couple of mills slated to come onstream late spring, meaning April, May, that I'm not sure that they're really going to hit as quick as everybody would hope to see the -- that production come online. And I really think it will be later summer before we start seeing good board coming out of those mills. Right now, the OSB, the -- on the panel side, they're running at near capacity, so once those mills come on, I think we'll see some more stabilization on the OSB side. Lumber is -- the mills are -- they're running at, from everything that we can gather in all the research that we've done, would indicate that you're mills are running in the high 80s as a capacity and there are no more -- no new mills slated to come on. China, is still staying as a regular buyer from the West Coast and West Coast of Canada, as well as the U.S. That's going to continue. Markets in India are opening up. So I think we're going to continue to see a very, very tight lumber market all through 2013. And I think there will probably be more upward inflation on lumber than on OSB panels. But both of them we'll be seeing -- for the next couple of quarters, we're going to be seeing, I think, increased prices.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Matthew Dodson with JWest LLC.
Matthew Dodson : Can you guys kind of talk about what you see in the first month of January? Has the trend continued from December? It was your highest sales month has it continued in the January, and do you think you can grow sequentially from the fourth quarter?
Floyd F. Sherman: Our trend going into January, very much the same as what we saw in the fourth quarter.
Matthew Dodson : And then can you kind of help us understand margins going forward? It seems like you guys are doing a better job in getting in front of lumber. Can we expect the same sequential increase, with the 40 basis points in margin kind of going forward as well? Or is that a little too high to bake into our models?
M. Chad Crow: That's a real tough question. A lot of it depends on what the commodity prices do, how high the inflation is that Floyd just discussed, and the competitive landscape. I certainly think we can see sequential margin improvement. 40 basis points a quarter, I would say, might be a tad optimistic.
Matthew Dodson : Can you kind of -- excluding lumber, are you able to get in front of the other inflationary prices?
M. Chad Crow: For the most part, yes. A little bit tougher...
Floyd F. Sherman: And they've run a little bit tougher with the component parts but very definitely, we're improving our margins on those products as well. But it's -- there's a lot of lumber relationship, obviously, in wall panels and roof trusses and floor trusses. So -- but the -- we are able and we're getting cost increase passed on, and we're doing the same on all other products.
Matthew Dodson : And then finally, on the mills business, it seems like that should accelerate from here and that should really help benefit your gross margins. Can you kind of help us understand kind of what you're seeing in the part of the business, and how that -- if does accelerate, how that can help your margins?
M. Chad Crow: What do you mean by mill business?
Matthew Dodson : The trusses business, I'm sorry.
M. Chad Crow: Trusses?
Matthew Dodson : Yes.
M. Chad Crow: Well, that's certainly the product category that has been most impacted there in this downturn. And certainly, as construction activity picks up, we feel like those products will be in higher demand and that those -- that product category has the most room for growth and improvement...
Floyd F. Sherman: And we also feel that that's going to come about from -- because of the labor shortages that are beginning to show up, in the install process, as well as all parts of all construction-related aspects. So as the labor tightens, that means the components of the trusses, panels, become more of a cost factor for the builder, and I think we'll be able to continue to move our margins up on those products. And that's where we're anticipating.
Matthew Dodson : And that is a positive mix shift, correct?
M. Chad Crow: Yes.
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes.
Matthew Dodson : And then one last question. On that, have you seen that -- you said it was hit most in the downturn, but have you seen that pick up and reaccelerate?
M. Chad Crow: Yes, we're already starting to see that.
Matthew Dodson : And finally -- I'm sorry, I do have one more question. With your stock up so much and you have -- we're not going to expect some equity raise up here, are we?
M. Chad Crow: We're constantly evaluating our capital structure and hope sometime in the next year or so, to be able to do some refinancing to improve that. Will it include equity or not, that's -- it's really hard to say at this point, but I can say right now that that's not on the table.
Matthew Dodson : And then, what is the make-whole on the bond this year?
M. Chad Crow: Well, on the term loan, we have a make-whole on the interest through December of '14. So if we pay them down any time before then, we have to make them whole in the interest. As of year end, the make-whole was about $50 million, which is essentially 2 years worth of interest.
Floyd F. Sherman: And it drops about $5 million a quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next, we'll hear from Philip Volpicelli with Deutsche Bank.
Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Actually, the last question just asked my question. So just to make sure I'm clear, the term loan, there's no premium that you would have to pay, you just simply need to make them whole on that $50 million of interest and that drops $5 million a quarter?
M. Chad Crow: That's right. It's -- that's 2 years of interest, so it's really about $6.5 million a quarter a drop. That's correct.
Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And then the bonds, right now, they're currently callable at par?
M. Chad Crow: That's correct.
Operator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Sherman, I'll turn the call back to you for closing remarks.
Floyd F. Sherman: Hey, we appreciate your joining us today. And if you have any further questions, don't hesitate to call Chad or Marcie Hyder. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the Builders FirstSource conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Your host for today’s call is Mr. Floyd Sherman, chief executive officer. [Operator instructions.]  The company issued a press release after the market closed yesterday. If you don’t have a copy, you can find it on our website at bldr.com.

We have provided reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents in our earnings press release and detailed explanations of non-GAAP financial measures in our Form 8-K filed yesterday, both of which are available on our website. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Floyd Sherman.
Floyd Sherman: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2012 earnings call. Joining me today from our management team is Chad Crow, senior vice president and chief financial officer. After giving a brief recap of the third quarter, I’ll turn the call over to Chad for a more detailed discussion of our financial results. And after my closing comments regarding our outlook, we’ll take your questions. Sales for the third quarter of 2012 were $291.8 million, an increase of 34.3% when compared to the third quarter of 2011. Our top line growth continues to exceed the increase in residential construction activity as actual single family housing starts in the south region increased 27.7% over the same time period and single family units under construction increased only 12.4%. For the second consecutive quarter, we reported positive adjusted EBITDA, finishing with $3.0 million for the current quarter as compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $700,000 in the third quarter of 2011, and on a year to date basis, our adjusted EBITDA has improved from a loss of $11.7 million in 2011 to a positive $3 million in 2012. We are seeing stronger sales trends in the housing market as it continues to recover, and our recent market share gains have also contributed to our improving sales. At our current sales pace, we’re poised for 2012 to surpass $1 billion in revenue, and believe we will be adjusted EBITDA positive. The last time we achieved similar levels of revenue was fiscal 2008, at which time single family housing starts were 622,000, or 100,000 more starts than the current forecast for 2012.  Our gross margin was 21.7%, and our adjusted EBITDA was a loss of approximately $32.4 million. So while we are still faced with a challenging housing environment, our improved operational efficiencies are certainly contributing to a much-improved financial performance. For the current quarter, our sales per south region single-family start increased to $3,703 from $3,522 in the second quarter of this year. As noted in our earnings release yesterday, our gross margins were again negatively impacted by inflation on commodity lumber and lumber sheet goods within the quarter and our limited ability to adjust intraquarter customer pricing.  While we were able to pass on some price increases as part of our third quarter pricing, we once again experienced a rising commodity market during the quarter. Commodity prices increased on average 14% from the end of the second quarter through mid-September, before falling back somewhat by quarter end. I also think it’s important to note that on a year to date basis, commodity lumber prices are up on an average of 20-25%. Specifically, framing lumber is up 14%, panels are up 27%, and 7/16 OSB is up 34%. Combined, lumber prices have risen to levels not seen on a consistent basis since 2005 and 2006. As we’ve stressed in the past, we prefer an environment of higher, stable commodity lumber prices. However, in a rising environment like we’ve seen most of this year, it does create pricing challenges for us, given fixed intraquarter pricing arrangements we have with our customers. Prices can’t go up forever, and we still believe that assuming prices stabilize at higher levels, we’ll see an improvement in our margins. I’ll now turn the call over to Chad, who will review our financial results in more detail.
Chad Crow : Thank you Floyd. Good morning everyone. For the current quarter, we reported sales of $291.8 million, compared to $217.2 million in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of $74.6 million or 34.3%. We estimate sales increased approximately 27% due to increased sales volume and 7% due to price. Breaking down our sales by product category, prefabricated components were $56.1 million, up 36.8% when compared to $41 million in the third quarter of 2011. Windows and doors were up approximately 20.5% to $61.8 million. Lumber and lumber sheet goods were $97.3 million, up $35.4 million. Our millwork category increased $5.9 million to $28.1 million, and other building products and services increased 18.8% to $48.5 million when compared to the same quarter last year. From a sales mix perspective, lumber and lumber sheet goods were 33.4% of total sales, up from 28.5% of total sales in the third quarter of 2011, due primarily to commodity price inflation. All other categories were fairly consistent between periods from a mix standpoint. Our gross margin percentage was 19.8%, down from 20.5%, a 70 basis point decrease. We estimate price negatively impacted gross margins by 150 basis points, largely due to commodity lumber inflation during the quarter relative to fixed customer pricing commitments, and was offset by an 80 basis point improvement due to increased sales volume. On a sequential quarter basis, our gross margin increased from 19.7% to 19.8%. Selling, general, and administrative expense was $58.7 million for the current quarter. This is up $8.5 million, or 16.8%, from the same quarter last year, despite a 34.3% increase in sales. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense decreased to 20.1% in the coming quarter from 23.1% in the same quarter last year. For the third quarter of 2012, our salaries and benefit expense, excluding stock compensation expense, was $35.6 million, or 12.2% of sales, compared to $28.8 million, or 13.3% of sales in the third quarter of 2011. The $6.8 million increase is primarily related to higher sales commissions and additional staffing needs to service our increased sales volume. We recorded $700,000 of facility closure costs in the third quarter of 2012. These costs were primarily related to revisions of subrental income estimates on two previously closed facilities in South Carolina and Tennessee. During the third quarter of 2011, we recorded $100,000 of facility closure costs. Interest expense was $10.6 million in the current quarter, an increase of $5.3 million from 2011. This increase was primarily due to interest associated with our new term loan, combined with the $700,000 noncash fair value adjustment related to stock warrants issued in connection with the term loan. We recorded $33,000 of income tax expense in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $268,000 in the third quarter of 2011. We recorded an after-tax noncash valuation allowance of $4.6 million, and $4.7 million in the third quarters of 2012 and 2011 respectively, related to net deferred tax assets. Absent the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate would have been 37.6% and 39.2% in 2012 and 2011 respectively. As of the end of the quarter, our gross federal income tax NOL available for carry-forward was approximately $226 million. Loss from continuing operations in the current quarter was $12.3 million, or a $0.13 loss per diluted share, compared to a loss of $11.5 million, or a $0.12 loss per diluted share in the same quarter last year.  Excluding the fair value adjustment for stock warrants, facility closure costs, and the tax valuation allowance, our loss from continuing operations was $0.07 per diluted share for the current quarter. For the same quarter of 2011, our loss from continuing operations was also $0.07 per diluted share, excluding facility closure costs and the tax valuation allowance. Adjusted EBITDA was $3 million in the third quarter of 2012, and represents a $3.7 million improvement compared to a loss of $700,000 in the same quarter last year.  Our cash use for the current quarter was $14.4 million. Of this amount, $9.5 million was cash used for interest of $5.2 million related to capital expenditures, and the balance was due to an increase in working capital, offset somewhat by positive EBITDA during the quarter. We ended the quarter with cash of $90.7 million, and net liquidity of $55.7 million, after giving [effect] to the $35 million minimum cash requirement contained in our term loan agreement. In addition to the $90.7 million of cash, we also had $12.8 million of restricted cash at September 30, 2012, of which $1.8 million was included in long term assets. Restricted cash consists of $11.9 million used to collateralize letters of credit outstanding under our letter of credit facility, and $900,000 used as collateral for other casualty insurance obligations. Our cash usage for fiscal 2012 is expected to be at the high end of the original guidance, due to the increase in working capital necessary to support our higher than forecasted sales volume. As a result, we expect to end the year with approximately $90 million of unrestricted cash, and $55 million of net liquidity. I’ll now turn the call back to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd Sherman: Thank you Chad. We’re pleased with our results for the third quarter, especially given the commodity price inflation and the extremely competitive pricing environment we experienced. We expect that the momentum that we’ve achieved from the improvement in the housing industry, and our recent market share gains, to continue to positively impact our operating results. We remain focused on growing market share and improving our margins in order to drive profitability as the market continues to recover. I’ll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.   
Operator: [Operator instructions.] We will go first to Seth Yeager with Jefferies & Co.
Seth Yeager - Jefferies & Co. : Another solid top line improvement here. Just on gross margins, obviously getting squeezed a little bit on the commodity side. And you guys can’t control the price of lumber, but is there something structurally in your industry… I know you have certain pricing conventions and contracts. But is that something that, over time, you’d be able to pass prices through a bit more quickly? What’s the overall thought there? 
Chad Crow : You know, structurally, I don’t think things have changed, in my opinion. It’s still an extremely competitive market out there. You’re always going to have a lag given our position in the supply chain, and the pricing agreements that we have in place with the customers. You’re always going to have a little bit of a lag. And like we’ve said, we were able to pass along some price increases in the third quarter, but unfortunately again we were chasing a rising commodity market. So between the inflation, and the fact that there’s still too much supply out there, there’s still too little demand. The reality of it is we’re pacing toward about 520,000 single family starts this year. It’s likely going to be the fourth worst year on record for housing. So while things are getting better, it’s still a very tough environment.  And so between the inflation and what I would call the excess demand, it’s just a slow process. But eventually, yes, I think margins will recover and when commodity prices do stabilize I really feel like we’re going to be able to get our margins up and pass on price increases. 
Floyd Sherman: Yeah, and I think another thing that we’ve seen is volatility that we haven’t seen occur in the past nearly to this extent. And the volatility is really occurring right before the end of a quarter and slightly after the beginning of the next quarter, and this is when most of your pricing is done to your customers. The market flattens out, and it gives you the appearance that it’s stabilizing.  And then we have seen just some unbelievable run ups in the price. We look at OSB. Our OSB over the quarter was about a 16% increase. But if you looked at it from a few weeks after the start of the third quarter, until I think it was around September 8, we saw an increase of 41.2%. And then it fell of 18% during that period of time that you begin doing your pricing. So whatever replenishment you did during the course of the quarter, you were doing at really exaggerated prices. I’ve been in the business a long time, and I’ve never seen the type of volatility and the points at where it’s occurring to the extent that we’ve seen this year. Very unusual year in that regard. And I think this is what’s really crated problems for us and the rest of the industry. 
Seth Yeager - Jefferies & Co. : Now, one thing that you’ve been hearing from just about every builder out there is labor is really starting to become a governor on growth in many markets out there. Obviously you’re seeing an improvement in your pre-fab business. Is that an area where you’re starting to see some momentum in pricing and margins. I know historically that was a pretty high margin business for you guys. And just in the environment where builders are trying to quickly turn inventories, is that something that you can look forward to a little bit of pricing there? 
Chad Crow : I think that’s certainly the case. Labor is tight in some markets, which bodes well for the fact that we can supply labor to frame houses. And given that environment, it also allows us to push our truss and panel products as we’re doing the work on those houses. So yeah, you’re right on both counts. We have seen an increase in sales of truss and panel, and we’re also seeing margin improvement.
Seth Yeager - Jefferies & Co. : And just lastly, can you just kind of talk us through the trends in DSOs? A little bit elevated over the last couple of years. And just in general, given the improvement in top line, where you sort of see working capital going into the beginning of next year? 
Chad Crow : From an A/R days standpoint, the most significant trend we’ve seen recently is I think just the fact that a lot of the large national builders, their business has ramped up so much that they’ve fallen a little bit behind on the back office side. So there has been a little slippage of days there. I think everybody’s a little gun shy to add full time employees, and they’re hanging on to the lower headcount as long as they can. So from our standpoint, it really doesn’t look like a liquidity issue with our customers. It’s more of an administrative backlog at the moment. But I think we’ll see that settle out when we get into the slower building season. Your other question, on working capital in general, I think we’re still going to trend around 10% of sales, like we have historically. Going into next year, that’s a good question, something we’re certainly keeping an eye on right now. If our sales continue to grow at the rate they have, 30-40%, that would put us in the area of $1.3 billion in revenue next year, which would certainly require additional working capital build next summer. So I don’t want to expect as a percentage of sales it’s going to get much different than 10%, but certainly the build in general is something we’re keeping an eye on as we go into next year. 
Operator: And we will go next to Richard Paget with Imperial Capital.
Richard Paget - Imperial Capital : I realize this has to do with end market mix, and customer mix, but what do you think is the potential of your revenues per start? Is there going to be a natural cap on this, just given your potential market penetration? Where do you think this could potentially go? Because it’s definitely much higher than the last peak right now.
Chad Crow : I get asked that question a lot, and it’s really hard to predict. We’ve really never been at levels this high, nor have we been through a housing recession like this, and it’s hard to predict what it’s going to look like coming out the other side. A lot of it’s going to depend on our customer mix, and what mix of houses they’re building to the overall build. And it’s also going to depend a lot on what happens with our competition. So I’m confident that if we can keep doing what we need to do, and serve our customers the way we can, we can certainly hold on to that, and I certainly think there’s probably some more upside there. But it’s just really hard to predict. 
Richard Paget - Imperial Capital : And then with the market obviously coming back relatively strong, how is the competition doing? I know you still say it’s competitive out there, but are some of your larger competitors still getting in better financial shape, and there might not be some more fall out in the overall industry? 
Chad Crow : Certainly from a large competitor standpoint there’s probably truth to that. There’s obviously more optimism in general with housing, and so that’s going to create opportunities for some of the larger guys, maybe from a refinancing perspective. I think you may see more smaller guys struggle in the next year or two as business grows, and especially at the rate it’s been growing, it’s going to squeeze a lot of people from a liquidity standpoint and the need to grow working capital. So I think that could be an area where we might see some additional fallout.
Richard Paget - Imperial Capital : Just to be clear, that 7% pricing, that’s all in lumber and lumber sheet goods, correct? 
Chad Crow : That’s correct. 
Richard Paget - Imperial Capital : And when’s the Q going to come out? 
Chad Crow : Probably into next week.
Operator: And we will go next to Jack Kasprzak with BB&T. 
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T: Follow up on the question about labor shortages. Just curious, do you guys see land as a limiting factor on home builders right now? Some of the press releases we read about housing data, housing sales and this commentary about it’s tough to find lots, or there’s a shortage of lots out there, have you guys seen that as a limiting factor out there? 
Floyd Sherman: We hear a lot about that. I can’t really say that we can say we’re experiencing it. We really can’t say that we’re seeing difficulties at this point. Typically your lot development is a number of years ahead of what’s actually taking place in current construction, so what’s happening in the land acquisition mode is all we have is hearsay conversation. Right now it doesn’t seem to be affecting the pace of building in the markets that we’re involved with. 
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T: And obviously the housing start number that came out Tuesday was a big upside surprise. Were you guys surprised by that number given the activity you had been seeing on the ground and with your customers? Was it getting sort of pent up to where we were going to surge a little bit to the upside and inflect a little bit in terms of starts? 
Chad Crow: It was pretty much in line with my expectations and what we had been seeing on a sales per day basis.
Jack Kasprzak - BB&T: And on margins, from where you guys stand today, or what you know today, how do you think fourth quarter gross margin looks compared to the third quarter? Pretty similar? Would you expect a little bit of an uptick? If you can give us any kind of guidance there it might be helpful. 
Floyd Sherman: Right now we are looking for it to be an uptick. Just tracking on a daily basis our margins and seeing what’s taking place, right now it’s looking favorable. We were able to do a certain amount of buying prior to going into the fourth quarter. And we got some attractive cost positions. And we were able to get pricing in that was an improvement over what we saw in the third quarter. And so at this point, we feel that we’re going to be seeing an uptick in the margins. 
Chad Crow: That’s consistent with my thoughts as well. Obviously it’s early in the quarter, and we’ll wait and see what commodity prices do.
Operator: And we will go next to Robert Kelly with Sidoti & Company.
Robert Kelly - Sidoti & Company : Question on pricing. It sounded like you were able to get some pricing, not enough, just given how commodities moved during Q3. Have you been able to recover some more price as we set up the fourth quarter contracts? And what happens if lumber stabilizes or drops off? Are you able to kind of hold pricing a little bit better if commodity prices were to slowly decline? What’s the situation if commodities are not running against you? 
Chad Crow: In that environment I think it would certainly favor our margin for the border. If we do sell through our inventory and are out having to replenish, and the market has fallen a bit, that’s certainly going to help. And I think in general, and Floyd might add some color to this, I would say we were slightly more successful in Q4 with pricing. And so far the lumber market has been in our favor as far as inflation or deflation. 
Robert Kelly - Sidoti & Company : So you’re able to still get a little bit more price as you move into Q4. 
Chad Crow: Yes. 
Robert Kelly - Sidoti & Company : As far as the competitive situation, are there strategies, other than just waiting for some of the competitors to go away, that you can investigate, where you’re partnering up with someone out there that’s got a ton of excess capacity? I know you don’t want to go the buy and close down somebody route. Are there opportunities to address the excess capacity issues through like a JV or a partnership? It seems like the strategy is just to kind of hang on and wait for a shakeout. 
Chad Crow: I haven’t really seen any JV type strategies out there. And you’re right, certainly not looking to go buy someone just to close them. We’re still very focused on our liquidity. I think the best thing we can do right now is just to keep providing the customer service and pushing our various product lines and keep hoping that the construction’s going to continue to improve. It’s just still very tough out there, and you’ve still got a lot of people hanging on. 
Robert Kelly - Sidoti & Company : You did a little bit of geographic expansion in the current year. Anything on the board as you look out into 2013 for new geographies or locations? 
Chad Crow: The expansion we did this year was really into adjacent markets that we were already serving, and just some really nice opportunities to expand our footprint at a relatively low cost. And so certainly if we had opportunities like that next year, we could do it. I wouldn’t look for any grand expansion by any means, but if some opportunities like that came along we would certainly look at it. But right now I don’t know of any that are on the table.
Operator: And we will go next to Howard Weinberg with UBS.
Howard Weinberg - UBS: Regarding the volatility of the lumber pricing and how that’s been impacting your margin, have you guys given any consideration of increasing some of your safety stock? I think last quarter you came in with around 75% of your lumber purchase, and I just wasn’t certain of whether or not sales… And I think Chad, you mentioned that sales sort of came in line with what you guys had anticipated. So how do you maintain that margin? And for us to have some better handle that margins will be in that ideal range of 21-23% gross margin that you’ve talked about in the past. 
Chad Crow : I think I said starts came in line with expectations. So that was kind of an after the fact. I already pretty much knew what sales were going to be, so it gave me a barometer of what starts were going to be. Like Floyd said earlier, it’s just been a very, very strange year on the lumber side. The pricing, and the inflation, and the timing of the inflation. So it just creates challenges for us.  You know, one option is to go out and you could attempt to take a position of 125% of forecast, if that’s what you wanted to do. It takes up a lot of liquidity. It eliminates any benefit you might get if pricing falls. And lastly, you’ve got to have somewhere to put it all. That’s a hell of a lot of inventory, and quite frankly I’m not sure all our locations could handle that much on the ground. And then you’ve got the issue with the weather and leaving lumber out in the weather if you don’t have covered storage for it all.  So it’s just been an interesting year. It’s certainly not one that I would expect to see again, but you never know. I certainly don’t want to see it again. But no, I think if we could get prices to stabilize, and demand to continue to improve, those margins will come back. It’s just been a very unusual year for us. 
Howard Weinberg - UBS: And then could you talk a little bit about where some of this growth is coming from? I’m assuming it’s mostly single family, but maybe if you could just talk about some of your initiatives on the multifamily growth? 
Floyd Sherman: We very carefully manage our involvement with multifamily. Several factors come into play. A lot of your multifamily is direct ship. They buy direct from the mills, the contractors. There’s really no place for us in it.  Others, pricing is extremely competitive, and usually much longer price guarantees. Many of the large projects, they’re looking for one year or more in price guarantees. We have a difficult time enough getting 90-day price quotes than getting involved with one year quotes. So we stay away from that.  Then many of the projects require bonding. We don’t like to bond. We do on occasion, but it’s a too-severe limitation on our liquidity. We look at the jobs where we feel we can do it and make some money. Our multifamily is still staying about the same percent of our overall business that has been, so I guess that would say we’re growing the business about as fast as we’re growing the balance of our business.  But probably, if you look at market share and multifamily, we’re losing market share in multifamily, because multifamily’s been expanding faster than single family has. But we’re going to continue to very carefully monitor the projects that we get involved with and we’re going to go after those projects that we feel really suit our needs. 
Howard Weinberg - UBS: And with respect to market share, who do you sense you’re gaining your market share from? Is it through some of the other, larger professional or pro build distributors, or is it coming from some stick framers that they just can’t compete with the public builders, and your larger customers just prefer your quality? Or how does that work out? 
Floyd Sherman: Our market share gains, it’s pretty much uniform across large builder as well as the regional and smaller builders. We slightly increased our share with the top 10, top 100. But we’re getting a good cross section of all of builders as we can determine from the market share gains that we’ve been achieving.
Operator: And we will go next to Rob Hansen with Deutsche Bank. 
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank: What do you look at as longer term, normalized operating margins? And given the cost takeouts that you’ve done over the course of the downturn, could you be looking at higher normalized margins compared to the last up cycle? Just wanted to kind of get your longer term thoughts on that. 
Chad Crow : We have taken a lot of cuts out of the business, so historically when we were at the last peak, an 8-8.5% EBITDA company on 25-26% gross margin. I certainly think from an operational standpoint we can do better than we did back then. So assuming you get back to similar levels of gross margin, I see no reason we couldn’t be a 9-9.5% EBITDA company. 
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank: And I just wanted to get a little bit more detail about the purchase of your Chelsea, Alabama location, and just your general outlook for capex. 
Chad Crow : That was a situation where the lease was up for renewal. The landlord was selling the property, so we had the choice of finding a new location or buying the real estate. And just looking at the two options, it made more sense to buy it. Capex for the remainder of this year should be very minimal. Really right now we’re still in the process of evaluating capex for next year. Obviously that depends a lot on our forecasted sales volume. But for the balance of the year, it should be minimal. 
Operator: And we will go next to Phillip Volpicelli with Deutsche Bank. 
Phillip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank: When you guys talked about 2013, I think you mentioned that if sales maintained their current pace you’d get to about $1.3 billion of revenue. And I think in the past you’ve implied that that would get you to a breakeven level. And I’m just trying to parse apart that breakeven. That breakeven is assuming just capex and interest expense, it’s not assuming working capital, is that right? 
Chad Crow : Right. 
Phillip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank: I guess you have probably started thinking about ’13. Are there any kind of large capex catch ups that you guys will need to do, or will you be able to keep it in this $8-9 million range? 
Chad Crow : At that type of sales level, we’ll certainly be adding to our fleet. That will be our biggest need. Primarily, most of that would likely be leased as opposed to buying it. So I think in that type of revenue range, we would see an increase in our lease expense. But as far as actually buying or capex, like I said we’re still in the process of evaluating that. You might be looking at something closer to $10 million of capex and then an increase in your lease expense. 
Floyd Sherman: But on a long term basis, this business, we traditionally would anticipate somewhere between 1-1.3% of sales would go into capex.
Operator: We will go next to Matthew Dodson with Edmunds White Partners.
Matthew Dodson - Edmunds White Partners: I have two quick questions for you. Can you talk about your liquidity needs for next year, and if you guys are thinking about either going out to the high yield market or having to raise equity? 
Chad Crow : Yeah, I touched on it earlier. We’re certainly looking at what our sales forecast will be next year. Obviously a 30-40% increase in sales will create a working capital build, especially next summer. So we’re currently evaluating what that means from a liquidity perspective. Obviously we have the minimum cash requirement of $35 million as something we have to make sure we consider in the evaluation.  So it’s just something we’re looking at right now. If sales continue to grow at that pace, it could squeeze our liquidity somewhat. It’s a great problem to have, but something we need to deal with nonetheless. But I think if that’s the type of growth we’re still seeing at that point, there’s going to be opportunities for us to manage that liquidity need, and I just don’t know what that will look like. It’s just something we’re keeping an eye on. 
Matthew Dodson - Edmunds White Partners: Can you address your debt structure currently? When does it make sense potentially from a make whole to take out those high yield bonds? 
Chad Crow : The make whole with High Bridge, at year end I think it will be $30-35 million. Certainly it’s a pretty big number to cover in a refinancing. It all just depends on the terms of the refinancing and what type of improvement you’re going to get on your rate, how much additional liquidity it’s going to add. Certainly as the quarters tick by, and that make whole comes down - it drops about $5 million a quarter as we pay interest obviously - then it becomes more manageable. So it really just depends on what type of refinancing we’re being offered.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Jeffrey Matthews with Ram Partners. 
Jeffrey Matthews - Ram Partners: Are you seeing players who are weak being irrational in the marketplace? 
Chad Crow : I would say yes, there’s still quite a bit of irrational pricing out there. It never ceases to amaze us, some of the pricing we’re seeing. So yes, I would say it’s as irrational as it has ever been throughout this downturn right now.
Operator: And we will go next to Shawn Boyd with Next Mark Capital.
Shawn Boyd - Next Mark Capital : Jumping down into operating expenses for a second, your year over year increase is a little higher than I would have thought given what we’ve talked about in terms of the 35% variable nature in the past. Is there anything in there that is maybe a one-off this quarter? Or any kind of outliers that drove that higher in the September quarter? 
Chad Crow : The biggest thing we’ve seen has been the overtime and the temp labor that we’re using. Sales have ramped up so quick this year that to some degree you’re reacting and the quickest way to plug those holes as far as the labor standpoint in the yards is the use of overtime and temp labor. So that has certainly been higher than I would have expected, but as we continue to backfill with full time employees and can bring that cost down, then I think we’re going to see an improvement from that standpoint. 
Floyd Sherman: The only thing that’s created problems for us in controlling the labor cost as close as you would like to control it is just variability that we’re getting on a day to day basis across our markets. Tremendous fluctuations in the demands that are placed on our operations and it really creates problems for our people trying to anticipate what the next day’s business is going to be and being able to react to it. And we find ourselves, for the most part, the business is strictly almost on a day to day basis. Very, very difficult to get any advance look at what the demand schedule’s going to be. 
Shawn Boyd - Next Mark Capital : Floyd, from your experience, how long would you expect in the recovery here for that to remain unsettled, so volatile that you can’t plan around it? 
Floyd Sherman: I think as the housing continues to improve and builders get more confident and they start putting in more spec buildings, which evens out the flow, I think we’re going to continue going through this. Typically in the past, once the market started to improve it moved pretty quickly from the bottom back to a normal state.  This is unlike anything that I’ve ever been through, and I think anything that housing has ever been through. My feeling is that we’re starting to see a little bit more uniformity on a day to day basis. September, for whatever reason, though, was really unusual for us. That was our highest sales per day average that we had all year, and when I say high, it was 15% better than any other month that we’ve experienced. And that really was surprising to us. And it’s continuing on into October, which is a good thing.  But again, suddenly we found ourselves having to react on a labor control basis to something that was very unusual for us. Typically September doesn’t have that big an improvement over August or June, or some of the better building months. Hopefully we’ll begin to see more stabilization and be able to plan out better than what we have been, but I guess we’ll just have to take it day by day and see how that comes around. Chad, you talk with the guys in the field. You see any difference in that? 
Chad Crow : No, you still don’t get a whole lot of visibility on the day to day basis, so you’re constantly struggling to adjust your workforce, and it just creates the additional challenges that Floyd talked about, of trying to manage day to day, and you end up using more overtime and temp labor than maybe you had intended. 
Shawn Boyd - Next Mark Capital : Given that backdrop, is there any absolute level of quarterly SG&A that we should be thinking about now, or do you want to update your feeling on how much of this is variable at this point? 
Chad Crow : I don’t think so. I still think in a normal environment, if we had the visibility we needed, the 35% variable is probably a good number. Now, like I said, once we blow past $1 billion in revenue, then we’re going to become more variable. That’s just the nature of it. We start adding more delivery expenses when we get to those types of revenue levels. So I’ve said all along that once we got past $1 billion and beyond that we’d probably start migrating more toward a 50-50. In the next few quarters I think we should do better than that, but once we get up to $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, that might be closer to what you’re looking at.
Operator: [Operator instructions.] And we’ll take a follow up question from Matthew Dodson.
Matthew Dodson - Edmunds White Partners: You guys have talked about how this housing recovery is not very normal, and can you kind of talk about, usually your fourth quarter, it drops down from your third quarter, and because this is abnormal, could you see yourself growing sequentially into the fourth quarter? 
Chad Crow : I think for our sales to grow sequentially in Q4 that would be very unlikely. I think it’s certainly possible that we may not see as large a seasonal slowdown since starts are trending upward. So from that standpoint we might see a stronger Q4 than we typically would, but sequentially to grow, I think that would be unlikely. 
Floyd Sherman: But I think if we look at it, I think our growth in the fourth quarter will be, as compared to the fourth quarter of last year, very similar to what we’ve had on that comparison all during the year. 
Chad Crow : But I’m not signing up for $290 million of revenue. 
Floyd Sherman: Oh no, we’re not going to do as well dollar-wise in the fourth quarter as we did in the third quarter.
Operator: And we’ll take another follow up question from Rob Hansen with Deutsche Bank. 
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank : You mentioned that you were kind of plugging the gap with temporary workers and overtime and stuff like that. What do you look for to kind of take that from temporary to, okay, we need to hire a few more people full time? What are you looking for confidence-wise to take that responsible on? 
Chad Crow : You know, I think we’re there. At the beginning of the year everyone had the same question, wow, housing activity sure is picking up. Is this sustainable? And everybody was wondering the same thing, as were we. So you’re just a little slow to add full time people. The last thing you want to do is hire full time people and then have to let them go two months later. Our workforce has seen enough of that the last six or seven years. But I think with the build we’ve seen, the activity we’ve seen this year, I think we’re really there now, and are in the process of trying to backfill with full time employees. But you can’t flip a switch and all of a sudden have the full time staff you need. It’s obviously a process of going through the interview process and hiring the right people.  But from a confidence level that the housing recovery is at least sustainable in the near term, I would say that we’re there, and are in the process of doing that. 
Floyd Sherman: Yeah, and I think one good example is our Houston window plant. We got up to where we had 40-plus temp labor in it. That’s back down now to where our temp laborers are less than 10. And we’ve been able to bring in and have BFS employees filling those slots. And that’s typical of what happens throughout the company. We’ve always used temp labor to take care of seasonal changes in the business, or temporary spikes in the business, but this year has been very unusual as far as usage of our temps goes.
Operator: At this time, there appears to be no more questions. Mr. Sherman, I’ll turn the call back to you for any closing remarks.
Floyd Sherman: We really appreciate your listening in on the call. If there are any further questions that you care to discuss, don’t hesitate to give Chad or Marcie Hyder a call, and we’ll hopefully be able to answer your questions. Thanks and have a good day.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-07-20 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Mr. Floyd Sherman, Chief Executive Officer. [Operator Instructions] Any reproduction of this call, in whole or in part, is not permitted without prior written authorization of Builders FirstSource. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, July 20, 2012.

 We have provided reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents in our earnings press release and detailed explanations of non-GAAP financial measures in our Form 8-K filed yesterday, both of which are available on our website.
 At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Floyd Sherman. Please go ahead. 
Floyd Sherman: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2012 earnings call. Joining me today from our management team is Chad Crow, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After giving a brief recap of the second quarter, I'll turn the call over to Chad for a more detailed discussion of our financial results. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions.
 We delivered our best operating performance in nearly 5 years, reporting positive adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 million for the second quarter and improving to breakeven adjusted EBITDA June year-to-date. Our second quarter sales grew 31.7% to $271.9 million compared to sales of $206.4 million for the second quarter of 2011.
 Over the same time period, actual single-family housing starts in the South Region increased 21.3% while single-family units under construction increased 1.5%. Our top line growth far exceeded this increase in residential construction activity, indicating we continue to grow market share, and we met our primary goal for the quarter of getting back to positive EBITDA.
 Our sales in the current quarter were our highest of any quarter since 2008 and represented our fourth consecutive quarter-over-quarter sales increase of greater than 20%. And our sales for South Region single-family start was $3,513, down just slightly from $3,539 in the first quarter of this year.
 However, as Chad commented on in our earnings release yesterday, it was a challenging quarter for gross margins, as the higher-than-expected sales volume combined with roughly 16% price inflation in lumber and lumber sheet goods during the quarter forced us to replace inventory during the latter half of the quarter at a higher cost. Given our limited ability to adjust intra-quarter pricing with many of our customers, we experienced gross margin compression on our commodity and lumber sheet good products. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we estimated this cost to be approximately $4 million to $4.5 million of gross profit dollars and $3.5 million to $4 million of EBITDA.
 As we've discussed in the past, an environment of higher, stable commodity lumber prices is the optimal environment for us. Unfortunately, as lumber and lumber sheet good prices climb to higher levels, we sometimes have to endure short-term margin pressure along the way. Thus far, in the third quarter, commodity lumber and lumber sheet good prices have been relatively stable. If that holds, we would anticipate seeing gross margin improvement in our commodity lumber category.
 Let's also not forget, it is still a very competitive pricing environment. And in our continuing effort to grow market share and win new business, we will sometimes sacrifice gross margin percentage in order to generate incremental gross margin dollars.
 Everyone in the housing industry was dealt a serious blow during this downturn, and the past 6 years have been very, very difficult. As the housing industry recovers, we must continue our march towards positive cash flow. And to get there, we must continue growing our sales and expanding our customer base.
 Despite the fact that commodity lumber prices presented some unexpected challenges for us during the quarter, we were still able to achieve our goal of positive EBITDA, thanks largely to our top line sales growth. This was a significant step towards returning to profitability.
 I'll now turn the call over to Chad, who will review our financial results in more detail. 
M. Crow: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning, everyone. For the current quarter, we reported sales of $271.9 million, compared to $206.4 million for the second quarter of 2011, an increase of $65.5 million or 31.7%. We estimate sales increased approximately 29% due to increased sales volume and 3% due to price.
 Breaking down our sales by product category, prefabricated components were $51.2 million compared to $40.2 million in the second quarter of 2011; windows and doors increased approximately 27% to $59.3 million; lumber and lumber sheet goods were $87.9 million, an increase of 44.8%; our millwork category increased $4.8 million to $26.4 million; and other building products and services increased 26.2% to $47.1 million when compared to the same quarter last year.
 From a sales mix perspective, lumber and lumber sheet goods were 32.4% of total sales, up from 29.4% of total sales in the second quarter of 2011, due primarily to increased volume, which is indicative of more homes being in the early phase of the construction process. All other categories were fairly consistent between periods from a mix standpoint.
 Our gross margin percentage was 19.7%, down from 20.7% in the second quarter of 2011. The 100-basis-point decline was, as Floyd mentioned, primarily attributable to commodity lumber inflation. We estimate gross margin decreased 170 basis points due to commodity lumber inflation relative to customer pricing, but was offset somewhat by a 70-basis-point improvement due to increased sales volume.
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were $55 million for the current quarter. This is up only $6 million or 12.2% from the same quarter last year, despite a 31.7% increase in sales. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense decreased to 20.2% in the current quarter from 23.7% in the same quarter last year.
 In the current quarter, our salaries and benefits expense, excluding stock comp, was $34 million or 12.5% of sales compared to $28 million or 13.6% of sales in the second quarter of 2011. The $6 million increase is primarily related to higher sales commissions and additional staffing needs to service the increased sales volume.
 We recorded $100,000 of facility closure costs during the second quarter of 2012. During the second quarter of 2011, we recorded $1.9 million of facility closure costs, primarily related to the closure of a distribution facility in Georgia.
 Interest expense was $10.5 million in the current quarter, an increase of $4.8 million from 2011. This increase was primarily due to interest associated with our new term loan combined with a $600,000, non-cash, fair value adjustment related to stock warrants issued in connection with the term loan.  These increases were partially offset by the expiration of our interest rate swaps during the second quarter of last year.
 We recorded $144,000 of income tax expense in the second quarter of 2012 compared to $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2011. We recorded an after-tax, noncash, valuation allowance of $4.3 million and $6.8 million in the second quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively. These related to our net deferred tax assets. Absent the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate would have been 34.9% and 37.5% in 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of the end of the quarter, our gross federal income tax NOL available for carryforward was $212.3 million.
 Our loss from continuing operations in the current quarter was $12 million, or a $0.13 loss per diluted share, compared to a loss of $15.4 million, or $0.16 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.  Excluding the fair value adjustment for stock warrants, facility closure costs and the tax valuation allowance, our loss from continuing operations was $0.07 per diluted share in the current quarter. For the same quarter of 2011, our loss from continuing operations was $0.08 per diluted share, excluding facility closure costs and the tax valuation allowance.
 Adjusted EBITDA was $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2012 and represents a $3.4 million improvement when compared to a loss of $1.3 million in the same quarter last year.
 We continue to manage our working capital efficiently, as our working capital, expressed as a percentage of sales, was a healthy 9.2%, consistent with 9.1% for the second quarter of 2011. Our inventory turns improved to 9.9 turns compared to 9.3 turns for the same quarter last year. Our accounts receivable and accounts payable days held steady at 34 and 30 days, respectively.
 Our cash used for the current quarter was $24.5 million. Of this amount, $15.4 million was due to an increase in working capital and $2.2 million related to capital expenditures. The remaining $6.9 million was cash used in operations and for cash interest.
 We ended the quarter with cash of $105.1 million and net liquidity of $70.1 million, after giving effect to the $35 million minimum cash requirement contained in our term loan agreement. As of the end of June, our liquidity was in line with expectations, and our cash usage for fiscal 2012 is still expected to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million.
 In addition to the $105.1 million of cash, we also had $14.4 million of restricted cash at June 30, 2012, of which $1.8 million was included in long-term assets. Restricted cash consists of $13.5 million used to collateralize letters of credit outstanding under our letter of credit facility and $900,000 used as collateral for other casualty insurance obligations.
 I'll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments. 
Floyd Sherman: We were -- thanks, Chad. We were very pleased with our results for the second quarter. We made significant strides during the first half of 2012, a result of our employees' efforts over the past several years, positioning the company to take advantage of the improved housing environment we are finally seeing.
 We believe we'll be able to continue -- we'll continue to see housing gradually recover, which should drive further financial improvements in our business. Throughout this downturn, we have not wavered from our commitment to grow market share, improve operating efficiencies and conserve capital. It is extremely gratifying to see the hard work and dedication of all of our employees translating to improved financial results.
 I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Jack Kasprzak with BB&T. 
John Kasprzak: With regard to the higher prices of lumber, do you guys expect and -- that you'll be able to pass those along ultimately to the customers, given that the environment is still somewhat competitive? 
Floyd Sherman: Yes. I think, Jack, I really think that we'll be able to do that. We initially were able to pass on increases from the -- going from the first quarter into the second quarter. We've also put out increased pricing in the third quarter. What really caught us in the second quarter was that we overshot our budgets in terms of the sales. We really didn't think that we would produce the sales revenue that we did, and that caused us to go in and do a replacement set while the market was on a spike up. It since has fallen back. It's now looking like it's stabilizing. And I think the -- we will continue to be able to put legitimate increases through, and we'll be able to get those increases. 
John Kasprzak: Okay. You're referring to the price of lumber when you said stabilizing, I assume? 
Floyd Sherman: Yes, lumber and lumber sheet goods. Yes. 
John Kasprzak: Yes, okay. The macro statistics on housing, homebuilder sentiment index, housing starts, housing permits, if anything, in the last month or so, have gained momentum, I would say. Your sales performance has obviously been very good for a few quarters here in a row, but are you seeing that on the ground in your business now? Two units under construction have turned positive, single-family have turned positive. So despite very good sales performance so far, it seems like it's early on with the market-building momentum. Is there any reason to think we can't continue to see this kind of robust growth? 
Floyd Sherman: No. I think that we'll be able to continue that growth. The only thing that possibly could cause us to pull back, other than a major fallback in construction activity, is if we saw that we were unable to pass on legitimate cost increases that would cause us to say the margins were unacceptable and we're just -- would just not be a profitable business for us. But I really don't anticipate that taking place. And right now, we definitely are still continuing to see a very much improving construction activity out there. 
M. Crow: Jack, you make a good point. We've been very pleased with our sales the last few quarters, and that's been primarily, when you look at the statistics, driven by starts. We just now, this past month, saw units under construction turn the corner and started improving, and so that gives us even more to look forward to, I think, as these starts begin to turn into units under construction. So I think you make a good point there that we're still on the front end of what we feel like is a wave of construction coming through. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Seth Yeager with Jefferies & Company. 
Seth Yeager: So just following up on Jack's question, as far as the growth in starts versus units under construction, is it fair to say that maybe over the next couple quarters, we'll start to see a mix shift away from the lumber and lumber sheet goods and more towards some of the other products? Or is that not -- you don't really expect that to be the case at this point? 
Floyd Sherman: No, I think the -- we should see the rest of the product lines following the lumber, lumber sheet good sales. And so I think that, that will be an improving part of the mix in our business. But typically, the lumber and lumber sheet goods are what you're going to see in a trend of -- an improving trend of the housing activity. If the housing activity stays as robust as what we've seen up to this point, then I think you're going to see, until it stabilizes, still a little bit heavier tilt towards the lumber and lumber sheet good category. 
M. Crow: Yes. If we see -- keep seeing starts like we've seen recently, the units under construction will continue to lag a little bit. And then you've also got to factor in commodity lumber inflation. If that continues, then that obviously can impact your mix as well. But you're right, Seth. I mean, if we're starting houses, eventually the other products have to follow. 
Floyd Sherman: Yes. And typically, as we go into the winter months, you'll see then the housing activity starts slowing down and then as you're finishing the house, closing it in, you'll see then a pickup in the mix of the other products. 
Seth Yeager: Appreciate it. I think, in the last couple of quarters, you've said that you've noticed a bit of a more elongated lag between homebuilders breaking ground and actually waiting to see before they actually start construction. Is that starting -- is that lag starting to compress a bit? 
Floyd Sherman: Yes. We're seeing that starting to take place now. 
Seth Yeager: Okay, that's helpful. And then just I get the sense you guys are continuing to grab share. Can you maybe provide the number of new customers that you guys added? And just maybe talk a little bit about trends in the Carolinas versus Florida and Texas. I know you added some capacity to your windows in Texas. It seems like a pretty strong market. If you can maybe just give some additional detail on that? 
Floyd Sherman: Yes. In the second quarter, it was a record quarter for us as far as new customers opened there. Then that also produced the record sales for new customers in the quarter. So we're still seeing a very healthy trend as we are adding new customers, and those customers are producing meaningful dollars for us. So it's a good trend going for us. 
M. Crow: And from a market standpoint, you're right. Texas has still been very strong for us. And really, if you look at a quarter-over-quarter sales perspective, most of Florida has shown some really nice improvements for us as well. And then you've got pockets of The Carolinas that are really strong, and you've got other pockets that aren't as strong. 
Floyd Sherman: Yes.  And I will have to say we are seeing indications for the first time that some of the builders are actually starting to put in spec inventory or trying to get spec inventory on the ground. 
Seth Yeager: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a last question, if I can. At one point you mentioned maybe pulling back a little bit on sales growth to maintain margins. How do we think about when you guys start to, in a way, up the accelerator on the top line? And then just, as far as going forward, thoughts around concern on the liquidity front as far as financing the working capital to sort of continue to fund that top line growth. How should we think about that? 
Floyd Sherman: Well, we have indicated in the past that our goal, the next step is to get cash flow breakeven. In order for us to get cash flow breakeven with our current penetration, it's going to be somewhere in the $1.250 billion to $1.3 billion in top line to generate the type of results, financial results that we need. So we're going to continue driving our sales. We obviously have to be very, very conscious of the margins, and I think we have been and will continue to be. But our -- we need to get to cash flow breakeven, and it's going to take sales dollars to do it. And that's how we're going to be directing the company. 
M. Crow: And if we keep our, like you say, our foot on the accelerator and continue to grow sales, you're right, that's going to chew up more cash and working capital. And you've seen the last week or 2, there's been a lot of money coming into home building with some of the refinancings we've seen with the homebuilders. So we're just constantly striving for EBITDA improvement, and we just keep evaluating our liquidity and what options might be out there. But I really feel like if we can continue to show the financial improvement that we have, that there will be opportunities come along. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Howard Weinberg with UBS. 
Howard Weinberg: Want to go back to the inventory question and try to understand what you felt was sort of an appropriate level. And are you going into the third quarter with an appropriate level of inventory, given what you expect for sales in the third quarter? 
Floyd Sherman: Yes, the -- as far as going into the third quarter, again, we have tried to estimate what our requirements are going to be to serve the business that we see in front of us or feel will be in front of us. We're in that position that, right now, we've covered 75% of what we feel the need will be, and we'll always -- we never cover 100% because we always feel there's opportunities to take advantage of certain situations that may arise. And that's -- we're in a, what we think is a good position for the third quarter. Only time will tell. I certainly am not going to tell our people to slow down their selling efforts. But we'll be monitoring it very closely, and we'll do what we have to do to ensure that we have the inventory to back up our commitments. 
Howard Weinberg: And Floyd, regarding the 75% number, is that similar to what you had going into the second quarter as the sales just exceeded, compounded by the fact that the price of lumber went up so rapidly on you? 
Floyd Sherman: Well, we weren't able to really get as much coverage as what we have right now, and we really missed estimating what our sales were going to be. So it was a combination of the 2. I would say more of it was driven by our underestimation of the top line growth that we got. 
Howard Weinberg: Yes. And just on -- last question on this topic. To the extent that lumber prices were to fall over the next several quarters, and given your inventory levels, how are your contracts set up that you'd be able to protect your margin in that event? 
Floyd Sherman: Well, typically, most of our contracts are either 60-day or 90-day forward pricing. Most of them have a 30-day tail so that you're really, in effect, covering 120 days or 90 days, whatever the situation may be. So that's what our inventories are designed to cover. And so then we -- then out on a repricing at the end of a quarter, then it'll take into account whatever the market costs look like at that time for the lumber, lumber sheet good products. So it's -- we don't get -- on a downturn, we don't really get hurt because most in -- very, very rarely have we had it to where people don't honor the commitments that they have with us. So we don't really have much downside risk in the inventory. 
Howard Weinberg: Great. That's helpful. And then on the -- just want to switch over to liquidity. Chad, I think you talked about $45 million the $55 million of usage for fiscal 2012. Year-to-date, I think cash was down about $42 million. Should we be implying for the rest of the year that you're going to be, call it, negative $3 million to negative $13 million for the rest of the year? Is that the right way to think about guidance? 
M. Crow: That's correct. 
Howard Weinberg: Okay. And then just finally on the CapEx spending done on the window facility, how much additional CapEx is going to be needed to bring that up to meet demand? 
M. Crow: At the window plant? 
Howard Weinberg: Yes. 
M. Crow: We pretty much made that investment already. 
Floyd Sherman: Right. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will go next to Philip Volpicelli with Deutsche Bank. 
Philip Volpicelli: My question's regarding contribution margins. If I give you guys the $4 million that you say got hit on EBITDA from the higher lumber prices, that gets you to a change year-over-year, or about 11% contribution margin in terms of your growth over $65 million of revenue. As we move forward, how much faster or how much higher does that contribution margin get as you near that $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion target that you guys suggest gets you to free cash flow breakeven? 
M. Crow: You're right. Adding back -- obviously, your math is right. And then another thing that we struggle with this quarter was just the rapid ramp-up in sales volume and our increase in overtime and use of temp labor. So had we been able to control that a little better and anticipate a little better, that contribution margin, I think, would have been more in the 12% to 15% range. Long term, a lot of it will depend on how well we're able to increase gross margins, obviously. And if we can get commodity inflation and pass along those price increases, we get incremental flow-through there as well. Long term, I would love to be 15% to 20% EBITDA flow-through, and I think we can if everything falls right for us in a particular quarter. Obviously some things didn't go our way this quarter, but I think, over the long haul, I think anywhere from 15% to 20% is our goal. 
Philip Volpicelli: Got you. And as you get closer to that $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion, that contribution margin should accelerate, right, because you've got more volume going through what should be a relatively fixed-cost base? 
M. Crow: Yes, you'll obviously have some variable components to delivery as volumes grow. But yes, I would anticipate that we get additional gross margin. Commodity inflation always helps. So yes, I would agree with that statement. 
Philip Volpicelli: Okay. And then with regard to the facility, the $35 million availability block, have you had any discussions with the lender there on whether or not you can reduce that number? And why was it set at $35 million? Can you just give us some context as to why is it set there? 
M. Crow: We have not had any discussions to this point. And I think the block from their standpoint was just to make sure -- if we get down close to the block, it triggers some additional reporting requirements that we have to do to Highbridge. And I think it's just a -- it's a point where they just want to be closer to the business and just making sure that, obviously, that their assets are protected. 
Philip Volpicelli: Okay. All right. And I guess one last question. What target EBITDA margin -- I mean, if I do the math to get to $50 million, which is roughly your breakeven at $1.25 billion and $1.3 billion, it's roughly a 4% EBITDA margin, which historically you guys have been able to achieve that pretty easily. What margin are you targeting, kind of, let's say, a year out? 
M. Crow: Oh, gosh. There's a lot of variables that go into that question. 
Philip Volpicelli: I mean, do you think you can get back to the 6%, 7% you had in the boom years? Or is that reflective of what it was at boom? 
M. Crow: Can we get back to that in a year? 
Philip Volpicelli: No. Over time. 
M. Crow: Oh, absolutely. We... 
Floyd Sherman: We will be... 
M. Crow: Back at the peak, we were 8%, 8.5%. 
Floyd Sherman: And with the permanent costs that we've taken out of the business... 
M. Crow: We should do better than that long term. 
Floyd Sherman: We'll be better than that. 
Philip Volpicelli: Okay. I guess there's too many variables to kind of go through it. But I appreciate the information. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Sean Boyd with Westcliff Capital Management. 
Sean Boyd: Just a couple, and I think I'm coming back to the same topic, but maybe coming at it from a different way. If I heard you correctly, the year-over-year change in gross margin was actually a little bit worse than the drop because we had scale that gave us about 80 bps to the positive. 
M. Crow: Right. 
Sean Boyd: So if we hadn't had the issues on lumber pricing, our gross margin would have been around 21.5%. 
Floyd Sherman: Right. 
M. Crow: That's correct. 
Sean Boyd: Okay. And of course, that's kind of a theoretical exercise, but the scale is definitely kicking in. So to your other comment about so far in the quarter, the price has been stable, and that's allowed you to improve gross margins in the quarter. Does that mean that we -- on a year-over-year basis, you're not seeing any impact so far in the quarter? 
M. Crow: Well, as Floyd mentioned earlier, we do have, in a lot of cases, a 30-day tail on the pricing commitments. So said another way, if Builders had submitted a PO prior to quarter end, then we give a 30-day grace period to carry over that pricing. So to sit here and tell you thus far, through July, we're not seeing an impact, would be incorrect, because we still have some of that tail coming through. But to answer the question a little more broadly, yes, we should see margin improvement this quarter, assuming a stable commodity environment. 
Sean Boyd: Okay. And just last thing on the gross margin, again, barring any issues such as the -- we had in this quarter. Can we target a particular gross margin, a particular level of revenues? So going back to that $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion cash flow breakeven, is that a 22% gross margin? 23%? How do you look at that? 
M. Crow: I would say you're in the ballpark, yes. I'm not going to get into forecasting gross margins. There's just too many components. But yes, you're in the ballpark, I think. 
Sean Boyd: Okay. Last one from me is on the SG&A, that being up the last 2 quarters year-over-year. We've talked about that having, I think it's about a 35% variable component. And so I'm at the point of just trying to grow that at sort of 35% of the overall revenue growth rate. Is there anything coming down the pike that would change that? Any sort of expansion or contraction that would step change it so that I'm not looking at the growth [ph]? 
M. Crow: I think I've said that up to about $1 billion in revenue, we should be about 35% variable. Once we blow past $1 billion in revenue, we will become more variable. We've got to start adding fleet, we've got to start adding drivers to keep up with the incremental volume. So I think once we get past $1 billion in revenue, you'll see that migrate down closer to a 50-50 split. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Rob Hansen with Deutsche Bank. 
Rob Hansen: I just wanted to see -- you mentioned that you had a record number of new customers. I just wanted to see what that number was? And then how many -- how much of that was related to the 2 new market entrances that you had over the past couple quarters? And also, what percentage is -- how much sales have you got in the last quarter from those 2 markets? 
Floyd Sherman: I'm not going to start giving sales dollars by the new markets. I think we've stayed away from that. One of them certainly has been -- has had more meaningful numbers. The other one hadn't even really opened until well into July. So it would be -- that number would be -- wouldn't mean anything. As far as the number of new accounts that we opened, 562, and if – and they are unique new customers for us. The new location in Austin, Texas, certainly was part of that number, very small piece of that, because we were already selling a certain amount of product into Austin, and they picked up part of that business. So they had less than -- probably not much more than 5% of that total. 
Rob Hansen: Okay. And then you mentioned that sales generally exceeded your own kind of internal forecasts. What parts of the country were -- exceeded your forecast? 
Floyd Sherman: Texas, Florida, Baltimore, Washington. 
Rob Hansen: Okay. And just one last one was, you've kind of talked about this in the past, I just wanted to kind of see if you could remind us, kind of refresh us in terms of the permanent cost that you've taken out of the business that should help you going forward. 
M. Crow: We estimate that to be $20 million to $25 million annually. 
Operator: At this time, there appears to be no further questions. Mr. Sherman, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing comments. 
Floyd Sherman: All right. Well, we appreciate everyone's participating on the call today. Any questions that you may have, that you'd like to follow up on from what you've heard today, don't hesitate to give Chad a call. That will conclude our presentation for today. 
Operator: This concludes the Builders FirstSource Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-04-20 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Builders FirstSource First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Mr. Floyd Sherman, Chief Executive Officer. [Operator Instructions] Any reproduction of this call, in whole or in part, is not permitted without prior written authorization of Builders FirstSource.

We have provided reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents in our earnings press release and detailed explanation of non-GAAP financial measures in our Form 8-K filed yesterday, both of which are available on our website.
 At this time, I will turn the call over to Mr. Floyd Sherman. 
Floyd Sherman: Thank you, and welcome to our first quarter 2012 earnings call. Joining me today from our management team is Chad Crow, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll start BY giving a recap of the first quarter, and then turn the call over to Chad who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions.
 Sales for the first quarter of 2012 were $219.4 million, an increase of 34.7% when compared to the first quarter of 2011. This marks our third consecutive quarter with year-over-year sales growth greater than 20%. Our sales growth continues to outpace construction activity as actual U.S. single-family housing starts were up only 16.8% compared to the same quarter last year, and U.S. single-family units under construction actually decreased 5% over the same period. Commodity lumber prices for the current quarter were, on average, relatively consistent with those during the first quarter of 2011. When combined, these factors indicate we continue to achieve significant market shares while not sacrificing gross margin performance to achieve our market share gains.
 The momentum we gained in the last half of 2011 carried over into 2012, enabling us to continue to improve our financial results. Our sales in the current quarter represented our highest first quarter sales since the first quarter of 2008, and our sales per single-family start of approximately $2,100 with a high watermark for the company. I might point out that we have also improved our sales per start performance in each of the last 3 quarters. Our market share with all classifications of builders, including the large national, regional and local builders, continued to grow, and we continue to open significant numbers of new customer accounts. In the first quarter of 2012, we sold to approximately 350 new accounts, which amounted to a sales dollar increase of 36% when compared to the first quarter 2011 new account sales dollars.
 Our adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $2.1 million, a $7.6 million improvement over the first quarter of 2011. These dramatically improved results were only made possible through the tireless efforts of our employees who continue to fight to make the most out of any and all construction activity within our markets.
 Our results certainly would seem to indicate we are getting close to achieving positive EBITDA performance, another major accomplishment delivered by what I believe is the best team in the building materials industry. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Chad who will review our financial results in more detail. 
M. Crow: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning, everyone. For the current quarter, we reported sales of $219.4 million compared to $162.8 million for the first quarter of 2011, an increase of $56.6 million or 34.7%. The increase is primarily due to increased sales volume as commodity prices for Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods were on average comparable over these periods. 
 Breaking down our sales by product category, Prefabricated Components were $43.5 million, up approximately 41% when compared to $30.8 million in the first quarter of 2011. Windows & Doors increased 30% to $49.7 million. Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods were $66.4 million, an increase of 38.1%. Our Millwork category increased 21% to $21.4 million and Other Building Products & Services were $38.4 million, up 37.2% when compared to $28 million in the same quarter last year. 
 Our sales mix was fairly consistent to that of the first quarter last year. Our gross margin percentage was 20.6%, up from 19.3% for first quarter of 2011, a 1.3 percentage point improvement, which was primarily attributable to our ability to further leverage fixed cost against increased sales volume. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $50.9 million, up only $4.2 million or 9.1% from the same quarter last year despite a 34.7% increase in sales. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense decreased to 23.2% in the current quarter and 28.7% in the same quarter last year. 
 For Q1 2012, our salaries and benefits expense, excluding stock comp expense, was $31.1 million or 14.2% of sales compared to $26.6 million or 16.3% of sales in the first quarter of 2011. Office G&A expense decreased $700,000 in the current quarter, primarily due to reduction in professional services while delivery expense increased $600,000, largely due to higher fuel prices and increased sales volume. 
 Interest expense was $13.1 million in the current quarter, an increase of $7.2 million from the first quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily due to interest associated with our new term loan combined with a $3.1 million noncash fair value adjustment related to stock warrants issued in connection with the term loan. We recorded $174,000 of income tax expense in the first quarter of 2012 compared to a $17,000 income tax benefit in the first quarter of 2011. We recorded an after-tax noncash valuation allowance of $7 million and $8.1 million in the first quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively, that related to our deferred tax assets. Absent this valuation allowance, our tax benefit rate would have been 36.3% and 38.4% in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
 Loss from continuing operations in the current quarter was $19.1 million or a $0.20 loss per diluted share compared to a loss of $21.1 million or a $0.22 loss per diluted share in the same quarter last year. Excluding the fair value adjustment for stock warrants and the tax valuation allowance, our loss from continuing operations was $0.11 per diluted share for current quarter. For the first quarter of 2011, our loss from continuing operations was $0.13 per diluted share, excluding transaction costs and the tax valuation allowance.
 Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2012. As Floyd pointed out earlier, this is a $7.6 million improvement when compared to a loss of $9.7 million in the same quarter last year.
 We continue to manage our working capital efficiently as our working capital expressed as a percentage of sales improved to 9.8%, down from 11.1% for the first quarter of 2011. Our accounts receivable days held steady at 33.4 days while our inventory turns improved to 8.8 turns compared to 7.5 turns for the first quarter of 2011 and our accounts payable days were slightly higher at 30.4 days. 
 Our cash used for the current quarter was $17.2 million. Of this amount, $2.4 million was due to an increase in working capital and $1.7 million related to capital expenditures. The remaining $13.1 million was cash used to fund operations and cash interest for the quarter. We ended the quarter with cash of $129.6 million and net liquidity of $94.6 million after giving effect to the $35 million minimum cash requirement contained in our term loan agreement. 
 Our liquidity at the end of the quarter was better than anticipated due to our improved P&L performance combined with our efficient use of working capital. We still feel the liquidity discussion in our most recent 10-K reflects reasonable guidance regarding our near-term liquidity needs. 
 To summarize, we expect our cash usage for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million and to end 2012 with cash of $90 million to $100 million and liquidity of $55 million to $65 million after deducting the $35 million cash requirement in our term loan. Our first quarter was stronger than we had forecasted. The one quarter does not a year make and we are therefore not prepared to revise our liquidity guidance at this time. In addition to the $129.6 million of cash, we also had $15 million in restricted cash at the end of the quarter, of which $1.6 million was included in long-term assets. Restricted cash consists of $14.1 million used to collateralize letters of credit outstanding under our letter of credit facility and $900,000 as collateral for other casualty insurance obligations. 
 I'll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments. 
Floyd Sherman: Thank you, Chad. We are very encouraged by our first quarter results and expect the momentum we have gained to continue to reflect positively on our 2012 financial results. We remain optimistic about the long-term health of our industry and our ability to position the company to take advantage of further improvements in housing. The recently announced April opening of our general Texas distribution facility in our entry into the greater Austin market is a perfect example of our optimism and positioning of the company for continued growth. My sincere gratitude goes out to all Builders FirstSource employees for their ongoing dedication and commitment to see the company return to profitability. 
 I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
 And we'll take our first question from Rob Hansen from Deutsche Bank. 
Rob Hansen: I just had a question on the 350 new accounts that you've signed up. Now, are these -- are you beginning to see new builders spring up at all or are these existing builders who just gained some market share essentially? 
Floyd Sherman: A combination of both. Some of them are new builders that are -- that have entered into the business and others are new customers for us. But that -- formerly we're doing business with other competitors. So it's a combination of both. 
Rob Hansen: Okay. And what have your customers told you that you're doing differently and that's why they've switched, the ones who have switched. 
M. Crow: I can comment on that real quick. From discussions I've had with some of the new customers, most of it seems to be service related. I think they just value our service and have had service issues with some of our competitors, and that's the comments I've gotten,  and Floyd, I don't know if you heard anything different. 
M. Crow: No, I think that's a pretty good summary of what we're hearing. 
Rob Hansen: Okay. And then on your -- the expansion into Austin. Do you think you'll see any other opportunities like this and have you booked at any other markets where you think you can expand? 
M. Crow: Yes, I think there will be, as we have said in the past, if we can expand markets that are contiguous to our current market that we're operating in into where there is a -- certainly a migration of customers that we're currently doing business with to enter into new markets and would like to see us provide them with materials and services. We're going to look real hard at that and there are several situations that fall into this category that we're looking at right now. I really don't -- it's very premature to say whether we'll be doing any more near-term expansion, but we certainly are looking at it where we can leverage off of existing facilities. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
 We'll take our next question from Howard Weinberg of UBS. 
Howard Weinberg: Could you guys go back and talk about those new customers that you mentioned and I may have missed it on the prepared comments, but could you talk about what the incremental sales were from those customers and just sort of give us some perspective of what organic customers are doing versus the new business that you've been winning? 
Floyd Sherman: The new customer sales would make up less than 5% of our total sales for the quarter. But nevertheless, it is a significant number for us, and it's usually a number that continued to grow then during the course of the year because from the time you do get credit approval and get a customer set up until you actually begin supplying with materials, a lot of that may push -- the process may start in the beginning of the quarter, but it's halfway through the quarter before you start making any meaningful shipments done. So this -- while the number may be small in view of the total sales for the quarter, it's still nevertheless, is an important part of the future growth of the company. 
M. Crow: And Howard, Floyd did say in his prepared comments that sales to new customers were almost $5 million in the first quarter. 
Howard Weinberg: Okay, and sorry, Chad, I missed that. Regarding your gross margin, certainly the 1/3 -- 130 basis points is great but with continued -- how should we be thinking about this going forward? You guys had almost 35% growth in sales, 130 basis point improvement in margin. Could we start seeing the expansion from here or should we think it's going to be stabilizing from here? And if you could just comment and give us some insight on how to think about the sales leverage. 
M. Crow: From my perspective, it's, to some degree, it's unchartered waters for us. I mean, the sales gains we've been achieving the last 3 quarters, I don't remember and I've been here a long time. I don't remember seeing anything like it. And this recovery -- this recession and recovery is obviously unprecedented. It's really hard to predict what might happen as we continue to go through this housing recovery. Sitting here today, I feel like we have a ton of momentum, and I see no reason we can't maintain the sales growth we've been achieving and maintain the sales per start that we've had the last few quarters but again, it's a little bit of unchartered waters for us. 
Floyd Sherman: And Chad, we're a pretty aggressive group of people, and I think we have a very, very aggressive sales team out there working for the company. And yet, we are greatly exceeding even our expectations of what we're going to be seeing. We saw it all during the last half of 2011. It's carried into 2012 and we don't see any slowdown in the current time with the weight of sales gain. 
Howard Weinberg: Beyond the sales gain, it sounds like I think you commented on the last question that the sales gain really came from service rather than competitive pricing, but I'm just trying to go back and drill down on the sales leverage. I mean, obviously, it's a distribution based model, which if you're going to get incremental sales I'm assuming you have a relatively high percentage of fixed costs that need to be leveraged. So as these incremental sales, I mean, could we see margin, I mean, are you guys thinking margin could be up several hundred basis points? 
Floyd Sherman: I would like to see them up several hundred basis points, but it's going to be tough to keep raising the margin especially -- typically, you would expect to see some margin give-up as you dramatically increase your market share. However, so far, we have not seen this. And we certainly are doing everything possible to see that we continue on our current pace. To raise it several hundred basis points in the near term, I think that would be extremely difficult, and I certainly wouldn't -- could not support that. 
M. Crow: No, I think, we would, like Floyd said, we would have to have an improvement in the pricing environment to get a 200 basis point improvement this year. And that's going to really take a real major improvement in the construction activity and especially in the area that we operate in. Homes under construction is what we sell into and that starts and permits are really a precursor of future business to come. Units under construction is really the measurement of construction activity, and we're going to have to see a major improvement in that in order to really be able to start elevating our pricing, I suspect. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Sean Boyd of Westcliff Capital Management. 
Sean Boyd: Just a couple here. On the quarter, can you talk a little bit about if the quarter had any -- if we had any boost from kind of opportunistic inventory buys, help [ph] business product that we're able to get out there? 
Floyd Sherman: The -- we certainly made some significant inventory buy in the commodity areas, which are the framing materials and panels -- structural panels in the fourth quarter. Our buys were really scheduled to protect what we do with some long-term pricing agreements, some 60- and 90-day pricing agreements that we were entering into, as well as what our anticipated level of business would be. We dramatically overshot our anticipated sales levels, which meant that we were back into a replenishment mode before quarter end. And prices started moving up during the course of the quarter, especially in the last 45 days of the quarter. And so our replacement costs was slightly higher, so it did affect our margins somewhat on the back half of the quarter. But we again began looking at and protecting ourselves going into the second quarter, and the -- and it's really a good thing that we did because we have seen significant increases in the commodity markets since the last few weeks of March, and I think going into now, April. The prices of lumber and OSB are up anywhere from 8% to 11%, 12%. And I think that we may see a continuation of that trend as the quarter progresses. Right now, we have protected ourselves. We, again, if our sales force overachieves again, we're going to find ourself back again into replenishment and that diminishes somewhat of the benefit that you got from your buys. But I think right now, I think we have a pretty good handle on the commodity and the inventory side of our business. 
Sean Boyd: Got it. So to be clear, in both of those cases, you ended up -- actual sales came in higher than what you originally forecasted and what you originally budgeted for in terms of purchases? 
Floyd Sherman: Yes, that's quite a bit [ph]. 
Sean Boyd: And the other thing I want to think about here is, just from a quarter-to-quarter perspective, whether we have seen the housing starts numbers on a national basis kind of calm down a little bit. And -- so any thought you can get us as to your own view of what you're hearing from the stores, from the different locations, from a bottoms up standpoint, do you feel like we've robbed the June quarter at all? 
Floyd Sherman: The feedback we're getting from our people in the field, and they of course are in contact daily with the builders in all of the various markets. Builders are still very optimistic. They certainly see an improving climate out there. No one is saying that -- there's -- the lid is coming off, but everyone feels that the year will be better than certainly we saw in 2011. The optimism that's out there now is higher than where I personally feel it may end up. I'm more in the area of 5% to 7%, 8% improvement in single-family, coming through the construction -- units under construction phase. I think the feeling of the builders is at probably somewhere in the 10% to 12%, 14% increase. So it's a much healthier atmosphere out there but far from being something that you would say is a robust. 
Sean Boyd: Got it. And compared to a year ago, that's also a very different outlook. A year ago, builders weren't expecting 10% to 14%. 
Floyd Sherman: Yes, and the feeling is now people are saying they really believe that there will be a continual improvement in the level of activity and it's not -- no one -- I really have not heard any comments, the negative comments of saying well, it's getting ready to fall back or is going to fall back, that the housing isn't going to sustain itself. So I think that's very, very encouraging. 
Sean Boyd: Got it. Okay. On operating expenses, if I can jump to that for a second, a little bit higher than I would have anticipated. At the $51 million level, is there -- is that the kind of level we should think about is going to the rest of the year? Or do we have anything in particular that hit in the March quarter that perhaps is not recurring? Can you help us on the operating expenses here? 
M. Crow: Well, when you do get into the first quarter, we do get hit with a few extra expenses. For example, employer payroll taxes, we get reset on that. So if you're comparing, say Q4 to Q1, that's going to be a difference. That was probably about $1.5 million increase in Q1 over Q4. And as the year progresses and we cap out on some of those employer taxes, you'll see that number come down. Another item that hit the P&L in Q1, we have a use-it-or-lose-it vacation policy. If you don't use your vacation, by the end of the year, you lose it. But we're required to accrue it on the front half of the year, and then you'll see that accrual come down. So that was another $1 million in expense in Q1 that you wouldn't have seen in Q4 as well. So those are couple of the larger items I can think of. 
Floyd Sherman: And then you've got the fuel cost increase. 
M. Crow: Then obviously fuel, yes, because of the higher fuel costs and the increase in sales volume. So there were a few expenses in Q1 that were higher than you're going to see in the back half. 
Sean Boyd: Okay. And so we've got $2 million, $2.5 million there. Okay, helpful. And also on the interest expense, if I could, when you backed out... 
M. Crow: I would like to point out Sean, our business traditionally is going to run about -- on SG&A side, total expense of 65% fixed, 35% variable. We actually flexed better than that. Our SG&A salary, wages, commissions. The commissions are going to vary directly with your increase in margin dollars since we pay a percentage of gross profit. We actually had a very positive flex with the increase. As Chad pointed out, I think our total SG&A was up about 9% against the 35%, 34.5% increase in sales. And so when 35% of your -- under normal circumstances, 35% of your SG&A dollars are going to be variable, directly variable with volume, I think we had a very, very efficient cost control in the first quarter in spite of some unusual expenses. 
Sean Boyd: Yes, now I hear you on that. And honestly, if you look back to the last couple of years, you've shown that, right? We haven't had great years, but we've had slightly good -- 11% growth last year, 3% a year before and yet you guys kept the SG&A very flat. So that's why I'm asking the question. I figured there was something variable in there, but at the same time, you've really done a good job keeping that fixed over the last... 
M. Crow: Yes. We've now gotten to the point, especially with that type of volume increase, you got to start adding in more drivers, you have to start adding in more yard personnel, other service support personnel out in the operation because we had really reduced our FTEs, which is a full-time equivalent from our high, we dropped from a little over 8,800 FTEs to where we got down into the mid-2,500s. And now, we're gradually creeping back up. At first, we were able to push that and we got a little bit better recovery in the last portion of 2010 and 2011. But we've had to start adding people back now. 
Sean Boyd: Got it. Okay, last one for me. Interest expense, when you back out the fair value of stock once you're -- if you -- we look at -- we're at about $10 million a quarter, is that the appropriate level to think about for the rest of the year? 
M. Crow: Well, if you include amortization of debt discount and debt issued cost, that's probably close, but cash interest will be about $37 million for the year. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
 We'll take our next question from Philip Volpicelli from Deutsche Bank. 
Sean Wondrack: This is Sean Wondrack on for Phil. Good sales growth this quarter. As one of the last gentleman had mentioned, weather was historically warm during the first quarter this year, and I'm not sure if you guys were able to quantify it, but do you have any idea how much of the impact on organic sales weather was during 1Q? 
Floyd Sherman: We really don't think it had that much of an effect on us. We don't operate in the Northeast quarter or the Midwest where the former winter reflected an improvement in the building activity. In the Southwest, Southeast, traditionally, they had been good building periods in the past and they were again this year. I think there was minimal affect I'll say, certainly less than 10%, maybe 5%, we may have had an advantage with weather. But in talking with our folks and just observing what was going on, that's the most I would attribute to it. 
Philip Volpicelli: Okay, that's helpful. And then also, I apologize if you mentioned this earlier. Did you outline any CapEx guidance for fiscal 2012? I know you guys have kept it at a very low level. 
M. Crow: Yes, we have and there'll be a little more this year than last year. I think this year, it's probably going to be, I would say in the -- about $8 million. About $5 million to $6 million of that is continued buyouts of equipment leases and then we've got some capital improvements we're doing in some of our manufacturing facilities, so -- but we're thinking about $8 million this year. 
Operator: At this time, it appears there are no more questions. Mr. Sherman, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. 
Floyd Sherman: Okay. We certainly appreciate your interest and tuning into the call. And if you have any questions and any follow-up questions that you'd like to ask, don't hesitate to give either Chad Crow or Marcie Hyder a call here in Dallas. We'll be glad to try to answer the questions for you. 
Operator: This concludes the Builders FirstSource conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-02-17 00:00:00) =====

 At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Floyd Sherman. Please go ahead. 
Floyd Sherman: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2011 earnings call. Joining me from our management team today is Chad Crow, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer. And I'll start with a recap of the fourth quarter and fiscal year, and then I'll turn the call over to Chad, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we'll take your questions.
 Our sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $192.7 million, up 31% from sales of $147.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. We accomplished this substantial sales increase despite actual U.S. single-family starts increasing only 4.7%, the average number of U.S. single-family units under construction decreasing 10.7% and average commodity prices being relatively flat during the quarter.
 Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $3.3 million compared to a loss of $12.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. For fiscal year 2011, we ended the year with sales of $779.1 million, up 11.2% over 2010 sales of $700.3 million and improved our adjusted EBITDA by $28.6 million to a loss of $15 million. Our financial results improved in spite of an 8.6% decline in U.S. single-family starts, a 14.1% decline in U.S. single-family units under construction and commodity deflation of approximately 6% for the year. 
 We continue to open a significant number of new accounts and increase our sales with the national builders. In addition, our improved liquidity made possible by our new term loan enabled us to take advantage of opportunistic inventory buys towards the end of the year. Our strong inventory position at year end should allow us to cover our customer requirements in the first quarter of 2012 and also give our sales force the flexibility to continue to pursue new sales opportunities. Single-family housing starts in 2011 were the lowest since the downturn began in 2006. I am extremely proud that despite this fact, we were able to dramatically grow our market share and make such sizable improvements to our financial results. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Chad, who will review our financial results in more detail. 
M. Crow: Thank you, Floyd. Good morning, everyone. For the current quarter, we reported sales of $192.7 million compared to $147.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of $45.6 million or 31%. We estimate sales increased approximately 29% due to volume and 2% due to price. Breaking down our sales by product category: Prefabricated Components were $35.6 million, up approximately 37% when compared to $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2010; Windows & Doors increased 28.3% to $47.2 million; Lumber & Lumber Sheet Goods were $54.2 million, an increase of $13.4 million or approximately 33%; our Millwork category increased $3.5 million to $20.2 million; and our Other Building Products & Services increased 32.5% to $35.5 million. From the sales mix perspective, we saw no significant changes among our product categories. 
 Our gross margin percentage was 20.4%, up from 19.1% for the fourth quarter of last year. The 1.3 percentage point improvement is primarily attributable to increased sales volumes and our ability to leverage fixed cost within cost of goods sold. Our selling, general and administrative expenses were $47.1 million, up only $1.5 million or 3.2% from the same quarter last year despite a 31% increase in sales. As a percentage of sales, however, SG&A expense decreased to 24.4% in the current quarter from 31% in the same quarter last year. For the fourth quarter of 2011, our salaries and benefits expense, excluding stock comp expense, was $27.1 million or 14.1% of sales compared to $26.1 million or 17.7% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2010. Delivery expense increased $600,000 or 7.4% for the current quarter as a result of increased sales volume. Interest expense was $8.1 million in the current quarter, an increase of $1.2 million from the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to the issuance of our new term loan in December of 2011.
 We recorded $300,000 of income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to a $100,000 income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2010. We recorded an after-tax non-cash valuation allowance of $6.5 million and $9.4 million in the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to our net deferred tax asset. Absent the valuation allowance, our tax benefit rate would have been 38% and 38.9% in the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
 Loss from continuing operations was $16.6 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared to a loss of $24.5 million or $0.26 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. Excluding the valuation allowance, facility closure cost and debt issue cost write-offs, our loss from continuing operations was $0.10 per diluted share for the current quarter compared to a loss of $0.15 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our net loss for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $16.7 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared to a loss of $24.6 million or $0.26 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $3.3 million, a $9.2 million improvement when compared to a loss of $12.5 million in the same quarter last year. 
 Given our strong sales performance during the quarter combined with the inventory buys Floyd previously mentioned, we did not see the anticipated reduction in working capital and, in fact, saw working capital increase during the quarter by approximately $8 million. However, our components of working capital remained healthy for the quarter as our accounts receivable days were 35.3 days compared to 36.2 days in the fourth quarter of 2010. Inventory turns were 8.7 turns compared to 7.9 turns, and our accounts payable days were just below 30 days.
 Our cash usage for the current quarter was approximately $20.6 million excluding the net effects of the recently completed term loan and letter of credit facility and the payoff of our previous credit facility and the remaining 2012 notes. Of this $20.6 million of cash used, $8 million was attributable to increased working capital needs, the result of our increased sales and $2.1 million related to capital expenditures. The remaining $10.5 million was used to fund operating losses and cash interest expense for the quarter and represents an $8.8 million improvement over the $19.3 million used to fund operating losses and cash interest in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
 On December 2, 2011, we completed a new $160 million first-lien term loan financial agreement and entered into a standalone letter of credit facility, which provides for the issuance of up to $20 million of letters of credit. The term loan and letter of credit facility both mature on September 30, 2015. In conjunction with this transaction, we repaid the $20 million outstanding under our 2007 senior secured revolving credit facility and terminated the facility.
 We ended the year with cash of $146.8 million and net liquidity of $111.8 million after giving effect of the $35 million minimum cash requirement contained in our new term loan agreement. In addition to the $146 million -- $146.8 million of cash, we also had $15.1 million in restricted cash at December 31, 2011, of which $1.9 million was included in long-term assets. Restricted cash consists of $14.2 million we used from the proceeds of the term loan to collateralize letters of credit outstanding under the new letter of credit facility and $900,000 provided as collateral for other casualty insurance obligations. 
 I'll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments. 
Floyd Sherman: Thank you, Chad. Though 2011 presented us with the fewest number of U.S. single-family housing starts since the downturn began, we significantly improved our results through the continued execution of our strategy, which focuses on pricing discipline, cost containment, preserving liquidity and providing superior customer service. I believe that through the dedication and sacrifices of our employees, we have positioned Builders FirstSource to outperform the competition and take full advantage of the expected housing recovery in our markets. I'm truly excited about the future of our company, and I'm ever grateful for our employees, customers and vendors that have partnered with us during these trying times. 
 I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Now we'll go to Philip Volpicelli from Deutsche Bank. 
Philip Volpicelli: With regard to the term loan that you issued, I understand it was $160 million and you issued at $0.97 on the $1, so that gives you about $155 million, but the net proceeds to you were only about $119.6 million. I was wondering, was the remainder fees that were paid to the underwriters or paid to the lender? 
M. Crow: Well, we had $14 million we had to use to back the LCs. I'm not sure if you took that into account. 
Philip Volpicelli: Okay, so that... 
M. Crow: And there were -- there was a -- there were some fees involved, but I think the biggest difference there is the cash collateral. 
Philip Volpicelli: So the remainder between the $14 million and the number I quoted would be fees? 
M. Crow: That's correct. 
Philip Volpicelli: Okay. And then, clearly we've seen an improvement in multi-family starts to begin the year here, and single-family seems to be kind of treading water. I know you, in the past, have talked a little bit about how much benefit you get from multi-family versus single-family. Can you remind us of those -- what the discount is for a multi-family start being a smaller unit versus a single-family in terms of [indiscernible]? 
Floyd Sherman: Typically in square footage, your average multi-family unit probably runs somewhere in the neighborhood of 750 square feet per unit. The single-family home is somewhere around 2,200 and -- I think this past year, 2,258 square feet. The multi-family unit, obviously, is a lower dollar value per unit. It is holding consistent in the mix of our company. So we are continuing to increase our multi-family light commercial sales on the same pace as we go our -- the single-family side of the business. I would have to remind you, and we have this come up quite often, while the starts and permit data are definitely increasing and we're very, very optimistic that that will soon begin reflecting itself in units under construction, to date, we have not really seen a major movement from starts into units under construction and then on to completions. For us, a start or permit is nothing more than a precursor of what the future building activity has in store for us. And so the -- while everything is looking very good from the starts and permit basis, we are hopeful that we will soon begin seeing it flow into the homes under construction side of the business. 
Philip Volpicelli: And, Floyd, what is that lag from the start, which is building the foundation nerve or preparing the land to actually erecting the wooden skeleton which would help you guys? 
Floyd Sherman: Well typically, once you've got to start and you finished your dirt work and you've got your footing [ph] then or the basement in, the construction proceeded very quickly, typically within 30 days. Now we're seeing a much longer lag period, somewhere in the 4- to 6-month period. A lot of this has to do with the fact that the builders are very reluctant to start the construction process on a house until they feel the buyer is going to be able to complete the financial contract. The process of getting a mortgage approved, getting the appraisals on the house worked out is a very, very difficult process. It probably -- in my estimation, it's affecting the actual housing construction portion of the industry more than anything else. The builders continually -- you will hear them saying that the mortgage process is extremely difficult, extremely slow, and the appraisal issues are really keeping the pricing down for the builder. Very, very tough environment out there. 
Philip Volpicelli: Understood. My last question. Chad, can we just walk through the I guess hurdles to free cash flow positive. So if I do my math correctly, interest expense should be somewhere around $36 million, $37 million. And then what are you guys expecting for capital expenditures for 2012? 
M. Crow: Probably about $8 million. 
Philip Volpicelli: $8 million. So if I just add those 2 numbers, am I in the right ballpark? 
M. Crow: Yes. 
Operator: And we'll now go to Seth Yeager from Jefferies & Company. 
Seth Yeager: Are you starting to see gross margins come back in that prefab division? I know that was one of the hardest hit from the downturn. Is that something that's starting to come back a little bit and is some of the competition starting to drop out of the market? Are you getting guys that are slowly coming in with things picking up a little bit? 
Floyd Sherman: Yes, we're seeing improvement in the margins on that side of the business. Still not anything where it needs to be. We're still fighting the issues of what I will say is low-cost labor on the job sites giving the builders an alternative in many cases to where they can use conventional stick framing versus components. The time is really not of the essence the way it has been in the past that really plays into the advantage that components -- one of the major advantages that components have to offer. The -- I think as the housing recovery keeps taking place and as we see the improvement in the housing environment, I think that we will start seeing the margins moving up to a more acceptable rate than what we have right now. And the timing again will become a very important part of the -- or consideration for the builder. 
Seth Yeager: Okay. So until we start to see -- and that's helpful. Until we start to see turnarounds closer to that 1 to 2 months where guys are starting to build, you're probably not going to see much -- a heck of a lot of expansion in margins there. Is that sort of safe to say -- until that cycles in? 
Floyd Sherman: Even this year on an overall basis, I think even with the worst year in housing starts, we were able to substantially increase our margins. So we've overcome even a declining construction level and our people are working really hard out in the field to improve our margins. We're getting good product mix, or the product mix, as Chad said earlier, has stayed very consistent, and we continue to really sell hard on our value proposition, which I think we offer a better value proposition to our customers than any competitors that's out there. And I think the builders are recognizing that and giving us a very slight improvement. But it continues to get better all the time. So I'm very, very pleased with the progress that we're making in improving and bringing our margins up in spite of still a very, very tough pricing environment. 
Seth Yeager: I mean just looking back I think over the last, I don't know, 6 or 7 quarters, you guys have had pretty nice gross margin improvement, and it looks like your inventories are positioned to an area where you may benefit from some price increases here in January. I mean, what's the -- you guys have been pretty consistent above 20% over the last 3 quarters. I mean is that a decent baseline at this point? Do you think you could get back to maybe 21%? I guess, what's the target internally there? 
M. Crow: Looking out further than just this year, we hope to get well above the 21% level. But I think 21% is probably a pretty good goal for this year. 
Seth Yeager: Okay, yes. I was just talking to this year. 
Floyd Sherman: And, Seth, I -- just to give you a little bit of magnitude of the improvement that we have seen in the component side, on a quarter-over-quarter comparison, fourth quarter of '11 to '10, our margins were up almost 390 basis points. So that's pretty -- now I will also say some of that is coming because we're getting better absorption. There's a lot of fixed costs in the component operations, and so we're getting better absorption. We also had better operating efficiencies, and we've gotten better pricing. And so I think it's a combination of all those factors. But nevertheless, it's improvement. Nowhere near where it has to be, but we keep moving the bar up. 
Seth Yeager: Yes. Last question, if I can. You showed some pretty nice leverage to this quarter. I guess what sort of revenue level would you have to see before you'd have to start bringing on some more guys, or more shifts or what have you? And where are some of those cuts that you guys made over the last few years would start to slowly filter back in? Is there a decent, I guess, baseline that we should look for before this cost would start to come back? 
Floyd Sherman: They will slowly -- we obviously -- because some of the numbers are certainly variable, we are slowly increasing our FTE count. It is staying -- we are still getting good absorption. So it's going to be a continual process, but the -- probably we will have reached the point to where it's almost going to be then close to a completely variable what, Chad, and probably another $200 million in sales? 
M. Crow: Yes. At somewhere around the $1 billion mark, I would think. 
Operator: And we'll now go to Brad Bryan from Imperial Capital. 
Brad Bryan: I guess I had 2 questions. First, to start out, can you just give a little discussion about the competitive dynamics, and how you're able to achieve a 29% volume gain in the fourth quarter? 
Floyd Sherman: Yes, I would love to do that. I think we are outperforming our competitors. I think that we have made some very, very strategic inventory buy strategy decisions. I think that we have the -- certainly, the best and most aggressive people out in our operations, taking our value proposition to the customer. I think the -- we are flat outperforming our competition in every area. We have the liquidity to make sure that we can support our market needs and the expanding needs of the market. I think that we have the quality of people. We've had the consistency of direction. I think that we have a very, very focused group of -- on our -- the objectives that we're trying to achieve in the company and a very high level of support from our people in field operations. I think we are extremely well positioned with the national builders. I think the national builders are viewing us as a survivor in this industry. We definitely have demonstrated our ability to continue our operations and continue supporting our operations and with the liquidity that's necessary to survive going into the future. The -- I think the builders are recognizing that we bring to them a better package all the way from our ability to supply individual materials to the job site, as well as a full install package. And I think that we cover the gamut of all of his needs, and we run his job site better than any of the competitors. And I think for all of those reasons, we are just flat killing and outperforming our competition. And as you know, I don't want to be bashful about saying it because our people really deserve the credit and the recognition that they're now starting to get. And I think that the -- we see this continuing right on into this year. We -- I feel very good about our start on 2012. That's all I can say. 
Brad Bryan: Okay. Can you talk a little bit about sort of how you view the marketplace, what your assumptions are for 2012 in terms of single-family housing starts and et cetera? 
Floyd Sherman: Yes. The -- I don't -- I guess the single-family -- pick your number somewhere between 450,000 and maybe as high as 500,000 single-family starts. But very honestly, we are not hung up and that's one of the things that this year we said in the company. We don't care where the housing starts are. We're going to find a way to hit a certain volume level, and we're going to figure out what it's going to take to do it irregardless of where -- what the housing start numbers are. And our people are doing just that. And I'm hopeful that we're on the high end of the housing range. And if so we're going to beat what we're forecasting our internal budgets are for the 2012. I think that single-family U.S. is going to be somewhere in the 450,000 to 500,000. The NAHB is saying it's somewhere around 478,000. Still a lousy year by anybody's measure, but hell of a lot better than what we saw in 2011. So that's the best I can do for you in that regard. 
Brad Bryan: Okay. In the past, your company has provided guidance in terms of cash burn expectations for the year and where you expect to end the year with liquidity. Can you provide a similar sort of update for 2012? 
M. Crow: Well, we've already covered cash interest will probably be around $37 million and CapEx around $8 million. So that gets you to $45 million. Our goal this year is to be north of break-even EBITDA. And so beyond that, it's going to depend on working capital, and that's all dependent on our increase in sales volume. 
Operator: And we'll now go to Phillip Wirtz from Odeon Capital Group. 
Phillip Wirtz: Just a quick couple here. First off, given your new term loan facility, so that new cash interest burden, and then also the fact that you've been very aggressive about gaining revenue per housing starts so to speak. Can you give us any sense just roughly of where kind of free cash flow break-even would be now? It seems like you've gotten a lot better on capturing your revenue from any given level of the start. So would that number be something like 750 where you could be free cash flow break-even? 
M. Crow: That's probably in the ballpark. 
Phillip Wirtz: Okay. And then the other one. Just kind of getting back to the outlook for 2012. I just -- I can't help but recall in 2011, as we were looking forward. Of course, we were more optimistic about housing starts than what they turned out to be, but can you contrast or compare the 2 years? How does things kind of look and feel now compared to where they looked and felt this time last year and give us any sense of the differences? 
Floyd Sherman: Yes. The optimism is much higher right now than it was in the third and fourth quarters of last year. As you recall, 2010, the first half of the year was very heavily influenced by the various programs that were put in place in hopes of stimulating housing, and it did for a very short period of time then fell off. The optimism, I think, has continued to improve in the home building community. As you move through the fourth quarter, it certainly seems to be a lot more positive even in the start of 2012. We have had good weather, which has helped with the enthusiasm or optimism that's out there. But nobody is saying that they see a return to normalcy anywhere close yet in this business. People are still feeling it as still 1.5 years, maybe 2 years away. But there are definitely positive signs. Starts and permits, which are really a precursor to future activity, and certainly those numbers are much more encouraging at this point than they were a year ago. And I think that will soon begin flowing its way through units under construction and then completions. It is still very, very tough out there on getting mortgages approved, appraisals that are more in line with the values that the builders are providing to their customer. There's still a lot of overhang that's got to be worked through. All of these things are still dampening the housing recovery. But right now, I think a much better feeling, and I think the activity will soon be coming forward. 
Operator: And we'll now go to Rob Hansen from Deutsche Bank. 
Rob Hansen: I just wanted to see if you could comment on some of the conditions post the quarter end. I apologize if you mentioned this earlier, but it seems like the builders have mentioned sales in January were up significantly, and it feels like February has started off on the right foot as well. So have you guys seen that in your business? 
M. Crow: We really can't say a whole lot about the first quarter. Floyd already mentioned that we're very pleased with how the year has started out. I think we'll just leave it at that. But there's certainly a lot of optimism right now within our company, and we think we've got a lot of good momentum. 
Floyd Sherman: And I will say -- and we are still gaining market share. And I'm happy with our market share gains that we're getting. 
Rob Hansen: Okay. And then I just also wanted to see if -- you mentioned that you guys have been strategically buying inventory. This is obviously the right decision to be able to help your customers. Is this some strategy that you're going to pursue throughout the rest of the year or do you think this is more of kind of a temporary -- take advantage of the situation? 
Floyd Sherman: Probably, we definitely -- in the future if we see that we can take advantage of a situation, we're going to do so. The commodity markets are one that you have to continually watch, and our people are very, very good at looking at trends and observing what's going on in the commodity markets. It's supported very much by our people in the field and their contacts that provide them information that gives us insights into the markets. And then, we make some very timely buys. We're going to do and continue doing what we feel is necessary to support our bottom line, as well as being able to support our customers with the most competitive cost position that they can be provided with. And so there are times that we can just ride the inventories on a normal replenishment basis, and there are going to be times that we have -- that we will step in and ensure that we have complete quarter coverages. And so I really can't say, going forward. It's just going to continue to be a mixed bag. 
Rob Hansen: Okay. And then just one last question here. You mentioned that you had some positive leverage within fixed costs and COGS. And I just wanted to see if you could give a little I guess, a little more break down in terms of the numbers. What percentage of costs in COGS are going to be fixed? 
M. Crow: That's around 5% to 10%. 
Operator: And we'll now go to Philip Volpicelli from Deutsche Bank. 
Philip Volpicelli: Just a couple of follow-ups. Many of the manufacturers of building materials have been trying to increase prices as we move into 2012. Can you give us some color as to whether or not they're sticking, specifically wallboard, roofing and then lumber? 
Floyd Sherman: We do very little in the way of wallboard, and so I can't say on a national average the -- but, yes, we have seen the wallboard increases. And as far as we're concerned, they appear -- the prices that have been put in place appear to be sticking. Roofing, there's been a lot of discussions, and we've seen some limited increases in some areas and some delays in putting other increases into place. But that -- I suspect the roofing increases are going to stick, and especially with the petroleum-based products. On Lumber and Lumber Sheet Goods, that's a roller coaster. And the producers have been awash in red ink. It's no fun to be operating at that level. And they're doing their best to try to get the pricing up. The demand just hasn't been there to support it. They've cut back probably as much as they possibly can. They've also taken short shifts and downtimes and so forth trying to hold the market up. And certainly, a higher price would be beneficial to us, as we've said in the past. But they -- it's been tough up to this point to make it stick. I suspect, though, as the construction activity keeps increasing, especially with the mills, I think, now operating very close to capacity, we're going to see a long-term increasing of price on the commodity side of the business. And we're going to have to make sure that we can stay ahead of it so that we can protect ourselves. But I think being the commodities over to the next couple of years are going to be -- it's going to be slowly increasing and those increases are going to stick. 
Philip Volpicelli: And, Floyd, are there any categories that I've missed in terms of doors or windows or other components for the home where you are seeing price increases that are sticking? 
Floyd Sherman: We have seen people attempt to increase prices. 
Philip Volpicelli: But nothing has been sticking? 
Floyd Sherman: But as builders say to us, "We accept no increases," except where they have no alternative. We say the same thing. And we've had to be very, very tough on it. I know people need increases out there just the same way as we do, but we have to do whatever we have to do in order to protect ourselves with our customer base. And our customer base has said pretty much no to any increases, and I also have to say that I understand where they are coming from. They are under tremendous pressures to hold their costs in line so that they can compete with a lot of the problem inventory that's out there. And it's still a very, very tough world out there. 
Operator: And we'll now go to Jack Kasprzak with BB&T. 
John Kasprzak: A few of my questions were asked, but I wanted to ask you about the competitive landscape, Floyd. I mean, what are you seeing out there, if anything, in the way of further closures by your competitors? Or do you think the environment still hasn't stabilized after such a brutal downturn? I mean, obviously, this is something that's probably going to help you guys being able to take some shares, some turmoil out there on the customer base -- competitor base, rather. 
Floyd Sherman: Jack, we are still seeing some closures and consolidations by some of our competitors. We have not had to do so. The -- I think it is beginning to stabilize, but I think this may just be a lull before the storm. I think there are a lot of people out there -- it is my feeling there are a number of competitors out there where working capital, liquidity, is extremely tight. And the -- as you know, there probably have been as many people who failed during real -- the real upturn as what they do in a downturn. And I think there's -- I think we're going to see some more capacity being pulled out of this industry because very frankly, there's still more capacity there than what there is demand to support it. So -- but the -- if we have a year where the building level is somewhere in the 470, 480, that's about where it was in 2010, and there were people who had a difficult time making it in 2010. They're going to have even a more difficult time making it under that scenario. And then when you start putting an increasing and improving market on top of it, I think there's going to be some more shakeout to come. 
John Kasprzak: Okay. And I think you just mentioned, Floyd, that mills are... 
Floyd Sherman: And I will also say, Jack, we are going to do our very best to help see to it that some of those people do exit the market. And we're going to beat them on every count. We're going to beat them with service, quality of our people and the competitiveness of our pricing. 
John Kasprzak: With regard to the mills, you mentioned they were near full capacity. I'm less familiar with that dynamic. But I mean, are there still mills that are shuttered that could come online? Or is it a situation where you think because the downturn has been so brutal, they'll be happier operating what they've got open now to full capacity without bringing on idle capacity? 
Floyd Sherman: There are mills out there that can be reopened. But I think that the -- I think that those companies are going to be very reluctant to do so. They are going to -- I think they're going to use this opportunity to really get the pricing levels back up to where it is a more acceptable pricing level over the long term. I don't really think that the mills are going to go out there to see what they can do and gut everybody just because they can do it. I think, though, that what they're going to do is get the prices up where it's a more responsible level, where it works for everybody in the system and over a longer period of time, and then they will slowly add capacity as they need to in order to keep those prices at a respectable level. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now go to Sean Boyd with Westcliff Capital Management. 
Sean Boyd: One clarification. Most of my questions have been answered. Earlier, in a response to another question, you made a point about gross margins improving, I think it was 390 bps year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And I don't know if that's just on component cost, but to be frank with you, I'm looking at 19.1% going to 20.4%. So can you just verify with your... 
Floyd Sherman: That was on the component side of the business. 
Sean Boyd: Okay. So basically on just components your gross margin is up almost 4 percentage points year-over-year? 
Floyd Sherman: That's -- I mean for fourth quarter to fourth quarter, yes. 
Sean Boyd: And help me again on what -- is that due to the opportunistic inventory buys? What's really driving that? 
Floyd Sherman: That's a combination of good inventory buys. It's a combination of fixed cost absorption. It's a combination of improved labor efficiencies and in the COGS side, the manufacturing side of the business. And it's also a reflection of slightly improved pricing. 
Sean Boyd: Okay. And, Floyd, what do you -- do you see additional headroom this year on that? Could you put another couple of hundred basis points on top of where we are at this point? Or how do you look at that? 
Floyd Sherman: I would really hope so. That's our intention to do so. It is an engineered product. It's a true value-add product. And the margins that we're still getting are nowhere near reflective of what they should be for this type product. But that's -- you almost nailed it on the head as to what our anticipation is this year. 
Sean Boyd: And just one other, if I may. On the opportunistic inventory buys, how often do those come along? Is that something where you've just been capital constrained in the past and therefore you couldn't do it, but -- and you had to pass? Or are those something that -- you only see those opportunities a couple of times a year anyhow? 
Floyd Sherman: So we -- the -- it is only going to occur a limited number of times during the year. A lot of it is -- as you know, we do a lot of forward pricing. Probably 60% of our business is either 60- or 90-day forward pricing. The -- and if we feel that the market conditions for that coverage period is going to be real volatile, meaning -- and especially towards the upside, then we are going to look and see about what -- how we can go about protecting the pricing we have in place to ensure that we get through that quarter without major hits to our margins. And so we will step in and look at the markets and see over and over a period of whatever time that we feel it's going to take, we will be -- again, buying that coverage and getting that protection. And that's -- that doesn't happen all the time. If we see that the market is going to be relatively stable, then we don't need to do that. And we'll always look for those small incremental buys that we can do at a real discount to market just to get the slight improvement in our average cost that we have on materials and inventory. So that goes on all the time but that's a relatively small piece of the replenishment. 
Operator: And if there are no further questions I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Sherman for any additional or closing remarks. 
Floyd Sherman: Okay. Well, we really appreciate your interest in the company and joining us on the call today. If there are any further questions or anything you want to discuss, don't hesitate to call Chad or myself. We'll be glad to see what we can do to answer your questions. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.

Floyd Sherman: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2009 earnings call. Joining me from our management team is Charles Horn, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will start with a recap of the first quarter and then I’ll turn the call over to Charles who’ll discuss our first quarter financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook we’ll take your questions.  First quarter of 2009 was very much as we had anticipated. It was an extremely difficult quarter for those in the housing industry. Single family housing starts declined 51.7% from the first quarter of 2008 and fell 24.2% from the fourth quarter of 2008.  We felt the impact of these difficult conditions on our first quarter results, although we were able to partially mitigate the overall impact to our action plan of conserving cash, growing market share, reducing physical capacity, adjusting staffing levels, implementing cost containment programs and prudently managing credit. We feel these efforts were successful as our net cash used during the quarter was only $4.3 million. This is consistent with net cash used in the fourth quarter of 2008, but we were able to accomplish this on $37.5 million less sales.  We estimate that market share gains reduced our sales decline quarter-over-quarter by an estimated 17%. We were able to achieve these gains by largely holding share with our builder 100 customers, expanding our presence with regional and local custom builders and penetrating further into the multifamily and light commercial segment. From a capacity standpoint we closed two facilities during the quarter. As a result of these closures and other staffing reductions, our average FTEs for the quarter dropped to 3169, down 38% from the first quarter of 2008 and down 22% from the fourth quarter. The reductions in payroll costs, coupled with other cost reductions allow us to reduce our selling, general and administrative expenses by 29% or approximately 88% variable with our sales volume decline of 33%. Excluding facility closure cost, the write-off of debt issue costs and the valuation allowance, our loss from continuing operations per diluted share was $0.46 compared to a loss of $0.43 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2008. We feel our action plan has been successful and continues to be the correct course of action to insure both the short term and long term health of our company. I will now turn the call over to Charles who will review the first quarter results in more detail.
Charles Horn: Good morning everyone. I will walk you through our first quarter results in more detail. We reported sales of $163.8 million, compared to $259.9 million a year ago, a decline of $96.1 million or 37%. Our sales volume dropped an estimated 33% compared to an estimated 50% decline in housing starts within our markets. This indicates a contribution from market share gains of approximately 15% to 17%.  Breaking down our product categories, prefabricated components decline $21.7 million, 42.1% from the first quarter of 2008. Windows and doors were down 39.2%. Lumber and lumber sheet goods declined 34.7% to $40 million. Millwork declined 38.6% and lastly other building products and services decreased 30.9%.  The categories of prefabricated components and lumber and lumber sheet goods, continues to be negatively impacted by price deflation, as our commodity price index dropped an estimated 15% year-over-year. Our gross margin percentage was 20.9% for the first quarter of 2009, down from 22.3% last year, a 140 basis point decline. Specifically, our gross margin percentage declined 30 basis points due to lower prices, 60 basis points due to volume, which is due to our fixed cost and cost of goods sold and 50 basis points due to a shift in sales mix, towards lower gross margin products and services. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $21.8 million or 29% to $54.4 million. As a percentage of sales however, SG&A expense increased from 29.3% in the first quarter of 2008 to 33.2% in the same period of 2009, which is reflective of fixed cost items becoming a larger percentage of our SG&A. Within salaries and SG&A, salaries and benefits expense declined $14.3 million or 31.3% from the first quarter of 2008. This decline was 95% variable with our sales volume decline of 33%. Office G&A expense decreased $3.1 million or 34.3% from the same quarter of last year.  Occupancy expenses were down $1 million, but up from 2.5% of sales a year ago, to 3.4% of sales in the current quarter. This is reflective of the fixed cost nature of this category. Delivery expenses decreased $4.1 million to $10.1 million during the quarter. The 28.9% decline is primarily due to a $2.2 million decrease in fuel costs and a $1.3 million decrease in fleet lease and maintenance expenses. Our bad debt expense was $1.2 million or 70 basis points of sales compared to $3.3 million or 10 basis points of sales in the year ago quarter.  We recorded $560,000 of facility closure costs during the quarter, primarily related to our remaining lease obligations on the distribution facility in Maryland and administrative offices in South Carolina. Interest expense were $7.5 million, an increase of $1.1 million over the prior year due to write-off of $1.2 million debt issue cost related to a capacity reduction in our revolving credit facility from $350 million to $250 million.  We recorded tax expense of $2.1 million or a 7.5% effective tax rate during the quarter, compared to a tax benefit of $9.5 million or a 38.3% tax benefit rate in the first quarter last year. Our benefit for the quarter was reduced by an after-tax, non-cash valuation allowance of $12.9 million or $0.36 per diluted share, related to our net deferred tax assets. Absent this valuation allowance our tax benefit rates would have been 38.1%.  Our loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $30.4 million or $0.85 loss per diluted share compared to $15.3 million or $0.43 loss per diluted share in the same period last year. Excluding the valuation allowance, facility closure costs and the write-off of debt issue, our loss from continuing operations was $0.46 per diluted share for the current quarter, compared to $0.43 last year.  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $13.7 million compared to a loss of $10.2 million in the same quarter a year ago. EBITDA declined $3.5 million year-over-year, on a $96.1 million sales decline, which equates to only 3.6% negative flow through from the loss sales. Our net cash used during the quarter was $4.3 million, leaving a cash balance of $102.6 million at March 31, 2009. Our net borrowing availability at March 31, 2009 was essentially zero due to a drop in our eligible borrowing base, which is supported by trade receivables and inventory balances. Approximately $19.1 million of cash on hand at March 31, 2009 supported a short fall in the calculation of the $35 million minimum liquidity covenants contained in you credit agreement.
 :  An updated on our tax income refunds. We expect to are e receive a $33 million tax income refund within the next two weeks. In looking forward, both the House and the Senate have introduced bills that would allow for a five year carry back for net operating losses. If that’s passed, that could allow us to generate up to $15 million of potential refunds in 2010.  Our working capital percentage excluding cash and income tax receivables was 12.6% compared to 12.9% last year. However, our cash conversion days worsened from 53 days last year to 60 days this quarter. The increase in our cash conversion days was primarily due to a decrease in our accounts payable days. Our accounts receivable days actually improved slightly dropping to 41 days from 41.9 days last year.  Our inventory turns essentially remains flat between years. Our accounts payable days decreased due to an increasing amount of outside contract labor and due to slow inventory turns. Our subcontractors generally require us to pay on a daily to weekly basis. We recently have extended these terms by negotiations to a net of about 15 days, which should improve our 80 days in the second quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
 :  An updated on our tax income refunds. We expect to are e receive a $33 million tax income refund within the next two weeks. In looking forward, both the House and the Senate have introduced bills that would allow for a five year carry back for net operating losses. If that’s passed, that could allow us to generate up to $15 million of potential refunds in 2010.  Our working capital percentage excluding cash and income tax receivables was 12.6% compared to 12.9% last year. However, our cash conversion days worsened from 53 days last year to 60 days this quarter. The increase in our cash conversion days was primarily due to a decrease in our accounts payable days. Our accounts receivable days actually improved slightly dropping to 41 days from 41.9 days last year.  Our inventory turns essentially remains flat between years. Our accounts payable days decreased due to an increasing amount of outside contract labor and due to slow inventory turns. Our subcontractors generally require us to pay on a daily to weekly basis. We recently have extended these terms by negotiations to a net of about 15 days, which should improve our 80 days in the second quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd Sherman: Thank you Charles. First quarter single family housing starts dropped 52% compared to the same quarter a year ago and on a seasonally adjusted annual rate, single family starts dropped almost 50% to 358,000 starts, further indication that 2009 will likely be more challenging than 2008.  We believe our action plan has been successful and limiting the impact of the difficult conditions on our results and we will continue to execute our strategy of implementing cost containment programs, prudently managing credit, rationalizing physical capacity and staffing levels, growing market share and conserving cash. This continued strategy execution coupled with $83.5 million in available cash and over $30 million in expected income tax refunds in 2009 should provide the liquidity to withstand these challenging conditions within our industry.  Since the housing correction began 36 months ago, we’ve asked a tremendous amount from our employees. The past three years have not been easy, but I’m very proud of the sacrifices our employees have made and I’m also very proud of their willingness to do whatever it takes to get the job done. They’ve responded admirably and for this, I owe them an enormous amount of gratitude. I’ll now turn the call over to the operator for Q-and-A.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will go next to Nishu Sood with Deutsche bank.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank: This is actually Rob Hansen for Nishu. In the release you mentioned that the incremental multifamily and light commercial sales. So just in general, how much of your sales, percentage wise is in those end markets now, and what is kind of your target over the longer term?
Floyd Sherman: Yes, I believe the percentage has grown slightly over 10% of our total revenues. Clearly it’s a market we like to continue to expand into. We’ve developed the infrastructure, the expertise and we will look to expand over the coming quarters. Obviously, we do not believe that the multi-family mark or light commercial is immune to the correction that’s going on. So that in and out of it sales may limit our ability to increase that percentage, but it is something in the long term we want to continue to try to penetrate.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank: In terms of types of construction projects, a lot of these are like the student housing that you had mentioned in the past.
Floyd Sherman: I can be military dormitories, student housing, apartment, complexes just any number of things high-rises…
Charles Horn: It can even be low rise office buildings.
Floyd Sherman: Yes.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank: Okay. That’s all I’ve got. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird: Hi, guys good morning.
Charles Horn: Hi, David.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird: In the last call you mentioned that you though your breakeven point was something less than $100 million per month and I don’t know if there’s any finer point you can put on that this quarter given the actions you’ve taken since then. Is there a range or something or you can give us an idea of where you think your break-even point is?
Charles Horn: Based on the cost structure that we’re putting in place right now and with the adjustments we’ve made and the efficiency improvements, I think that number is now closer to $80 million to $85 million a month in terms of sales. So somewhere in the $960 million to $1 billion in annual sales per year.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird: Okay and in terms of the locations that you have open right now, I would imagine it’s all over the map, but is it safe to assume there’s a number of locations that you have, you cut down, to basically bear minimum costs that next step for you as you’ve been doing right along we do to close the operation?
Charles Horn: That is true. While we’re redisson [ph] we really don’t want to do that, we want to keep our footprint as broad as possible. There are a few that we’re looking at, that if we cannot get turned around via headcount reduction or sales expansion or gross margin expansions, then we will look to make a decision on sometime during the second quarter.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird: Okay and then just to add on to the last question, I think you said 15% to 17% of incremental top line was driven by share gains plus the multi-family and non-res areas. I don’t know if you answered this to the last question, could you break that down to some extent for us, give us an idea. I think your share gains had been running kind of upper single-digits. Do you think that’s still the case today and the rest will be from these other areas?
Charles Horn: I think that will be accurate, yes. I think you’d probably be seeing the single family in the 10% to 12% range, in the multi-family and the 3% to 5% range.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Alright guys, thanks very much.
Operator: We’ll go next to Walter Branson with Regiment Capital.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital: Hi, thanks. A couple of things. I apologize if these have been asked, because I was off for a minute. Regarding tax refunds, so it sounds like you’re getting $33 million in the next two weeks and that’s going forward except for unless the bill is passed that extends to these carry backs; is that correct?
Charles Horn: That is correct.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital: Okay and were there any tax payments or refunds in the first quarter?
Charles Horn: No.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital: Okay and can you give us a little bit, again if you haven’t done it already, overview of your liquidity outlook over the next few quarters. Obviously the tax rate will bolster that, but aside from that, what are you looking at, what do you expect to see in terms of changes in the borrowing base and cash flow over the next few quarters.
Charles Horn: We’ll begin the second quarter once this refund comes in with about $160.5 million of liquidity. At this point I don’t know; Floyd would disagree with me, we don’t see any increases in sales per day coming in terms of the second quarter.  So if we make the assumption that we’re going to stay flat at about 350,000 annualized single family starts, then what you would likely see is a slight increase in the cash burn as we are not liquidating as much working capital, but based upon where we stand now with the refunds, we feel very good about 2009, we feel good about looking out into 2010. Clearly we’re always going to be looking for ways to get more efficient, to save more cash and to make sure that we have a strong cash balance at the end of 2009, but I would expect the cash burn to increase slightly just because we’re not monetizing as much working capital as our sales would not be dropping.
Floyd Sherman: We still have room for improving our inventory turns. We’ve identified some slow moving inventory that we feel we can convert into cash and are already actively involved in doing this. We continue to improve on our labor efficiency and we will be producing some efficiency gains in the payroll area, the cost area.  As Charles mentioned earlier in his part of the presentation, that we are anticipating an improvement in payables. That’s coming from not only the extensions that we have been able to achieve, and right now all of our subcontractors have agreed to the extended pay going from pay now to a 15-day pay schedule. We’ve also negotiated improvements in our payable terms with a number of our suppliers and we anticipate that also contributing to us in the coming quarters.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital:  Okay, so tell me if this is right, but you’re not expecting the normal second quarter seasonal pick up in sales per day, is that right?
Floyd Sherman: I can tell you we’re not seeing it at this point.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital:  Okay and then, but it sounds like perhaps inventory and receivables will be and hence the borrowing will be relatively stable. Is that also true?
Floyd Sherman: I think that would be accurate statement, yes.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital:  Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Ivan Holman with RBC Capital Markets.
Ivan Holman - RBC Capital Markets: Ivan, sitting in for Scot Ciccarelli. I guess the first question I just kind wanted to approve that you guys had mentioned regarding the labor cost cuts, the 10%. Can you kind of give us an idea as to where those labor cost cuts are going to be coming from; where the major payroll cuts are going to be? Are those going to be those areas that are challenged and is there a lot more room before you really start kind of impacting quality and what not, to actually cut more out of your labor expense?
Floyd Sherman: The labor reductions and it will be throughout every phase of our operation, whether it’s here in head quarters, whether it’s out in field operations distribution, operations or manufacturing facilities, we continue to look for ways that we can become more efficient and how do we operate more efficient? We have a weekly labor planning guide that all of our operations follow. We track it on a daily and weekly basis, are full-time equivalent and we post that against our sales that are occurring during the week and so that we continually are looking for areas that we can improve on efficiency and bring everybody up to a higher standard of operating. These are all on going. We’ve been doing it consistently now over for the past 18 months and I think the results very dramatically speak for themselves.  We don’t have any specific area that is overstaffed or is top heavy. So it’s just going to come from a broad base throughout the operations and it’s going to come because we are very, very focused on running a more efficient operation and an operation that will really aid us when better times, that we are confronted. Housing recovery, we should dramatically be able to leverage our results upward.
Ivan Holman - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thank you. So if there is no turnaround I guess in the near term, are you saying that there is more potential for more kind of headcount reduction? You guys are open to that possibility? Thank you.
Floyd Sherman: We have indicated that I think the 10% FTE count versus first quarter FTE count, average count, there’s about a 10% improvement that you will see.
Ivan Holman - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, great thank you, and I guess like my second question is with regards to lumber prices. I was just wondering if you had seen any improvement possibly on the vendor level in terms of firming of lumber prices.  I was just kind of tracking the numbers and it looks like obviously figures are much lower in your basis, but are you seeing any tentative maybe stabilization. I know the spring season typically picks up around now. Has there been any pass through from vendors trying to maybe negotiate better terms on lumber prices or is that still very, very soft.
Floyd Sherman: No, lumber pricing has definitely firmed up over the last several weeks and the lumber mills have reacted. Now they have really begun reducing their number of mills, number of units that are producing, number of shifts and they are very quickly bringing their supply in line with the demand. We’ve seen a rally in the lumber market pricing over the last several weeks. We think that this probably is going to hold, because it’s based on the supply and demand.  On the other side of the ledger, we have got sheet goods, especially 716 OSB, we still are seeing very soft pricing and the capacity is still exceeding the demand that’s out there. So, I don’t really anticipate seeing major improvements in OSB pricing. The mills on the lumber side, they are very, very difficult to negotiate price now as compared to what you were able to do a few months ago.
Ivan Holman - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. It’s very helpful. That’s it for me. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We’ll next to Brian Tedale with Broadpoint Capital.
Brian Tedale - Broadpoint Capital: Hey, good morning.
Floyd Sherman: Good morning.
Brian Tedale - Broadpoint Capital: First thing, I want to make sure I heard you correctly. If the cash tax refunds, if the markets go back five years did you say it would be additional $50 million five zero or 15 million that you could receive?
Charles Horn: It would be up to 50, but it would depend obviously on our actual losses in 2009 as to how much we could reclaim.
Brian Tedale - Broadpoint Capital: Would that be increment to the 33 this year?
Charles Horn: That is correct.
Brian Tedale - Broadpoint Capital: Okay and with regard to working capital, given your comments before, do you think that you could still squeeze out another $10 million, $15 million of additional cash or working capital this year or do you expect something less than that?
Charles Horn: Let’s look at the balance sheet real quick. I think it’s conceivable to squeeze out 10 in a static environment from where we currently stand. Again, much of that will becoming in payables with some of the initiatives we’ve made and then the other point Floyd made on inventories.  Receivables will continue to be pressure; I don’t know if we can improve DSO and receivables from 41 days; that’s pretty good in today’s conditions. CapEx will definitely be dropping in the second part of the year. In fact our 1.7 I believe that was in the first quarter, that probably pretty well covers us for the year.
Brian Tedale - Broadpoint Capital: Okay. If I heard you right, that covers you for the full year?
Charles Horn: I believe so.
Brian Tedale - Broadpoint Capital: Thank you for those. With regard to the customers, I think in the past you had mentioned; that’s when the banks have been getting a little tougher for the customer, forcing lower liquidations, are you seeing that pick up more now or is that sort of dilapidate at all?
Charles Horn: I can’t say that’s being dilapidate, I think it’s just continuing the way it was before. I think beginning in Q4 of last year is where we really saw the increase in activity of builders heading to orderly liquidation and that process just continues.
Brian Tedale - Broadpoint Capital: Finally just with regard to I assume the liquidity front, are you at this point pursuing any new paths of liquidity or not yet. At this point you’re still comfortable; you mentioned ‘09, but are you pursuing anything new at this point?
Charles Horn: Well, like I said we feel good about our current liquidity position, but there are also various things we are considering. We are looking at the potential divestiture of some non co-assets, but that’s very early in the process. There’s always things we can look to do to try to improve liquidity and Floyd and I are very focused on doing that.
Brian Tedale - Broadpoint Capital: On the M&A front, is it something you could raise looking at seismic sizable or something in single-digit type of millions, something in that category?
Charles Horn: It would be lower and of course, it’s just unknown whether we will be successful.
Brian Tedale - Broadpoint Capital: Alright. Thank you very much.
Operator: We’ll go next to Michael Plansey with Credit Suisse.
Michael Plansey - Credit Suisse: Hi, just a couple of questions. First one, $14 million of savings you referenced with regards to the headcount, is that incremental to what you have already received?
Charles Horn: That’s correct.
Michael Plansey - Credit Suisse: Okay and then on the fourth quarter conference call, you had mentioned that you had expected to get some availability back on your ABL, it looks like it actually declined further. What was the major delta there?
Charles Horn: Basically our sales were lower in Q1 of 2009 than what we anticipated in doing our forecast.
Michael Plansey - Credit Suisse: Right. Okay and then also, was there any change in the percentage of receivables that were 60 days past due?
Charles Horn: The 60 day bucket was fairly consistent. In terms of the overall greater than 60, it has gone up to about 7% from where it was last year. That’s part of the reason why you see the higher bad debt expense, part of the reason why you see the greater allowance as a percentage of total trade receivables.
Michael Plansey - Credit Suisse: You said it increased 7% year-over-year?
Charles Horn: Yes.
Michael Plansey - Credit Suisse: Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Jay McCanless with FTN Equity
Jay McCanless - FTN Equity: Morning everyone.
Floyd Sherman: Morning Jay.
Jay McCanless - FTN Equity: I wanted to ask the breakeven question in a different way. Is there a level of single family starts, where you believe Builders FirstSource will be breakeven?
Floyd Sherman: Well we do look at that. In fact we look at that pretty much everyday. There’s so many moving factors, I’ll just give you the answer. If we keep things static in terms of our current cost structure, current margin rate, it’s probably in the 480 to 500 penetration. Our currents market penetration, 480,000 to 500,000 single family starts annually.
Jay McCanless - FTN Equity: Okay. Assuming everything stays the same as it is now.
Floyd Sherman: That’s correct.
Jay McCanless - FTN Equity: Okay and then also on the M&A front, I wanted to see if stock was still in play and are you all looking at any deals right now, potentially watching them or maybe another company?
Floyd Sherman: In terms of our Intel on stock building supplies, really no better than anyone else. It’s just what we’ve seen in the public, wisely have indicated they are looking to divest them. We understand they’re running at process, but beyond that we don’t have too much information. In terms of what we are doing, our focus is primarily on maintaining liquidity and protecting our current company. So we are not looking to active in any M&A activity at the moment.
Jay McCanless - FTN Equity: Okay and then my final question on the credit facility is and I guess this is more of a procedural question, if you decide to shut down more operations later in the year, it means less inventory less receivables standing, does most of the cash that you might of the saving that you would get from there, have to immediately go to pay that down, because it is an asset-based facility and should be carrying less assets etc. Is that the line of thinking logically?
Charles Horn: You’re correct, but first I mean we obviously before getting an effective advance rate of inventory of 44%, we’d expect if we sit down in operation, we’re going to get more than that in liquidation value. So, net-net it’s going to be a possible arbitrage for us, but in terms of will it reduce the borrowing base, yes. Would we then have to put more cash up, which would still be a greater line of cash than what we had borrowed, yes or we can pay down the debt some.
Jay McCanless - FTN Equity: Okay. So it’s either put the cash up or pay the debt down, one of the two.
Charles Horn: An example; when we sipped out New Jersey, we monetize a lot more in real value at receivables and inventory than what our current credit agreement gives us credit for. So definitely it’s an advantage if we choose to go that root in terms of a faster cash flow.
Jay McCanless - FTN Equity: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Jim Wilson with JMP Securities.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: Thanks. Morning guys. I know I asked this question before, but I just need a little updating color on; in your key markets, how much shrinkage of competitors you have seen, are you continuing to see? I’m just trying to get a feeling for how you’re postured for the future beyond obviously the share gains you are already getting, but how you are postured for the future, particularly as it relates to how much further shrinkage of competitors has occurred over the last three months.
Floyd Sherman : I think we are in good shape Jim. There has been a lot of shut downs from everyone in the industry, from the top five down to the bottom levels and so we’re definitely seeing capacity pull out of it, some of the major markets, some of the smaller more treasury market.  As part of the reason, our goal is try to keep our footprint is broad as possible, so we can keep a toehold in the market and make sure we’re there when we see a housing recovery, but capacity has greatly dropped out. I can’t sit here and tell you enough it’s dropped out at this point, it hasn’t. So we’re definitely seeing in each of our markets capacity dropping and in some cases it’s us dropping the capacity.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: Again, I guess for future markets and in sort of sales conditions at the moment that seem to be getting better or at least from what I see southwest, but particularly Arizona, Nevada California, Colorado, any thoughts of being opportunistic and even picking up a facility or something in those markets or is it still too early.
Charles Horn: Way too early and it won’t be happening in the immediate future for us.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: Okay. Fair enough.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will go next to Ted Wagenknecht with DDJ Capital Management.
Ted Wagenknecht - DDJ Capital Management: Good morning. When you guys mention this breakeven level. Breakeven what?
Floyd Sherman: That’s a good question. What we are referring to is breakeven EBITDA.
Ted Wagenknecht - DDJ Capital Management: Break even EBITDA; and you guys have mentioned two facility closures, one in Maryland and one elsewhere; was that subsequent to the quarter end. That’s a Q 2 event or was that in the quarter.
Floyd Sherman: That was during the quarter and one of them is just a regional office, it was purely an admin office.
Ted Wagenknecht - DDJ Capital Management: Can you talk a little bit about what’s been happening with stock and 84 and maybe probe build in your markets? Is stock effectively winding down?
Floyd Sherman: I don’t know if we can make that statement. Again we do understand they’re running a process; we don’t know how that will ultimately end up, but everyone for the most part is shutting down locations and trying to cut their cash burns and that includes 84 and includes stock and that includes us.  All of us are trying to rationalize capacity in the markets, all of us are trying to get some stable pricing in the market and all of us are trying to respond with the efficiency improvements. 
Ted Wagenknecht - DDJ Capital Management: Just in terms of the markets in which you operate, what is the overlap with stock specifically?
Floyd Sherman: We have a lot of overlap in the traditional southeast markets. We have overlap with stock in the Texas markets and so probably pretty much uniform all the way through from the Atlantic Coast right on down to Florida and then over to Texas. So, high percentage of market overlap.
Ted Wagenknecht - DDJ Capital Management: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We will go now to Kevin Starke with CRT Capital.
Kevin Starke - CRT Capital: Following on the last question, I know we all hate addressing hypothetical, but have you given some though to what might happen if well he doesn’t find a buyer for stock and they have to liquidated it. Would that might mean near term and longer term for your markets.
Floyd Sherman: If it were to head that direction, short term it can put pressure on us as they liquidated inventory. Long term that obviously benefit to us as we’d eliminate one of our key competitor within our markets.
Kevin Starke - CRT Capital: Anything you can do to mitigate the initiate liquidation.
Floyd Sherman: I think there’s ways we can look at it if they work to happen that way. We could even look at maybe acquiring some of the inventory. We can look at during something to try mitigate it, but I think in most scenarios there would still be some downward pressure.  Well we’ve seen where companies have shutdown in markets where we compete. When they get rid of the inventory, they get rid of it is fairly aggressively. So, short term there is a little bit of an impact, but we would try to manage it as best as we could.
Kevin Starke - CRT Capital: You could be a buyer to inventory, could you not?
Floyd Sherman: That would be an alternative for us, yes.
Kevin Starke - CRT Capital: Looking at the trading of the FRNs it’s been pretty active lately, and I’m was just wondering if any new holders have made over just to you on how to address the use of cash that those reference represents.
Floyd Sherman: Well, I talk to many of the major holders on a daily basis. They’re interested in the company and they’re interested in the investment. I’m not aware of any new holders or any major sellers, but I do talk with a couple of the biggest holders quite frequently; in fact one was on the phone earlier. So we do discuss it with them, but in terms of the company looking at acquiring them, I wouldn’t say that we’d use any of our liquidity at this point to do so.
Operator: And at this time there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Sherman I’ll turn the call back to you for closing remarks.
Floyd Sherman:  Okay. Thank you for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Charles Horn.
Operator: This does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2008 Q4  (2009-02-20 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Katie E. Murphree – Director of Investor Relations and Financial Reporting Floyd F. Sherman – President, Chief Executive Officer, Director Charles L. Horn – Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President
Analysts: Rob Hansen – Deutsche Bank Securities Scot Ciccarelli – RBC Capital Markets [Allen Weber] – Robody & Company Jay McCanless – FTN Equity Capital Markets [Michael Plansey] – Credit Suisse Kevin Starke – CRT Capital 
Operator:  Hello and welcome to the Builders FirstSource 2008 fourth quarter and year end 2008 financial results conference call. Your host for today’s call is Mr. Floyd Sherman, Chief Executive Officer. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference call over to Miss Katie Murphree, Director of Investor Relations and Financial Reporting, who will begin the call.
Katie E. Murphree:  Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and 2008 year end financial results. We issued a press release after the market close yesterday. If you don’t have a copy, you can find it on our website at BLDR.com.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management may make statements concerning the company’s future prospects, business strategies and industry trends.

We have provided reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents in our earnings press release and detailed explanations of non-GAAP financial measures in our form 8-K filed yesterday, both of which are available on our website.  At this time I will turn the call over to Floyd Sherman.
Floyd F. Sherman:  Thank you, Katie. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter and 2008 year end earnings call. Joining me from our management team is Charles Horn, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I’ll start with a recap of 2008, and I’ll then turn the call over to Charles who will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we’ll take your questions. Two thousand and eight was a very difficult year. In fact, the housing environment was worse than most expectations. Total housing starts declined 33.2% during 2008, while single family housing starts declined 40.5%.  We felt the impact of these difficult conditions on our 2008 results, although we were able to partially limit it through our action plan. Our action plan principally consisted of g owing market share, reducing fiscal capacity, adjusting staffing levels, implementing cost containment programs, managing credit tightly, and most importantly, conserving cash. Overall we feel these efforts were successful. We estimate that market share gains reduced our sales decline year-over-year by an estimated 10%. We were able to achieve these gains by largely holding share with our Builder 100 customers and expanding our presence in the multi-family and like commercial segment.  From a capacity standpoint, we closed or mothballed 14 facilities during 2008. These closures reduced our fixed operating costs and allowed us to redeploy sales to other locations to gain efficiencies. Because of these closures and other job reductions, our headcount was down over 2,100 to 3,274 by year end 2008, a decrease of 39.3% from the beginning of the year. The reduction of payroll costs from our headcount reductions coupled with other cost reductions allowed us to reduce our selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding non-cash and non-reoccurring charges by 19.5% or 65% variable with our sales volume decline of 30.4%. Our bad debt expense of the percentage of the sale increased only 24 basis points, while our cash used for 2008, our most important measure, was only $30.7 million. Because we’ve been prudent in executing these measures they will benefit us not only for the short term, but also enable us to be a more efficient organization in the long term. I’ll now walk you through our 2008 results. Two thousand and eight sales were $1.345 billion, a decline of 32.4%. Our sales volume dropped an estimated 30.4% compared to an estimated 42.5% decline in housing activity in our markets, signifying a contribution from market share gain of an estimated 10%. Our gross margin percentage fell 300 basis points to 21.6%. Specifically, our gross margin percentage decreased by 190 basis points due to price, 90 basis points due to volume, which is representative of the fixed costs within the cost of goods sold, and 20 basis points due to a shift in sales mix, storage, installed product sales, which carry a lower gross margin percentage than distributed sales. Our SG&A expenses decreased $66 million or 18.4%. We continued to reduce our headcount very well with the decline in sales volumes for the year. Our average full time equivalent employed for 2008 were 25.2% lower than 2007, resulting in a $49.3 million decline in salaries and benefit expense, excluding stock compensation expense. Offsetting the decline in SG&A was a $1.5 million increase in stock compensation expense and $2.8 million in transaction costs associated with canceled acquisitions.  We recorded asset impairment charges of $51.1 million before tax, or $0.97 per diluted share, net of tax. We recorded goodwill impairment charges of $44 million related to our Ohio and Florida business units. The impairment charges are the result of a continued decline in housing starts in these specific business units and the effect of this decline on the expected short and long-term operating performance for the business units. We no longer had goodwill on the balance sheet for these business units as of December 31, 2008. We also recorded pre-tax asset impairment charges of $7.1 million which consisted of $4.4 million of other intangible assets, $2.3 million of fixed assets, and $400,000 related to land held for sale. During the protracted decline in economic conditions that affect our industry, we evaluate the current operating performance as well as the long-term expectations of our locations. Based on this evaluation we closed nine facilities in 2008, excluding our New Jersey locations. On these facilities we recorded $4.8 million of facility closure costs, or $0.08 per share, net of tax, in 2008. Our New Jersey location facility closure costs are included in loss from discontinued operations and amounted to $3.7 million. We recorded a tax break of $18.9 million, or a 12.5% tax benefit rate during 2008, compared to a tax benefit of $12.1 million, or a 44.8% tax benefit rate in 2007. Our benefit for 2008 was reduced by an after tax, non-cash valuation allowance of $35.5 million, or $1.00 per share, related to our net deferred tax assets. The 2007 tax benefit rate was affected by tax legislation that was enacted in one of our filing jurisdictions. Subsequent to the third quarter of 2008, we announced our exit from the New Jersey market. We are treating this exit as a discontinued operation for accounting purposes. The loss from discontinued operations for 2008 was $7.7 million, or $0.21 loss per diluted share, compared to $8.9 million, or $0.25 loss per diluted share for 2007. Loss from continuing operations in 2008 was $131.8 million, compared to $14.9 million in 2007. Included in the loss from continuing operations in 2008 were after tax, non-cash charges of $73 million related to impairment of goodwill, fixed assets and other intangibles, facility closure costs and evaluation allowance on primarily all of our deferred tax assets. Loss from continuing operations per share for 2008 was $3.70; including $2.05 related to the non cash charges I just mentioned it. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $36.2 million compared to income of $51.1 million for 2007. The difficult conditions were definitely reflected in our 2008 results but through executing our action plan, we were able to limit the impact on this unprecedented downturn. These efforts will not only benefit us in the short term, but will allow us to be a more efficient organization in the long term. I’ll now turn the call over to Charles who will review the fourth quarter financial results in more detail.
Charles L. Horn:  Good morning everyone. As Floyd indicated I will walk you through our fourth quarter results, we reported sales of $201.3 million compared to $290.2 million last year, a year-over-year decline of $88.9 million or 30.6%. Our sales volume dropped an estimated 27.9% compared to an estimated 45.6% decline in housing activity within our markets, indicating a contribution from market share gain of about 15%. Breaking down our product categories, prefabricated component sales declined 34.3% from the fourth quarter 2007, due to a combination of lower volume and prices. Windows and door sales were down 30.4%, lumber and lumber [sheet good sales] declined 35.7% to $45.6 million. Again, due to a combination of lower volumes and prices, millwork sales declined 34.2% and other building products and services sales declined 19%. Our sales mix between years was consistent, with the exception of other building products and services which increased to 23.1% of total sales totals. This category grew due to the expansion of our installed services and the multi family [inlying] commercial segments. Our gross margin % was 21.3% for the fourth quarter of 2008, down from 23% last year, a 170 basis point decline. Specifically, our gross margin percentage declined 80 basis points due to price, 60 basis points due to volume and 30 basis points due to a shift in sales mix toward installed product sales, which carry a lower gross margin percentage than distributed sales. Our selling general and administrative expenses decreased $15.1 million or 18.7% to$ 65.8 million as a percentage of sales SG&A expense increased from 27.9% last year to 32.7% in 2008; this is reflective of fixed costs becoming a larger % of our selling general and administrative expenses.  Within SG&A salaries and benefits expense, including non cash stock based compensation declined $11.3 million or 24.6% from the fourth quarter of 2007. This decline was roughly 88% variable with our decline in sales volume. Delivery expenses decreased $2.5 million to $11.8 million during the quarter; this 17.8% decline is primarily due to a $1.2 million decrease in fuel cost. Our bad debt expense actually declined $0.2 million for the quarter when compared to last year, but increases the percent of sales to 80 basis points, from 60 basis points last year. Offsetting the declines in SG&A expenses were a $1.1 million increase in stock compensation expense and a $2.8 million in cost associated with canceled acquisitions. During the quarter we recorded assets impairment charges of $36.8 million before tax or $0.72 per share net of tax. We recorded goodwill impairment charges of $36.4 million related to our Florida business unit. The charge was the result of the continued decline in housing starts in this market and its effect on both our short-term and long-term expected operating performance. After the goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter, our Florida business unit no longer has any goodwill on the balance sheet. We also recorded a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $0.4 million related to lands we have held for sale, again this is located in Florida. We recorded a tax benefit of $13.4 million or a 20% tax benefit rate during the quarter, compared to a tax benefit of $10.3 million or 37.7% tax benefit rate last year. Our benefit for the quarter was reduced by an after-tax, non cash valuation allowance of $9.0 million or $0.25 per share related to our deferred net deferred tax assets. Our loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $53.4 million or $1.50 loss per diluted share, compared to $16.9 million or $0.48 loss per diluted share in the same period last year. Excluding the asset impairment facility closure cost and the tax evaluation allowance, our diluted loss from continuing operation was a $0.52 diluted loss per share for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to a $0.36 diluted loss per share for the fourth quarter 2007. As announced subsequent to the third quarter of 2008, we exited our New Jersey market, which we are treating as a discontinued operation for accounting purposes. As such, our loss for discontinued operations for the fourth quarter 2008 was $5.4 million or $0.15 loss per diluted share, compared to $43.4 million or $0.10 loss per diluted share last year. Included in the discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 was $3.7 million in facility closure costs. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2008 was a loss of $12.1 million compared to a loss of $5.2 million in the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of sales decreased to a negative 6% compared to a negative 1.8% for the fourth quarter of 2007. Now we’ll turn to liquidity and capital resources, during the fourth quarter of 2008 we repaid $20 million of our borrowing under our revolving credit facility, reducing the balance to $40 million at December 31, 2008. Subsequent to year-end we reduced our revolving credit facility commitment from $350 million to $250 million as allowed by the revolving credit facility. Our available borrowing capacity was not affected by this reduction, as our borrowing base, which consists of eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances used to calculate the available borrowing capacity did not support $250 million in borrowings. Additionally, we do not anticipate this reduction will have an effect on future availability as we do not anticipate our borrowing base will grow to support an excessive of $250 million of borrowings at any point during the remaining life of the credit facility.  This reduction does allow us to save about $0.5 million in interest expense per year related to commitment fees. As a result of this reduction, we wrote off $1.2 million of deferred financing costs in January 2009. Our total cash used during the fourth quarter was $4.3 million, leaving a cash balance of $106.9 million at December 31, 2008. Our net borrowing availability at December 31, 2008, was zero due to a drop in our eligible borrowing base coupled with lower seasonal advance rates set forth under our credit agreement. Our available cash at December 31, 2008, was $94.1 million as approximately $12.8 million of cash on hand supported a shortfall in our borrowing base at year end. We anticipate this shortfall in borrowing base will dissipate by March 2009, when our advance rates increase in accordance with our credit facility. Our working capital percentage, excluding income tax receivables actually improved to 13.1% from 13.5% in the fourth quarter of 2007.  However, our cash conversion days worsened from 54 days last year to 61 days this quarter. The increase in our cash conversion days was primarily due to an increase in inventory days and a small decrease in accounts payable days.  Our accounts receivable days actually improved slightly, inventory days increased about five days, as managing inventory levels at this level of housing is problematic. The need to replenish and economic order quantities in order to achieve best profit from our suppliers, is pressuring our inventory days. Our accounts payable days decreased by about two days. This decline is due to an increasing amount of outside contract labor supporting our installed product sales. These sub contractors generally require payments on terms from daily to weekly.  We are in the process of negotiating better terms with these vendors and hopefully this will improve our payable days in 2009. I’ll know turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd F. Sherman: According to Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies, the current housing start levels, new home sales and existing home sales rival the worst downturns in the post World War II era. And home price declines and mortgage defaults are the worst on records that date back to this 1960s and 1970s. These statements were based on a report dated in June of 2008.  We have seen a further decline in these metrics. Actual fourth quarter housing starts dropped to 103,600 from a 188,300 units in the same period of 2007, or a 45% decline. Fourth quarter percentage decline was the largest year-over-year change since the housing correction began in March 2006. For the year, actual single family housing starts fell to 622,400 units from 1,460,100 last year.  And the seasonally adjusted annualized housing rate for single family housing starts at the end of 2008 was 398,000. This level suggests that 2009 will likely be worse than 2008. We anticipate the first six months will be the most difficult with some improvement in the third and fourth quarters of 2009.  We believe our action plan in 2008 was instrumental in limiting the impact of the difficult conditions on our results. We've gained efficiencies in 2008 through effective implementation of our action plan. We will continue to execute our strategy of implementing cost-containment programs, managing credit tightly, rationalizing physical capacity, and growing market share in 2009 in order to conserve liquidity.  This continued strategy execution coupled with $94.1 million in available cash and $35 million in expected income tax refunds in 2009, should provide the liquidity to weather yet another year in these unprecedented industry conditions. I will now turn the call over to operator for our Q&A session.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Rob Hansen – Deutsche Bank.
Rob Hansen – Deutsche Bank:  Just wanted to see if you could elaborate a little more on the drop in accounts payable, as well as the accounts receivable?
Charles L. Horn:  From the accounts payable, I think we saw about a two-day decline. What you're seeing there is again as we go out and expand into more of an installed product sales, there's a large component of our sales that are being driven by the actual sub-contract labor which are not employees. The sub-contracts labor expense for 2008 was somewhere in the area of $50 to $60 million.  That does process through our accounts payable system, and what that does if it has terms of pay now or pay within a week, it obviously depresses what we're seeing in the overall payable days. From an actual product standpoint our days were stable or slightly up, but really what depressed it was this increasing amount of sub-contract labor flowing through.  From an accounts receivable days we are seeing continued pressure. What you're seeing within the industry is many smaller customers are struggling. Many of them are basically heading to what I would call orderly liquidation. As such, that does pressure a little bit in the payment and it has increased some of the delinquency.  Year-over-year if you look at what happens in terms of our delinquency, we have seen about 5% increase in the amount that has slipped into our greater-than-60-day bucket. And that's what you're really seeing going through with the A/R days.
Rob Hansen – Deutsche Bank: Okay and then just, on the revolver, you had mentioned that you would pay it off once the Wells and Wachovia deal went through? I just wanted to see what the rationale was behind only paying $20 million of it off and why not the full amount?
Charles L. Horn:  What we did, is we did a forecast for the year and based upon the forecast for 2009 and coupled with our forecast for the borrowing base, we thought one, there would be no requirement to pay it off, two, we would be able to keep it, treat it as long-term. Our proclivity at this point in the cycle is to keep cash rather than just relying upon a non-drawn revolver and that's what we chose to do so.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli – RBC Capital Markets. 
Scot Ciccarelli – RBC Capital Markets:  A follow up question on the payables, you said that payable days were relatively steady. So are you suggesting that vendors have not tightened terms at all?
Charles L. Horn:  I can't say that I've really seen any tightening of our terms. Our major suppliers are very cooperative; they want to work with us. We're all in this housing environment together, and Floyd, if you want to add anything to there. We've not really seen much coming through that.
Floyd F. Sherman: I think we, due to our very good relationships with the suppliers, I think the suppliers also view us as a survivor in this business and one that will be a really critical customer, and strategic customer to them down the road.  They are continuing to work with us very well and they're very, very comfortable with our financial condition and relative to what else they see going on in the industry, and we really don't anticipate any substantive changes in this relationship going forward.  I will also add something to – Charles indicated that one of the factors that dropped our average days in payable was the terms in which we pay our sub-contract labor. We are talking with the primary labor suppliers in an effort to expand and get better pay terms, especially from the pay now, pay within a week.  We're attempting to move these pay terms up to as much as 30 days. I don't know how successful we'll be in this area, but this is an area that has our attention and we obviously, it has real implications for us, and we think we will be able to be successful in improving over the position where we are now, but it'll be taking a lot of work and it will be occurring over the next 30 to 60 days.
Scot Ciccarelli – RBC Capital Markets:  Okay thanks, and then you did mention you thought you gained market share during the quarter. Can you just describe to your knowledge, I know it's pretty fragmented, a lot of privates out there, but what you see going on in the competitive front because obviously, as you mentioned, it's tough for everybody?
Charles L. Horn:  What we definitely see is from your smaller builders up to your regional builders, there is quite a bit of distress. What you're seeing is that the largest builders are continuing to be fine. They have good liquidity. They do not have any current debt. They're going to be survivors.  I think what you're going to see as a result of this pronounced decline is that the major builders are going to grab substantial share and definitely come out dominate toward the end of this cycle. What we definitely see is more regional and smaller builders moving to what I'd call an orderly liquidation.  What they're doing, in many cases, they're making a decision, are we better off alive or dead? In some situations they're set up in a very tax-advantaged situation which means that any income tax refund coming through to them can pass directly through to the owners versus going into the company. Many of them are now looking at that and saying, do I want that money to stay in the company or do I want to take in and just wind down? And I think you're going to see more of that in 2009 and from a credit perspective it's something we're very focused on, because I think you'll see more and more smaller builders decide, I'm going to take the refund and just wind down operations."
Floyd F. Sherman:  I think to also add to that, Charles, we're seeing almost no speculative building at all. What's being built is where the builders definitely feel they has a contract that's good, will go through and they'll be able close the house out.  The level of building activity is uniformly, through just about all of our areas are reflecting the same position by the builders, and some of it's due to the fact with the small builders, the banks are just squeezing down on them. They're not advancing any more. They're not allowing them to build any specs.  In fact, in many cases, they've set target. They have to get inventory, a certain amount of reduction in inventory, before they'll even talk to them about advancing on a good contract. We're going to continue to see some really diminished building activities we think over the next several months.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes – Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.
Keith Hughes – Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: I have a couple of questions, I guess first on working capital. As a source of cash here at the end of the year, much more modest than prior year, given we’re headed into a tough 2009, is there really significantly more dollars you can pull out of working capital?
Charles L. Horn: Keith, it’s going to be a challenge. As we talked about on A/R, I think our challenge in A/R would be to try to keep; basically the A/R dates from moving up slightly. Inventory, again, we’re getting to a housing level that’s very difficult to replenish in economic order quantities, so it’s really hard to pick up our turns. If we do try to break, to increase our turns, it will have to be through consignment programs or buying is some very, very small quantities which can be efficient. So it will be a challenge. Looking at working at working capital, the biggest opportunity could be A/P. As Floyd talked about, we do have opportunities with the subcontractors, we do have opportunities with our temp labor firms, we do have opportunities with our professional services. So there’s things we can do to try to actually increase A/P even though DSO will definitely be moving against us and likely, we’ll be looking to maintain inventory turns and inventory days.
Keith Hughes – Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: Are manufacturers open to consignment relationships at this point?
Charles L. Horn: I think there’s some product categories that would still be possible, but overall, it’s difficult. The ones that have excess inventory and do have not have storage, it could work. Certain specialty categories, it could work, but I don’t know if it’s a huge opportunity, but it’s a possible opportunity.
Floyd F. Sherman: Keith, we are working with our suppliers. Obviously, we would like to be able to increase our days and we’re talking to every one of our suppliers to see what we could do to get more favorable terms and yet not impact our pricing. We also really are looking hard at all purchases that are made outside of our preferred vendors in an effort to, say if we’re going to buy outside of our vendors, it’s got to be done on terms that are equal to our preferred vendors and at a price that’s attractive to us.  There is probably in our business about 18 to 19% of our purchases fall into that category and I think there is an area of opportunity that we can get an improvement in terms, because typically those purchases are not carrying the same quality terms that we’re getting with preferred vendors and we are hard at work at pairing this disparity down.
Keith Hughes – Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: As of the end of the year, what was the breakdown at fixed and variable in SG&A?
Charles L. Horn: I would say you’re probably looking somewhere in the area Q4 60% fixed, 40% variable.
Keith Hughes – Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: And final question, you talked a lot in the financial discussion about the shift to installed service, what specific trades are you doing more than you would have say a year or two ago in that business?
Charles L. Horn: In terms of what type of projects? We've done a number; we did a large basically, it's a campus housing. We’ve done some military housing. We’re trying to look for projects that are not quite as immune to the cycle in terms of financing. So they tend to be multi-layered, multi-product jobs, but we’re basically turn-keying very large construction projects that we’ve not done before. These are projects that can last 12, 18 months where as I can tell you candidly, before we were looking at projects that would last up to three months. So we’ve really pushed up the scope and duration of the projects that we’ll take versus what we did before.
Keith Hughes – Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: Doing the pre-fab components and I assume the windows and doors, that sort of work with them?
Charles L. Horn: In trim, it could be any number of things that we spec out. They tend to break it down based on package and it’s just whatever quotes come in as being the most advantageous to the general contractor.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Allen Weber] – [Robody & Company]
[Allen Weber] – [Robody & Company]: I guess my general question was, kind of on the thought process in the markets that you've kind of closed down in, was it just a function of market position, the real estate, and I guess that was my general question.
Charles L. Horn: Definitely market position is one, if we’re not number one or two in the market, then we’d be more inclined to leave it. The other thing that we tend to look at is does the operation make a contribution toward its fixed costs. So we look at it, does it gross profit dollars minus its variable expenses, at least make a positive contribution to fixed costs. So it could be losing EBITDA, but if it has a positive, so let’s say that fixed costs are $1 million yet, it's generating $100,000 of cash toward it, then we’re not going to be inclined to shut it down. But conversely, if it’s not covering variable costs, or not even trading dollars with our customers and it's a market long-term we don’t feel we have very good potential then, those would be the ones we target. Our overall goal is not to shut down facilities, we want to keep a broad footprint, we want a presence for recovery. Our proclivity would be to go through it to try to scale it back, pull out as many people as we can, operate more of a skeleton crew and get it to a contribution break even or positive contribution. That’s really what our target is.
[Allen Weber] – [Robody & Company]: Okay, and I guess on the flip side of that is, can you talk about in some of your markets, are you seeing just as you’ve gotten out of New Jersey, are you seeing some of your competitors, I mean we know the situation for the builders, are you seeing many competitors in your markets actually leaving the market? Or is that what you expect or?
Charles L. Horn: In New Jersey?
[Allen Weber] – [Robody & Company]: No, not in New Jersey, in the markets you’re still in.
Charles L. Horn: A number of our markets are seeing closures. Some of our big competitors have shut down anywhere from 86 for one competitor to over 100 for another competitor. Those are companies bigger than us. In terms of smaller competitors, if you go into Florida, your small independents, especially in your trusts and panel manufacturing are just shutting down, trying to sell off their real estate for whatever the real estate value is. So the reduction in capacity is pronounced at all levels of the supply chain.
Floyd F. Sherman: And we saw in Georgia in the Atlanta market area alone, close to $700 million of sales at the height of two competitors that have pulled, that have shut down and liquidated.
Charles L. Horn: We’ve definitely seen that we have one smaller market in Florida where a year ago there were three competitors with us, now we’re the only person standing. Now we’re still the only person there with 2 housing starts, but again, we are seeing that capacity shrink out.
[Allen Weber] – [Robody & Company]: Okay, my last question is, does the shutting down of the markets, does it change your relationship with these suppliers, does that enter into the thought process or not really?
Charles L. Horn: I don’t believe it really impacts our relationship with our suppliers. Our suppliers are still looking for volume. Something an employee taught me a long time ago, they're still looking for customers as well. So in a difficult environment they’re still going to need customers. They are going to be looking for customers with good liquidity. Overall, we’re toward the top of that heap and so they are going to continue to work with us.
Floyd F. Sherman: We’ve had a number of occasions where some of the major forest product producers have come to us with excess inventory or some bill balancing needs that they had because they knew that we could buy in a much larger volume than they were getting through their typical customer base. We frequently shop and look for those types situations because it helps us in the market place with more competitive pricing. We’re still a very, very important customer overall to the forest products producers. They view us, as I said earlier, our supplier base and generally; the suppliers of the building products industry are viewing us as a long-term survivor and somebody who is going to become even more strategically important as we go down the road and into the future.
[Allen Weber] – [Robody & Company]: Okay and I guess my final question was when you look out over the next, at some point we’ll have a better environment and obviously, the competitive landscape has changed; can you just in your own mind speak about how you think the products will play out as to the sense of what you currently do? Would you expect any to be smaller or larger as a percent, just curious on that?
Charles L. Horn: In terms of our mix, in terms of adding products, reducing products we carry?
[Allen Weber] – [Robody & Company]: Yes, just overall mix of what you currently have, how you expect that to change, if any of it’s been a surprise to you?
Charles L. Horn: I don’t think there will be substantial changes; there could be some further opportunities to expand mix in the future. Perhaps it could be a case where some specialty distributors fall out during a part of this process that we’re going through. Likely it’s going to be a very consistent mix but I think again what we said earlier, I think it’s going to be directed to fewer, fewer big customers versus the broad base of customers that we currently have had over the last decade in terms of the building environment. 
Floyd F. Sherman:  If I were to look at the two parts of our business where I think we will see an improvement in our percentage of mix, but not major change, one is in the installed service area, we’re continuing to build up our expertise, certainly our reputation and if you look at the sales to that sector each quarter it's growing pretty dramatically with us, I think that will increase and I think the other area will be in manufactured components, a lot of capacity has been taken out of the market. We clearly were the leader in this area; we have retained a very high percentage of our engineering group so that we can expand this business quite rapidly. All of our – the component manufacturing plants with the exception of two, which are [mothball] ,are still operating and so we can gear up quite quickly and I think we will be increasing our share of the market for those components as housing improves.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Jay McCanless – FTN Equity.
Jay McCanless – FTN Equity Capital Markets: Wanted to ask first about that reserve, could you tell us again where it was at the end of the year and give us some sense of how much or how little you’ve had to increase it with all of the bankruptcies and quarterly liquidations you’ve talked about over the last six weeks.
Charles L. Horn: At the end of the year it's $6.2 million on an $85 million balance, it grows a little over 6.2% reserve. The end of last year was $7.2 million on $126 million balance so a little over 5%. So at the end of period it’s about 2% higher, in terms of bad debt expense for the year is about a million spot higher in 2008 than it was in 2007.
Jay McCanless – FTN Equity Capital Markets: Okay and what type of growth have you seen at the beginning of first quarter ’09?
Charles L. Horn: In terms of the bad debt expense? I think it’s a little bit early to really know where we stand. I can tell you that the AG in January didn’t look any different than December, so I can’t think of any specific event in January that makes me feel any differently than ’08.
Jay McCanless – FTN Equity Capital Markets: Okay. And then wanted to ask you had talked in earlier conference calls about banks keeping competitors open to try to collect the A/R’s as best they could. Is that trend starting to slow down? Are you starting to see more of these liquidate and finally go away, how are things looking there?
Charles L. Horn: Well I can tell you on the customer base it definitely seems that there is more of a tendency towards just letting the customers orderly wind down, finish out homes, sell them off. There doesn’t seem a great willingness to lend even though it does seem once companies go into the work out groups they do seem to work with them a little bit. I think the way we look at it comes down to many cases is the company worth more alive or dead, and that’s the evaluation that the credit people within the banks make, but we definitely are seeing with the smaller customers, banks are pushing them more towards liquidation.
Jay McCanless – FTN Equity Capital Markets: Okay and then on the competitors side? Same holds true for competitors as well as customers?
Charles L. Horn: Hard to say. I don’t probably have as much insight into that as I do with our customer base. They definitely seem to be working with our big competitors, hard to say with the smaller suppliers. Many of them are failing.  Is that a result of their banks? I’m not sure; it could just be a case of the family deciding they no longer want to operate the business in this environment, and so I can’t be very specific on that one.
Floyd F. Sherman: I would have to think from all that we hear Charles, wouldn’t you agree that everyone is on a very, very tight leash. Anybody who is on an ABL is continually having the quality of their assets reviewed and adjustments made.  The banks have a much tougher attitude and in many respects, I think the financial institutions are really running scared of any exposure that they have in the home building construction sector, and they just – really maintaining the pressure on all of the companies on all of the exposure that they have.
Jay McCanless – FTN Equity Capital Markets: And then my final question just, what is your outlook for the lumber market this year and what are some of the things you’re seeing right now in terms of price?
Floyd F. Sherman: Our outlook is that we thought and have projected that we think there will be a slight increase in the cost of commodity products. The – we saw – it looked like the market in January and February early part of February was starting to move up, but that and a lot of mill closures have been announced. The financial reports coming out of the forest products industry, both domestic as well as Canadian are extremely grim. But a number of companies have tried to set a floor on their pricing and said they will not sell below this and the floor was above what current market pricing was. That’s beginning to crumble, because I think there still is not enough capacity that has come out. There still has to be some more capacity taken out, both on the Canadian, as well as on the American side, and we’re starting to see prices are beginning to slip back down. I think still by the end of – I think when we look at the year in total, I think we’re going to end up seeing a slight increase in costs, but nothing dramatic. That obviously has tremendous affects on us. We would love to be able to see a lot stronger commodity pricing market, but I don’t think that it's going to be a great deal different that what we’re seeing right now.
Operator:  And our next question comes from [Brian Tydale] – [Broad Point Capital].
[Brian Tydale] – [Broad Point Capital].:  I had a question, given all of your cost cutting initiatives, trying to get a sense, what level of revenue do you need given your cost structure now to basically get EBITDA back to a positive number?
Charles L. Horn: That’s a tough one to answer. I can tell you six months ago we thought it was $100 million, but I think with the things that we’ve done now it’s much lower than that, but given a more defined answer 
Floyd F. Sherman: A hundred million a month. 
Charles L. Horn: Yes, $100 million a month. Six months ago we felt that, obviously with the changes we’ve made now we’ve taken it down, but I don’t know if we really can provide much more insight than that.
[Brian Tydale] – [Broad Point Capital].: Well I mean given ’08 levels of billing of top line. Is that number stuck for ’09? Obviously ’09 looking to be worse but if that number stuck for ’09 would you be comfortable thinking that EBITDA gets back into positive territory?
Charles L. Horn: If we could see the same level of revenues in ’09 as we saw in ’08? I think that is conceivable, yes.
[Brian Tydale] – [Broad Point Capital].: From a liquidity stand point, obviously with the revolver being or the AVL going down, are you having discussions with any such equity holders or are you exploring any additional methods of brining in some additional availability or liquidity at this point? Or in your view do you think you have enough to get through this year and next year and get through the down turn?
Charles L. Horn: It is the latter. At this time we are not exploring any further equity or liquidity to come into the business. We’re always looking for ways from our own operations we can generate more. If there is non-core assets we can invest, we’ll consider it. If there are things we can do internally to improve cash that's what we’re looking for. At this point obviously we’re not looking to do anything that could be dilutive to share holders. We do feel that we have more than enough liquidity to ride through 2009 and candidly, Floyd and I are looking at making sure we have enough for 2010, even if we see no improvement in housing and that’s what we’re working on now.  So versus having a 12 month outlook we do everything more on a 24 month outlook in terms of managing liquidity.
[Brian Tydale] – [Broad Point Capital].: Do you – is there anything planned or slated right now in terms of asset sales? Have you identified some things you’re looking to part with this year?
Charles L. Horn: We definitely have ideas yes.
[Brian Tydale] – [Broad Point Capital].: Anything you could share, in terms of regions or what types of things you’re looking to – you may be looking to liquidate?
Charles L. Horn: Not at this point.
[Brian Tydale] – [Broad Point Capital].: How about even in terms of size of dollars. I mean are you talking single-digit millions or are these larger sales?
Charles L. Horn: I can’t give you a reasonable estimate at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Michael Plansey] – Credit Suisse.
[Michael Plansey] – Credit Suisse: I was wondering if you had any maintenance covenants that you could trip over the course of the next 12 to 18 months.
Charles L. Horn:  The key covenant that we have we talk about in the press release and that is the $35 million minimum availability threshold. That's the part that basically takes our eligible borrowing base, it subtracts from it our any outstanding borrowing, and that resulting sum has to exceed $35 million. If we did not have enough to cover the $35 million then we'd move into a testing environment where we'd have to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio of one to one, which clearly if you look at our trailing 12 months results we couldn’t meet. So if you go through and pierce through the press release, what you'll see is our cushion above that $35 million is about $95 million at year end and we think that that will actually go up a little bit at the end of the first quarter, when our credit agreement allows for an increase in our seasonal advance rates.
[Michael Plansey] – Credit Suisse:  Now do those advance rates come back down again in the second half of the year or do they stay up?
Charles L. Horn:  What they do is they increase in March through August and then they drop from September through February.
Floyd F. Sherman:  Qualified for tax.
Charles L. Horn:  Yes, the other part from a liquidity standpoint we also talked about in the press release is we do have an anticipated $35.6 million income tax refund, we're targeting May 2009 to receive it, even though we're working to get it earlier than that if possible. 
Operator:  (Operator instructions) Our next question comes from Kevin Starke – CRT Capital
Kevin Starke – CRT Capital:  Do you think you might use some of that tax refund to buy back the second lean note given that they're trading at [$0.30] on the dollar?
Charles L. Horn:  You know it's always a consideration we look at that every day.
Kevin Starke – CRT Capital:  You could possibly buy back the whole issue.
Charles L. Horn:  It goes back to our two year outlook, how we're trying to always look ahead in terms of liquidity to cover 24 months. If as the time goes forward, our visibility looks better and we feel comfortable with our liquidity that would be the first place we'd look. Conversely right now, with still the muddiness in the water, the uncertainty we're going to sit on the liquidity and try to increase it versus doing anything at this point to decrease it, but you're right it's very attractive.
Kevin Starke – CRT Capital:  Yes, forgive me if you've mentioned this but did you give past due receivables percentage?
Charles L. Horn:  I did not, I do not have that in front of me, it seems like the greater than 60 is around 12%.
Kevin Starke – CRT Capital:  Okay and that's up from about 7% at the end of the third quarter? 
Charles L. Horn:  That's correct.
Kevin Starke – CRT Capital:  Okay the mechanics of your first, of your revolver credit agreement are a little tricky but they mention a compliance period, I'm wondering if you triggered that by virtue of falling below the minimum liquidity? 
Charles L. Horn:  No, we didn’t fall beneath it. If you have our credit agreement, if you look at the definition of how that calculation works, there's a concept of qualified cash, meaning that any cash we have on deposit with the agents can count against any shortfall on the borrowing base.
Kevin Starke – CRT Capital:  Okay so you triggered none of that compliance period?
Charles L. Horn:  We did not trigger a compliance period yes. 
Kevin Starke – CRT Capital:  Okay good, by the look of it you can only do that twice, right?
Charles L. Horn:  No actually, we're not restricted on just leaving qualified cash over at the agent. That is not a trip up, what you're referring to is if we actually put forth on it, we can cure it, in terms of the cures we're limited but this would not have been deemed a cure.
Kevin Starke – CRT Capital:  Got it, good, all right, I get a lot of interest from fixed income investors who think that you have a very long runway with your very slow cash burn and your pretty good cash position, but it's hard to look ahead to what normalized sales might be, normalized EBITDA and I know you're not prepared to give that information, but I'm wondering if you have a viewpoint of what may be normalized housing starts might be in this economy and what rough sales level, at Builders First versus my correspondence?
Charles L. Horn:  Well it depends on your timeframe; we spend a lot of time thinking about that. If you go back to the peak of housing in 2005 you saw over 2 million starts in total. I think we believe that in the normal cycles going forward you're going to see probably 1.5 million in terms of total starts, not this 2 million level that you saw during the boom years. Having said that, we still believe that that can be very beneficial for us, with the capacity that's dropped out of our markets, with the fact that we've been able to maintain broad presence as we've only really x'd in one market.  We feel that will play into our hands, so while maybe our sales will not get back to what they were at the peak level we feel we can actually be more profitable. I mean Floyd spent a lot of time talking about things we're doing to be more efficient and I think that again we've always focused on market share and being the largest within our markets. And I think it actually plays into our hands in that regard, in terms of the ability to be more profitable, more efficient and have a larger share within our markets, but at a new reset lower level of housing across the cycle, Floyd?
Floyd F. Sherman:  Yes I think another way you can also look at it Charles, is our sales dollar generated per housing start has really continued to increase as we've increased our market share. That's not going to go away when housing returns to a more normalized state and I agree. I think that the range of housing probably on a normalized basis is 1.5 to 1.7 million housing starts, I think all the demographics and all the studies that have been done certainly support that. The – I think our penetration is definitely going to be better as we go, I think with our efficiencies that we are producing now, they're not going to go away as business conditions improve and so I look for a better future even than what we've had in the past, as we get to a more normalized position.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) It appears there are no further questions in the queue, Mr. Sherman I'll turn the conference back over to you for closing remarks.
Floyd F. Sherman:  Okay thank you for joining us today, if you have any further questions please feel free to contact Charles. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes the Builders FirstSource Conference Call. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect your line.

At this time I will turn the call over to Floyd Sherman.
Floyd F. Sherman: Welcome to our third quarter 2008 earnings call. Joining me from our management team is Charles Horn, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer. After I give a brief overview, I’ll then turn the call over to Charles who will discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we’ll take your questions. The challenging conditions facing our industry persist as annualized housing starts in September fell to 817,000 units, the lowest level since the US Census Bureau began tracking data in 1958. Further aggravating an already weakened housing market was the financial market turmoil that intensified in September as the broader credit markets, not just the mortgage markets, became virtually frozen. These challenging conditions only strengthen our commitment to our strategy and to the long-term success of Builders FirstSource. Our operating strategy for these conditions centers on preserving liquidity, reducing operating costs and growing market share. Our cash balance was $131.2 million at the end of September after we borrowed $60 million on our $350 million revolving credit facility at the end of September. We initiated the borrowings in response to the instability in the credit markets to make certain we would have ample cash liquidity for our long-term needs. We continue to reduce our operating costs in response to the decline in our sales volume. Our selling, G&A expenses declined 18.9% for the quarter when compared to the year ago quarter which is 63.9% variable to our 29.6% decline in sales volume. Additionally, by growing market share during the downturn we have been able to partially offset the negative affects economic conditions have on our sales. We have successfully grown market share every quarter throughout the downturn. We were able to grow share in the third quarter of 2008 by 10.1% compared to the third quarter of 2007 through outstanding customer service and by expanding our customer base. Although we are facing difficult times in our industry, we’re proud of our accomplishments: Strong liquidity after more than two years of challenging conditions, reductions in operating expenses which are in line with our sales decline, and market share growth. Our strategy has served us well to date and we believe it’ll help us to successfully navigate this protracted downturn. With the continued decline in housing starts and general economic conditions that affect our industry, we made the decision to close two of our facilities in the third quarter. In addition, subsequent to the quarter end we decided to exit the New Jersey market, close the small facility and idle another facility through an end market consolidation bringing our total closures to nine facilities. We made these very difficult decisions based on not only the short term but also the long term prospects of these operations in order to protect our liquidity. I’ll now turn the call over to Charles who will review the financial results in more detail.
Charles L. Horn: We reported sales of $288.3 million in the third quarter of 2008. That’s a decrease of 30.3% compared to $413.9 million for the same period in 2007. Breaking down our sales drivers for the quarter compared to the prior year. First, we estimate that housing starts within our markets declined approximately 39% compared to the same period in 2007. This decline is consistent with the decline in overall national single-family starts of 39.1%. Second, lower market prices on lumber and lumber sheet goods had slightly over a 1% negative impact on our sales compared to the third quarter of 2007. Conversely, market share gains added approximately 10% points to our sales and new operations nominally added to our sales. Breaking down our product categories. Prefabricated components declined 29.7% from the third quarter of 2007 due to a combination of lower volumes and lower prices. Windows and doors were down 28.9%. Lumber and lumber sheet goods declined 34.8% to $71.6 million. We estimate that $35.5 million of the decrease is due to lower volumes and $2.8 million due to lower prices. Millwork declined 31.7%. Finally, other building products and services decreased 26%. Our sales mix was consistent between years with the exception of other building products and services which increased to 21.4% of total sales. This category grew due to our expansion of installation services into the multifamily and light commercial segments. Turing to grow margins. The $39.1 million decline in gross margins was across all product categories. Our gross margin percentage was 21% in the third quarter of 2008 compared to 24.1% in the third quarter of 2007. We experienced margin compression in all of our major product categories, the most significant in our manufactured products. The impact of fixed costs within our cost of goods sold against lower sales volumes lowered our gross margins by approximately 1 % point. Pricing pressure on all products continued in the highly competitive environment although we are seeing pricing stabilize and in some cases improving. As the downturn persists, we may see further margin compression. Our selling, general and administrative expenses were $75.6 million, down $17.6 million from the third quarter of 2007. We reduced our salaries and benefits expense by almost 22% from Q3 2007 on a sales volume decline of 29.6% or about 73% variable. We reduced our full-time equivalent headcount by 22% from the third quarter of 2007. In an effort to reduce fixed operating costs we closed two locations during the third quarter of 2008. Subsequent to quarter end we announced the closure of four additional locations. These closures should improve our cash flow by an estimated $5 million to $7 million in 2009. Also in October we reduced our corporate staff by approximately 31 people. The corporate reductions should bring us an additional $3 million in annualized savings. From the third quarter 2007 we were also able to reduce our office G&A expense by almost $3 million or 29% and delivery costs by $1.6 million or 9.4%. However a the percentage of sales delivery costs were up 120 basis points primarily due to increased fuel costs. Fuel costs increased due to higher diesel prices coupled with extended delivery distances. Our occupancy expenses were only slightly lower than the third quarter of 2007 as these costs are relatively fixed in nature. Bad debt expense and other customer write-offs were essentially consistent between quarters at $1.5 million. Credit is becoming increasingly difficult for our builder customers to access. Accordingly we continue to diligently pursue collection of our accounts receivable. Our bad debt expense and other customer write-offs may reflect these difficult conditions in future quarters. During the quarter we closed a facility in South Carolina and a facility in Ohio as a result of the continued decline in market conditions for these two facilities. We recognized $4.1 million or $0.07 per share in facility closure costs which are primarily related to future minimum lease obligations on these vacated facilities. We will recognize additional facility closure costs in the fourth quarter related to locations closed after quarter end. Interest expense was $6.1 million for the third quarter, down $400,000 from the year ago period. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the debt balance from September 2007 as well as lower interest rates during the quarter. We borrowed $60 million under our $350 million revolving credit facility at the end of September. This was done late in the quarter; therefore the borrowing had a minimal effect on interest expense during the quarter. Income taxes. During the third quarter we recorded an after-tax valuation allowance of $3.2 million or $0.09 per share on net deferred taxes recorded during the third quarter of 2008. Excluding the impact of the valuation allowance during the third quarter our effective tax rate was 38.3% compared to 36.7% in the year ago quarter. Net loss for the third quarter was $18.9 million or -$0.53 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $12 million or -$0.34 per diluted share in the same period last year. Excluding the facility closure costs and the tax valuation allowance, our diluted loss per share was $0.37 compared to $0.01 per diluted share last year exclusive of the asset impairments. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was -$7.6 million compared to $14.6 million in the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales decreased to a -2.6% compared to a +3.5% last year. Looking at our balance sheet, we had $131.2 million in cash at the end of September. Our liquidity defined as cash plus net borrowing availability was $154.5 million at quarter end. This amount is net of the $35 million minimum liquidity covenant contained in our credit agreement. We will continue our efforts to preserve liquidity in these very challenging conditions. Looking at cash flow and working capital. We used cash in operating activities during the quarter of $4.4 million due to the net operating loss which we were not able to completely offset with reductions in working capital. We did receive $8 million in income tax refunds during the quarter and we anticipate receiving approximately $1 million additional tax refunds in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our working capital percentage excluding income tax receivables actually improved 10.4% this year from 10.8% in the third quarter of 2007. Our day sales outstanding improved one day from last year while our accounts payable essentially remains flat. Inventory turns were slightly worse, down one turn as we took strategic inventory positions on certain products in advance of announced price increases. At September 2008 our accounts receivable balance greater than 60 days was 7% of total accounts receivable, up slightly from 6.2% in June 2008. I’ll now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd F. Sherman: The turmoil in the credit markets and the resulting contraction in lending could further damage an already weakened housing market. Because of the many factors that affect our industry it’s difficult to predict when conditions will improve, but we estimate that these challenging conditions will persist through mid-2010. We will continue to provide updated housing permit and commodity price data on our website each month to help guide you through the market uncertainties. This data is summarized and based on publicly available information. This quarter was yet another difficult quarter but we’re committed to the long-term success of Builders FirstSource. We continue to focus on our strategy which has served us well to this point with strong liquidity, a more efficient organization through implemented operating efficiencies, and continued market share growth. We believe this strategy will help us weather the current downturn and make us a better company able to take advantage of the upside when the market does turn around. We would like to point to our proven ability to cut costs and increase our operating efficiency, to preserve working capital and liquidity, and to grow our market share. In order to continue with these successes in these areas we will focus our efforts on identifying initiatives to offset declining sales, reduce headcount, drive operational improvements, rationalize physical capacity and restructure underperforming locations. We will strive to maintain our market leadership and financial strength during this downturn. To achieve these identified initiatives we’ll rely on the considerable strengths of our employees to continue the successful implementation of our strategy throughout the remainder of the downturn. I’ll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities: First I want to get some details on the drawing down on the line of credit. I just wanted to hear a little bit more about the rationale, specifically were there any concerns that you had about the banks that were involved in providing the line or have there been any concerns on the part of your suppliers about your own liquidity position that led you to draw down?
Charles L. Horn: It certainly wasn’t the latter issue. It was a case where our lead bank is Wachovia. Obviously everyone knows the events towards the end of September regarding Wachovia. Again with them being an agent we wanted to make sure that we borrowed, had the liquidity there in case there was a hiccup with Wachovia. Had they just been a participant we wouldn’t have been overly concerned but as agents with our money flowing through them, we thought it was beneficial to go ahead and draw the money and have it on hand. It certainly wasn’t a case where we needed it. It certainly wasn’t a case to beef up our balance sheet in terms of our suppliers. It was purely precautionary. I think once we see the merger go through with Wells Fargo you’ll see us pay it back and get rid of the negative interest arbitrage.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities: What might the interest impact be in the next couple quarters?
Charles L. Horn: I think the effective rate is about 5.5% on this drawing so it’d be $60 million if we kept it for the full quarter at 5.5%.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities: Last quarter you’d mentioned that you might get $7 million to $10 million back in tax refunds. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on the status of that and what you might get this half and what you might be looking at next year.
Charles L. Horn: For this year we received $7 million in the third quarter. We have an additional $1 million to be received in the fourth quarter of this year. So for 2008 we’re only looking at an additional $1 million of refunds. For 2009 our best estimate right now is around $35 million of refunds which we’ll endeavor to get back in May or June of 2009.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Walter Brenton - Regiment Capital].
[Walter Brenton - Regiment Capital]: Just a follow up on the previous fellow’s questions on cash flow. On the second quarter call I think your full-year guidance for negative cash flow implied that you would use $15 million to $25 million in the second half. You only used $4 million in the third quarter but of course you have those tax refunds. Is that range still good for the full second half?
Floyd F. Sherman: I think that’s correct. We are anticipating that Q4 could be difficult with the financial crisis that’s going on. So I think we’d stay with that same guidance.
[Walter Brenton - Regiment Capital]: For next year, anything you can tell us beyond the tax refunds in terms of your cash flow expectations?
Charles L. Horn: No. We really don’t give forecasts. We’ve always made that a point so that’s pretty much all we can disclose is the tax refunds.
[Walter Brenton - Regiment Capital]: Any comment you can make on working capital and whether you have any expectations of taking money out of working capital?
Charles L. Horn: We are. I think if you look at the fourth quarter this year, we can do a little bit better on inventory. We’ve done a very good job on DSO. We’ve done a very good job on accounts payable. I think we can do more definitely on inventory; increase our turns a little bit. Going into next year though I think it’s going to be a challenge to maintain working capital percentage. I think there could be further pressure on DSO. Inventory’s controllable. AP’s more controllable. But DSO could be a little bit more difficult going into 2009.
[Walter Brenton - Regiment Capital]: Just so I understand the numbers, that $4 million charge you took for closing those locations, that’s basically still on the balance sheet, right? You haven’t really spent that yet right?
Charles L. Horn: That’s correct. It’s primarily lease obligations that we will pay out in the normal course of business over time.
[Walter Brenton - Regiment Capital]: Did that go into accrued liabilities and would have been factored into the change in that number?
Charles L. Horn: Most of it is recorded in long term versus the current liabilities.
[Walter Brenton - Regiment Capital]: In terms of the use of your cash at this point, it sounds like - tell me if I’m not right - but it sounds like at this point you’re pretty much just holding cash to get you through this downturn. Is that kind of your approach right now?
Charles L. Horn: I think that’s correct. You won’t see us being overly inquisitive. There’s really nothing on the horizon on that. Cap ex we’re pulling in. We definitely will try to conserve cash. That’s our first priority.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kasprzak, Jr. - BB&T Capital Markets.
John Kasprzak, Jr. - BB&T Capital Markets: I wanted to ask about the issue of competition. You guys have obviously been mentioning that out in the market place. I notice Wolseley recently said with regard to their stock operation in the US they’re shutting down 86 branches, exiting 16 markets. What can you tell us about as far as the housing downturn what you’re seeing on capacity in your market? Is it finally starting to exit the market at an accelerating pace? It seemed like there was a big of a lag and that’s obviously contributed to a tough environment, but are we starting to see capacity closures, capacity exiting the market pick up?
Floyd F. Sherman: Yes. We are seeing this taking place now on an accelerated basis. I don’t believe the required capacity has been eliminated to as great a degree as we think that it should be but it certainly is accelerating on a much faster pace than what we’ve seen up until now. We are seeing it obviously from the announcements that are made by Wolseley. There’ve been some announcements by 84. But we’re also seeing it with a lot of smaller operations. A number of trust operations have closed. Whether this will be a permanent reduction in capacity or whether it’s just mothballing, we’ll just have to wait and see. I think what we’ll find is that it will be probably split evenly between permanent reduction and mothballing.
John Kasprzak, Jr. - BB&T Capital Markets: We had 2.2 million housing starts at the peak. Is there any way to determine what the industry, it’s a moving target of course, capacity is today versus where we were at the peak?
Floyd F. Sherman: I really don’t have any way of estimating that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Analyst for Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc.
Analyst for Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc.: My question is with the share gains. I was wondering if you could explain what was the driver of that? Was it more on the price side? I know you mentioned moving into commercial markets. Was that the main driver?
Floyd F. Sherman: The commercial market initiatives and the multifamily initiatives have certainly been a significant part of it. I would also say that we have been price aggressive. You can always argue whether it’s meeting market conditions or whether you are taking advantage of someone else’s position and trying to take business away. I think that we certainly have been aggressive in our pricing. Our multifamily and commercial endeavors continue to gain momentum. They are becoming a much more important part of our business. It’s a business that we had to learn. There are certain costs that you have to put in upfront but they now appear to be really working in our favor. We will be continuing to push this side of the business. I can just tell you that there are two projects that we’re currently providing materials for and also doing some labor on that exceed $5 million each in size, and a lot of smaller projects that range anywhere from several hundred thousand to the $5 million in size. We’re getting these projects throughout our market areas which we’re very pleased to see because that does give us a broader coverage and we’re not depending upon just one area for the business.
Analyst for Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc.: As a percent of the total, how big would you say this is as a percent of the total versus a couple quarters ago?
Floyd F. Sherman: Charles you correct me if I’m wrong, but I would say it’s now probably approaching 8% of our total business.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Wilson - JMP Securities.
James Wilson - JMP Securities: My main questions were on the competitive front that you already answered. The other thing is, with the major builders downsizing and I think in the process of probably already but certainly in the future gaining lots of market share, can you kind of describe how the relationship is working with the major builders since presumably you’re going to be one of the few suppliers still out there and the big builders are going to be gaining a lot of market share as small builders go under? How is that partnership working today? How can you benefit from it and are you already benefiting from it?
Floyd F. Sherman: We definitely are increasing our involvement with the national builders. That’s always been an extremely important part and a major piece of this company. As the competitors pull out of the markets or withdraw their presence or reduce their presence in the market, it definitely favors us and we are quick to take advantage of it and have been doing so. The market share gains that we had were a combination. Also we increased our business with the large national builders as well as we’re increasing our share of the custom home builder and the smaller builder. Certainly as the larger national builder takes on a greater percentage of each market place, where that occurs that fits in very well with our strategy and we respond to it very quickly.
Charles L. Horn: The only thing I’d add is we are well positioned with that group. About 50% of our revenues are to the Builder 100 group so we do think that will be beneficial for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.
Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: I wanted to follow on a little bit more with the stock in 84 closures you talked about. Are there any opportunities even in this down market to maybe step in where they’ve stepped away?
Floyd F. Sherman: It’s a little bit too early yet. I’ve seen the announcements. I haven’t necessarily seen the actions taking place in the market. We have not gotten nor have they put out a list of closures so I think there’s a lot of speculation in the market but that’s all there is right now. As soon as we see that and as soon as we see them either pulling out or reducing their presence in the market, we obviously are going to go after it. I think a strong selling point of our company is our financial stability and our ability to remain in those markets and provide a very competitive service oriented package to the customers. Once we get definitive lists or we see definitive closings, then we will address that in the markets where we overlap.
Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: I also wanted to talk a little bit about customers. If you look at the customer roles at your different facilities, have you all measured what percentage of those customers have dropped off from say the peak until now or is that some type of assessment you might do in the future?
Charles L. Horn: We have not done that at this point. We tend to monitor more year-over-year so I can’t really tell you exactly what it is. If I look at our Top 10 customers at the peak, our Top 10 customers were about 26% of our overall revenues and they’re now down to about 20% of our revenues. I think that’s more of an indication of the fact that they pulled back quicker. They responded to the excess inventory in the market far more quickly than what your custom and semi-custom builders did. Other than that we’ve really not drawn any conclusions.
Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: Are you hearing any reports from the field that private bankruptcies have picked up? And conversely, have you heard with all the executives who’ve been displaced from the larger builders of any new companies potentially trying to start up and get funding in this market?
Charles L. Horn: To your latter question, no. I’m not aware of anything to that effect. In terms of bankruptcies, closures, many of your small builders are suffering extremely at this point. Credit has been pulled back. Your smaller regional banks have quit funding them. So you are seeing quite a bit of them going under and filing bankruptcy.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Rob Hanson] - Deutsche Bank Securities.
[Rob Hanson] - Deutsche Bank Securities: You mentioned that 7% of your accounts receivable was greater than 60 days past due. I just wanted to see what’s a comparative figure for this during more normalized times?
Charles L. Horn: In normalized time it’s running 3.5% or 4%. So during good times it would be about 4% and at this point it’s about 7%. Again we really try to work it. I think at 7% we’re still one of the lowest in the industry if not the lowest in the industry. We try to keep our net 30-day terms where we can. And we do have very aggressive charge-off policies. We don’t let anything go beyond a year. Anything that hits the 90-day bucket is reserved at a 50% rate. Any company that files Chapter 7 or 11 we fully charge off at that point in time. So we’re trying to monitor it. We really just have two or three smaller accounts that really caused the blip in the percentage. We do think we can work through it. Were’ working to try and get collateral to support those receivables. But the smaller custom and semi-custom builder is an exposure we focus on and we try to minimize, but it will get worse before it gets better.
Floyd F. Sherman: I think another very important difference too with us is we apply our cash not to the oldest invoice. We apply cash to the invoice where it’s directed. If it’s not specifically directed, we hold it until the customer tells us where to apply it. Many people in this industry, their usual practice is to apply cash to the oldest invoice so what you see in days outstanding can very well be a misnomer.
[Rob Hanson] - Deutsche Bank Securities: I also wanted to see if you could walk us through your decision to exit the New Jersey market and based on that criteria what other markets might you exit in the near term?
Charles L. Horn: Obviously the exit in New Jersey was a very painful decision for us to make. It’s one we agonized quite a bit over. It was a situation where we’re looking to maintain cash flows as we’ve talked about before. We looked at the major operations that were losing money and then we sat back and said, “Three to five years down the road, what is the potential for this market?” New Jersey unfortunately was on the top of the list in meeting the criteria that we ranked them by. So we made the tough decision. We estimated it would save us over $5 million of cash flow next year in 2009. Again thinking five years down the road that the upside was not great, it was the right decision to make. In terms of the other small locations, there have been more end market consolidations or small locations that really didn’t make any money. In terms of any other major moves like New Jersey, that’s more of a distant decision. We’ll have to look and see how 2009 develops before we make any m ore tough calls. Again it’s not a case where you can go through and just start whacking off markets. That’s never a good thing to do. It has to be a very limited approach. It has to be very selective because you do want to keep your core business, you want to keep your core geographies and you want to make sure that you have a good viable company with a good strong footprint when a recovery comes.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Brian Tadale - Broadpoint Capital].
[Brian Tadale - Broadpoint Capital]: I wanted to go back to the liquidity front. Given your comments that you expect this to continue to mid-2010 and your $150 million you have of net liquidity at this point, what’s your comfort level that’s enough to get you through to that point?
Charles L. Horn: The way I look at it is if we have $155 million of liquidity, we have a tax refund coming next year anticipated to be around $35 million, so that puts us up around $190 million. We should get in a declining environment some working capital that will come out that will help offset any operating losses. We are taking plans like what we talked about in the press release where we closed locations. We have reduced our headcount which will benefit us by about $10 million going forward to next year. Then what we’ll do is as the market conditions develop if we see it getting worse, there are more actions we can try to take to minimize it. Candidly, we think conditions can get really tough before we have any issues in 2010. We do feel we have a good liquidity structure, actions we can take and we’re being very proactive in taking them to ensure that we keep the liquidity we need.
[Brian Tadale - Broadpoint Capital]: With regard to the borrowing base in the facility if you look at actually the reduction in liquidity versus the second quarter, it was more of a reduction in the base than it was actually a burning of cash. Do you have a sense of what a floor, I know it’s a tough market, but what a floor would be in terms of the size of the actual base that you could borrow against?
Charles L. Horn: Let me address your first point which is you’re right. The borrowing base did go down, and then too our advance rates go down from September through March. We have a seasonal advance rate that goes up during your peak months and down during your other months. So if you’re comparing sequential quarters, you’re also seeing that decline in advance rates. In terms of a floor it depends on where your sales volume goes in terms of your AR and your inventory, so I really wouldn’t know how to answer that.
[Brian Tadale - Broadpoint Capital]: Was there any magic to that $60 million number that you drew and was that an expectation of what you would need from peak working capital next year or just your logic on the $60 number?
Charles L. Horn: No. At the time we had about $85 million we could have borrowed under our borrowing base. We just chose to leave some cushion so we borrowed $60 million.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Starke - CRT Capital.
Kevin Starke - CRT Capital: On the borrowing base questions, there’s a little provision in there that talks about equipment availability. I wanted to know if that was available to you?
Charles L. Horn: We actually took advantage of that during the third quarter. It adds about $7 million to the borrowing base but it amortizes down on a monthly basis so it does add some. I think it added about $7 million to the borrowing base so it wasn’t a huge add.
Kevin Starke - CRT Capital: And it amortizes so that actually will reduce over time?
Charles L. Horn: That is correct.
Kevin Starke - CRT Capital: The letters of credit outstanding at the end of the quarter?
Charles L. Horn: Yes. That was about $16.6 million.
Kevin Starke - CRT Capital: The $4.4 million operating cash burn and the $1.1 million cap ex gets you to $5.5 million in basic burn. Do you think that’s a pretty good template for Builders FirstSource going forward on a quarterly basis?
Charles L. Horn: It’s going to depend on the level of housing starts. If the starts are somewhat equivalent to what they were in Q3, I think that’s a pretty good measure. But I think all of us as we said in our press release believe starts are going to go further down before they bottom and we see a recovery.
Kevin Starke - CRT Capital: Your borrowing base is roughly 55% or 60% of your total AR and inventories in any given time just eyeballing the numbers. Inventories and receivables are down to the tune of 30% year-on-year for the past several quarters. It makes me wonder why you would actually want to repay that $60 million and why wouldn’t you want to just hold on to that?
Charles L. Horn: We could. That could be an option we do. It’s just a matter of, do we want to carry the interest expense if we don’t need the borrowing? But it’s always a consideration we have and an alternative we do have.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Walter Brenton - Regiment Capital].
[Walter Brenton - Regiment Capital]: I just wanted to ask another question regarding the tax refunds. After getting that $35 million in 2009, do you still have an ability to carry back more in 2010 if you have losses in 2009 or do you bump up against the three-year limitation for carry-backs?
Charles L. Horn: Everything from that point forward will be carried forward. So we have no additional amounts to carry back.
[Walter Brenton - Regiment Capital]: You had said on the last call you could potentially do [60 to 70]. So that just means you don’t have the losses to support the [60 to 70]?
Charles L. Horn: Two things. The first point is correct. We won’t have the losses to support it. And second, I didn’t have the exact number in front of me so I’ve kind of refined that going into this call.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim McDowell - Group G Capital Partners.
Tim McDowell - Group G Capital Partners: Just one question on SG&A. I know on past calls you guys have discussed the fact that you are cutting into bone, muscle and that significant cuts would be possible. But you guys did a nice job in this quarter cutting down SG&A. If revenues were to go down and if that is in fact the case, how should we think about you guys being able to further make cuts to SG&A? Is it more of a step function related to the closing of various facilities or are there further measures that can be taken irrespective of the facility closures?
Charles L. Horn: I think obviously when you look at the salaries and benefits, we’ve done a very good job flexing there. I think that there’s more we can do if we have to to take that metric down. Obviously to reduce our fixed costs such as occupancy, that will require us to close additional locations. That is always an option we have even though we don’t have anything currently on the table aside from what we’ve already announced. Delivery costs, we’re trying to reduce the fleet, trying to pull back on lease expense within delivery costs. Obviously we’re hoping for a break in fuel costs which would give us some benefit as well. From a bad debt expense standpoint I think we’ll see it being fairly consistent at around $1.5 million per quarter. Not a great deal we can do there. So a longwinded way of saying there are obviously some costs we can take. Again the biggest cost expense we have is payroll and we can continue to address it. If we need to take further costs out, we’d have to look at our fixed costs which would be primarily closing locations.
Tim McDowell - Group G Capital Partners: Where would you say you guys stand I know historically the split has been kind of salaries have been 55% or 60% of overall SG&A fixed versus variable? Where does that stand today?
Charles L. Horn: In Q3 our payroll, salaries and benefits was still about 60% of our total SG&A. So it’s still a very meaningful number to us.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Ray Lamansky] - BB&T Capital Markets.
[Ray Lamansky] - BB&T Capital Markets: I have a question for you versus a comment you made before about saying it could be harder to maintain DSO going forward and also how that relates with charge-offs. It looks like you charged off about the same amount this quarter as you did last. Would you say that when you say it’s going to be harder to keep a lid on DSO, is it because let’s say the customers in your non-big builder component are having troubles paying and slower or that the larger players in the homebuilders are taking advantage of their position right now to try to improve their own cash flow a little bit more by paying more slowly?
Charles L. Horn: It’s more the smaller builders who are having their credit lines pulled away from them. We’re seeing some fairly large regional builders who are losing their credit lines. Once that happened they have to wait until they sell homes. Then they try to pay off their suppliers. I think the credit crisis we’re seeing that’s going on is really affecting your smaller builders. I can’t tell you that we’re seeing any issues with our top customers.
Operator: At this time there are no other questions holding. I’ll turn things back over to our speakers to provide some closing comments.
Floyd F. Sherman: Thank you for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Charles Horn.
Operator: Ladies and Gentlemen, again thank you very much for joining us. That will conclude today’s conference call. Have a good day.

Floyd Sherman: Thank you, Katie. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2008 earnings call. Joining me from our management team is Charles Horn, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. I will start with an overview of the second quarter. I will then turn the call over to Charles who will discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail. After my closing comments, regarding our outlook, we will take your questions. Although, national housing starts climbed back above the 1 million mark in June, single family housing starts, the biggest driver of our business, fell from the first quarter of 2008. Single family housing starts in June 2008 were 613,000 units compared to 621,000 units in March of 2008. Year-over-year, we estimate that the housing starts in our market declined 41.3%. As we continue to see declines on housing starts, our markets are becoming even more competitive. We experienced intense pricing pressure during the quarter which was reflected in our gross margin. Our margins declined to 21.6% from 25.1% in the year-ago quarter. We expect continued pressure on our margins as these difficult conditions persist. In response to these challenging conditions, we continue to focus on reducing operating costs, improving operating efficiencies, and growing market share to offset the portion of the negative economic drivers that affect our industry. Through a combination of expanding our customer base and outstanding service to our current customers, we successfully grew our market share by 8.2% for the current quarter compared to the second quarter of 2007. We were also able to reduce our salary and benefits within SG&A by $13.9 million or almost 23%. When compared to our sales volume decline of 32.5%, this reduction in salaries and benefits was 70% variable to our sales volume decline as we continue to increase employee efficiency. Although small victories, they are victories just the same, in very difficult economic conditions. I will now turn the call over to Charles who will review the financial results in more detail.
Charles Horn: Good morning, everyone. We reported sales of $307.3 million in the second quarter of 2008 , a decrease of 33.9% compared to $465.1 million for the same 2007 period. Breaking down our sales by sales driver for the quarter, first we estimate that housing starts within our markets declined approximately 43% compared to the same period in 2007. Again, I will remind you, what we do is we'll lag permits within our markets for one month to an assumed start. Second, lower market prices on lumber and lumber sheet goods had less than a 1% impact on our sales for the second quarter. So again, a very nominal impact. Third, market share gains contributed about 8 percentage points to our sales. And lastly, new operations added almost 2% that being two acquisitions we completed late in 2007. If we further break it down on sales by product category, prefabricated components declined 40.9% from the second quarter of 2007, due to a combination of lower prices and lower volume and declined to 19.5% of total sales for the quarter. Windows and doors were down 29.6% and they represented 24.1% of our total second quarter sales, up from 22.6% last year. Lumber and lumber sheet goods, our base commodity products, declined 39.5% to $76.2 million and fell to 24.8% of sales from 27.1% of total sales in the year-ago quarter. We estimate that $43 million of the decrease is due to lower volume and $6.7 million due to lower prices. Millwork declines 24.7% and now represents 10.6% of sales, up from 9.2% last year. Finally, other building products and services decreased 27.8% and represents 21% of sales, up from 19.3% in the second quarter of 2007. Certain product mix shift that you see here over the last several quarters have been driven by the dynamic that more homes were completed than started. That trend narrowed during the second quarter of 2008 and will likely abate during the second half of this year. Accordingly, we would expect future sales declines if any to be more equalized among the broad product categories. Gross margins. The $50.4 million decline in gross margins was across all our product categories. Our margin percentage was 21.6% from the second quarter of 2008, compared to 25.1% in the second quarter of 2007. We experienced gross margin compression on all of our major product categories, the most significant in our manufactured products in commodity lumber and panel products. The deleveraging of our lower sales volumes to fix cost embedded within our cost of sales, lowered our gross margins by approximately 120 basis points. Gross margins on lumber and lumber sheet goods fell 2.4%, as it is a category with fewer varieties to competition or entry. In addition, market prices for lumber and lumber sheet goods increased on average approximately 12% from Q1 2008. And we were largely unsuccessful in passing these price increases through to our customers. Our selling general administrative expenses were $80.8 million, down $18.7 million from the second quarter of 2007. We reduced our salaries and benefits by almost 23% from last year on a sales and volume decline of 32.5% or about 70% variable. We reduced our full-time equivalent head count by 22% from the second quarter of '07. Although, we continue to look for operating efficiencies, we are nearing a core level of staffing in a number of locations. So, similar percentage reductions in full-time equivalent head count will be difficult for us to achieve in future quarters, should housing activity continue to fall. From the second quarter of 2007, we were also able to reduce our office SG&A expense by almost $3.5 million or 29.5%, and delivery costs by almost $2.1 million or 11.8%. Delivery costs did not decline commensurate with sales volumes, primarily due to higher fuel costs. Our fuel costs increased due to higher diesel prices and longer delivery distances as we endeavor to expand our customer base. Our occupancy expense was higher than in the first quarter of 2007, because of the two acquisitions completed finished late in 2008. Additionally, our bad debt expense and other customer write-offs increased $1.3million year-over-year, a result of a continued decline in economic conditions and its affect on our smaller customers. During the quarter, we recorded asset impairment charges totaling $14.2 million or $0.24 per share related to certain of our markets. The impairment charges are the result of the continued decline in economic conditions in these markets, and its affects on these markets current operating performance and our long-term expectations. Included in the asset impairment charges is $7.5 million of goodwill, $4.4 million of other intangible assets and $2.3 million of fixed assets. We will continue to assess the value of our reporting units. And further declines, if any, in housing activity could necessitate further impairments in 2008 and going forward. Our interest expense was $6.3 million for the second quarter, down about $300,000 from the year-ago timeframe. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower debt balance from June of 2007, as we paid off a $40 million term note in the fourth quarter of last year, as well as lower interest rates for the quarter. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in interest income, due to lower average cash balances and an increase in commitment fees related to our new revolving credit facility entered into in November of 2007. During the second quarter, we recorded an after tax valuation allowance of $24.1 million or $0.68 per share on substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The continued deterioration in our macroeconomic conditions that affect our industry, as well as specific financial and non financial factors that arose during the second quarter of 2008, drove the need for this valuation allowance. Our net loss for the second quarter was $45.9 million or $1.29 per diluted share, compared to net income of $8.4 million or $0.23 per diluted share in the same period last year. Excluding the asset impairment charges and the tax valuation allowance, our net loss per share was $0.37. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2008 was a negative $7 million compared to $25.3 million in the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of sales, decreased to a negative 2.3%, compared to 5.4% for the second quarter of last year. Maintaining a healthy balance sheet is critical in a prolonged difficult operating environment. We are proud of the fact that our balance sheet has remained healthy after nine straight quarters of declining housing starts. At the end of June, we had $75.2 million on cash on hand. And when combined with $137.6 million in available borrowing capacity, we had over $213 million in liquidity. We still believe, we are well-positioned to weather the current housing downturn. We used cash and operating activities during the quarter of $2.9 million due to our net operating loss which we were not able to completely offset with reductions in working capital. We did receive $6.8 million in income tax refunds during the second quarter. And we anticipate receiving $7 million to $9 million of additional tax refunds in the second half of 2008. Our operating cash flow did improve from the first quarter of 2008, as we improved our day sales outstanding and increased our inventory turns. Our inventory turns increased to 9.7 times, compared to 8.8 times in the first quarter of 2008. Our day-sales-outstanding lowered to 38 days from 40 days in the first quarter of 2008. In the current environment, we believe it is important to stay on top of our accounts receivable aging and we feel that we have managed our accounts receivable very prudently. At June 2008, only 5% of our accounts receivable portfolio was greater than 60 days past due. We previously anticipated that we would be able to make breakeven free cash flow for 2008, but the continued downward pressure on our gross margins makes this unlikely. We did however make improvement during the quarter as our cash use fell to only $6.6 million, compared to $15.7 million in Q1, 2008. I will now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd Sherman: Although, we cannot predict how long this downturn will last, we generally expect these difficult operating conditions to at least continue through 2008 and 2009. We will continue to provide updated housing permit and commodity price data on our website each month to help guide you through the market uncertainties. This data is summarized and based on publicly available information. This quarter was yet another difficult quarter with a prolonged downturn. It is easy to continue to focus on the negatives, declining sales, margin compression, declining EBITDA, but we are looking at this downturn as a challenge to help us identify ways to make Builders FirstSource a better and stronger company. In the past, we have pointed out our ability to cut costs and increase our operating efficiency, as well as our continued focus on working capital and liquidity. But we have also been working on initiatives to off set our declining sales. Some of the success of these initiatives was evident in the quarter in our estimated market share growth of 8.2%. Two of the main initiatives that we have been working on to offset our declining sales is building customer relationships and diversifying our customer base. We believe building customer relationships through superior customer service and offering value-added solutions will help us to build customer loyalty in these difficult economic times. One example is in the -- to help us build customer loyalty is in the last half of 2008, we will be certifying our sales force through a web-based training program and best practices on green products and practices. So, our sales force will be able to offer our builder customers, green building solutions. We will be one of the first companies in our industry to certify our entire sales force in green building solutions. We have also focused on diversifying our customer base through cultivating relationships with custom builders and markets that we previously sold predominantly to national builders, expanding our delivery area in certain parts of our markets and expanding our presence in multi family and light commercial, in which we have over $25 million in projects awarded that are slated to begin in the third and fourth quarter of 2008. To mitigate some of the downward pressures that the competitive pricing environment is putting on our gross margins, we will continue to focus on our value-added as well as increase our manufacturing volume. Additionally, we will continue to focus our efforts on identifying initiatives to offset declining sales, reducing head count, driving operational improvements, and rationalized physical capacity and restructure underperforming locations. We will strive to maintain our market leadership and financial strength during this downturn. We rely on our employees to successfully employ this strategy. Their commitment to Builders FirstSource and their innovativeness has helped us to weather the downturn to-date, and we are counting on them to help us to continue to successfully employ our strategy through the remainder of the downturn. I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Sherman. (Operator Instructions) Our first question of the morning will go to Michael Rehaut at JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Jen Consoli - JPMorgan: Good morning. This is Jen Consoli on the line for Mike. How are you?
Charles Horn: Great, how are you Jennifer?
Floyd Sherman: Fine.
Jen Consoli - JPMorgan: Good. My question is regarding the share gains. They accelerated nicely versus last quarter -- versus the last couple of quarters. How much of that is due to the fact that you were unable to pass through the lumber and the fuel cost increases? My question is what are your competitors doing and how are you going to balance the two going forward?
Charles Horn: I think pricing was an element to it in the fact that we did have some pricing already set. We were somewhat aggressive in trying to maintain key customers during the quarter. I think the second piece of it though is where we've diversified and branched out into more multi family markets like commercial markets, trying to expand beyond just traditional single family. I think that's part of what you are seeing in the market share and gain number.
Jen Consoli - JPMorgan: Okay. So, this higher level of share gains, is that something we can expect going forward? Or do you think as you try to get some of the price back, that that will drop back down maybe to the 4% to 5% range?
Floyd Sherman: I think the -- as we work to push our margins up, it will affect our market share gains to a certain extent. We certainly will do everything possible to hold and continue building market share gains to the degree that we have, but it is going to be a lot tougher. There is no question in the second quarter, we did ease off somewhat and become more responsive to the pricing demands that our customers were placing on us. It definitely pushed more volume through, but now we have to start tightening up and see if we can't start moving the margins up.
Jen Consoli - JPMorgan: Okay. Great. And then on the -- as far as your footprint, are you looking at any particular markets more closely in terms of maybe moth-balling or exiting? What is the strategy there as well?
Charles Horn: I think we are looking at moth-balling some facilities and we would be looking at areas. Such as if you look at the Midwest and if you look some in Florida where housing continues correct far more than the national average, I think that's where you will see us look to see if there is further cost we can take out on our moth-balling facilities.
Jen Consoli - JPMorgan: Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator: And we will go next to of Nishu Soon, I believe it is the Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Charles Horn: Good morning.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: I wanted to ask about the $1.3 million in bad debt expense. Charles, is that the write-off numbers that we are seeing which would be against the provision or is that the provisioning number?
Charles Horn: It works hand in hand. What we did during the quarter is we wrote off directly against the reserve, close to $1.2 million for accounts that have either filed Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 or we now deem uncollectible. What we then do is we'll look at our aging buckets. And we do a run rate on each bucket in terms of how much provision we need. And so it works hand in hand. We did do a big charge off $1.2 million against the provision. Then we evaluated the in revised AR aging, in terms of how much allowance we needed to cover it.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: And in terms of the allowances, those have been falling the last couple of quarters in absolute terms as well as a percentage of our trade receivables. Given that so many of your clients are facing severe distress and many are filing bankruptcy, shouldn't that number be headed the other direction?
Charles Horn: Let's address that. If you go back to December of 2007, our allowance was 5.4% of our trade AR. This quarter it is 4.5% of our trade AR. But again, keeping in mind that we wrote-off a direct write-off of $1.2 million. That would normalize to 5.3%. It would be 5.3% apples-to-apples versus 5.4%. Now, the other dynamic we have to keep in mind is how old is our portfolio. As of December 2007, over 7% of our portfolio was over 60 days. We now drop that to about 5% of our AR portfolio, greater than 60 days past due. So that improvement in the currency, plus the fact that you have to normalize that direct write off, it keeps it apples-to-apples. And part of the improvements are the need for no further increases, due to fact that we're collecting our money more current and we have less old money sitting out there.
Floyd Sherman: And traditionally, even under good times, that number was 3% to 3.5%. So, we are getting down to close to where we were under normal business conditions.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Got it. So, you are taking the age level of the -- how old basically the receivables are, as a the best indicator of distress among your customers.
Floyd Sherman: That's correct. 
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then my second question, I wanted to ask was you are going to get $7 million to $10 million in tax refunds in the second half of the year. Once you get those, will you have used up your claw back for the 2006 fiscal year? And also related to that, is there any cash tax positive payment that you can claw back from 2007? Or will we be pretty much done with that as a source of cash flow?
Charles Horn: No. The receivables you see here relate to over payments we made in 2007. You know how you have to estimate it in the beginning of the year and make payments, plus losses in 2007 that we carry back to 2005. Current period losses that you also see coming into the income tax receivable number, we will carry back to ' 06 where we had ample taxable income that we paid taxes on. And that will probably be done in May, June of 2009 before we do that. So, the incremental $7 million to $10 million you see coming in relates purely to 2007. And then any loss we generate in 2008, we will be able to carry back to '06 and get that money in mid 2009.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: About how much, I guess, what I'm trying to get a sense of how -- in terms if you could quantify, how much recovery you have left overall.
Charles Horn: I would say it is going to be somewhere in the area of $60 million to $70 million potential that we can carry back to ' 06.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Got it. If I can sneak one last one in. The CapEx was $5.2 million this quarter. I wanted to get your sense -- or get some details as to why that's increased?
Charles Horn: It really was a decision that Floyd and I made to try to buy off some of our rolling stock off of lease and then try to sell the equipment out in the open markets at what we feel is close to what our buy outs were. To try to reduce the fixed cost structure we have on our P&L. So, what you see is -- you also see proceeds from sales of property and planned equipment increasing. We will continue to try to sell that equipment to get the money back. It wasn't CapEx we were making to try to expand the business or maintenance CapEx. It was purely we were buying off leases and trying to sell the equipment, so we expect to get that money back in the later half of the year.
Floyd Sherman: The lease buy outs were approximately $4.1 million.
Charles Horn: Correct.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Michael Cox at Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: Thank you very much for taking my questions. My first is on the sequential increase for the second quarter in terms of the sales. It was a little better than last year's Q1 to Q2. Anything to read into here?
Charles Horn: No. If you look at it, it pretty much grew parallel with what the starts increased in Q2 versus Q1. It is sequenced just based upon an increase in starts.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Looking at the gross margin, the gross margins come in from the peak range of the mid-26% range and now into the mid-21%. Is there a way to look at where you feel that this could floor at some point? Maybe in drawing on some of your historical experiences in this industry, a reasonable expectation there?
Charles Horn: It is a very difficult question. It is hard to know how quickly capacity is going to shake out of the markets we compete, and take some of the pricing pressure off of us and maybe a few other key competitors. That is taking place. It is not taking place as quickly as we would like to see. But I think over the next six months, you could see more capacity drop and that could take some of the pressure off. Then if we look at it in on a sequential quarter basis, in the first quarter we were at 22.5% margins, dropping to 21.6%. If you look at that sequential change, it was all in distributed products not manufactured, and predominately was due to the commodity lumber products where we experienced increases in raw material or purchase costs, but we couldn't pass it through. That was probably about 60 basis points. So, I think that did put some pressure on the quarter that was more driven by the fact that we had a duration difference between our pricing to customers and then, how long we were carrying the inventory levels. Long-winded way of saying, some of these decreases this quarter was just due to the market change. Some of that could come back, but conversely to really get it back to a higher level, we need capacity to drop out of the markets. Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray Okay. That's very helpful. In terms of the asset impairment, the impairment that was taken this quarter, is it in the same markets that it had been taken in the past? Is there any way to quantify how much left there could be to impair in those markets if that was the case?
Charles Horn: One of them relates to a previous market which is up in the upper Midwest. There we have taken all the fixed asset impairments and goodwill impairments left. The newcomer in terms of the impairments is Florida, which hit this quarter where we impaired some intangibles lists, customer intangibles as well as some goodwill. Really, I don't expect a huge amount to come there, just for the fact that Florida is already down over 60% from where it was. That is a market that adjusted fast. If the market continues to get worse, there could be more but at this point we don't anticipate it. But to your other question, there is still a substantial amount of goodwill sitting on that reporting unit. Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question goes to Keith Hughes of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Go ahead.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Thank you. You talked a lot about your liquidity on the call. Just wondering if the Board has considered or would consider some type of equity raise in the future to get you off the defensive and onto the offensive at some point in the future when it is appropriate to do that?
Charles Horn: I think Keith that would have to be more event driven, some compelling acquisition, something that would necessitate the use of the funds. Again with the ABO we have in place, there are no affirmative covenants. We are not worried about our EBITDA levels. We're not worried about our funded debt levels, as much as we are worried about how much our availability is. How much cash do we have on hand and what is the collateral base supporting the ABL. So, I don't believe there is a compelling reason for them to go out and raise equity or do a writes offering, absent some need for the funds or the liquidity.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. And within the -- you talked about SG&A, cutting it to the bone here. Have you exited any geographies yet? Is that something that could be on the table in 2009 given your view of the market?
Floyd Sherman: We have really not exited any of our major markets to-date, Keith. We have consolidated within some of the markets and we are still servicing those markets from -- out of fewer locations. If we continue to see the pattern of the decreasing housing starts continue on into 2009, yes, there could be some markets that we will exit from. But it will be done with a lot of careful consideration, because once you exit a market, very, very difficult to go back in. Very expensive to try to restart your position in the markets. That will be reviewed carefully. If we deem that in our long-term best interest that that market is not critical and the risks of continued losses in the market far outweigh what our potential gain is, then that decision will be made.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Trey Grooms at Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.: Good morning. With the jump up in CapEx in the quarter with the lease buy outs, is there any further lease buy outs that you guys are looking at? Is that all done? With that, what is your CapEx goals for the year now? For ' 08?
Charles Horn: I would say, Trey, that's largely done. We're going to try to monetize that equipment, sell it, and get cash proceeds in. I would say for the remainder of the year, we are looking no more at $3 million to $4 million maximum in terms of CapEx.
Floyd Sherman: Our CapEx will only be on an emergency basis and for something that -- where the returns are just so overwhelming that it dictates that you go ahead. But don't anticipate much in that area.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.: Okay. And then, you guys said that you are down to pretty close to core levels of staffing at most of your facilities. You were able to flex salaries and benefits about 70% with sales falling off. Looking out for the rest of the year since you are getting closer to core levels, what level of flexibility do you still have here?
Charles Horn: There is some. There is probably the potential -- take it more in absolute terms, 200 to 300 people that we can do on maybe a 10% further decline in housing levels. Again you run into -- and it goes back to an earlier question. The best way to take additional head count out is to moth-ball facilities. Those two decisions go hand in hand. What we know is from a structure standpoint, we are in a very good position in that we have fewer facilities than most of our competitors. Therefore, we have fewer fixed costs. You still have to have a manager and dispatcher and so forth within each location. In terms of just flexing at the location, taking out some admin, some ability to do so but it will be more driven by moth-balling facilities.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, the improvement that we saw in inventory turns and DSOs, are those levels of inventory turns and DSOs, are those sustainable as you look out into the rest of ' 08?
Floyd Sherman: I think they are sustainable and personally believe that we can improve slightly on our inventory turns. Any time when you are down at this level or the lower volume of operations, inventory management becomes a tougher and tougher problem. But like anything, you can continue to fine tune. You continue to tweak. The overall, what the management oversight of inventory, making those proper decisions. I think there is still some improvement to go.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.: Okay. And then, just one final question. If you look out at the different regions that you guys operate in, is there any that you saw in the quarter and what you've seen thus far in expectations for this quarter, are there any regions that are looking or performing better than you expected? Or better than the rest of the group from a demand standpoint?
Floyd Sherman: I would say the some of our South Carolina markets, they are doing, Charlotte included within that group, looking better than our markets. We seem to be stabilizing in the mid-Atlantic areas. But overall, it is still a very tough situation. There was not a single market that had a positive growth in it as compared to last year.
Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc.: Okay. Thank you guys very much.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jay McCanless at FTN Midwest. Please go ahead.
Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest: Good morning. Just wanted to find out what lumber prices have done since the end of the quarter?
Floyd Sherman: Plumber prices have just moved up very slightly. The lumber manufacturers are trying their best to keep and push prices up. We are finding in many cases their responses -- they have no product to sell. But when you look into the inventories that are being held at mill level, you obviously see that they have a growing inventory situation on their hands. We would like to see higher lumber prices, but I don't think right now under current conditions that it is going to be sustainable to -- at the levels where we are now. Could see a slight decrease, but it's pretty static as -- over the last few weeks. During the quarter, we had an unusual spike. We paid the price on it. There was a very significant jump. We are talking better than 20% over a four-week period. When you are trying to really manage your inventory and spin your inventory, it caught us as Charles indicated. But right now, the prices have come back down. I think that's what we are going to see for the next month or so.
Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest: Okay. And then following on that. With the dislocation in the market, I just wanted to check about segment profitability. Is prefab components still the most profitable? How would you rank the profitability of the different market segments now?
Charles Horn: In terms of ranking, I wouldn't put prefab or obviously lumber and lumber sheet goods at the top of it. If you look at the areas that gross margins have held in the basket, it's still going to be in your windows and doors, millwork and your other products and services. Part of the reason your manufactured product is down, is we have a lot of excess physical capacity. Our utilization in our plants is around 55%. When you seeing on that level of overhead, it makes profitability a little bit more difficult. Obviously, with pricing for commodity products, your lumber and panels that's out trading very much close to variable cost out in the markets. If I had to sort them at this point in the game, I would say windows and doors, millwork, other products and services, manufactured, and then commodity.
Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest: Okay. All right, thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Robert Manowitz at RBS.
Robert Manowitz - RBS: Hi, good morning. 
Charles Horn: Hi Rob.
Robert Manowitz - RBS: As I look at your accounts payable, the number of days did increase sequentially. But year-over-year, it is actually retreated a little bit by my accounts. Maybe the acquisitions in late '07 might influence that a little bit. Should we read into that anything? Is anything going on in terms of the extension of credit with you guys? Or are people pretty comfortable with your access to your ABL?
Charles Horn: At this point, we've really had no issues with these suppliers in terms of their comfort level or trying pulling back on our terms. Our terms are very equivalent to what we had last year. It was around 30.8 for the quarter versus slightly over 31 last year. Some of that just gets into timing. It's when we (inaudible) and it then flips to an accrued liability. In terms of terms, we are very comfortable that they are going to hold static or maybe increase a little bit. We are really not feeling any pressure at this juncture.
Robert Manowitz - RBS: Great. And if you could help me better understand your comments earlier on the potential for a tax refund in '09. You gave us $60 million to $70 million number.
Charles Horn: Yes.
Robert Manowitz - RBS: Are you saying that if you were to post negative pretax income in 2008 of $150 million or so, not that that's our expectation, the maximum amount that you can collect in a refund then would be roughly 38% of that? So kind of $60 million to $70 million? Did I think about it the right way?
Charles Horn: Yes.
Robert Manowitz - RBS: Okay.
Charles Horn: Obviously there is a threshold where if the net operating losses get over a certain amount, it would not be carried back to 2006. It would then be a carry forward.
Robert Manowitz - RBS: Right. And that threshold is that $60 million to $70 million that could be looked back to. Is that right?
Charles Horn: Yes. At this point, I do not anticipate our net operating losses for the year will exceed our ability to carry back.
Robert Manowitz - RBS: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question goes to Kyle O'Meara at Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Dave Manthey - Robert W. Baird: Hi. It is Dave Manthey at Baird. I was wondering, if you can talk about the diversification into multi family. Is part of the lower margins as a result of moving into new markets and having a low price to try to make in roads? Then if you could also just discuss the core single family market. I assume that you are making positive share gains and your margins were weaker in the core single family business as well. If you could just talk about the impact of the diversification effort.
Floyd Sherman: Yes. Definitely the move into multi family, light commercial does have a downward affect on your margins. A lot of that is due, Dave, to you put in a lot of advanced costs into estimating, bidding those projects and that is typically far in excess time-wise of what you have on repeat single family business. And so, you have a lot of up front costs that are incurred in that business. And typically, you are bidding against multi people, competing for that business. And so, it definitely affected the margins. I can't sit here and tell you exactly how much it did, but I can see it in our design and engineering costs. That part of the explanation.
Dave Manthey - Robert W. Baird: But in your core single family business, you still had significant share gains and you saw some margin degradation there as well, right?
Floyd Sherman: Yes, correct.
Dave Manthey - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then definitionally in terms of -- Charles, you talked about moth-balling facilities. Floyd, you were mentioning earlier about exiting a market, I am just wondering are those the same thing or is moth-balling the first step and exiting the next step?
Charles Horn: The moth ball is where you shut down the plants, but you keep the facility. You take out the people, so you are taking out fixed costs associated with personnel. The facility is still there. You continue to pay the rent. You are not trying to sublet it. You are going to hold onto it until you see a market recovery. When you exit a market, you pretty…
Floyd Sherman: Let me add, the other point is that you may moth-ball facility, but then you continue servicing that market out of other facilities that can do it on a lower cost basis. You are still selling in that market. You still have a presence in that market. You just may not be utilizing one of the facilities to produce a product or distribute the product from it.
Charles Horn: When you exit a market, you are actually leaving the market. You do not have any other facilities that can ship into the market. You are now closing your facilities. You are trying to sublet them or sell them if you own the facility. You are trying to monetize your working capital. And at that point, you are not trying to engage or shift into the market from anywhere else.
Dave Manthey - Robert W. Baird: Are these just production facilities or are they distribution facilities also?
Charles Horn: It can be a combination of both.
Dave Manthey - Robert W. Baird: Okay. All right, thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Walter Branson at Regiment Capital. Please go ahead.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital: Thank you. I have a couple things. You said that you are withdrawing your guidance for breakeven free cash flow for the year. Obviously, you are a ways off of that for the first half. At this point, what is your outlook for free cash flow in the second haft of the year?
Charles Horn: What I think is that you will see -- and again, this is just a broad range, anywhere from 15 to 25 of negative cash flow for the second half of the year. That will be very dependent upon start levels if it stays stable versus decline and obviously gross margin levels.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital: And is that negative 15 to 25 include the benefit of the tax refund?
Charles Horn: Yes.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital: And within that, I mean, so is working capital likely to be a use of cash in the second half as well?
Charles Horn: No, it depends, if things static -- starts stay static, then it would be flat. If starts go down, you will see it as a provider of cash.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital: Okay. Previously, you have expressed a keen interest in making acquisitions once you think the market has bottomed out. Does that remain the case? Or have you changed you viewpoint on that?
Charles Horn: No, I think we are still very focused on it. If a deal is available that we can make sense from a structural standpoint, liquidity, the financing markets would bear it. And then the last point would be whether long-term it really gives us opportunities to extract synergies and future value creation. What we don't want to do is just chase any deal. There is a number of small deals out in the market right now which we could do, but may not make any sense long-term in terms of value creation. It would really have to be something that makes a great deal of sense, a compelling acquisition for us to do it.
Floyd Sherman: If we look at a potential situation that may arise within a market where we are currently operating -- for us to be interested in it, we would really have to really be able to see that we could take capacity out of that market and retain the sales and so forth. But we are not going to just buy up facilities and not be able to take capacity out of the market. Because right now, capacity is one of the key issues that are affecting our business.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital: Okay. It sounds like -- tell me if I'm wrong, it sounds like I'm hearing a little bit of different change in the nuance of you are saying. Because I thought previously, you were very interested in buying things cheap when the market had bottomed. I think you said it was number two for use of cash, besides protecting the existing business. Have you changed at all?
Charles Horn: No. That is still right. It would still be number two, but again liquidity is still the key. The first part is now probably a little more on our minds, that's why we would be less active in terms of acquisitions.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital: Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: And we'll go next to [Nitin Dihialipitus] at Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.
Nitin Dihialipitus - Lehman Brothers: Thank you. Charles, did I hear you right that you said 15 to 25 negative FCS just in the second half. Or is that for the year?
Charles Horn: That would be for the second half. That's an estimate on our part that starts could fall some in the second half of this year and that the trends from a run rate standpoint on our gross margin stays where it is.
Nitin Dihialipitus - Lehman Brothers: That it's continue to decline some?
Charles Horn: Yes.
Nitin Dihialipitus - Lehman Brothers: I see. You mentioned that a lot of your business is getting to a core staffing level. What does that equate to in terms of starts number that core staff level can support, if you like?
Charles Horn: The staff level goal versus what Nitin?
Nitin Dihialipitus - Lehman Brothers: Versus basically what's the starts number? And on the core level does that equate towards a 1.2 million starts number, total starts. Or does that equate to 1 million total starts number?
Charles Horn: We look at the single family start level right now which fully equipped, right around 670 annualized. We would be looking at the single family size, because that's still where we are more exposed as a company. And that's what we would tie it to. But again, facility is your key driver of your staffing which we have an advantage having fewer facilities. But again, should starts fall further, it still means you have too much capacity in the markets and you have to moth-ball to really get the variable costs up, and in your fixed costs in terms of head count. So, the point is if we keep our facility open, you will still going to have your core infrastructure which would be your manager, your dispatcher, your credit personnel. And you will still going to have some delivery and some variable cost in your warehousing.
Nitin Dihialipitus - Lehman Brothers: I understand. Okay. So it is not as much how many starts can they support, it is how many facilities can this core level support?
Charles Horn: I think that's the bigger issue. Yes.
Nitin Dihialipitus - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Fair enough. And in terms of lumber, you mentioned that there is a 12% increase in the second quarter. In terms of timing, have you been able to take some of that pricing in the third quarter or is that 60 basis point margin and almost permanent?
Charles Horn: If you looked at what happened is the run up took place over a four or five-week timeframe in Q1, which is when we were procuring. By the end of the quarter, it was already dropping back. So, at the point we're in negotiating with customers who had already pulled in some. So, we experienced the intra-quarter detriment but didn't really have the higher price to pass on beginning of the second quarter. Again, if you remember, many big customers will want to price a commodity product for a quarterly basis at the very beginning of the quarter. And so, they will look at random links at that point in time and that will be the key determinant of the pricing. Where we got hurt is that the price ran up intra-quarter, and then fell back down by the time we had re-set opportunities with our customers.
Nitin Dihialipitus - Lehman Brothers: So, if you don't expect to occur -- then shouldn't that actually in some sense come back to your gross margin?
Charles Horn: Yes.
Nitin Dihialipitus - Lehman Brothers: I see. Okay. So, you are already factoring that into your guidance?
Charles Horn: We are definitely considering that, yes.
Nitin Dihialipitus - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Great, thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will go to [Kenneth Blue Shlemmel] at Wolf Point Capital. Please go ahead.
Kenneth Blue Shlemmel - Wolf Point Capital: Two questions. What do you expect asset sales to be in the second half of the year with the lease buy outs you did and now you will sell those assets and any other assets?
Charles Horn: It would be less than $1.5 million.
Kenneth Blue Shlemmel - Wolf Point Capital: Just $1.5 million? And then back to the tax refund question one more time. Is $60 million to $70 million the maximum or is that what you expect to get back, based on current trends and forecast?
Charles Horn: That would be the maximum.
Kenneth Blue Shlemmel - Wolf Point Capital: What is your best guess, based on where we are today in terms of what your outlook is for losses this year? What do you think the expected tax refund might look like?
Charles Horn: Hard to say, but I do not think we will exceed that amount, but I think we will be pretty close to it.
Kenneth Blue Shlemmel - Wolf Point Capital: Well, that is probably close to the expected amount?
Charles Horn: I think we'll be somewhat close to the expected amount. Yes.
Kenneth Blue Shlemmel - Wolf Point Capital: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Tim McDowell at Group G Capital. Please go ahead.
Tim McDowell - Group G Capital: My questions have all been addressed. Thanks.
Operator: And gentlemen, we have no other questions remaining in the queue. So, I would like to turn it back to you for any closing comments.
Floyd Sherman: There are no other comments from us. We really appreciate you joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Charles.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the call. We do appreciate your participation. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.

Floyd Sherman : Thank you Katie. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2008 earnings call. Joining me from our management team is Charles Horn, Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. I will start with a note review of the first quarter. I will then turn the call over to Charles who will discuss our first quarter financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook we will take your questions.  The macro economic conditions that affect our industry have deteriorated for eight consecutive quarters. From the peak in March 2006 housing starts in our markets are down 48%. In the quarter, housing starts were down 39.1% compared to the first quarter of 2007. We are having a difficult time maintaining margins as pricing become more competitive as conditions continue to deteriorate. We are also seeing a decrease in fixed cost absorption as our manufacturing facilities are below optimal utilization. As a result of these pricing pressures and deleveraging of fixed cost we experienced a 310 basis point decline in margins.  Despite these challenges we grew market share by 4.1% in the quarter, had incremental sales from new operations of 1.5% and reduced salaries and benefit expense including stock compensation by 22.3% and selling, general and administrative expenses by 18.4%.  I will now turn the call over to Charles who will review the financial results in more detail. 
Charles Horn : Thank you Floyd, good morning everyone. We reported sales of $270.5 million in the first quarter of 2008, a decrease of 34.2% compared to $411.1 million of the same 2007 period. Breaking down our sales drivers for the quarter compared to the year ago quarter, first we estimate that housing starts within our markets declined approximately 39% compared to the same period in 2007. We lag permits within our markets one month to an assumed start.  Second, lower price in our lumbar and lumbar sheet goods had a minimal impact on our sales during the quarter. Third, conversely market share gains contributed approximately four percentage points to our sales and new operations added an estimated 1.5%. We felt the pricing pressure and the negative impact to decrease housing starts across all of our product categories.  Breaking down our product categories prefabricated components declined 36% from the first quarter of 2007 due to a combination of lower prices and lower volumes and also declined 19.9% of total sales for the quarter. Windows and doors were down 26.3% and represented 25.2% of total first quarter sales up from 22.5% last year. Lumbar and lumbar sheet goods declined 43.7% to $64.5 million and fell to 23.9% of sales from 27.9% of total sales in the year ago quarter. We estimate that $44.5 million of the decrease is due to lower volume and $5.6 million due to lower prices.  Millwork declined 27% and represented 10.6% of sales up from 9.5% last year. Finally other building products and services decreased 31.3% and represented 20.4% of sales up from 19.6% in the first quarter of 2007.  Turning to gross margins, the $44.2 million decline in gross margins with across all our product categories. Our gross margin percentage was 22.3% in the first quarter of 2008 compared to 25.4% for the first quarter of 2007. Of the 310 basis point decline, approximately 157 basis points is attributable to the de-leveraging of our lower sales volumes against our fixed over ahead within cost of goods sold. The balance of the decline is primarily related to lower pricing on all products. As market conditions continue to create increased competitive pressure we expect further pressure on our gross margins.  Our selling, general and administrative expenses were $79.6 million, down $17.9 million from the first quarter of 2007 and down $5.8 million on a sequential quarter basis. We continue to manage our operating cost structure well. Excluding stock compensation expense we reduced our salaries and benefits by almost 24% from Q1 2007 on a sales volume decline of 32.8% or about 73% variable. We reduced our full time equivalent headcount by almost 40% from the peak in March 2006 and 23.6% from the first quarter of 2007.  At this point we are beginning to reach a core level of staffing given the number of locations and operations we have. From the first quarter 2007 we were able to reduce our professional fees by over $1.5 million and delivery costs by about $1 million; however the percentage of sales and delivery costs were up by 170 basis points primarily due to increased fuel costs. Our occupancy expense was higher than the first quarter of 2007 slightly because of the acquisitions of Bama and Wheeler late in 2007.  Our interest expense were $6.5 million for the first quarter down about $200,000 from the year ago quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in the debt balance from March 2007 as we paid off our term loan in the fourth quarter of 2007. Offsetting the decline in interest expense, we had a decline in interest income due to lower interest rates and a lower cash balance in the first quarter of ‘08 compared to last year.  We had an income tax benefit with an effective rate of 38.2% for the first quarter of ’08, compared to an income tax expense with an effective rate of 37.1% for the first quarter of ’07. Our net income for the first quarter or the net loss for the first quarter was a negative $15.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to net income of $0.2 million or $0.1 per share for the same period last year.  Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2008 was a negative $11.1 million compared to $14.7 million in the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales decreased to a negative 4.1% compared to 3.6% a year ago. Our balance sheet remains healthy and our liquidity is still strong with $81.8 million in cash and $129.5 million of available borrowing capacity. The strong financial footing allows us to continue to invest in our company during this challenging operating environment.  From a cash flow and working capital stand point we used cash and operating activities during the quarter due to a slight built in our inventories in March as our sales per day increased to 6.7%, an increase in other receivables as a result of a $10.9 million increase in income taxes receivable in the first quarter of 2008 and the payment of the 2007 annual bonuses in February of ‘08 which reduced our accrued liabilities by $5.9 million. Anticipated tax refunds should improve our liquidity during 2008. We anticipate receiving a total of $12 million to $17 million in tax refunds in the second and third quarters of this year.  We did see some improvement in day sales outstanding from the fourth quarter of 2007. We went from 42 days in the fourth quarter of ‘07 to 40 days in the first quarter of ‘08. Our credit department has done a good job managing our accounts receivable. We also had 1.7 day improvement in our accounts payable dates from the fourth quarter of 2007. Our inventory turns just slightly to just below nine turns in the first quarter of 2008 as we took strategic inventory positions in certain lumbar, roofing and gypsum products to protect against potential price increases. This was about 6.5 million.  I will now turn the call over to Floyd for his closing comments. 
Floyd Sherman : Thank you Charles. Housing starts in our markets are down 48% from the peak at March 2006. Housing markets continue to worsen, due in part to the increase in foreclosures and the tightened credit standards in the mortgage industry. Although we cannot predict how long this down turn will last, we generally expect the difficult operating conditions to last at least through the first half of 2009.  We will continue to provide updated housing permit and commodity price data on our website each month to help guide you through the market uncertainties. This data is summarized and based on publicly available information. This quarter was a difficult quarter. We are not pleased with the outcome, but we did see some improvement late in the quarter since we were nearing breakeven adjusted EBITDA for March. We will continue to stay focused on our strategy and do all we can to continue to increase market share, reduce headcount, drive operational improvements, rationalize physical capacity and restructure underperforming locations.  In addition we will strive to maintain our market leadership and financial strength during this downturn which takes the commitment of our employees which I am confident we have. Our employees continue to seek new business opportunities and find opportunistic ways to flex our cost structure in this very difficult operating environment.  We will now take your questions and so we’ll open the session for questions and answers. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) and we have our first question from Michael Rehaut at JP Morgan; please go ahead. 
Jennifer Kensoli – JP Morgan : Hi, it’s [Jenn Kensoli] on the line for Mike, good morning. My first question is, those last comment that you made regarding the breakeven EBITDA levels in March; can you talk about what was the driver of that and what you are seeing in the market? 
Floyd Sherman : I think the key thing is we saw a slight seasonality. Our sales per day in March picked up about 6.7% compared to December, so I wouldn’t attribute it to anything more than just a flat seasonal pickup. Our cost structure is very sensitive to just small changes in revenues and so I think that revenue pickup with some of the cost reductions we have made contributed to that March getting close. 
Jennifer Kensoli – JP Morgan : Okay and my second question was regarding the share gains; they accelerated this quarter versus last quarter which is the first time in several quarters that has. I think on your last conference call you had mentioned that you were pulling the credit in on some of your customers and that you suffered or you gave up some market share gains as a result of that and can you talk about that and may be what you are seeing and what drove that sequential acceleration in share gains? 
Floyd Sherman : I think that we continue to be somewhat tight on our credit. We won’t be very prudent to mention during this down turn, so I think that that call is true but I think what we are seeing more so in the first quarter of this year than last year is we are seeing more competitors start to leave the market, more capacity dropping out of the markets and I think that gives us a little bit better ability to increase share and maintain our tight credit standards. 
Operator: Our next question goes to Nissam Sood at Deutsche Bank. 
Nissam Sood - Deutsche Bank : First question I wanted to ask was you mentioned that in terms of your staffing levels I imagine now that you’re branch locations and the headquarters, you’re kind of approaching a core level. There is still the potential here though as I am sure you are planning for as well, for a start do they continue to fall even further than they have already, so how would you adjust the scaling of your business further if conditions do continue to deteriorate. I imagine would that involve for example more facilities closures or what’s your plan to kind of deal with that type of environment? 
Floyd Sherman : I think what we will have to do is as we watch conditions develop, should we see further deterioration which is likely, we will have to look just to mothball more facilities, more operations. So, the first thing you will do is look within your four walls, your facility and say “do I need this store shop within this facility or can I ship them somewhere else?” So the first thing you will do is rationalize operations within your facilities, then you’ll look to mothball more facilities if you’re in a market like Florida; is there an ability to mothball facility or a long term is to market if you don’t go very good about it and this is the third piece of the chain you could look to maybe exit. I know Floyd and I are not at that point or this point but you do operate; so you would look to shut down operations within your market; then you’d look to shut down a few facilities, maybe mothball them and then if conditions get really bad in the issue then you would look may be to -- you exit the market. 
Charles Horn : And there is still room to take out employees, to reduce our head count; although the reduction is on the same basis of what we had in the past. We also would look to start running shorter work weeks. You’d move to 32 hour shifts and then even less if required to do so.
Nissam Sood - Deutsche Bank : Got it and were there any mothballings or market exits at this quarter? 
Floyd Sherman : No. 
Charles Horn : No. 
Nissam Sood - Deutsche Bank : Okay second question I wanted to ask was, I wanted to understand the timing and the kind of triggers of the tax refunds you are receiving. It’s obviously an important supplement to the liquidity position that you built already. So I was wondering Charles if you could just help us to understand the amounts that you would expect to receive, the kind of source, what level of differed tax assets you still have on your balance sheets and the kind of increments we are seeing here. I think you said five to seven, in the next quarter seven to ten; what’s kind of driving the timing of those? 
Charles Horn : This relates to our 2007 year. It’s primarily one you get to file your 2007 return which we are in the process of doing. Once you do that, that will trigger the first round of refunds in the five to seven range and then you will go back and amend previous returns to claim your tax refunds by curing back and then that will be your third quarter recoveries. From a differed tax asset standpoint we don’t have a great deal, we’ve been able to trigger receivables at this point; that’s what you are seeing in the bills and other receivables. As we move into ’09 you will see the DCA starts to build if we are still in a net operating loss standpoint, but currently our differed tax assets are not appreciable. 
Nissam Sood - Deutsche Bank : Got it and just final quick question on the significant substantial rise in you diesel and fuel prices; I was wondering just if you could talk recently about the dynamics of that on your relationships with your customers, how you are passing that through and how that’s impacting the sales process and how that’s flowing through your numbers? 
Charles Horn : We have not been able to pass the increases through. We have attempted to do so but abandoned it when we just saw the charge building up on our AR and so the customers that we have in the building community had just refused to take any form of increase and the majority of our competitors apparently have not seen fit to try to pass the increase through because they may have already rationalized that they weren’t going to be able to get it and so why cry, but the increase on diesel fuel is up from a little over $3 a gallon in the first quarter of ’07 to what we are now paying $4.37 a gallon on average. We have national fuel contracts but still it hasn’t been able to offset the tremendous increase that we’ve seen in fuel costs. If you did it on a flex basis to ’07, on the first quarter and using first quarter ’07 fuel costs, the net affect was over $1.54 million. 
Operator: And we’ll go next to Nitin Dahiya from Lehman Brothers. 
Nitin: Charles, when you look at your receivable ARDs even after adjusting for the one time items you had mentioned it seems to have gone up on a year-over-year basis by almost eight, nine days and are you seeing terms changing or is that just a question of timing? 
Dahiya –: Charles, when you look at your receivable ARDs even after adjusting for the one time items you had mentioned it seems to have gone up on a year-over-year basis by almost eight, nine days and are you seeing terms changing or is that just a question of timing? 
Lehman Brothers: Charles, when you look at your receivable ARDs even after adjusting for the one time items you had mentioned it seems to have gone up on a year-over-year basis by almost eight, nine days and are you seeing terms changing or is that just a question of timing? 
Charles Horn : No, I don’t think it’s that much. If you go back in the phase where we break up the trade receivables from other, you got to look at the trade receivables which were actually down. Our overall DSO I believe is up about three days year-over-year, but down on a sequential quarter basis. It’s not that we are changing terms; we still stay very consistent with what we were before, but I think what it is, it’s just people again trying to extend our payment as much as they can. Many of our customers are going through liquidity issues on their own accord and so we are just making this very, very difficult. Now I was very pleased with our credit department that we are able to pull it down on a sequential quarter basis from 42 days to 40, but I think year-over-year there definitely was a decline in drop off in sales and the difficulty our customers are going through, it was not unexpected. 
Nitin: The other thing which is interesting is your bad debt or allowance for returns and doubtful accounts hasn’t necessarily gone up, so you are not seeing that as a big pressure just yet? 
Dahiya –: The other thing which is interesting is your bad debt or allowance for returns and doubtful accounts hasn’t necessarily gone up, so you are not seeing that as a big pressure just yet? 
Lehman Brothers: The other thing which is interesting is your bad debt or allowance for returns and doubtful accounts hasn’t necessarily gone up, so you are not seeing that as a big pressure just yet? 
Charles Horn : Again I think you need to look at it as a percentage of total trade AR. It’s almost identical as percentage of trade AR. So it stayed very flexible, so then you look at what is the currency of your portfolio. If you look it, our greater than 60 days it’s only about 6.5%, so we have a very small greater than 60 days past the due compared to many of our peers and so what we will do is we will look at it’s percentage of total portfolio and then we will look at it as a percentage of our AGs and so you are going to see it be consistent because it’s holding pretty true. 
Floyd Sherman : And we will also do a credit assessment on the following of credit on every individual account and then use that if we see any potential problem developing, it wouldn’t be reflected. 
Charles Horn : Yes and looking year-over-year last year in March of ’07 our DSO was 37 days versus 40, so they are up about three days. 
Nitin: Okay. Yes I think I probably just calculated a little up but that’s actually good, but in terms of obviously you are seeing some customers have problems, so are there some sales that you’re kind of seeing where we will not just do simply because we are not sure that the customer can actually service it. 
Dahiya –: Okay. Yes I think I probably just calculated a little up but that’s actually good, but in terms of obviously you are seeing some customers have problems, so are there some sales that you’re kind of seeing where we will not just do simply because we are not sure that the customer can actually service it. 
Lehman Brothers: Okay. Yes I think I probably just calculated a little up but that’s actually good, but in terms of obviously you are seeing some customers have problems, so are there some sales that you’re kind of seeing where we will not just do simply because we are not sure that the customer can actually service it. 
Charles Horn : Sure, there are some customers that previously we would have sole or that we would like to continue to sell but we can’t because of credit decisions. 
Nitin: But then are they getting product as there or is it -- I mean essentially I think what I’m getting to is the next question which is on margin. I mean obviously some of the customers are having problems and as you pointed out pricing is kind of tough but as the smaller guys kind of fight for their survival, does that reduce some of the margin pressure or the pressure from customers kind of keeps margins slow. 
Dahiya –: But then are they getting product as there or is it -- I mean essentially I think what I’m getting to is the next question which is on margin. I mean obviously some of the customers are having problems and as you pointed out pricing is kind of tough but as the smaller guys kind of fight for their survival, does that reduce some of the margin pressure or the pressure from customers kind of keeps margins slow. 
Lehman Brothers: But then are they getting product as there or is it -- I mean essentially I think what I’m getting to is the next question which is on margin. I mean obviously some of the customers are having problems and as you pointed out pricing is kind of tough but as the smaller guys kind of fight for their survival, does that reduce some of the margin pressure or the pressure from customers kind of keeps margins slow. 
Charles Horn : Well I see your point. Obviously if capacity drops out of the market over time I think that will help mitigate some of the pressure on our gross margins yes, but it’s your earlier point; do customers when we cut them off the credit go and buy somewhere else? Yes, but we saw that very recently; you saw a company fall bankruptcy just the other day. We had pulled our credit lines on them and they started buying from someone else right before they filed and so there are suppliers within the market still willing to sell. Customers will jump over and buy from them where they can until they end up actually filing bankruptcy. 
Nitin: I see and then lastly when you look at working capital for the year and again without getting very specific on guidance obviously first quarter had its number of one time items, but from a year prospective, would you expect to end the year on a somewhat consistent basis in terms of days versus the last year? 
Dahiya –: I see and then lastly when you look at working capital for the year and again without getting very specific on guidance obviously first quarter had its number of one time items, but from a year prospective, would you expect to end the year on a somewhat consistent basis in terms of days versus the last year? 
Lehman Brothers: I see and then lastly when you look at working capital for the year and again without getting very specific on guidance obviously first quarter had its number of one time items, but from a year prospective, would you expect to end the year on a somewhat consistent basis in terms of days versus the last year? 
Floyd Sherman : I think our 80 days when you look at where we are, about 31 days, I think we can hold pretty steady there maybe a slight improvement. Our goal on DSO will be to hang in that 40 to 42 range and then it gets into the inventory turns. We intentionally dropped a little bit in the first quarter because we are seeing price increases coming through in certain area like gypsum, roofing and certain lumber products, so we bought a position to protect ourselves. We didn’t have to, but we thought it was a prudent course of action, so we depleted our inventory turn a little bit on purpose, but we can see that improving in Q2, Q3, Q4 and I think that’s the biggest opportunity we have to improve work in capital percentages. 
Operator: We’ll next going to Walter Bransin at Regiment Capital; please go ahead. 
Walter Bransin - Regiment Capital : Yes following actually on that a little bit regarding cash flow and working capital, can you give us a little color on your outlook for cash flow exclusive of the tax refunds over the next couple of quarters and particularly your outlook for working capital; will it be a source reduced over the next couple of quarters, again exclusive of the tax refunds. 
Floyd Sherman : Perhaps by saying we still continue to expect it to be a tough year in terms of overall housing starts and so perhaps it’s my comment that’s in the range of a million starts for the year, I think we’ll generate some working capital inflow. Our goal for the year is that level of housing starts, about a million to be about cash flow neutral. 
Walter Bransin - Regiment Capital : Is that cash flow from operations minus CapEx? 
Charles Horn : That’s correct. 
Walter Bransin - Regiment Capital : Okay that would be excellent and also regarding acquisitions given your outlook now for the market to be tough through the first half of ’09 are you kind of focusing on conserving cash or are you still looking at making acquisitions this year. 
Floyd Sherman : We are still obviously very, very conscious about conserving our cash, but at the same time we are looking at acquisitions; I have a number right now on my desk. I still have not seen the pricing drop to what I think is a realistic level given the conditions of our industry and I think it’s going to take probably another three to six months before we really start seeing pricing for the businesses get inline with where values should be reflected and we are not just going to spend money for the sake of spending money. If we do an acquisition we expect it to contribute a significant value to this company on the rebound and so I think there is another three to six months to go before anything meaningful will develop at least from our standpoint regarding acquisitions. 
Operator:  And we’ll go next to Michael Cox with Piper Jaffary. 
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: Good morning. My first question is on lumber prices. I was wondering if you could provide an outlook as to where you see lumber prices trending through the balance of the year or hearing -- atleast indications of some of the mills going out of business or taking capacity offline. 
Floyd Sherman : Michael we really started to see prices firming up for SPF lumber. Pine is still pretty flat. OSB has shown some signs of gaining a little bit of strength. The lumber markets in the past week to week and a half really is starting to weaken again and we really at this point don’t know quite what to make of it. There are number of mill close downs that have been announced, this goes for both lumber and OSB. LP is just announced, in the OSB side some very significant shutdowns for maintenance, over haul, upgrading, so forth that I think has created a little spark of interest in the OSB pricing, but we still think over the course of the year that there will be a slight improvement in lumber. We think that OSB will stay relatively flat through the year and we really don’t see any significant improvements taking place until probably mid ’09. 
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: Okay that’s very helpful. Are there specific geographic regions where you maybe encountering more rational behavior from competitors? 
Charles Horn : I can’t say or point any specific geography, no. 
Michael Cox – Piper Jaffray: Okay and then from a credit prospective, I know that this has been a key focus point for your company, but can you just touch a little bit on how you are able to manage the credit profile and just a general comment on the health of your core customer base? 
Charles Horn : The first thing is you always keep an active dialogue with your customer; you want to have a good dialogue. When they quit having the dialogue, that’s when you need to get worried. You always try to keep your receivables and your lien right and when it’s the customer that you know is struggling you try to find a way to get collateral support KAR which we’ve done in certain cases, but usually what we’ll do is we’ll try to work with them, we’ll try to workout payment plans if we see an issue we try to get collateral. Look, when a customer quits being cooperative and doesn’t want to pickup the phone and talk to us, that’s usually when we are going to go and try to protect our lien rights and then we’ll quit shipping. 
Operator: And we’ll go next to Keith Hughes at SunTrust. 
Keith Hughes - SunTrust: Thank you. The inventory, we talked about that a little bit in this call, it’s down about 20% year-over-year versus 34% sales decline. As we look forward, wherever the decline ends up being this year, is that the kind of spread you think we’ll see in terms of an inventory reduction for the year or there are some extenuative factors that make it better or worse? 
Charles Horn : Again, I point back Keith, the fact that we bought about $6.5 million of inventory in the first quarter we didn’t really need, but it was more quote against the process increases. We see in certain categories that are starting to get price pressure where suppliers to trying to push their increases. What we’ll do in advance is go through and take a position to protect against it, to protect our existing order base and I think what you’ll see is we did do that in Q1, Floyd I don’t know if you’ll have any plans really in Q2 or Q3 but we always have to look at it and be opportunistic to protect our open order file. 
Floyd Sherman : Yeah and I think that’s going to continue Charles. We don’t have anything on the board right now with the exception in the area of some of the steel products. We are attempting because they are -- very significant increases have been stated to the industry, roughly 13%, 13.5% and so we are trying to protect ourselves regarding those particular products, but I think from an inventory standpoint Keith, the more you keep shrinking it and pulling it back especially with the number of skews that we have, it gets tougher and tougher to really turn levels up because of the economic quantities and real order quantities and so forth, just managing a 300 plus thousand queue inventory is really tough under these conditions. I think we can get back up and I think we can get our current levels backup in the high nines to maybe even as much as 10 times but it’s going to be tough to do so. The inventory buys will be where we -- really as Charles said it’s necessary in order to protect the position. It is not going to be just a gamble on inventory because we just don’t believe in that tactic, but where we see opportunities to really protect ourselves we are going to use our cash positions to do so. 
Keith Hughes - SunTrust: Alright and second question; you had talked about not exiting geographies earlier; is the primary goal there to be effectively the last man standing at some of the geographies to soak our market share and incur the losses until that happens? 
Charles Horn: I think that’s part of it, but you also have to do a trade off. Keith, we’ll tend to look at the market on a cash-on-cash return. So let’s say that the market is for an example just loosing the main dollars to EBITDA and we think over the next two years that we’ll do $1 million per year to a negative $2 million. If we look at shutting it down and exiting the market it’s going to cost us a negative $3 million in cash between severance, lease obligations and so forth. That may not be a very wise use of our money, so we tend to look at what is the long term benefit, what is the cash-on-cash return? If it’s a two year return or better, it may make sense if it’s a three year return; four year return it may not make sense. 
Keith Hughes - SunTrust: Okay, final question. Charles you have a table in the press release which showing the trade receivables for the first quarter of ’08, can you tell me what those were for the first quarter of ‘07? 
Charles Horn:  Let me see, I don’t have that directly in front of me. 
Keith Hughes - SunTrust: Can give it to me later if you… 
Charles Horn: Yes I can. 
Operator:  And we’ll go next to Robert Manowitz of RBS. 
Robert Manowitz – RBS: Most of my questions are answered, but if I could go back to the beginning of the call or the beginning of the Q-and-A session where we talked a little bit about March and I don’t want to elaborate March because I understand it’s a cyclical month, but two questions there; one is how did the performance in March of ‘08 be breakeven EBITDA compared to March ’07 and then the second piece of that is if you look back historically not at March ‘08 but in a more normalized market what might March represent as a percentage of the first quarter revenues? 
Charles Horn: I guess a number of questions. What I would normally expect from March is to be historically up 10% to 15% over January, February average. In this situation we saw a little over 6% increase versus the 7% increase. So again if you go back and start it historically, there is always a little seasonality, this year it was only about half the seasonality. In terms of comparing March of ‘08 to March of ‘07 the housing start levels are so different. It’s hard to get a good correlation. What we are trying to indicate there is that because we are now getting into a sales volume that’s fairly low and its now our profitability is so sensitive to it, even a 6% increase in sales per day in March compared to January, February took us almost breakeven EBITDA for March and you can see for the quarter we were negative 11. So, all we are trying to indicate is there is a low seasonality, our sales volumes are now very, very tight in terms of profitability in how much they can move and how it impacts us. 
Robert Manowitz – RBS: No, I understood and maybe I could just follow on one last question and that is if you think about the comments you just provided on January to February to March, what would those normal percent changes look like going from March to April to May? 
Charles Horn: I think what we are expecting is that you’ll see April, May, June be very consistent with March. We are not seeing at this point any pick up and our sales per day basis is basically flat. 
Floyd Sherman : Yes, [Inaudible] continue to fall away. It’s really eroding and packing away any from what you would normally expect in seasonal improvement and on a sequential basis there was just a very, very slight improvement in March versus February and I suspect we are going to see the same type of numbers in April versus March. 
Charles Horn:  So, in other words we are not looking for a big seasonal bump. We saw a little seasonal pick up about half of what you normally expect and we don’t expect that trend to really continue on sequential level increases in April May June. 
Floyd Sherman : Yes all of our internal planning are really being based on consistent sales per day through the second quarters compared to March. 
Charles Horn: Yes.  
Operator:  Now we’ll go next to David Manthey I believe it is with Robert W. Baird. 
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird: In terms of the answers that you just gave, if you’re expecting the next three months to be roughly flat with March, what would that typically look like. I know it’s a little hard to gauge what the typical sequential pattern was over the past few years but you would expect it to ramp normally right? 
Charles Horn: Yes. 
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird: And by low single digits each months or how would it ramp? 
Floyd Sherman : Typically our second quarter has been 20% plus better than the third quarter. 
Charles Horn: Yes. 
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird: And then in terms of the markets that you’re competing in along the lines of the previous question, in terms of being the last man standing, do you think in most of the markets you compete in you are the low cost producer? 
Charles Horn: It’s hard to say because we compete against so many private companies. I don’t really know the exact thing of the answer. I would think that we are fairly low because we have fewer facilities than many of our competitors so we have fewer fixed costs than in down environments, but I don’t have an exact answer. 
Floyd Sherman : From all the performers that we have seen from acquisition targets that we have looked at we haven’t seen anybody who could beat our financial results. 
Charles Horn: But in the markets where we have overlapped with big competitors like Provil and Stock, I mean they are very strong liquidity wise, they are not going to go anywhere. It’s primarily your smaller local and regional suppliers that are suffering and going out of business?
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird: Okay great and then final question here, are you seeing any change in average order size and I don’t know if you gauge this sort of thing, the number of trusses you are supplying per house or anything like that that would indicate that houses are getting smaller and then have you seen any differences -- again I don’t know if you track this, but are there any differences between the custom builders and the tract builders as it relates to this down turn? 
Charles Horn : I can’t say that I have that data in front of me. Dave, I don’t know the answer. 
Floyd Sherman : When we talk to our people in the fields, we would look at the house patterns are still pretty much the same as what they have been. There hasn’t been great move on the parts of our builder customers to down size our homes. We have seen them taking out a lot of higher cost amenities since we are trying to get a more targeted price point home, but as far as square footage, we have really seen the start coming down and the trusses, we are still seeing a consistent use of truss and for those buildings who have traditionally used trusses. In the area of the custom builders and high end semi custom, that building activity did not ranch it down nearly as quick as what the large national builders pulled their activity levels down, but we are now beginning to see some real slow down in the higher end builders and we are also starting to see where we have credit exposure; we’re having to watch the credit in this area a lot closer than we have been in the past and I think they are beginning to get really -- they’re being cut back from their financing sources and they’re beginning to reflect the same problems that we have seen in the housing market with the national builder. 
Operator:  And we’ll go next to Jay Mcchales at FTN Midwest. 
Jay Mcchales - FTN Midwest: Wanted to ask first on the good will side; I know there were good will impairments last year and if we have a further deterioration in the markets how defensible do you think the good will position is now? 
Charles Horn: I think if we do see further deterioration Jay we will have to address it in each quarter that we see it. I mean the way the accounting centers works, any time you have any type of event that could signal that you have an impairment required to go and do the test. So to answer your question specifically if we see further erosion in the second quarter and we don’t see a pick up or we are generally closer to an operating plan in the Q2, then I think that you will see us go and do the test. 
Jay Mcchales - FTN Midwest: Okay and then getting back to the level of core staffing at your operations now, since you’ve indicated that you are either at or very close to that core level could we see the same percentage decrease in SG&A for the remaining quarters in this year, roughly an 18% decrease or should we expect that to tighten up; how should we look at that going forward? 
Charles Horn: I think if we get further declines in year-over-year sales you’re going to see it tighten up. Again we are seeing around a little over 5000 full time equipment employees, but not really shut down any further operations or locations until again absence in going through and pulling out the past deeds is going to get increasingly difficult to pull out people. 
Floyd Sherman : We flexed, what Charles, 72% on our salaries, benefits and that was much better than what we had anticipated. One thing I would like to say is that our people have really worked hard. They are looking at every way they can to take cost out of the operation to do it more efficiently, we continue to improve our processors which also have and streamline a lot of our processors which have helped us gain more efficiency. So, I will never say never but that really surprised me, it exceeded my expectations and so I will say we are going to continue to look at it and see if we can continue to achieve this type of efficiency again. 
Jay Mcchales - FTN Midwest: Okay and then my last question, I think you have answered this in one form or another with the other questions but what is the pace of not only customer bankruptcies that you are seeing but also competitor bankruptcies? 
Charles Horn: We are seeing customers starting to file bankruptcy. We know of a number of customers that potentially could be entering bankruptcy. From a supplier base we have previously talked about the one large one in Atlanta, Wheelers. We had rumors [Inaudible] into a rather fairly large regional still preparing to file bankruptcy in the supply chain. I think you are going to see that pace accelerate in Q2 and Q3 of this year. 
Floyd Sherman : Probably we have seen more truss plants shut down. In Florida for instance there seems to be an unusually high number of truss operations that have gone out of business in Florida and also up in the mid Atlantic area. 
Jay Mcchales - FTN Midwest: Okay and since you mentioned Wheelers that I think begs another question. When these ones that are being shutdown etc; how many are reopening fairly quickly under new names and still selling products that are well below what everyone else’s cost is? 
Charles Horn: Well we saw at Wheelers that former owners stepped in and bought some of the assets that are bankruptcy along with the name and they planned to open three. I guess we will just have to sit back and evaluate how successful they are doing that in terms of how much money do they have, what they can put into the business because I wouldn’t think banks are going to be overly minimal to win them and then how successful they are with suppliers. The suppliers get cramped down fairly abruptly in that bankruptcy, so we will have to see how successful they are in getting a back up and going. 
Operator: We will go next to Rob Jose with Van Kampen Investments.
Rob Joss - Van Kampen Investments:  You mentioned in your press release that you are getting margin pressure from both your customers and then your competitors. With competitors going out of business and there’s customers too are you seeing any of that pressure diminish? 
Floyd Sherman : Not yet.  
Charles Horn: Not yet. I think at this point it would be premature. I think it’s going to take several more quarters before that to kind of work through the system. It is a competitor that gets into issues and they start trying to survive, they are going to convert their inventory for whatever price they can get. They are just trying to convert to cash and we are in the midst now of many competitors converting to cash and again these are more your smaller regional and local suppliers. 
Rob Joss - Van Kampen Investments: Okay and a kind of related question; as you see prices say in lumber commodities falling do you experience any benefit from there or is the competition so intense that you have to reduce prices right away to meet those falling costs? 
Charles Horn: Actually when you get into the market, your products like lumber you’ll see there’s a difficulty to it. You want to a higher market price because that’s the way the market seems to work. So we prefer to have higher lumber prices higher OSB prices than lower procurement prices. 
Operator:  And we will go next to Russ Stiver at Raymond James. 
Russ Stiver - Raymond James: Your CapEx is now down to a very low level, can you remain at that level indefinitely or how long can you go before you need to put a little more money into the plant and equipment? 
Charles Horn: I think we can go another two years at the level we are at which we agreed for [Inaudible] per year. I mean if you look we really -- in the good years we refurbished our fleet, we upgraded our facilities, we have a lot of the new facilities. So I think we can go to a closer to remain at this level for the next one or two years. 
Russ Stiver - Raymond James: Okay, you read earlier to point the credit lines from Kimbal Health, can I infer from that that you don’t have any AR exposure to them? 
Charles Horn: A have a small exposure, very small. 
Russ Stiver - Raymond James: Okay and finally your bonds are trading at significant discount. Is it possible for you guys to start buying those bonds in the open market? 
Charles Horn: It’s one of the considerations that we keep in the back of our mind. I think again we want better visibility into the down side of the housing market before we use liquidity to do so. 
Operator: And we will go next to Seth Harvey at UBS. 
Seth Harvey - UBS:  Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered; I just kind of want to go back to the inventory question. I mean I know you just kind of talked about as you had been more opportunistic about purchasing this quarter but if you look at generally where the activity level now is in the industry do you feel like you can take that down from current levels to be more kind of inline or you are kind of at that point now where you are very much inline with what the activity level is? 
Charles Horn: Again we took the $6.5 million position because we had existing orders to customers we needed to cover and before these price increases went in. Had we not done that our turns would have been about 9.5 for the quarter and that’s about right where we thought they would be. So, again as we see further price increases coming through where we have to take an equivalent positioning in Q2 or Q3 I think you will see some improvements in turns going back closer to that 9.5 range. 
Operator:  And we are going next to Jim Wilson at JMP Securities. 
Jim Wilson – JMP Securities:  A couple of questions; I guess one you said you are looking at a lot of acquisitions, but I was wondering if strategically there is target areas of the country you would actually consider as soon as you think the pricing is attractive and you are going to try to take advantage of this downturn and spread west for instance.
Charles Horn :  I don’t think we are pre-disposed to any geographic region. There are opportunities in the West that would make sense, but again it has to be a large scale, but I think we are pretty open to anywhere it makes sense, probably the Mid West would be the least of the pricing for us, but throughout our core states and going into other states we think long term we feel good about it. Sure, we are going to look at opportunities. The key differential is if we go west we are going to be looking for scale. If you go into new markets you don’t want to just have one or two locations.
Jim Wilson – JMP Securities:  Right, okay it makes sense. The second thing is just, I was wondering if you could talk a little about what big builders have done and how they obviously accelerated inventory but cut production faster than the small guys, but I was wondering if there was any kind of strategic effort as you now find that big builders looking with cash and liquidity are going to be the survivors. Proactive moves on your part or on their part are trying to partner or drive more shares towards you and other big players. Is the industry going in that direction and are you kind of proactively seeking it?
Floyd Sherman : We are proactively working with a number of the large national builders and we will continue to do whatever we can to enhance our position and to encourage them to do as much business as possible with us. The large builders are continuing to work on their purchasing programs and it seems like they are trying to align themselves with fewer suppliers and with more controls coming out of the Central office as relating to purchasing actions and that benefit us very well as it does to some other large national players. So I think the activity in this area will continue and I think the national builders will look to increase or enhance their positions with people like ourselves especially when they view the long term market and they know that this market is eventually going to turn and I think the belief is when it turns its going to have a very sharp upturn and supply is going got be critical.
Operator:  And we’ll go next to Ken Schlemmel at Wolf Point Capital.
Ken Schlemmel - Wolf Point Capital : A couple of questions going back to the sequential change from the first quarter to second quarter you said typical it’s about 20% and it looked like last year it was about 13%, would you expect this year to be a smaller increase versus that 13 last year.
Charles Horn : Oh yes. 
Ken Schlemmel - Wolf Point Capital : Much less. 
Charles Horn :  Yes and again if we just go back and look at December of ’07 versus March of ’08 we were up about 6.7% on the sales per day. So I wouldn’t extrapolate anything beyond that Q2 to Q1.  
 :  Yes and again if we just go back and look at December of ’07 versus March of ’08 we were up about 6.7% on the sales per day. So I wouldn’t extrapolate anything beyond that Q2 to Q1.  
Ken Schlemmel - Wolf Point Capital : But obviously that you don’t expect a 13% increase sequentially.  
Charles Horn : No.
Ken Schlemmel - Wolf Point Capital : And do you feel there probably isn’t going to be seasonality this year? I mean I know you can’t look out too far, but there’ll be order as well.
Charles Horn :  It goes back. Well, of course there’s going to be a very flat seasonality but it’s going to be tempered by the fact that starts our continuing to go down.
 :  It goes back. Well, of course there’s going to be a very flat seasonality but it’s going to be tempered by the fact that starts our continuing to go down.
Ken Schlemmel - Wolf Point Capital : Okay and the tax programs to congress that would help home builders to look back a couple of years, are you guys included in that or you’re not considered… 
Charles Horn :  We would be considered. The Senate Bill still includes it; the House Bill has removed the four year carry back. So depending upon the system it goes through we would receive the benefit for that, especially with our 2009 where it really remains. 
Ken Schlemmel - Wolf Point Capital : Now again if the bill that was in the Senate passed as it existed today what would be the rebate you would get or would you -- have you…
Charles Horn : What it would allow us to do is for ’09, right now the way the law is structured, if we generate it in that operating loss in ’09, we would not be able to carry it back we would have to carry it forward the future years; still a benefit but it’s a forward looking benefit. If the Senate Bill goes through any loss that we generated in ’09 we would carry back to ’06 and ’05 and reclaim immediate cash refunds. 
Ken Schlemmel - Wolf Point Capital : What would that look like? Do you think it would depend on…
Charles Horn : It would depend on the loss. The potential would be up to $130 million, because that’s how much we paid in tax in those years.  
 : It would depend on the loss. The potential would be up to $130 million, because that’s how much we paid in tax in those years.  
Ken Schlemmel - Wolf Point Capital :  But this would be a ’09 event payable in 2010.
Charles Horn : That would and that’s correct. It will be probably mid 2010 in infusion of cash.
Ken Schlemmel - Wolf Point Capital : Okay, that’s down the road and then letters of credit outstanding at the end of…?
Charles Horn : About $17 million.
Ken Schlemmel - Wolf Point Capital : Same as it was before?  
Charles Horn : Yes.
Operator: Now we will go next to [Ray Lipinski] at BB&T Capital Markets.
Ray Lipinski - BB&T Capital Markets : Good morning guys. Most of my questions have been answered but we talked a lot about working capital this morning and we spoke mostly about the left hand side of the balance sheet. Just in looking at it, it looks like our payables were fairly normalized with liabilities reflected, they came in a little bit. Is there anything exceptional that went on there, was it seasonal or something which is likely to provide you with a little cash in the next quarter?
Charles Horn :  There is a couple of things. We pointed out one of them actually in our release where we talked about the payment of ’07 bonuses which took place in the first quarter of ’08. That would have been included within that accrued liabilities number at year end. That would have dropped at about 5.8. The other thing that you’re seeing there is as we continue to pull back our staffing levels, our accrued liabilities for salaries and wages are going down. So that’s just the biggest pull back you’re seeing in the accrued liabilities.

Ray Lipinski - BB&T Capital Markets : Thanks. Second question just is we talked a fair amount about the credit issues with your customers; just wondering if there are any issues worth talking about of your direction of the supply chain which might have impact on your business over the next couple of quarters.
Charles Horn : We’re not dependent upon any one supplier. We are very diversified, we’ve got by the products. Florida, are there any suppliers that you can think of that we are concerned about? No.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) and we go next to Michael Rehaut at J.P. Morgan; please go ahead. 
Michael Rehaut – JP Morgan :  Just a quick follow up. Regarding you geographic exposure, can you just go into a little detail, particularly in Texas and the Carolinas; I mean are you seeing any type of stabilization there or do you think things continue to worsen in those markets as well because they had been holding up a little bit better?
Charles Horn : They continue to worsen. I mean if you look at North Carolina, it is still probably the best of most of the states in terms of how much has fall to this point. South Carolina is moving pretty much with overall housing starts and Texas, certain areas of Texas are moving pretty much with overall starts and so it’s pretty well affecting all of our markets.
Operator: And at this time there appears to be no more questions. Mr. Sherman I would like to turn the call back to you for any closing comments sir.
Floyd Sherman :  Thank you and thank you for joining us today. If you have any further questions please feel free to contact Charles Horn. 
 :  Thank you and thank you for joining us today. If you have any further questions please feel free to contact Charles Horn. 
Operator:  Thank you everyone. That does conclude the Builders FirstSource conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you.

Operator: Hello and welcome to Builders FirstSource fourth quarter and year end 2007 earnings conference call. You host for today’s call is Floyd Sherman, Chief Executive Officer. (Operator Instructions) I would like to turn the call over to Katie Murphy, Director of Financial Reporting. Please go ahead.

At this time I will turn the call over to Floyd Sherman.
Floyd Sherman : Thank you, Katie. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2007 earnings call. Joining me from our management team is Charles Horn, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer. I will start with a recap of fiscal year 2007. I will then turn the call over to Charles who will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we will take your questions. Fiscal year 2007 was an extremely challenging year. The year started with housing starts slightly over 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis and ended with housing starts slightly over 1 million units, a 37.5% decrease. In addition, market prices for lumber and lumber sheet goods in 2007 were on average 14% lower than 2006.  In response, we have actively expanded into the light industrial and commercial segments, an attempt to mitigate the decline in single family housing activity. We are seeing success in certain markets and hope to grow this business for the long term. In addition, throughout the continued deterioration in the housing market, we have maintained a clear focus on reducing operating costs, improving operating efficiencies and maintaining positive cash flow. We have reduced our SG&A expenses by almost 15% in 2007. The largest component of the decrease in SG&A have been from a reduction in salaries and benefits as a result of an 18% decrease in full time equivalent headcount this year and 36% since March 2006, when the housing correction began. The reduction in the headcount has not been reactionary but a thoughtful flexing of workforce in response to lower sales volumes as well as the deployment of best practices creating a more efficient organization. We are being careful to not cut so deep that we impair our long-term value by not being able to quickly respond to improved homebuilding condition when the recovery occurs. We also understand that strong liquidity is important in difficult times. We maintained positive cash flow throughout the year and ended the year with almost $100 million in cash even when paying $40 million to permanently retire our term loan. We also closed on a new $350 million revolving credit facility late in the fourth quarter. With the available borrowing capacity under this facility at the end of the year of approximately a $120 million, we had a combined liquidity of almost $220 million. This strong liquidity should help us weather the current downturn and to take advantage of opportunities to grow the company as they arise. I will now walk you through our fiscal year 2007 results. Our fiscal year 2007 sales were $1.5925 billion, down 28.9% while housing activity in our markets decreased 34.1%. In addition, lower market prices for commodity lumber and lumber sheet goods reduced our total sales by approximately 2.7%.  As for the controllable sales drivers, we continued to gain market share which added an estimated 6.1 percentage points to sales for the year. Also new facilities contributed an incremental 1.8% which includes the acquisition of Bama Truss. The acquisition of Bama Truss expanded our presence in multi family and commercial construction and added steel roof truss manufacturing capability.  Our gross margin fell 170 basis points to 24.5%. We felt margin compressions across all of our product lines, but the declines were primarily due to the de-leveraging of lower sales volumes to fixed cost of sales, lower lumber and lumber sheet good prices and the rising percentage of installed sales which carry lower gross margins. Net loss was $23.8 million compared to net income of $68.9 million in 2006. Included in the net loss were after-tax non-cash charges of $18.8 million related to the impairment of goodwill and fixed assets and write-off of deferred loan cost.  Net loss per diluted share was $0.68 including $0.55 related to goodwill impairment, asset impairments, write-off a deferred finance cost and incremental stock compensation expenses. Adjusted EBITDA which has been adjusted for stock compensation expense was $46.6 million compared to $173.1 million.  The difficult market environment is definitely reflected in our result for 2007, but we have implemented numerous operating efficiencies and strengthened our liquidity throughout the year which will make us stronger in the long term. I am impressed as always with the level of dedication and commitment of our employees. They have risen to the challenges of the current market downturn with continued focus and diligence.  I will now turn the call over to Charles who will review the fourth quarter financial results.
Charles Horn: Thank you, Floyd. Before I speak to our fourth quarter results I wanted to highlight that we closed on a new $350 million revolving credit facility during the fourth quarter. This new facility releases us from some of the restrictive financial covenants under our previous agreements and strengthens our liquidity. The borrowing capacity under the new facility at December 31, 2007 was approximately $121 million and is determined under a borrowing base formula. When coupled with our cash on hand, our overall availability was nearly $220 million. This strong liquidity will help us better manage our business during the downturn and afford us the ability to take advantage of opportunities should they arise.  Now I will address our fourth quarter results. Beginning with sales; looking at our fourth quarter results we reported sales of $302.3 million, a decrease to 31.1% compared to $438.6 million for the same 2006 period. Breaking down the year-over-year change in fourth quarter sales, we estimate that housing starts for our markets declines by 34.7% compared to the same period in 2006.  Florida and Atlanta, Georgia have been particularly hard hit by the decline in starts. Of our markets Atlanta seems to have been affected the most by rising foreclosure rates particularly in the third and fourth quarters.  Compared to the fourth quarter last year, nationwide commodity lumber and lumber sheet good prices declined approximately 1.5 %. The impact on our net sales was less than 1% for the quarter. Commodity prices have been at a stable low level for the majority of 2007. As such we expect the year-over-year impact on sales and profitability in 2008 to be nominal.  Market share gains offset our sales decline by an estimated 2.4 percentage points. We believe our value added products and services give us a competitive advantage and help us to gain new business and maintain our current customer base during the downturn. However, our tightened credit standards have limited our ability to actively pursue certain new customers. Finally, new operations offset our sales decline by 1.5% for the fourth quarter. We continued to improve our sales mix during the quarter transitioning from commodity items to higher margin value-added products and services but we also felt the negative impact of decreased housing starts across all of our product categories. Lumber and lumber sheet goods declined $48.7 million or 40% and declined to 24.5% of our total sales. The decrease was attributed to lower unit volumes and prices which negatively affected us by $43.2 million and $5.5 million respectively. Prefabricated components decreased 29.3% from the prior year quarter due to a combination of lower volume and lower raw material prices. This product category represented 20.1% of total sales for the quarter.  Windows and doors were down 27.9% and represented 24.6% of total sales. Millwork decreased 26% and represented 10.5% of total sales. Other building products and services decreased 26.7% and represented 20.3% of total sales. The sales decline was partially mitigated by our continued growth in our installation services. Please refer to the table included in our press release for additional fourth quarter and fiscal year sales data by product category. Gross margins; our overall gross margin decreased to 23% for the quarter from 26% in the fourth quarter of 2006. The decline was in all major product categories. The de-leveraging of fixed costc within our manufacturing operations against lower sales volumes lowered gross margins by approximately 113 basis points. Lower prices on commodity lumber products added 70 basis points to the decline.  In addition, the continued growth of our installed services business which carries lower gross margin percentages lowered our overall gross margins. We are experiencing increased competitive pressure within our markets which will likely lower gross margins in 2008 absent an improvement in market conditions. Our SG&A expense was $85.4 million for the fourth quarter 2007, down $14 million compared to Q4 2006. We continue to totally control our operating cost reducing our SG&A by 14.1%. Our salaries and benefits expense fell $11.8 million or 19.3% from the fourth quarter of 2006 due primarily to a reduction in our average full time equivalent headcount of 21%. Part of this reduction in headcount was from closing some of our regional headquarters and idling production in certain facilities in order to optimize utilization across our organization. As market conditions improve, we will increase our production when it is warranted.  We will continue to evaluate end market consolidations based up on specific market conditions. I will note that also included in SG&A expense was 2.1 million in severance and other charges during the quarter. Interest expense was $7.9 million for the fourth quarter, up almost $1 million from the fourth quarter 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to the $1.6 million write-off of deferred loan cost due to permanent retirement of the term loan and the cancellation of the $110 million revolving credit facility and the $15 million pre-funded letter of credit facility. These items were partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower debt balances during Q4 2007.  Our effective tax rate decreased to 37.3% in the current quarter. The difference from Q4 2006 is primarily due to the fact that we established approximately $900,000 of additional reserves in the fourth quarter of 2006 in connection with various tax audits.  Net income for the fourth was $20.4 million. There was a loss of $20.4 million or $0.58 per diluted share including $0.20 related to goodwill and impairment assets of assets in the write-off at deferred loan cost and another $0.04 related to severance and other charges in the quarter compared to net income at $3.9 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the same period last year.  Diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter were $35.1 million compared to $36.1 million in the same quarterly period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the 2007 fourth quarter was a loss of $8.1 million compared to income of $21.9 million in the prior year quarter. Average working capital for the fourth quarter was 13.8% of sales compared to 11.6% in 2006. We continued to be very focused on working capital management. However the continued decline in market conditions has negatively impacted our days sales outstanding by almost four days. As the economic conditions continued to deteriorate, we anticipate the days sales outstanding to continue to worsen. We are doing everything we can to mitigate any increase in DSOs and have tightened our credit standards in response. We have seen a slight decrease in our inventory turns as we endeavor to respond to declining sales levels. We have slightly increased our accounts payable days as we continue to work with our vendors to negotiate favorable payment terms.  As of December 31, 2007 cash on hand was $97.6 million and funded debt was $275 million. During the fourth quarter we permanently repaid $40 million of term loans in connection with our new credit facility. Our keen focus to conserve capital by increasing operating efficiencies and reducing expense allowed us to maintain a healthy operating cash flow at $71.5 million for the year. Capital expenditures were $10.1 million for the year, over 17 million less than 2006. The combination allowed us to generate free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, of $61.4 million for 2007.  I will now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd Sherman: Thank you, Charles. While the home building industry has experienced an unprecedented decline of demand, I still believe that the long term outlook for the housing industry is very positive due to the growth and the underlying demographics. Until housing demand stabilizes we will manage our business day-to-day in order to meet customer needs. To help you through the market uncertainties, we’ll continue to provide updated housing permit and commodity price data on our website each month. This data is summarized and based on publicly available information.  We believe our market leadership, financial strength and industry leading scale affords us the ability to manage through the downturn and out perform our peers. We have fortified our balance sheet by continuing generate cash and improving our liquidity further strengthening our financial position. We are leveraging our deep industry knowledge to diversify our product offering and broaden our customer base, as evidenced by the recent acquisition of Bama Truss. We are operating more efficiently without sacrificing quality and customer service. We will continue to work diligently and thoughtfully to achieve the appropriate balance of short term cost reductions while maintaining the expertise to grow the business when market conditions improve. We want to avoid taking steps that will limit our ability to compete and create long-term shareholder value. Finally and perhaps more importantly, I continue to have a great deal of confidence in the abilities of the entire Builders FirstSource and we will continue to work hard on improving all facets of our business. I will now turn the call over to the operator for Q-and-A.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Floyd Sherman : Good morning.
Charles Horn : Good morning.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: The question I have is on cash flow. In 2007, you folks certainly did an impressive job of sustaining cash flows, however, if you kind of look at what’s happened in 2007, you obviously were able to reduce your working capital but as of the fourth quarter, you are now in a negative EBITDA position. So just looking ahead, absent a recovery in demand, do you think you will be able to sustain positive cash flow going forward in 2008?
Floyd Sherman: Well, Nishu if we break it down even to Q4, even though it was negative EBITDA, it was positive free cash flow and then if we break down the quarter, I think our focus will be to try to mitigate the declines in EBITDA while at the same time, trying to monetize the assets we have on the balance sheet so far to stimulate free cash flow.  We will be very focused on pulling back our CapEx. I think we are targeting nearly $7 million to $10 million for 2008 and we will respond and pull that down as needed. So even though Q4 was very difficult, we did generate good free cash flow and I think we will endeavor to try to do so in 2008 as well.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Second question I had was you were mentioning the increased emphasis on the light industrial, the commercial markets. I know a lot of that expertise you have been gaining from your acquisition of Bama Truss. How much of your sales percentage-wise is that end market now and how much would you target it for over the next year or two?
Floyd Sherman: Right now on a current basis, it probably is somewhere between 2% to 3% of our sales, but we are also leveraging what we do at Bama Truss into one of our other market areas and it’s really helping us gain a lot of new customer base in that particular market and if I probably take those sales and add in, I would guess our light commercial multi-family business, Charles was probably now getting up close to 5% of our sales in total and growing and we are also attempting to take and apply, use the same leverage in our other operating groups.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And just final question; you mentioned that you’ve been mothballing a couple of facilities. I was just kind of wondering if you could give us some numbers, maybe I just missed them, on the number of facilities you have mothballed and/or if you have actually just shut any down outright?
Floyd Sherman: For Q4, we had mothballed three; one of which we are actually trying to sell at this point. We have actually idled 11 operations which is where we have had the miller facilities, something within the location where the locations exists but the operation no longer does.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: So is that three in the fourth quarter and then 11 cumulatively or am I --?
Floyd Sherman: No, it would be 11 if we had actually idled like function within a facility, such as a millwork door shop within a facility. The facility would still exist and have lumber and other products but we would not have a door shop any longer.
Charles Horn: And what we will do is then consolidate a number of similar locations and make one efficient operation that can supply multiple locations. So in the fourth quarter, there were 11 of those and three mothballs.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Got it and what’s the total to date through the downturn on those two?
Charles Horn: That basically, we really started an earnest in the fourth quarter. There were a couple of others earlier in the year but…
Floyd Sherman: Probably around four previously.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Manowitz with RBS.
Robert Manowitz – RBS: Hi, good morning.
Floyd Sherman: Good morning.
Robert Manowitz – RBS: I was wondering if you could share with us your experience out of the pricing pressure side of things. When does that typically reverse itself, cycles? Is it when the volumes actually come back or is it earlier than that as participants adjust to the levels of activity?
Floyd Sherman: Well, I believe if the current conditions extend out into 2009 and we see a substantive loss of capacity in the industry, then I think prices may begin to firm up. We are starting to see some indications of prices firming up in the commodity, in the SPF market, the OSB market is still a wash in the capacity and some additional new capacity coming on line, I don’t think that we will see a lot of improvement on the panel side of the business but in a lot of our other products that we manufacture, if capacity really begins pulling out, I think we will start seeing improved margins on the component side of the business, but the real substantive change will occur once the building gets back to a more normal state and when I say normal, I think that’s in the above the billion and a half housing production basis.
Robert Manowitz – RBS: Right, and as I look at the revenue side in the fourth quarter by segment, the sheet goods, which are obviously used earlier in the construction process were weaker than your other categories. Is it fair to read into that that the other three categories will start to see comparable declines as the fourth quarter starts progress for the first and second quarters of ‘08 or is that not likely?
Floyd Sherman: You know Rob I think it’s probably more of a case, so you didn’t get more competition within that category, more suppliers of that particular type of product.
Robert Manowitz – RBS: So you just didn’t pick up market share there where your market gains were actually allocated to three of those categories -- is that the way to think about it?
Floyd Sherman: It tends to be our lowest gross margin category, so there is a limit as to how far we will chase the processing on the category for not picking up other product sales.
Robert Manowitz – RBS: Fair enough. My last question is, as you look at your cash balance and your debt load and the bonds trading at a fairly deep discount to par obviously there is four years left before maturity, but how would you gauge your interests in allocating some of that cash towards debt repayment?
Floyd Sherman: Rob this is something we consider if we look at it from a waterfall basis, we still look at maintaining liquidity to protect on the downturn, the second thing we look at is legitimate acquisitions if they make sense, the third in that waterfall would be, do we want to be opportunistic and take advantage of buying some of the bonds back and then the fourth would be more do we -- use some of our liquidity to buy back shares, so that will be the order of priority I’ll place that.
Robert Manowitz – RBS: As one addendum to that question, is there anything that prevents you from using the ABL line to pay off bonds at a discount?
Floyd Sherman: There are a lot of flexibilities built into the ABL agreement. We would have to significantly reduce our liquidity before we would have any restrictions preventing us from doing so.
Robert Manowitz – RBS: Alright, well thank you and good luck
Floyd Sherman: Thank you.
Operator: I will go next to Walter Branson with Regiment Capital.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital: Thanks. Actually I had a couple of things. In your preannouncement a couple of weeks ago you indicated a net loss within the range of what you actually reported actually building towards my end of that, but you would indicate in a $11 million impairment charge which came in at only $8.7 million. So I guess my question is did you -- offsetting the lower impairment charge, higher expense than you had anticipated and aside from severance charge were there any other one time items that were unanticipated?
Floyd Sherman: Actually Walter it came in exactly the same. We just broke it out separately. I think you are looking at the goodwill and fixed assets and the deferred loan cost, add those two together, so we came in exactly as what we said in the preannouncement.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital: I wanted to ask you about share gains. Your share gains were the relatively low level in the fourth quarter compared to what you had in the past. Are you seeing capacity going out of market yet because I would think that would improve your share gains; or is that still not there yet? Why are the share gains not what you…
Floyd Sherman: Well we really haven’t seen any appreciable loss of any capacity where there is a lot of conservation and we are starting to hear of people considering shutting down operations, haven’t really started taking place yet, but I would anticipate we will see that going forward. – I think probably the most limiting factor in our taking market share is our willingness to give our product away I think and manage our credit. I think that probably has affected our market share gain more than anything else. Charles you may want to add to that, but the two factors of price management and credit management is really, really important in this type of environment and you have to look at those things very carefully because as Charles said, we are going to look at maintaining liquidity and making sure that we operate a business that provides us good financial stability as well as flexibility.
Charles Horn: Walter you have seen bankruptcies for homebuilders going up. We expect that trend to continue. So we have been very active in trying to manage our credit policies, we pulled in credit lines with several customers and in doing so, we do forego some market share gains in the trade-off but not willing to take a credit risk.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital: And then my last question is in regard to cost reduction. I think you did a good job pulling dollars out of SG&A in 2007 kind of consensus for housing starts in 2008 nationally is a further decline of 25% or more. Can you partially offset the potential impact on your revenue from that kind of a decline with a similar SG&A reduction in 2008 or have you kind of reached the end of your ability to do that?
Charles Horn: I think there is always the ability to flex SG&A commensurate with volume declines. I mean as sales volume goes down it is less variable and more fixed in nature. If you look at our fourth quarter, our SG&A was about 45% variable and about 55% fixed. I would expect that trend to be somewhat consistent for ’08, maybe slightly less variable but we will continue to endeavor to pull back on obviously salaries and wages where appropriate.  What we don’t want to do is to pull back too much on our fixed cost such as our occupancy. We want to keep facilities; we want to keep the ability to respond when the market comes back. We don’t want to be premature and exit the market to get out of and then maybe losing from an EBITDA standpoint. So we are going to be very cognitive to hold capacity and make sure we idle where appropriate, but not impair our ability to respond to a recovery.
Floyd Sherman: One of the other things Charles that’s really beginning to affect our SG&A is the difference in the rising fuel costs. Fuel cost was a major cost item for us and that’s an SG&A expense in our delivery side and we are not really anticipating any decrease in fuel costs throughout ’08, in fact, what we are seeing is that we can anticipate another 10% increase or so going forward.
Walter Branson - Regiment Capital: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Nitin Dahiya with Lehman Brothers.
Nitin Dahiya - Lehman Brothers: Good morning. On DSOs. I mean obviously the increase you said is partly because of competitive pressures. Is it just a competitive response or is it also that some of your customers are having problems paying on time?
Charles Horn: Obviously, the payment on time; we had slipped our DSO about four days and that has in some cases made us respond by pulling back on our credit lines as a way to mitigate that. So that’s part of it but a lot of margin compression is just coming through pure competitive pressures. When you get into a situation where starts are down so much and many smaller competitors are struggling for liquidity, they start converting their inventory to cash to survive. So, on categories such as lumber and that really puts a tremendous amount of pressure as they sell almost for variable cost.
Nitin Dahiya - Lehman Brothers: I think I was more focused on the increasing DSOs, is that like a competitive response from you or is it that the terms have not changed but just that people are not paying?
Charles Horn: That is correct. We have not changed our terms. That is just a response where people are trying to extend our payment days.
Nitin Dahiya - Lehman Brothers: I see, but is it a bad debt expense associated with that that we have to be worried about?
Charles Horn: We have increased our provision, our bad debt expense increased to 30 basis points in 2007 versus about 15 in 2006, so we had responded and that is reflected in our results that we have to higher bad debt expense.
Nitin Dahiya - Lehman Brothers: I see and also the increase in inventory days is that also just because of the slow down? Do we expect that to come back down?
Charles Horn: On the AP days?
Nitin Dahiya - Lehman Brothers: Sorry, inventory days.
Charles Horn: Well primarily the is there is we struggle to get ahead of these declining sales volumes you get an order from a customer; you order the material and then the PO from the customer gets cancelled. So to a certain degree, you have to assume a certain order cancellation rate to try to get ahead of decline in sales volume and it took us a while to get ahead of it.  I think we are doing a good job, we have centralized many of our purchasing functions and I think that’s allowing us to pull that back into check.
Nitin Dahiya - Lehman Brothers: But Charles, from a 2008 perspective I mean with all DSOs and AP days moving and obviously sales being down what should we be looking at from our working capital cash flow point of view for ’08?
Charles Horn: I think Nitin what we are trying to do is maintain the working capital percentage may be slightly improve it and then it will based upon what your assumption is for sales levels.
Nitin Dahiya - Lehman Brothers: So no major changes and that’s good.
Charles Horn: Correct
Nitin Dahiya - Lehman Brothers:   Just moving on to the right sizing of the business if you like, I mean you have taken out some capacity or shuttered some. What kind of start level is your business sized for today and where do you want to be at? 
Charles Horn: We have the physical capacity to do over $2 billion in revenues. I mean it’s a situation where you can do end market consolidations but exiting the market doesn’t improve your utilization anywhere else, so when the market is under performing you adjust to close it where the high cash cost doesn’t really help us because it doesn’t improve us anywhere else.  So we do have a lot of capacity or utilization levels run in the 60s now. We would like to see that improve, but again like I said earlier we want to be prudent in where we downsized in what we do. 
Nitin Dahiya - Lehman Brothers: From a fixed cost basis, I mean obviously if you are not taking out the plant but I am sure we can lay off some people. What kind of order of magnitude savings on the fixed cost side can we be looking at considering the fact that we are not really not exiting markets? 
Charles Horn: Here at this point we haven’t identified any additional mass volume or closures for 2008 so I don’t know even if there is really a number I can give you on that.
Nitin Dahiya - Lehman Brothers: Lastly on acquisition opportunities, I mean are you already seeing some is like really good deals where you can buy some one for probably even a discount to assets or something or net assets or do you think that stage is still go to six months out.
Charles Horn: I think it’s still further down the road. I think still people many people want to go back on average three to five years worth of trailing EBITDA to come up with a valuation. I think the market will need to get a little bit worse before it becomes more of a net tangible asset or discount net tangible asset by environment. We did recently do one small acquisition where we paid a substantial discount to net tangible assets.
Nitin Dahiya - Lehman Brothers: On the previous question as well around between waiting for such acquisitions versus buying back bonds, I have gathered that you will be much more inclined to wait for these acquisitions and then by the bonds at a 25% discount.
Charles Horn: I would say at this point, yes. I mean we will evaluate that, we do think it’s an opportunity, but we would like to see where prices go or how many companies come on the market, are they good quality, and what can we buy them for before we make that decision.
Nitin Dahiya - Lehman Brothers: Okay, thank you much.
Charles Horn: Thank you.  
Operator: We will go next to Trey Grooms with Stephens.
Trey Grooms - Stephens : Good morning.
Charles Horn: Good morning.
Trey Grooms – Stephens: So with the commentary that you gave on the price management and credit management that you guys have in place or getting more aggressive on, looking into 2008, do you expect that market share gains will continue to contribute positively to revenues in the year?
Floyd Sherman: Yes.
Charles Horn: Yes.
Trey Grooms – Stephens: Okay. And can you quantify that at all, I mean in the past we looked at a 8 to 10 number and then obviously things are getting a little bit tougher. Is there anyway you can quantify that a little bit for your expectations?
Charles Horn: Obviously, we don’t anticipate it’s going to be at historical levels. So I think it’s going to be a much lower level, it’s more consistent with what you saw in Q4 and what you have seen previously.
Trey Grooms – Stephens: Okay. That’s pretty helpful, thank you. And then also Floyd I guess, just kind of getting back to your expertise and been through many of these cycles, can you give us kind of your take on where you see the market, the housing market, where you think it bottoms out and as far as timing and so forth because I know everyday that we go on the outlook seems to get darker and darker, you know I guess the light at the end of the tunnel continues to recede but if you -– could you just give us kind of your thoughts on what you see the housing market doing over the next two years?
Floyd Sherman: I guess my observations or my feelings are that we probably are getting near the bottom. I think that the –- it just seems to feel over the last several months that we are starting to maybe get close to the bottom. I think we are going to go through a period well through this year and into next year at a low level. I don’t really anticipate or it doesn’t seem to right now, I don’t have the feeling that things are going to substantially improve or get worse through 2009, but that’s -– I think that’s -- we are a business that’s really a reactionary business, should conditions improve and I think when the turn comes, it’s going to come very quickly, a lot quicker than it has in previous down cycles, it’s -- I think the buyers are there and I think they are -– that once they see that they can get -– that they have the availability of mortgage money, that prices have stabilized, that they are going to return to the market and the market will reflect and move up quite rapidly. It’s just my feeling about it.
Trey Grooms – Stephens: Yeah, that’s helpful. Thank you, guys.
Operator: We’ll go next to Rob [Joss] with Van Kampen Investments 
Rob [Joss] - Van Kampen Investments : Hi, thanks guys. I was wondering just a quick question on your debt structure. Could you give me a breakdown of the revolver, any letters of credit, and then the bond balances?
Charles Horn: The revolver is a $350 million asset-backed line of credit. Currently, the borrowing availability is a $120 million based on the borrowing base.
Rob [Joss] - Van Kampen Investments : Okay.
Charles Horn: We have stand-by letters of credit currently at $17.2 million and that is netted out of the 120 availability I gave you and then we have the $275 million of floating rate notes due in 2012 we currently have swapped about a $100 million notional on that $275 million.
Rob [Joss] - Van Kampen Investments : Then what’s actually drawn that on the RC.
Charles Horn: We had nothing drawn under the revolving credit facility.
Rob [Joss] - Van Kampen Investments : Got you. Okay, about a $120. I am sorry when you said a $120 was available. You said net of the 17 you said? 
Charles Horn: $100 million in cash correct.
Rob [Joss] - Van Kampen Investments : Got you, great thanks.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.
Analyst for Keith Hughes– Sun Trust: Actually this is [Judy Mayer] for Keith Hughes. Just on a bunch of acquisitions and you mention staying in balance sheet looking for opportunities. I know there have been some recent news items at least in the greater Atlanta areas for bankruptcy filings in other dealers. Is this the type of opportunity that you are looking for or would you see this as more of like an opportunity for share gain?
Charles Horn: Think it would be Judy, you are out in the background of an area that’s really hurting quite a bit in Atlanta and that’s an area where we have seen a number of companies hurting, we saw one file bankruptcy, number of them are closing facilities and I think we will be looking for in fact we bought one of the small locations out of the companies that filed bankruptcy.  So we are always going to look for opportunities but it needs to be where it fits our profile, fits our market, is a good tuck in but again we are looking at it to be a discount to net tangible assets at this point, we are not really interested in paying off of a trailing EBITDA number and so we will look at -- we still believe that the most opportunities will be further down the road, anywhere six to nine months down the road, but foremost valuations really meet the criteria in we are looking for.
Judy Mayer – Sun Trust: Okay great thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next with Michael Cox for Piper Jaffray
Tom Hayes - Piper Jaffray: Hi good morning, this is Tom Hayes for Michael. I was just wondering if you can give a little more color as to what you see as the opportunities in the installed sales business?
Floyd Sherman: I think the installed sales business is a continual growing business. More and more of our operations are getting into installation. I think the growth will be pretty much consistent with what we seen over in 2007, the problem or the thing that we have to be very careful about is to make sure that we have the structure in place so that we can properly control the installation process that we control our costs and we know how to bid the labor component of the job and be able to leverage off in the locations that are doing a successful job on installation, but it’s now literally involving the majority of the products that we carry.
Tom Hayes - Piper Jaffray: Okay great. Just another follow up. You had mention as far as these Bama acquisition that you kind of rolled the experiences from that you know another market. Do you plans to expand the presence to other markets throughout the 2008 year.
Charles Horn: Yes
Tom Hayes - Piper Jaffray: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Seth Harvey - UBS.
 : Good morning
Floyd Sherman: Good morning 
 : I think you said there was a $2.1 million SG&A, restructuring charge and SG&A is that correct?
Charles Horn: Correct.
 : The second was regarding CapEx. I think you had given a 7 to 10 million ’08, how flexible is that?
Charles Horn: I think we are getting closer to a maintenance CapEx level there is some flexibility in there which is why I give the range. Not a great deal of expansion in CapEx, we are not looking to green field any new facilities, so I think the bottom end of range would be 7 the top end of the range would be 10.   
 : We kind of heard some other suppliers saying that especially in the southern markets that they have been, they have been seeing projects pushed back that kind of in December had a kind of hard stop. Are you seeing any kind type of pick up in the first quarter or is that kind of behavior continuing?
Charles Horn: I would say we’ve seen any up in the first quarter. I think we’ve seen some consistency in the first quarter, at least in terms a sales per day and that’s were we get a little bit of comfort at least we are seeing a little consistency there rather that the continued downward trend that we saw previously.
Floyd Sherman: And we are not seeing the tremendous fluctuation on the day to day basis that we have that we have been seeing prior to this. Seth Harvey – UBS   So are you seeing kind of more as people kind of announce their intent to start on a community that they are pulling though with that and not actually kind of as you were saying before you were kind of trying to keep track on inventory seeing some, seeing more on fall through at this point.
Charles Horn: It’s hard to answer that. We don’t really track meaningful backlogs; in reality, from the time we receive the PO it could be 30 days to ship or one day to ship. So we don’t really track our backlogs, so its difficult form me to say how we are performing against that and the quantity of orders being shipped out. Well fully diluted to this one, we are not seeing the start the urgent starts we had before. It seems to be more consistent but I can’t really answer the detail question that you are asking, Seth.
 : And that’s it, thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Brian [Sydale] with Bank of New York.
Brian Sydale – Bank of New York: Hey good morning.
Charles Horn: Good morning.
Brian Sydale – Bank of New York: Just one confirmation on the new credit facility. Is it a 100% asset-backed or are there any coverage ratio convents embedded within that? 
Charles Horn: It is a 100% ABL. The only ratio that’s embedded is a fixed coverage ratio of one to one if our minimum availability under the facility drops below $35 million and the $35 million would obviously be covered by our cash of close to a 100 million and then close to the $120 million borrowing capacity we talked about. So, in that scenario we’d have to drop on $220 million to $35 million of minimum before that fixed charge coverage ratio kicks in. 
Brian Sydale – Bank of New York:  Right, okay. Thank you very much. 
Charles Horn: Thank you.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) we’ll go next to Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest. 
Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest : Hi good morning. 
Charles Horn: Good morning Jay
Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest : When you were discussing the cost of fuel what does that make up of your cost of goods sold on average.
Charles Horn: Its in SG&A and its about 1% of sales. 
Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest :  Okay. Do you have any ability to make that up with fuel surcharges in this environment? 
Floyd Sherman: No, any attempts that we’ve made have ended up being a collection problem and so we no longer are even attempting it. 
Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest : I wanted to dig down on the capacity question a little bit more. If I remember correctly prefabricated product is your highest margin category. What are you seeing in terms of competitor capacity in that specific product category, is it increasing, decreasing?
Charles Horn: Its decreasing its more in a market-by-market bases. If you look at Florida, the number of truss plants they are going out business are substantially we are seeing a number of truss plants that are closed now. The properties are coming on the market, so its really more of a market by market driven issue.
Floyd Sherman: In some of the markets, Florida as an example, like Charles said we are seeing people taking business deliberately at variable cost and they are really just trying to keep the doors open and so you have respond to that in the market, and it certainly has an effect on the pricing of the product in those markets. 
Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest : Would you assume that it’s going to continue, they are going to continue to close going forward. 
Charles Horn: I believe that yes, that’s the case and now at what point time do they try to open, re-open you know I can’t tell you but I think a number of the plants would end up not reopening. It will be just permanently retired so ultimately I think that would be very good for us in the component business. 
Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest : Looking though it is the downturn, when things start to get better and the first question is on acquisitions. Would you prefer to do acquisitions with either cash or do you think your cost of equity is low enough to where you would consider doing potently share deals. 
Charles Horn: I think it would depend on the deal but I think we would consider both. 
Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest : Do you have a preference for either one? 
Charles Horn: Clearly we thought the smaller though acquisition we would prefer cash, but if there were something of a more meaningful size and I think we would have to consider a combination of both. 
Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest :   Listening to the homebuilders report over the last couple of months they were all indicated, not all of them but the majority of them have indicated that they re trying to produce lower price product. They have done it through discounts of a spec in inventory but they have indicated that going forward they want to have less queues and an overall lower price point.  What effect has that had on your business today and what do you think the effects would be over the next two to three years in terms for Builders FirstSource and then also in terms of what new markets or areas you want to expand into? 
Floyd Sherman: I think what you are probably hearing is that the builders would like to be able to, as you say streamline reduce the number of SKUs that they offer. Have a more efficient supply channel and ultimately result in lower cost of the product to the consumer, that’s fine with us. Certainly we are in the business, we have over 300,000 active SKUs in our product likelineSo if they are successful in reducing there product offering it means we can get a lot more efficient from a inventory standpoint and the ability to provide a better package to our suppliers and hopefully then bring about an improved cost structure.  So I think the fact that the builders want to lower the price to the customer and how they are going about doing it, if they do it through a more efficient product, fewer SKUs, I don’t think that in and of itself is going to lower our gross margins. I think the competitive pressures that we are having and the amount of capacity that exists in the industry is going to be the major contributor to our margin erosion. Some of you may see if differently.
Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest : Okay great. Thank you guys. 
Operator:  We’ll take out next question from Michael [Accent] - Suntrust
Michael [Accent] - Suntrust : Good morning guys. I want to go back to a comment that you had made earlier on the call that you are going to try to be cash flow positive in 2008. I want to make sure I understood that correctly. I mean, it looks like your CapEx and interest are going to be around 25 million this year and it doesn’t sound like you expect working capital to be a huge source of cash.  Sort of looks like the run rate that you are assuming now includes a big improvement in housing starts, EBITDA should be maybe slightly positive. Is there some other item that should be taking to account or are you expecting that EBITDA should improve form the current run rate?
Floyd Sherman: I think the key thing here is to keep in mind that if again, if we keep our percentage of working capital as a percent of sales the same and you assume that the sales volume comes down which is which is what’s driving the lower EBITDA you should monetize some of your cash from your working capital, so that would be one of your offsets towards your cash interest is about $22 million; assume about $7 million of your CapEx and that is what we are trying to make sure we try to achieve positive free cash flow or positive cash flow. 
Michael [Accent] - Suntrust :  Are you expecting any tax refund of any significant size? 
Charles Horn: We will probably in mid 2008, a tax refund of close of $15 million. 
Michael [Accent] - Suntrust : Okay great, okay thanks.
Operator:  At this time there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Sherman I’ll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
Floyd Sherman :  Okay thank you for joining us today. If you have any further questions please fell to contact Charles Horn. 
Operator:  This concludes the Builders FirstSource conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Hello and welcome to Builders FirstSource Third Quarter Fiscal 2007 conference call. Your host for today is Mr. Floyd Sherman, Chief Executive Officer. Any reproduction of this call in whole or in part is not permitted without prior written authorization of Builders FirstSource. As a reminder this conference is being recorded today, October 26, 2007. I would like to turn the call over to Kaydee Murphry, Builders FirstSource Director of Financial Reporting who will begin the call. Please go ahead.
Kaydee Murphry: Good morning and thank you for joining us for the Third Quarter 2007 Financial Results. We issued a press release after the market closed yesterday. If you don’t have a copy, you can find it on our website at www.bldr.com. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management may make statements concerning the company’s future prospects, business strategies and industry trends. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Please refer to our most recent form 10K filed for the Securities and Exchange Commission and other reports filed with the SEC for more information on those risks. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. We’ve provided reconciliations of adjusting items in non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings press release and detailed explanation of non-GAAP financial measures in our Form 8K filed yesterday, both of which are available on our website. At this time, I will turn the call over to Floyd Sherman.
Floyd Sherman: Thank you, Kaydee, good morning and welcome to our Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2007 earnings call. Joining me from our management team are Kevin P. O'Meara, President and Chief Operating Officer and Charles Horn, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I’ll start with an overview of the third quarter. I’ll then turn the call over to Charles who will discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail. After my closing comments regarding our outlook, we’ll take your questions. We continued to face challenging market conditions during the third quarter, which are reflected in our operating results. Housing starts in our markets were down nearly 32% while market prices for lumbar products declined less than 3%. Despite the challenges of the current operating environment, we’ve grown profitably our market share. Market shares had an estimated 6% positive effect on sale during the quarter and 10% year-to-date. Going forward, we will have to balance market share gains with maintaining gross margins as we are focused on profitable market share gains not growth for gross sake. We’ve generated incremental sale through new facilities. New facilities added 1.9% sales growth in the current period and 1.4% year-to-date. We’ve managed margins. Gross margins were 24.1% for the current period. We’ve also maintained a clear focus on reducing operating cost and improving operating efficiencies. We reduced selling general and administrative expenses by 15.7% as compared to Q3’2006. To date, we have reduced our headcount by approximately 32% since the housing corrections began. Finally, we reduced capital expenditures by $4.8 million or 76.1% as we endeavoured to maximize our cash flow. Our cash on hand was $132 million at quarter end, even after acquiring Bama Truss. Our cash flow oriented management approach has given the company a strong balance sheet, positioning us well for the challenges of the current operating environment. In addition, we will use our strong liquidity to take advantage of growth opportunities. In this environment, we are managing our operations on a daily basis and reacting as quickly as possible to changing customer demand. I’m proud of the ongoing effort of companywide to seek new business opportunities and to operate as efficiently as possible while still providing outstanding customer service during extremely difficult period in home building industry. I’ll now turn the call over to Charles who’ll review the financial details further.
Charles Horn: Good morning everyone. We reported sales of $413.9 million, a decrease of 27.4% compared to $569.9 million for the same 2006 period. Breaking down our sales drivers for the quarter, first we estimate that housing starts within our markets declined approximately 32% compared to the same period in 2006. We lagged permits within our markets for one month to estimate an assumed start. Second, lower price in our lumber and lumber sheet goods negatively impacted our sales by 3.5%. This decline in total sales include a 0.5% negative impact related to lower market prices with the rest attributable to competitive pressures within our markets. Conversely, market share gains added approximately six percentage points to our sales and new operations added an estimated 1.9%. We felt the negative impact to decrease housing starts across all product categories. In addition, our lumber sheet goods and prefabricated components categories were slightly impacted by commodity price deflation. However, our efforts transition to higher margin, value-added products and services continue to be successful as shown by the increased sales percentages in the windows and doors, millwork and other building products and services category. We believe our value added product mix gives us a distinct competitive advantage to attract new business during this downturn. Breaking down our sales categories further, lumber and lumber sheet goods declined by 36.5% to $109.9 million and fell to 26.6% of total sales compared to 30.4% of total sales in the year ago quarter. We estimate that $42.9 million of the decrease is due to lower to volumes and $20.2 million due to lower prices. Prefabricated components decreased 27.8% from the prior quarter due to a combination of lower volume and lower raw material price and declined slightly to 20.6% of total sales for the quarter. Windows and doors were down 22% and grew to 22.7% of total sales up from 21.1% last year. Millwork also declined by 21.8%, but grew to 10% in total sales up from 9.3% last year. Lastly, our building products and services decreased 20.9% and grew to 20.1% in total sales. The sales decline in this category was mitigated by continued growth of our turnkey installation services. Please refer to the table included in our press release for additional third quarter sales data by product category. Turning to gross margins, the decrease by $52.5 million was largely in the lumber and lumber sheet goods category. Overall, we maintained a strong gross margin at 24.1% down from 26.6% last year. Of the 250 basis points, approximately 80 basis points decline between years is due to the deleveraging of lower sales volume against our fixed overhead in cost of goods sold while lower pricing on commodity lumber products contributed 140 basis points to the decline. In addition, we experienced gross margin compression in our other building products and services category due to the growth of our installed service business which carries lower gross margin percentages. If market conditions continue to create increased competitive pressure, we may not be able to maintain our gross margins during the remainder of 2007. In addition, during the quarter, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $18.9 million or $0.33 per share related to certain reporting units. The goodwill impairment charge charges are the results of the continued decline in housing starts in specific markets and the effect of this decline on our current operating performance as well as our long-term expectations. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from $3.2 million down $17.4 million compared to the prior year quarter and $6.4 million from the second quarter of 2007. As the percentage of sales, our SG&A expense increased from 19.4% in 2006 to 22.5% in 2007. Partially bridging the change, lower process for lumber products increased to 2007 percentage by 100 basis points as many variable costs do not adjust with changes in price. An incremental stock compensation expense added $1 million or 20 basis points. Again, we managed our operating cost structure very well reducing our SG&A by 15.7% during the quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, our average full-time equivalent headcount decreased 16.4% while our salaries and benefits expense excluding the incremental stock compensation expense billed $15.3 million or 21.7% from 2006. This compares to a sales volume decline of 23.9%. Our interest expense was $6.6 million for the third quarter, down approximately $1 million from the 2006 third quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to increased interest income related to our growing cash balances. These items were partially offset by higher interest rates during the third quarter of 2007. Our effective tax rate was a benefit of 39.2% for the three month ended September 30, 2007 compared to an expense of 36.3% for the three month ended September 30, 2006. During the third quarter of 2007, the statute of limitations expired in certain federal and state jurisdictions for the 2003 tax year. As a result, we reduced the reserve for uncertain tax positions by approximately $0.2 million this year. Net loss for the third quarter was $11.5 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared to net income of $17.45 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the same period last year. The net loss attributable to the non-cash goodwill impairment charge was approximately $0.33 for the quarter. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year were $35 million compared to $36 million in the same quarterly period last year. EBITDA for 2007 third quarter was $12.4 million compared to $47 million in the prior year quarter. EBITDA or the percentage of sales decreased to 3% from 8.3% reported in the third quarter of 2006. Just a note, we have not adjusted the EBITDA for non-cash stock compensation expense. If we look at our balance sheet, it remains very healthy. Our liquidity is strong with cash of $132.4 million and available borrowing capacity of approximately $108 million. Restricted loan covenants in our trade agreement are not currently limiting our availability, but could limit us in the future. Overall, we believe our strong financial footing positions us well for the challenging operating environment and for future growth opportunities. From a debt standpoint as of June 30, 2007, our cash on-hand was $132.4 million reducing our net funded debt to $182.2 million. We’re intensely focused on controlling cost and maintaining our cash flow. We were focused not only on controlling our cost but also improving operating efficiencies. These operating efficiencies will help us in the current economic environment, but will also put us in a better position when the industry turns around. Regarding cash flow, we reduced capital expenditures to $1.5 million from $6.3 million in the year ago quarter. This reduction in capital expenditures coupled with the reduction in working capital levels has allowed us to generate strong cash flow. Our operating cash flow less capital expenditures has actually increased for the nine-month period ended September of 2007 to $52.3 million from $51.3 million last year. We anticipate 2007 capital spending to be significantly less in 2006 and range from $8 million to $10 million. I will now turn the call back over to Floyd for his closing comments.
Floyd Sherman: Thank you, Charles. National housing starts on the trailing 12-month basis are now down almost 31% from the peak in March 2006. Unfortunately, the housing environment continues to worsen due in part to the tightened credit standards in the mortgage industry. We cannot predict how long the downturn in the housing industry will continue, but we generally do not expect recovery until late 2008 or early 2009. To help guide you through the market uncertainties, we’ll continue to provide updated housing permit and commodity price data on our website each month. This data is summarized and based on publicly available information. We’re not pleased with these results, so we continue to seek opportunistic ways to counteract the non-controllable macro economic factors impacting our business. We will persistently strive to grow our market share and flex our cost structure while still providing exemplary customer service. Our constant goal is to maintain our market leadership and financial strength in order to deliver long-term shareholder value. I’ve a great deal of confidence in the abilities of our entire Builders FirstSource team to accomplish this goal. I believe our current operating strategy positions us well for the challenges of the current operating environment and to take advantage of growth opportunities. I’ll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: (Operator instructions.) Your first question comes from Keith Hughes with Suntrust.
Keith Hughes - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: Thank you. First question, did you site earlier that the gross margin compression was primarily from what occurred in the lumber segment, is that correct?
Charles Horn: That is correct, Keith.
Keith Hughes - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: Why are you seeing more pressure you think in the lumber which is basically a commodity item versus the value-added items that you also sell which compressing more margin associated with them.
Charles Horn: Keith, I think it just boils down, there’s more competitive pressures on that category and more people offering that product offering.
Keith Hughes - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay, now Charles, you had talked about the revolver availability that there could be some covenants that come into play if you were to tap the rest of the availability. Is there a certain balance that you have to get above where covenants start to apply or would the metrics on the covenants just work out that way?
Charles Horn: We do have a cash flow credit facility. There is an EBITDA interest coverage provision within it. That is the covenant that’s increasingly getting tighter. So as we move forward based upon how that covenant calculates, as it gets more restrictive, it could limit the use of our facility, but before we ever get there, Keith, we will look to go out and change the agreement, amend the agreement. We had several bits of alternatives to make sure we maintain our liquidity and we’ll certainly address it before that ever comes into play.
Keith Hughes - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: And there are no covenants on the floating rate notes, is that correct?
Charles Horn: That is correct.
Keith Hughes - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: And fourth quarter, I assume which should be a working capital source of cash quarter?
Charles Horn: I would normally anticipate that, yes.
Keith Hughes - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. And if you did not tap the $108 million availability discussed, but you really started bumping up against the covenants, would you just pay off to roughly $40 million on the term loan and just with floating rate notes, that would be option, would it not?
Charles Horn: That is one of the alternatives, yes.
Keith Hughes - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan.
Jen Consoli - J.P. Morgan: Hi this is Jen Consoli on the line for Mike. I just wanted to ask a quick question on the share gains with them coming in at 6% this quarter, it’s a little bit below your 8%-10% goal and I’m assuming that’s because you wanted to hold to your margins a little bit, but given the more protracted housing downturn, I was wondering if we should be looking more for like 6-8% type growth from share gains and also if you could give us a little bit of color on what category you feel good about your share gains and you had mentioned multi-family a couple of quarters ago and perhaps which categories came in a little bit below your expectations.
Kevin O’Meara: To your first question on the growth of market share gains to 6-8%, I think that’s fair and yes, you’re correct, it is a balance between market share gains and end gross margins and we’re fighting that everyday in the market place. In terms of where we are able to grow, the install sales certainly is an area that continues relative to the housing starts and to our product mix that continue to grow as Builders still seek to use that service. I think that’s probably the single biggest area where you’ll see us continue to increase market share.
Jen Consoli - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then given obviously deeper downturn in the housing environment, have you given any thought to mothballing any facilities, or are there any plans in the works?
Kevin O’Meara: That’s something that we continue to look at on a regular basis. We don’t have any firm plans at this point in time, but just in the normal course of running our business, that is something that we look at from time to time.
Jen Consoli - J.P. Morgan: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And next, we’ll go to Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities : Thanks, question on the Bama Truss acquisition on the kind of strategic rationale. Was that mainly for the component manufacturing capability, translating that into kind of a typical residential environment or more of a diversification type acquisition because of its light commercial and multi-family exposure.
Kevin P. O'Meara : It’s more of that later. Really a couple of things, one is they do steel trusses which we don’t do anywhere else in the company and so it gave us a new competency in the products. The history we have at manufacture, it did open up to a greater extent light commercial and multi-family, in greater strength than what we have done in the company historically, the parts of our operations has done multi-family business. And then lastly, and this is longer term, I don’t think we’ll see this anytime soon, it did position us strategically within Alabama and there is plenty of real estate there if we decide that we want to use it as a jumping off point in the future to build a distribution center that potentially could serve Birmingham and potentially even Montgomery.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities : Will you be pursuing more diversification type acquisitions or on the other hand, I would imagine there would be a lot more distressed opportunities now as well?
Kevin P. O'Meara : I think it’s going to be consistent with what we have said in the past, we’re just going to be opportunistic. I mean, this Bama came available. It was an attractive opportunity having the strategic rationale that I just discussed, and so we went ahead and made the acquisition. It totally depends on what becomes available and what makes sense to the company.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities : And longer term question for Charles here. You’re EBITDA margins, whichever way you want to talk about them increased a lot obviously during the housing boom and as you kind of filled out your operating platform of 2003 to early 2006, now obviously with the worse housing recession that we’ve had in a long time and pretty severe contraction, what should we be modeling on a longer term basis you think for a normalized margin for Builders FirstSource?
Charles Horn: There are really two factors you have to keep in mind. The first will be, what are your expectations for 2008-2009 or what are your expectations for recovery? Obviously, fixed cost is still an element within our COGS as well with as within our SG&A. it definitely can influence what EBITDA percentages should be. That’s the first thing you have to consider. The second thing you have to consider is if you presume that recovery does come in ’09, ’10, or ’11, we continue to migrate to a higher value-added product mix which traditionally carries higher EBITDA percentages. So let’s assume that we continue on that route and we do see recovery down the road which takes some of the pressure off of our fixed cost and the deleveraging event against the lowering sales volume, I think you could see some upside to the EBITDA percentage in the long term.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities : Are you able to give us any kind of range that you folks tend to look at internally?
Charles Horn: No, we tend to avoid doing that. I think right now, just with the liquidity and of the fluidity of what’s going on and how, then I don’t think its very good for us to do that, but we do think that we’ll continue to migrate the business toward value-add, deemphasize the lower gross margin commodity product and really position ourselves for a very strong EBITDA percentage in the future.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities : Okay, thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Next we go to Michael Cox of Piper Jaffray.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question is on the SG&A control. I was wondering where you feel you are in terms of managing that down and the headcount reductions, is there still further room to go or are we at a point where you start to cut into muscle?
Charles Horn: I think we still have opportunity. We continued on in October and we’ll continue on throughout the duration of the correction time to make the appropriate adjustments on our staffing levels. That is by far our largest controllable cost and so we will have to continually look at that and try to stay ahead of the curve. The other thing goes back to what Kevin alluded to, we will continue to evaluate our fixed cost whether we need to mothball, close, consolidate facilities and that will be a really second bullet that we’ll be looking to use in trying to improve operating cost during the downturn, but also position ourself for going forward to have even better operating efficiencies again when the recovery comes.
Floyd Sherman: I think Charles, one of things that we continue doing on an ongoing basis is evaluating how we conduct our business, what are the processes that are used and where can we become more efficient and we’re moving very aggressively in bringing and promoting these improvements within current operations and that’s going to be going on, ongoing for the foreseeable future.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: Okay that’s helpful, and in terms of the sizeable cash balance that you currently have, I’m curious what type of catalyst would require to move more aggressively in using that cash either to pay down debt or look more aggressively at acquisitions?
Charles Horn: I mean, clearly, paying down debt is one of the alternatives with the loan covenant situation we discussed earlier. Acquisitions will continue to look at them, address them aggressively. As Kevin said, be opportunistic, but conversely, we are seeing capacity starting to drop out of the markets as well, and we feel that even more beneficial to us and potentially an acquisition in the short term. So we’re going to evaluate our market by market level, see where capacity is pulling out. If a good acquisition comes our way, we do want to be opportunistic, but we don’t want to chase an acquisition if it’s not the right fit long term.
Floyd Sherman: And we’ve also seen, Charles, the announcement that have been made, Stock Building Material Supply has taken a number of operations offline. Certainly, we’ve seen the same with ’84. We’ve seen with Depot Supply. I’m seeing it with a number of other smaller regional players, so the industry is beginning to react now and we’re seeing some significant capacity being pulled. And that’s a fantastic opportunity for us.
Michael Cox - Piper Jaffray: Excellent, thank you very much.
Operator: Next is Mitun Daia with Lehman Brothers.
Mitun Daia –Lehman Brothers: Good morning. Charles, you mentioned the 3.5% sales, the imnpact of lumber prices, how much of that did you say was impact of material prices versus competitor product line?
Charles Horn: The market impact was somewhat small, about 0.5% on total sales. As you look, market prices are starting to basically be the same year over year. So most of that that you saw com through was just pricing concessions we’re giving customers in reaction to more competitive market plays.
Mitun Daia –Lehman Brothers: But about 3% of that you are saying was just pricing concessions?
Charles Horn: I’d say that’s accurate.
Mitun Daia –Lehman Brothers: And is that a conscious decision to gain some share or is it just that that place is just so competitive?
Floyd Sherman: Part of the reason that we’re making those adjustments certainly competitive pressures are part of it, but another part of it is in order to hold the rest of the parts of the package. We often find that if you lose the commodity side of the business frequently, you can anticipate to see an erosion of sales in your other lines, so we look very, very aggressively and respond very quickly to what has to be done in order to hold our position on the commodities.
Mitun Daia –Lehman Brothers: But, I mean, if I were to extend this argument then, Charles, I mean you mentioned for example that most of the gross margin compression you saw was the lumber, but it is very linked, right? Because the lumber price decline you’re taking only because you want to make sure that you don’t lose the other stuff?
Charles Horn: That would be correct. I mean, that’s part of the reason for making the price concession, yes.
Mitun Daia – Lehman Brothers: Yes, okay, as you said, you’ve almost anniversaried right now, but when do we see the lumber prices, if you like, when will they start being ahead as opposed to your competitive action?
Charles Horn: I think that we don’t anticipate any appreciable improvements or increase in commodity prices in the next year. I think it will probably be 2009 before some support can come into it and maybe help move that market prices up, but we don’t see it in the foreseeable future.
Mitun Daia – Lehman Brothers: But you don’t see further declines, I would suppose?
Charles Horn: At this point, we understand it’s below variable cost. It’d be hard for us to think its going to go appreciably lower. My guess would be, it’s going to be bump along where it is right now for about the next year or year and a half.
Mitun Daia – Lehman Brothers: Okay, and geographically, which markets are you seeing the greatest weakness?
Charles Horn: Clearly, Florida as a state is by far one of the weakest areas, the next would be Georgia. If you look at what’s going on in Atlanta, Atlanta is a very tough environment. Permits down over 52% in Atlanta during the quarter, is the fourth largest foreclosure rate markets right now in the US, so I’d say Florida obviously being the biggest drain on us and then Georgia being the second.
Mitun Daia –Lehman Brothers: And what about Texas? Because you have a couple of Builders also talking about Texas being very painful.
Charles Horn: Texas is painful. I wouldn’t say that there’s any market that’s not painful at this point, but Texas we do have some diversification in this area in terms of our multi-family and some light commercial businesses that help mitigate some of the pressure coming through here.
Mitun Daia –Lehman Brothers: Okay, and lastly, on pricing pressure from Builders, I mean, are you seeing it in one area more than the other and what magnitude, I mean, a builder this morning, we were asking them and they said probably they are seeing 7% to 10% to 15% kind of input cost decline. I don’t know if that’s what you guys are seeing and if the pricing pressure from Builders is in one area over another?
Charles Horn: I would say that the pricing pressure from the Builders is pretty universal and can’t point in any particular area where it’s more intense versus others. One of the things that I think you maybe picking up when they talk about their input cost decline, that also includes decline in the market price for lumber and lumber is the second single largest cost they have after the land and house, and so when the lumber prices decline that will cause their input prices to decline even if it doesn’t necessarily mean that our gross margin percentages are being impacted.
Mitun Daia – Lehman Brothers: I see, fair enough. And on the installed services, I mean, there were some talks that the builders are going to focus on that and are you seeing that as well?
Charles Horn: I mean, it’s definitely an area they focus on. They’re definitely trying to drive down prices on labor just due to the abundance of labor within the industry right now. So I will say that that is an area they’re being very effective.
Mitun Daia – Lehman Brothers: Fair enough. Thank you very much.
Operator: We’ll go to David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks a lot. Guys, I was wondering if you could address some of the markets that had held up better for you. Last quarter, I believe you mentioned North Carolina and Tennessee as being a little bit better than the rest of your locations, could you just talk about the conditions there. Have you seen some further deterioration in those areas?
Charles Horn: I think, North Carolina is holding on the best of these states, but I’d actually take it to a little bit more granular level while answering your overall question, what we’re seeing are some of the smaller markets with more diversified homebuilder basis are holding in better than large markets, and so I think it’s almost a small market versus large market driven type of phenomenon within our business, but with the greatest strength being in North Carolina, the greatest weakness would be in Florida.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, and in terms of new operations adding 1.9%, is that a number we should expect to diminish while the pain continues here or do you have plans to continue to open new operations even if the market remains weak?
Charles Horn: Well, it’s conceivable. What’s driving that 1.9% is our two acquisitions Bama Truss and Wade Building Supply which we did late last year. That’s primarily the sales driver to that 1.9%. So depending upon the acquisition pipeline that could go down or it could go up. In terms of green fielding operations, I don’t think we plan to spend very much capital on doing that during this downturn.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you, and then just to put two thoughts together here. Floyd, in your monologue, you said that you would seek better gross margin opportunities that you wouldn’t grow for growth sake, but Charles, I think you mentioned that if conditions continue, your gross margins could decline and I’m just trying to put those two thoughts together and understand sort of what your view is and how you plan to attack the market from here?
Floyd Sherman: Well, I think there are two parts to that. What I’d said that we’re not just going to just start dropping prices indiscriminately just to take on business that do not give us an acceptable level of profitability. And I think what Charles was also saying is that we do anticipate that there is going to continue to be a lot of competitive pressures on the products we sell, the builders are exerting tremendous pressure on the supply chain to drive down their cost, and obviously we have to react to that, but I’m not the one who believes that just take business for business’ sake, unless it really gives you a strategic advantage that will quickly pay for itself when the market turns up and so, we’re very carefully managing that. We’re really watching that we don’t get over aggressive in trying to take business for business’ sake.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Very helpful, thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go to James Mccanless of FTN Midwest.
James Mccanless - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: Good morning everyone. I wanted to ask you first on the builders in you different markets, we saw fairly large builder out west go bankrupt earlier this week, and just wanted to get your sense of potential bankruptcies in your markets, what you see happening over the next few months?
Charles Horn: Due to what we’ve seen, we continue to evaluate all sizes of builders, what we’re seeing some of the smaller builders are starting to really have problems, and some of our markets, Dallas, Atlanta, we’ve definitely seen smaller builders starting to go out of business, and so we are having to watch that closely, and it is starting to be more pervasive than what it was before. You probably saw during the quarter, we did increase our allowance per bad debts in recognition of this increasing defaults rate going on among the smaller builders, and I do expect that trend to continue.
James Mccanless - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: But you still have in bankruptcy or slow pace situation, you still have certain rights such as lien rights, et cetera, correct?
Charles Horn: That is correct. In many cases, we do have lien rights perfected. We would be secured in trying to make sure we get paid, and in many cases we get personal guarantees from the smaller builders as well.
James Mccanless - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: Okay, second question, great working capital management this quarter, but I wanted to address the cash balance from a different way, what if any cash target do you have or net debt goal, net debt cap goal that you have in mind right now?
Charles Horn: I don’t think it’s really a net debt ratio, I think we’re more focused on total liquidity which would be cash plus credit availability. We’re very focused on cash, we’ve very focused on cash flow, we’re very focused, what I will say is always protecting the head and then in making sure that we can be opportunistic. So I can’t give you a specific ratio, but I’m obviously being very tight on cash, we’re obviously going to protect our liquidity under our credit agreements through the various alternatives we talked about and so we do want to have very strong liquidity during this downturn.
James Mccanless - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: Okay, following on with the downturn question, are there other lines of businesses or potentially other areas that you believe are becoming attractive? Do you guys, as other people either shut their operations like you discussed before or move out of certain markets?
Charles Horn: Well, I think what you try to do is when somebody leaves the market where you participate is try to hire any good people there particularly the sales people and any quality customers if they have, and so really, it’s on a case by case, market by market basis. I can’t really say that there’s one market in particular, one segment of the business in particular where we’re necessarily seeing it. Obviously, there is more pressure on the commodity lumber side of the business, and so competitors that are highly geared towards commodity lumbers as opposed to the value-added type products will tend to have financial problems before others, so it really just is a case by case basis.
James Mccanless - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: Okay, and then the last question I have in listening to the Homebuilder conference calls over the last couple of days, pretty much across the board, they indicated that they had lowered their average sales prices to inform to both FHA and the GSE conforming loan limits and I’m wondering if that has translated into even stronger pressure on companies such as yourself to deliver better prices for them, so I guess my question is, has the pricing pressure intensified from the builders over the last 30 to 60 days?
Floyd Sherman: I can’t really say that I see any visible or can feel a visible increase in the pressure. It had just been just tremendous pressure though that’s being exerted unlike any pressures that I’ve seen or experienced in over four years in the business. But I think it started over a year ago and it really continually kept stepping it up and it’s hard to imagine that it can be anymore difficult an environment than what we’re going through right now.
James Mccanless - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: Right, thank you gentlemen.
Operator: And next is Steven Fisher of UBS.
Steven Fisher – UBS: Good morning, just to follow up on the cost side, do you think you could take out another 15% of SG&A next year and what level of sales or market decline do you think you’d need to see to dig out that kind of level of cost?
Charles Horn: I think it is conceivable, again, it’s going to be somewhat volume driven, but I do think it’s conceivable to take out 10% to 15% should volumes continue to fall. Now to answer a different way, if volumes are static, that would be an increasingly difficult thing to do, but our guess is that the market will continue to correct in ’08 and we will see volumes fall, and given that scenario, I do think that we can pull down 10% to 15% in our SG&A.
Steven Fisher – UBS: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: And we’ll go to Seth Harvey of UBS.
Seth Harvey – UBS: Good morning. I just had a question on, we’re kind of going back to working capital this quarter and it looks like you haven’t been doing a very good job of taking investment out of working capital for the second quarter. This quarter has slowed down, just wanted to see if there is anything happening there specific to this quarter?
Kevin O’Meara: No, I don’t think so. I think you’ll see AR. Obviously we aged just a little bit more than we have in the previous quarters, part of the reason we increased our allowance. Inventories I think our turn ratio is about equivalent, we can still get some improvement there. Our accounts payable days, we’ve taken that to over 32 days based upon negotiating with suppliers, so that can hang in pretty well even though as Floyd had said in the past, as we increase our install labor business, that doesn’t put some downward pressure on our accounts payable because we have pay our subcontractors on a weekly basis. So what I think you’ll see is AP about static, can get some improvement in inventory turns. It will be difficult to improve our days sales outstanding on accounts receivable during this time, in fact, we’ll probably see a little bit more creep in that metric.
Seth Harvey – UBS: Okay, and in terms of your capex, cut down, I guess you’re saying 8 to 10, is that a sustainable number and would you expect 2008 to be similar?
Charles Horn: I think it is sustainable in the short term of a two to three year window. I think you will see us take it potentially lower in 2008 and then as conditions improve, we’ll look to maybe cover some of the deferred maintenance items we’re doing now and that could be in 2010-2011. So in the short term, I think we can definitely take it down a little bit down further than what we anticipate in ’07, and again we’re always focused on maintaining cash flow and generating good cash flow.
Seth Harvey – UBS: And then, I guess, finally kind of going back to the covenants, so until an EBITDA coverage covenant or is that with a term loan or the revolver or when does that actually step down?
Charles Horn: It actually will, in this situation, it stepped at the beginning year, first quarter of ’08. It is an EBITDA interest covenant and it does cover both the revolver which is $108 million availability as well as the term loan.
