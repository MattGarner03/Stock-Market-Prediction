===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-16 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ivy, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Head of Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.
Kristin Silberberg: Thank you, Ivy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning are Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our first quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking, and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our first quarter presentation, located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review in the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results in the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. And with that, I will hand over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We announced financial results today that were in line with our expectations. Highlights include: NIM expansion of 3 basis points to 2.90%; core loan growth of 1%; resilience in our fee categories despite some softness in capital markets, given market uncertainty; and credit trends remaining favorable, along with continued share repurchases. Our balance sheet remains very strong with CET1 ratio of 10.6%, LDR of 77.5%, virtually no Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and a strong credit allowance position. During the quarter, we entered into an agreement to sell $1.9 billion in purchased student loans, which reside in non-core, $200 million of the portfolio was sold in Q1 with the balance to be settled ratably over the next three quarters. We will use the proceeds to pay down high-cost funding, purchase low-risk-weight securities and repurchase shares. The transaction will be accretive to NIM, EPS, and ROTCE. We had already included the impact in our full year guide. During the quarter, we also issued $750 million in senior debt, further bolstering our funding base. We executed well on our strategic initiatives during the quarter, the Private Bank continued to see excellent growth, reaching $8.7 billion in deposits and $5.2 billion in AUM. We added Private Wealth teams in Florida and Southern California during the quarter, and another one today in New Jersey. Our New York City Metro, private capital, and payments initiatives also saw continued progress. As we look forward, there has clearly been an increase in uncertainty in the macro-environment given the policy decisions and rollout emanating from Washington. This has caused many market participants to hit pause on investments or deal activity. On a positive note, our corporate and consumer borrowers are generally in good shape and are in position to weather these challenges. The basis for our full year guide had anticipated some choppiness in the first half of the year tied to the rollout of tariffs and downsizing of the federal government. Our view held that as the lower tax, deregulation and pro-energy agenda kicked in later in the year, we would see a pickup in loan demand and deal activity in the second half. So, with respect to an update to our full year guide, at this point, we reaffirm our EPS estimate, though there could well be some puts and takes. Events in the Q2 will help clarify whether the second half outlook will solidify as we had planned. On our guide slide in our presentation, we call out some risks that affect both us and the industry at large, given the environment, and we also show some potential offsets to the full year guide. The main risk associated with continued economic uncertainty and a slowing economy, include a pushout in capital markets fees, slower loan growth, and higher credit provision. Potential offsets to these possible impacts include even better performance on funding costs, greater share repurchases, and further efforts on cost transformation. It's worth noting that there is a significant amount of pent-up demand around M&A activity. We are working on a record number and dollar value of transactions, and are hopeful that they get done as uncertainty subsides. So, while it's still early to make a call as to how the environment plays out, we remain focused on pulling the levers we can to offset any macro headwinds as we did in 2024 in meeting our initial year guide. And as we look to the medium-term, we remain confident in our NIM trajectory, which powers our ROTCE improvement, and in our ability to execute on our key strategic initiatives like the Private Bank. In short, we feel good about our positioning overall from a strategic business and financial standpoint. We will stay focused on execution and the things we can control as we continue our efforts towards building a distinctive great bank. With that, let me turn it over to John.
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce indicated, we delivered first quarter results, which were broadly in line with our expectations and reflected typical seasonal impacts. Referencing Slides 5 and 6, we delivered EPS of $0.77 for the first quarter with ROTCE of 9.6%. Net interest income came in at the better end of our expectations for the quarter as we performed well on our margin, which continued to benefit from the time-based decline of non-core and terminated swaps, along with strong deposit cost performance. Fees were up nicely year-over-year, and linked-quarter performance reflects the impact of seasonality and market uncertainty on capital markets. Wealth fees were a record for the quarter as we continue to build out the Private Bank. Expenses were managed tightly, including the usual seasonality in salaries and benefits. Credit came in as we expected, and we maintained a strong reserve coverage level. During the quarter, we entered an agreement to sell approximately $1.9 billion of non-core education loans. This acceleration in non-core runoff will be accretive to NIM, EPS and ROTCE, with the redeployment of the freed-up capital and liquidity as the sale settles over the course of the year. We continue to execute well against our strategic initiatives. Notably, the Private Bank continued to steadily grow its profitability, contributing $0.04 to EPS and finishing the first quarter with $8.7 billion of deposits. Also, we continue to make good progress in New York Metro, and our TOP 10 program is well underway. We ended the quarter in a very strong balance sheet position with CET1 at 10.64% or 9.1% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal, a pro-forma Category I LCR of 122%, and an ACL coverage ratio of 1.61%. This includes a robust 12.3% coverage for general office. We also executed $200 million in stock buybacks during the quarter, taking advantage of our strong capital position. Next, I'll talk through the first quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on Slide 7. Net interest income decreased 1.5% linked-quarter, driven by the day count impact of about $28 million and slightly lower interest-earning assets, which was partially offset by the benefit of higher net interest margin. As you can see from the NIM walk at the bottom of the slide, our margin was up 3 basis points to 2.9%, driven primarily by the time-based benefits of non-core runoff and reduced drag from terminated swaps and the benefit of improved deposit costs, partially offset by the net impact of rate-driven impacts on the balance sheet. We continue to execute our down-rate playbook in the deposit portfolio. Our interest-bearing deposit costs decreased 18 basis points while maintaining the mix of non-interest-bearing deposits at 21%, stable with the prior quarter. Our cumulative interest-bearing deposit down-beta improved to 53% in the first quarter. Moving to Slide 8, noninterest income is down 3.5% linked-quarter, with seasonal impacts in capital markets and card fees. Capital markets saw lower M&A and loan syndication activity given seasonality and the impact of uncertain market conditions pushing M&A deals out. Debt and equity underwriting improved coming off a slower fourth quarter. Even in a quarter impacted by seasonality and market volatility, we managed to perform well in middle-market-sponsored bookrunner deals, ranking number three by volume. Our deal pipelines across M&A and DCM remained very strong despite market uncertainty. In fact, our M&A pipeline is at all-time highs in terms of number and value of transactions given pent-up demand. We are hopeful these deals get done as market uncertainty subsides. The wealth business delivered a solid quarter with increased annuity sales activity. We also continued to see positive momentum in fee-based AUM growth from the Private Bank. Our global markets business was up slightly this quarter with increased client hedging activity in FX and energy-related commodities. On Slide 9, expenses were managed tightly, up 1.7% linked-quarter, primarily reflecting seasonality in salaries and benefits. Our latest TOP program is underway, and this gives us the capacity to self-fund our growth initiatives. On Slide 10, period-end and average loans were down slightly. This reflects the non-core transaction of $1.9 billion as well as auto runoff of $700 million. Excluding non-core, loans were up approximately 1% on a period-end basis. The Private Bank continued to make good progress with period-end loans up about $550 million to $3.7 billion at the end of the quarter. Commercial loans were up slightly with a modest increase in line utilization as some of our corporate banking clients drew down on their lines to finance inventory builds ahead of tariffs. We also saw a modest increase in capital call line usage given M&A activity in our sponsor base. And core retail loans grew slightly, driven by home equity and mortgage. Next, on Slides 11 and 12, we continue to do a good job on deposits, growing on a spot basis, primarily in low-cost categories in what is typically a seasonally down quarter. Period-end deposits were up approximately $3 billion or 2%, driven primarily by low-cost growth in the Private Bank and Consumer, partially offset by a seasonal decrease in Commercial. The Private Bank continues to add customers and grow nicely, with period-end deposits increasing by about $1.7 billion to $8.7 billion at the end of the first quarter. Our retail franchise grew deposits in low-cost categories this quarter, and we continue to maintain strong CD retention rates even as we reduced yields. Stable retail deposits are 68% of our total deposits, which compares to a peer average of about 55%. This was a big driver of our improving deposit costs this quarter as our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a competitive environment. Our interest-bearing deposit costs are down 18 basis points linked-quarter, translating to a 53% cumulative down-beta. We continue to maintain a robust level of liquidity with a pro-forma LCR of 122%, significantly above the Category I Bank requirement. Moving to credit on Slide 13. Net charge-offs of 58 basis points for the quarter included a 7-basis-point impact from the non-core transaction. Excluding this impact, net charge-offs were 51 basis points, which was down modestly from 53 basis points in the prior quarter, in line with our expectations. Commercial charge-offs were down modestly, driven by a sequential decline in general office. Retail charge-offs were broadly stable, excluding the impact of the non-core transaction. Of note, non-accrual loans were down 5% linked-quarter, reflecting a decline in commercial as we continue to work out general office loans. Retail non-accrual loans also decreased as a result of the non-core transaction and continued runoff of the auto portfolio. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14. The allowance was relatively stable at 1.61% this quarter as portfolio mix continues to improve due to back-book runoff and lower loss-content, front-book originations, offset by a slightly more conservative loss forecast. The economic forecast supporting the allowance reflects a mild recession similar to last quarter and macro impacts from tariffs. The reserve for the $2.86 billion general office portfolio is $351 million, which represents a coverage of 12.3%, broadly stable with the prior quarter. Note that the cumulative charge-offs plus the current reserve translates to an expected loss rate of about 20% against the March 2023 loan balance when industry losses commenced. Moving to Slide 15, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio is 10.64%. Adjusting for the AOCI opt-out removal, our CET1 ratio was stable at 9.1%. Given our strong capital position, we repurchased $200 million in common shares, and including dividends, we returned a total of $386 million to shareholders in the first quarter. Turning to Slide 16, we provide some details on the non-core portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, we took the opportunity to accelerate the rundown of the portfolio with an agreement to sell approximately $1.9 billion of education loans. We recognized a $25 million charge-off associated with this portfolio that was covered by a pre-existing allowance. $200 million of the sale settled in the first quarter with the remainder scheduled to settle ratably each quarter through 2025. We expect to use the proceeds to pay down high-cost funding, invest in low-risk investment securities, and repurchase shares. With this redeployment, the transaction will be accretive to NIM, EPS and ROTCE. Moving to Slide 17, we are well-positioned to drive strong performance over the medium term with our overall three-part strategy: a transformed consumer bank, the best-positioned commercial bank among our regional peers, and our aspiration to build the premier bank-owned private bank and private wealth franchise. We continue to make excellent progress on the Private Bank. We delivered our strongest deposit growth quarter so far, adding $1.7 billion of deposits to end the first quarter at $8.7 billion, and the mix continues to be very attractive with slightly over 40% in noninterest-bearing. We also ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in loans and $5.2 billion in AUM. With a $0.04 contribution from the business in the first quarter, we are tracking well against our 5% accretion estimate to Citizen's bottom-line in 2025 and to deliver a 20% to 24% return on equity. Moving to Slide 18, we provide our guide for the second quarter. We expect net interest income to be up approximately 3%, driven by an improvement in net interest margin of approximately 5 basis points and day count. This pickup in net interest margin is primarily attributable to the time-based benefits of non-core runoff and reduced drag from terminated swaps. Noninterest income is expected to be up mid- to high-single-digits, led by capital markets, with some risk if market uncertainty persists. FX and derivatives and wealth should also provide a lift for the quarter. We are projecting expenses to be broadly stable. Credit trends are expected to improve slightly from the first quarter charge-off level, excluding the non-core transaction. And we should end the second quarter with CET1 in the range of 10.5% to 10.75%, including share repurchases of approximately $200 million, which could increase depending on loan growth. Currently, our full year outlook remains broadly in line with the guide we provided in January, which contemplated a pickup in business activity in the second half of the year. However, if the current challenges in the external environment persists, there could be select risks that impact us as well as the broader industry. Persistent market volatility could impact capital markets revenue and anticipated loan growth in the second half of the year. While the assumptions incorporated in our current reserve are conservative and our corporate and consumer borrowers are broadly in good shape, a heightened likelihood of a deeper recession could lead to higher provision. However, if these risks arise, we have potential offsets we can leverage. Lower loan growth could facilitate additional share repurchases as well as the opportunity to further lower deposit costs as we continue executing our deposit pricing playbook. We would also take the opportunity to manage expenses down through streamlining our operations and further cost transformation. Looking out in the medium-term, we see a clear path to achieving our 16% to 18% ROTCE target. Expanding our net interest margin is an important driver, and we project to be 3.05% to 3.10% in 4Q '25, 3.15% to 3.30% in 4Q '26, and in the 3.25% to 3.50% range in 2027. Slide 21 in our appendix provides some incremental details on our net interest margin progression to 2027. This, combined with the impact of successful execution of our strategic initiatives, should drive ROTCE meaningfully higher by 2027. To wrap up, we delivered Q1 results that were in line with our expectations, highlighted by growth in net interest margin. While the market uncertainty has impacted capital markets revenues, deal backlogs are at all-time highs. We accelerated the runoff of non-core with the education loan sale, which will be accretive to NIM, EPS and ROTCE. We ended the quarter with strong capital, liquidity and reserves, which puts us in an excellent position to support our clients while navigating market uncertainty. And we continue to drive forward our strategic initiatives, with the Private Bank progression particularly noteworthy. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Operator Ivy, let's open it up for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We're now ready for the question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
John Pancari: Good morning. Hi,
Bruce Van Saun: Good morning.
John Pancari: Just on the balance sheet growth, just wanted to see if you can give us a little bit more color around loan demand, what you're seeing here in the -- in this backdrop? Are you seeing -- what are the some of the trends in line utilization? Are you seeing any weakening of the pipeline and also any type of pre-tariff inventory build that might have driven a little bit of the growth in the near-term, but might be more of a pull-forward versus the outlook? If you can just give us some color there? Thanks.
John Woods: Yeah, I'll start-off and others will chime in here. But maybe just starting in commercial. We are seeing some line utilization increases. We saw that up a couple of percentage points at the end of the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. That was driven by a number of factors. I mean, we think tariffs is part of the story, but I'd also say that M&A and some working capital is in there as well. So -- and that was both in our corporate banking business as well as on the sponsor side, and our utilization in our subscription line side of the house and commercial. So, we are seeing some of that trending. And frankly, given the expected pickup in business activity in the second half, there's some expectation that we'll see that continue, assuming some of this uncertainty subsides. On the consumer side of things, we're seeing good take-up in the resi and HELOC side of the ledger. Given where the rate environment is, HELOC, in particular, has been a really strong story for us. And last but not least, I'd throw out the Private Bank, which continues to drive growth. So, you're seeing all three of the legs of the stool, as you heard earlier, contributing to the loan growth outlook. And maybe I'll just pause there and see if there's other color to add.
Don McCree: Yeah. I would affirm what John said. It's Don. I think as we talk to customers, we're hearing a little bit of expansion desire. They've gone a little bit to the sidelines right now, just given what's going on with the uncertainty in the environment. The other thing, John, that's been going on really powerfully in the first quarter is we've gotten disintermediated by the bond markets. We had an extremely strong bond quarter, and some of that came off of our balance sheet as clients access particularly the high-yield market. I think that probably is going to reverse, given where rates are right now. So that will be a tailwind behind us in terms of loan growth. I don't know how much of it is tariffs in terms of the line draws. I think it's just general working capital build. People are running their businesses really tightly. So, I don't think we've seen the tariff impact yet, and that could be a tailwind also. And then, we'll have to see on the capital call lines, that's a pretty big part of our balance sheet, not huge, but it's about a $10 billion exposure overall, of which, about half is drawn, and that's running at relatively low utilization. So, to the extent we get some of the deal activity kicking in, particularly in the second half, that should grow nicely.
Brendan Coughlin: Yeah, it's Brendan. On the consumer side, if you put aside our non-core rundown, which as John pointed out, was down about $1 billion linked-quarter, and look at the underlying business, that we're still originating. We're seeing decent growth 1% up year-over-year. As John pointed out, heavily led by residential and secured. The portfolio is 75% secured. Keep in mind on the consumer side with incredibly high credit straps with high FICOs and relatively low LTVs. HELOC, we're actually up 9% year-over-year and believe we're right at the top of the league tables on net growth versus peers, and that's through a bunch of innovative investments we've made in analytics and customer experience that has driven a little distinct advantage for us. We will continue to take advantage of that given the high-quality nature of the customer and expect that growth level to persist throughout the year. In mortgage, even though we have high rates, the portfolio growth is actually decent, up 3% year-over-year. Again, high-quality customers prepay speeds really low on the back-book given the lack of a refinance activity. So, we're seeing net positive growth. The other portfolio, student and credit card, have been flattish, student given higher rates and credit card, honestly by design, as we look to launch some new products here midyear, we expect that to see some higher returning growth assuming the economy plays in our favor in the second half of the year. So, we feel pretty good that underlying loan demand is high for the second half of the year. In the Private Bank, we are -- as John pointed out, we grew about $500 million linked-quarter. What we're seeing there is still strong demand from that customer base as the consumer part of that portfolio builds, the mix has shifted modestly to consumer. So, that's now 30% of the book where it was in the low-20%s about a year ago. That's a good sign. We expect slow, steady continued progression and balancing out the book. And demand seems to have picked up. Our mortgage originations in the Private Bank are about double what they were same time this year despite a similar rate environment. So, activity is strong and we expect growth rates to accelerate in the back half of the year for the Private Bank.
John Pancari: Great. Thank you for all that color. I appreciate it. And just quickly on my second question is just around capital. I know you're sitting here around 10.6% CET1 and you cited expectation for around $200 million of buyback similar to this quarter or to last quarter. But also, I know you mentioned, I think, Bruce, you mentioned this, and John, you mentioned as well, that if you did see weaker loan growth and weaker macro, you could see higher buybacks. Can you just maybe help frame that like if the -- if we do see weaker loan growth in a weaker economy, would you conversely maybe be more cautious, and therefore, maybe [husband] (ph) more capital versus step-up buybacks? Can you just talk about how you view that trade-off? Thanks.
John Woods: Yeah. I'm going to start there. I mean, we're committed to that range that we articulated at 10.50% to 10.75%. If there's less RWA, then, we would feel that, opportunistically, a willingness to step up on the buyback side of things. And the reason for that is a couple-fold. I think the starting point on capital is very strong, both before and after AOCI. So, you look at our AOCI haircut, we're still north of 9%, which is quite a good number. We would also have to look at what the uncertainty would hold. And if you look at our reserve position that we've already set aside, we actually have a recessionary scenario already contemplated in our provision and loan loss reserve situation. So, from that standpoint, I think that we could see a number of scenarios throughout 2025 that would be consistent with continuing to be able to upside buybacks in the face of lower loan growth.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. And what I would add to that is if you go back to 2024, we also had a pickup in growth that would build over the course of the year. When that didn't happen, we basically used the freed-up capital to buy back our shares and we thought our shares were very attractive. And I'd say given kind of the crack in bank stock prices since the macro uncertainty and the rollout of the tariffs, we still feel that the stock is cheap relative to inherent value. And so, it presents a real opportunity to offset any impact that would hit in the P&L from slower loan growth if that happened through buying back our stock and buying it back at very attractive pricing.
John Woods: Yeah. And just hasten to add, as we keep growing our tangible book value per share, the earn-backs on buying back stock at these levels is well under a year. And so, it's pretty attractive and so we would feel good for all those reasons stated.
John Pancari: Great. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ken Usdin from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Ken Usdin: Thanks. Good morning. Guys, I wonder if you could talk through that push and pull on the capital markets outlook and the fee guide. So, I guess, first of all, the record pipeline, what's your level of confidence in terms of closing those transactions? And I guess, secondly, if that capital markets embedded expectation doesn't pull through, how do we understand like the comp ratio offset and the magnitude of flex that you can have to keep PPNR close to in line? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. So, I'll start and then maybe John or Don can follow on. But again, I think the exciting aspect of this from our standpoint is that we've, over time, built out really strong capital markets capability and a very broad M&A capability that covers middle market companies through mid-corporate and specializes in industry verticals that we think are going to be active. And so, the fact that there's pent-up demand from sponsors to do deals, there's industry sectors that are very active, for example, data centers, where we have a really strong group of folks focusing there. I'd say it's heartening to see that we've got record numbers of engagements. Our people are working very actively, and on a probability assessment, none of these deals have dropped, and I think we're just waiting to see some of this uncertainty subside. So, we still feel optimistic that things will settle down here a little bit and that we should be able to pull that through. What I would say if that is not the case and then things do push out a bit, there's other things to consider. One is that we're broadly diversified. So, we've had the ability to if one area doesn't fire on all cylinders like if M&A is soft, and oftentimes our financing, our syndicated loan capability, our debt underwriting will pick up and provide an offset. And then, the FX and interest rate derivatives and commodities hedging risk management business also is seeing an uptick in activity, and depending on the circumstances that could provide an offset. So, the first line of defense is kind of diversity within the fees that could help offset any push out on M&A volumes. And then, secondly, there's obviously incentive compensation that would drop if the deals don't deliver. And then, just broader looking at the expense base, we're constantly working on ways to streamline our businesses and perfect how we're running the bank to make it more efficiently. So, we have a TOP 10 program up and running, but we're certainly not content with that given all of the opportunities we see around new technologies like AI and ways to deploy that just to run the bank better and serve our customers better. So, I'd say that would be the broad playbook, but maybe for color on the revenues, Don, you might want to add anything there?
Don McCree: Yeah. No, I just echo a couple of things that Bruce just said. One is, I'm really encouraged by the diversity of the franchise and the people that we continue to add. Actually, we're continuing to hire really strong talent into some of our industry teams. So, that provides an ability to continue to transact in the market. I also want to remind people that a significant part of our M&A business in particular is mid-sized companies coming out of our core franchise. And they continue to have a really strong desire to sell and transact and a lot of those go into private equity. And the other thing I'd say is that the financing markets are generally pretty attractive, so we can get these things financed and they're not $10 billion deals. They're $100 million, $200 million, $300 million deals. So, they're eminently executable. One of the things that's been interesting is and you would ask the question of why are these things pushing, part of it's due to the de-staffing of the FTC and the SEC. So, it's just taking longer to get these transactions done. And I think the most important thing that Bruce said is we have not lost one mandate out of the pipeline. So, it's not as if these transactions are going away, it's they're just taking a little bit longer to execute. So, I'm super confident that we're going to be able to get these things across the finish line, whether it's the second quarter or the third quarter, we'll have to see, and if some of it will be volatility, but there's very little tariff dependency in any of these underlying deals. So, the big picture is we should generate the revenue and hopefully my bonuses aren't going to go down by year-end, but Bruce still do that to me as you have done in the past if that does happen.
Bruce Van Saun: John, anything to add?
John Woods: No, I would just highlight the diversity point that you made, just on the expense side, I mean, we would -- in an environment like that, you get the direct offset that you mentioned on incentives and then you take a harder look at some discretionary stuff that we also touched on before. And then, just more broadly, just feeling like the net interest income story has just a number of great tailwinds that are part of why we feel good about the guide for '25 as well.
Ken Usdin: Thanks for all that.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, Ken.
Operator: Your next question comes from Peter Winter from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Peter Winter: Good morning. I was wondering just looking at interest rates, which have been extremely volatile, it seems like the forward curve changes daily. But can you talk about what the ideal interest rate is -- interest rate environment is for Citizens and yield curve? And conversely, what type of rate environment would put the NIM outlook potentially at risk? And are there any plans to reduce some of the asset sensitivity?
John Woods: Yeah, good questions there. I mean, out the window, our asset sensitivity is plus or minus 1% to a plus or minus 100 basis point change in a gradual shift in the yield curves up or down over the next 12 months. So, we are slightly asset sensitive.
Bruce Van Saun: Close to neutral.
John Woods: Yeah, we're close to neutral, based on just how those numbers are playing out. And I'd say that the first and foremost, the net interest margin trajectory is primarily not rate dependent. So, you've got the time-based benefits that are really driving net margin, both in the near-term and over time. So, for example, in the first quarter, we had about 5 basis points of time-based benefits. And given the slight asset sensitivity and seasonally lower deposits that's why we ended up at 3 basis points of net interest margin growth in the first quarter. When you look out to the second quarter, again, we're going to get about 5 basis points of time-based benefit and better balance sheet trends. So, that's why all of that drops to the bottom-line and really get that momentum continues to build not only through '25, but out into '26 and '27. And we have in our slide deck an illustration of the fact that by the time you get to the fourth quarter of 2027, the cumulative time-based benefit is 35 basis points. If you add that to the 2.90% that we delivered in the first quarter, we're already at the lower end of the range without having to deal with interest rates. And so, then from there, the rest of the story that takes us into our range of 3.25% to 3.50%, you would also look at fixed asset repricing, which really is more about long-end rates and there's a lot of baked in turnover of the balance sheet, given coming out of the lower rate environment that we're in -- coming in the pandemic. So, you got 15 basis points to 20 basis points there and now we can talk about rates, right? And so, there's -- and we're pretty well hedged from a swaps standpoint in through -- out through the middle of 2027. So, yes, we will do a little better if rates are higher. So, if rates are -- the terminal rate out the window appears to be around 3.50%, that's a good outcome for us. And that would put us in the middle of our range, but higher rates -- terminal rates like 4%, would be consistent with the upper end of our range of around 3.50%. But we could tolerate as low as 3% on Fed funds or even a touch lower and still hold the low end of our range at 3.25%. So, we are basically comfortable with a wide range of scenarios on rates. We feel pretty well hedged with a slight orientation towards performing a little better a couple of years out if rates are a little higher. And we think about inflation and stagflationary scenarios when we think about positioning the balance sheet that way. But the objective of trying to have a lot of non-rate related tailwinds is something that you need to think about when you think about our recovery on net interest margin.
Peter Winter: That's great. Thanks, John. If I could ask just kind of a follow-up to Ken's question? You talked about the puts and takes with this uncertain environment, but can you just give an update on the positive operating leverage for the full year versus January's forecast of 1.50%? Just -- I realize there's all this uncertainty, but just wondering how you're thinking about it.
John Woods: Yeah. We think -- we're reaffirming that outlook. We believe that that's very achievable around the 1.50%. And a big driver of that, again, back to net interest margin. We see net interest margin rising by about -- rising to 3.05% to 3.10% by the end of the year. That implies about a 15 basis point increase in net interest margin year-over-year. That's pretty powerful on the NII line. And therefore, that 3% to 5% NII is a huge driver of our positive operating leverage and we feel good about that. And we talked earlier about the diversity on the capital markets and fee line broadly and how our pipelines are consistent with being able to deliver the guide with some levers to pull if certain scenarios play out. So...
Bruce Van Saun: So, I would add to that, in 2024, most banks, including ourselves, were very tight on expenses and 2025, we're inflating a little bit. So, the guide was for roughly 4% expense growth and that reflects the fact that there's lots of great things for us to invest in as we build out the franchise here. So, things like making sure we're adding to the Private Bank, we're adding private wealth teams, we're opening Private Bank offices, we're investing in AI and various projects, data analytics capability. There's our payments capability. So, there's things that we want to keep investing in to position us for that medium-term growth outlook that, in a tougher environment, we can throttle some of those things a little bit. But our preference is to not do that to keep investing and keep building. So, just kind of putting that in context, there are some levers to pull, preferences to keep going, make those investments for the future, but we can pull back a little bit if need be.
Brendan Coughlin: The other structural benefit that we do have as well on the Private Bank, keep in mind that the majority of that cost base was compensation guarantees. And so, as the team is productive and we have confidence in hitting our revenue outlook, that revenue is gobbling up existing expenses and compensation not necessarily adding to it. So, it's [indiscernible] operating leverage right there naturally versus last year, which we have a lot of confidence to deliver the revenue outlook. So, that should be a structural advantage for us, too.
Bruce Van Saun: Great point, Brendan.
Peter Winter: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead.
Erika Najarian: Hi, good morning. I mean, you have...
Bruce Van Saun: Good morning, Erika.
Erika Najarian: Thank you. You've alluded to this and how you've responded to all the questions, particularly the PPNR one, but as you know, the net interest income outlook is quite important. And as I pull up the slide from last quarter, it's set up 3% to 5%. So, if I think about affirming the exit NIM on Slide 21 and then the balance sheet seems to be fairly in line, at least average earning assets were in line this quarter. Unless we think that the balance sheet will shrink, it seems like that up 3% to 5% is still broadly in line, right, in terms of what you're affirming. So, just wanted to confirm that in terms of the full year look.
John Woods: Yeah, you've got that right, Erika. It's John. That 3% to 5% feels pretty good. If you just think about NIM alone, that would take us to the upper end of that range, but what we indicated in the guide was that, at least back in January, that we might have interest earning assets down about 1%, which is what put us into the middle of the range. There's some flexibility there. When you think about relative value in the securities portfolio and what we're seeing in deposit flows, which are actually coming in a little better than we expected, there are -- there's another lever there with respect to interest-earning assets in the securities book that we'll be monitoring throughout the year. But net interest margin trends exactly as expected, feeling very good about that with some levers to pull even in the securities portfolio and on interest-earning assets, if relative value looks attractive and deposit flows continue the way they've been going. So, that's the way that we think about that 3% to 5%.
Erika Najarian: Thank you. And switching topics on the reserve, so this is a two-part question. Number one, just a broad question here. What unemployment rate is your reserve sort of looking forward to? And second, John, could you talk through the dynamics that's perhaps unique to Citizens about the non-core runoff? So, as we think about perhaps the baseline case of unemployment potentially getting worse or the company weighting the downside case more, what is sort of the offset of the $1.9 billion student loan sale and the runoff portfolio? And obviously, the commercial real estate portfolio has been -- you've been resolving parts of that for some time now. So, walk us through those two dynamics as we think about how to think about the provision from here as we think about perhaps a more uncertain economic backdrop, but also a specific optimization of your loan mix?
John Woods: Yeah, I'll hit both of those and others may chime in here. We have a number of scenarios that get applied to different parts of the portfolio. Our baseline scenario has an unemployment rate of 5.1% that covers a large portion of our book primarily in C&I and in retail, but when you get into the CRE portfolio -- and also that 5.1% is paired with a decline in GDP that would imply a mild recession. So, a majority of the book has a mild recession associated with it. But when you think about the CRE book overall, we have a combination of a moderate to severe recession assumption applied to CRE. And so, the unemployment assumption there is higher than 5.1%. So, on a weighted average basis, you'd end up with an unemployment rate that's above 5.1%. I mean, just as an example, our general office portfolio has a severe recessionary scenario with an unemployment rate of 9.3% and a GDP decline of 4.4%. So, just giving you a sense that generally it's something higher than 5.1%. And that's why I think what we're saying is that a lot of the uncertainty and concern about recession for 2025, we feel like it's mostly baked into our allowance. I mean, we'll be monitoring it and we're keeping an eye on it and we're watching charge-off trends coming down in line with our expectations. So, that all feels very good on the credit side.
Bruce Van Saun: John, you might have the number on the top of your head, but Erika, we had -- we're about 1.61% in terms of the allowance to loans kind of the day one CECL was [1.42%] (ph)...
John Woods: On an adjusted basis.
Bruce Van Saun: If you adjust it down first for the investors deal and then for the actions we're taking in non-core, what is that number?
John Woods: 1.25% to 1.30%.
Bruce Van Saun: 1.25%-ish, in that ballpark. So, anyway we feel that over time we've continued to improve the focus on kind of where we want to lend. We want to lend to deep relationships. In commercial, we've been moving more upmarket, so that 80% of the C&I portfolio is now investment-grade equivalent. And in the retail book, 95% of the book is super prime and high prime, 78% of the book is -- retail is secured. And in homeowners, are the ones that we're lending on an unsecured basis, two-thirds of the borrowers are homeowners which tend to have a better credit profile. So, we have a bunch of those stats back on Pages 24, 25 and 26. The CRE portfolio, we've taken a lot of the pain there already. So, the pigs have been going through the Python, so to speak. So, we feel that we're well reserved for different scenarios that could ensue over the course of the year.
John Woods: Yeah. And to the other point -- question you had, Erika, regarding non-core rundown, I mean, I think you can kind of pair in some respects, I mean, certainly the balance sheet is fungible, but you can sort of think about non-core and Private Bank in some respects together because we're taking a lot of that liquidity and capital and down in the non-core space, but we're growing in Private Bank and in commercial. So, on the Private Bank, we have a year-end target on the loan side that is similar to the rundown in non-core that's being accelerated in '25. So, what you're seeing is pulling back on lower customer value assets in the non-core space, growing high customer attractive RWA in Private Bank and in commercial and in core retail. So, the engine here is humming along really well and probably a little faster than we expected given our opportunistic transaction.
Bruce Van Saun: When we set up non-core, that was roughly broad numbers $10 billion running down in the consumer runoff portfolio and $10 billion running up in the Private Bank. And by the way, the credit quality in the Private Bank, I mean, the group that came over from First Republic had virtually no credit losses, and so far, we've had no credit losses in that book. So, you can't say that will always be the case, but it's very, very high credit quality. So that alone is going to average down the net charge-off ratio through the cycle to something in the low- to [mid-30s] (ph) from something that had been kind of higher [30s to low 40s] (ph). So, Brendan, you want to add anything here?
Brendan Coughlin: Yeah, just a couple of quick stats maybe just to build on your points. On private banking, we have zero customers that are in delinquency or criticized right now. So, to John's point, we're replacing non-core rundown with that quality of asset. The other thing to make note of on non-core, which is seasoned now and then rundown with no new originations coming through with auto, as the portfolio gets more seasoned, you have the dynamic of you drive the car up a lot and immediately reprice this down and you're upside down a little bit on LTV until paydowns happen. The portfolio is a couple of years seasoned now. So, we feel pretty good that we've got our arms around lost content. It shouldn't be hypersensitive to unemployment unless there's a really significant event in the market. So that should be stable and we feel good about the quality there. And just on the retail book to everybody's point, 79% of it on the core side is residential secured. On the home equity book 99% is below 80% CLTV. On the mortgage book 51% CLTV. So, there's very, very little loss content there unless there's a significant housing market correction, which obviously we're not seeing high chance of that. And then, when you unpack the unsecured book, while over time, we'd like to have more exposure to credit card, right now we're undersized on credit card and that's a good thing if there's an unemployment spike. And on the student book, 98% is co-signed by the parent on in-school and 40% of our student loan refinancing book is with folks with advanced degrees, which are less sensitive to spikes in unemployment. So, when you net all that together, I feel like on a relative basis, we should be in a very strong spot if there's a blip in unemployment.
Erika Najarian: Very thorough. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt O'Connor: Good morning. A couple of follow-ups on fee revenue categories. The service charges were quite strong year-over-year and you mentioned cash management, which I think is pretty straightforward and then also overdraft. Just elaborate on the overdraft? Is it increased frequency? And why you think that is? Were there some pricing changes or what drove that component?
Brendan Coughlin: Yeah, most of the service charge numbers actually in cash management and business banking is seeing really strong growth with some technology investments that we've made in the consumer business to drive stickier engaged customers. By the way, that's also showing up in our low-cost deposit trends. So, the increases that we're seeing are largely driven by healthy fee creation versus punitive, which we are very, very pleased with. Our overdraft line has, obviously, been on a downward slide for a decade and it's now relatively stable. We've not made any pricing changes. And while there's -- the mass market population is generally back to paycheck to paycheck, they are back pretty stable. So, we're not seeing any behavior in that base. Spending trends are still strong, but stable. We're not seeing anything in that base that would suggest a breakout of economic stress yet, which obviously would be tied to an increase in overdraft fees too. So, we feel like that's going to be kind of range bound. Hopefully the growth that we see will be in the positive fee creation through customer advice and services that we provide, largely in cash management, and overdraft is in a range. Obviously, I'm sure you all saw the court case that is out there on overdraft and then the House and the Senate both signed off on eliminating the rule from the CFPB. So, we also think the risk that potentially existed in the back half of the year, but that may be coming down is de minimis at this point headed to the President's desk for signature. So, anyway overdraft is stable, not growing, not really decreasing in any material way.
Matt O'Connor: Okay, that's helpful. And then, in credit card, you were down obviously versus 4Q on seasonal trends, but also down a little bit year-over-year. I know you're trying to grow it. Is that just the cost of rewards and upfront sign-ons, or what's driving that drop on a year-over-year basis? Thanks.
Brendan Coughlin: Yeah, we have -- there's been a little bit of our prior expansion activity we were doing with credit card we paused for a short period of time while we launched new products in May and June. So, we're very, very excited about a couple of new products that are coming out late spring into the summer. The customer spending trends have been broadly stable for a bit here. And so, we're expecting that to get back into growth mode. As you probably remember going back 18 months, some of the growth in credit card and debit card fees were structural related to the Mastercard arrangement that we did that really drove some net positive fee growth to the bottom-line as we generate more spending activity and grow the net portfolio in cards in the back half of the year, we expect that line to continue to modestly grow.
Matt O'Connor: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Gerard Cassidy: Hi, Bruce. Hi, John.
John Woods: Hi.
Bruce Van Saun: Hey, Gerard.
Gerard Cassidy: Guys, can you share with us -- as a follow-up to your comments on the non-core loan portfolio, and in view of the sale of the non-core student loans, can you give us the pros and cons of selling the entire portfolio that you outlined on Slide 16?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, I'll take that. John, you can chime in. But I think that there's relatively high predictability in terms of the runoff of auto, which is basically what's left. And should we want to accelerate that sale, there's going to be a liquidity cost that has to be paid. So, our view is since this is short duration paper, it runs off predictably, it runs off fast. The duration of the paper is roughly two years that we're better off preserving the capital and not incurring that liquidity cost if you will. So...
John Woods: Yeah, agreed. And so, we've got very strong capital and liquidity. So, there's no need to accelerate it beyond the accelerated rundown. I mean, if you look in the fourth quarter of '25, by the end of this year, the entire book is going to be down to $2.6 billion. $1.5 billion of that is -- or a little more than $1.5 billion, about $1.7 billion or so is sitting in an auto collateralized structure anyway and therefore wouldn't be able to be sold. So that's sort of ring fenced and just runs down on its own. So, you're basically under $1 billion by the end of the year from the round trip from the beginning of this journey in terms of running down non-core and this is going to be kind of in the rearview mirror very soon. And from that standpoint, we think the transaction that we did was the accelerant. And...
Bruce Van Saun: That was the longer lived asset with the bigger tail. So, to move that out really helps accelerate the whole rundown.
John Woods: And who knows, maybe in the future there could be a cleanup, but it will be something that really wouldn't have much of an impact given that it's in such a low profile by the end of the year anyway.
Gerard Cassidy: Great. Thank you. And then, as a follow-up, obviously, your credit, you've got it under control and you talk very thoroughly about the office commercial real estate portfolio and the challenges there. I noticed in the C&I portfolio and I know the numbers are not large and it could be the law of low numbers that one or two loans going non-accrual will push the number up, but in Slide 28, you do give us that breakdown of non-accruals. Can you give us some color on the C&I portfolio? The uptick again wasn't material in nominal levels, but what are you guys seeing in C&I, especially in view of your outlook of the uncertainty we're all confronting with this economy?
John Woods: Yeah. Maybe just to start off, on 28, that's the allowance, is really -- when you see those numbers go up, that's really us being a bit a touch more conservative with respect to areas that we're seeing that makes sense to flow additional allowance over to...
Bruce Van Saun: That's the non-accrual though. I think that you're talking about the 0.57% going up to the 0.65%.
Gerard Cassidy: Right. Again -- correct. But it's small. I understand it's small, but I'm just curious.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. I think that's just the law of kind of small numbers in terms of if you have one thing move into non-accrual as we work through some issues that can make modest adjustments from quarter-to-quarter there, but nothing really to call out I think.
Don McCree: Yes, Gerard, I'll just jump in. We're seeing no macro deterioration in C&I. I go back to what I've said for a couple of years now as people really tighten their belts during COVID, both from a debt standpoint and an efficiency standpoint and that's going to help them go through any kind of uncertainty that we have. So, we see no broad trends of deterioration at all in our C&I book.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. And I would say it's more a question of they're in good position and they've positioned themselves to be resilient and adaptable to the environment. To me, the bigger question is when -- how much offense do they want to play and the macro actually holds them back from further growth in their businesses and that potentially affects loan demand or deal activity. But I don't really view it as any kind of material credit risk. And in fact, when you look at the sectors that we lend to, we don't have huge exposure to the sectors that are most exposed to tariffs. So, in general, we feel really that this is more an issue about how much offense comes out of the customer base as opposed to are we worried about credit deterioration.
Gerard Cassidy: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ebrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning. Just two very quick follow-up questions. John, maybe for you. Not sure if I missed, when we look at your fee income guidance, you talked about the capital markets pipeline. What are we assuming for capital markets just from a fee revenue standpoint for second quarter and for the full year, if you don't mind sharing that?
John Woods: Yeah, we have the -- it's a driver and it's -- I think I'd go back to the diversification points that we said earlier. I think we've got -- in the capital markets, we've got M&A certainly as part of the story, but there's loan syndications, some equity capital markets opportunities. And you heard Bruce earlier talk about client hedging, that are all contributing to the second quarter as well as the full year. And then, we're also focused on the fact that on the consumer side of the house, card and wealth are also expected to be contributing in 2Q and in 2025 as well, but we haven't broken down the details separately from fees in 2Q or 2025.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. It's a material driver to the 8% to 10% growth we had for the year in the original year guide and then in the second quarter lift that we have. And I would say the kind of level of the capital markets activity to me is why we had a little bit wider range in the second quarter fee guides. So, we still think we'll see a nice bounce off of Q1 levels, but we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. But I think the broader point John just made about diversity and when one thing is a little soft, we have enough levers that I think we're pretty confident that we'll be able to find offsets at capital markets is a bit sluggish.
Ebrahim Poonawala: Got it. And I guess maybe just a follow-up. On the margin outlook when you have the margin for the end of the year, end of '26, can you remind us what the Fed funds rate underpinning that is? I understand -- appreciate the time sensitivity -- sort of the time sensitivity of what the NIM does, but what's the Fed funds rate? If we get 100 basis points of Fed funds cut, let's say, between now and year-end, does that create some downside risk to that '25, '26 outlooks or not?
John Woods: Yeah. I'd say, as I mentioned, we're pretty well hedged. We've got -- when you look out the window, there's a -- we said -- sorry, starting over, we said two cuts in January, but out the window maybe there's three, but that third cut happens late in the fourth quarter, number one. And number two, we are close to neutral from an asset sensitivity perspective. So that 3.05% to 3.10% feels very good and very comfortable with respect to delivering that range. The terminal rate of about 3.50% getting out into '26 and '27 puts us into the middle of our 3.25% to 3.50% net interest margin range. You'll see on the slide there in the back where we articulate that outlook. And so, 2026 also just one other thing to add in case there's any follow-ups, the net interest margin growth in '25 is very comfortable and we feel good about it. It maybe implies about 15 basis points year-over-year. 2026 is a significant amount of tailwinds associated with some accelerating trends and much of the time-based benefit actually really starts to kick in, in '26, and that's something to keep an eye on also.
Ebrahim Poonawala: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Manan Gosalia: Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. One was, on loan growth, can you talk about how much of the loan growth over the past year has come from NDFI loans and how you're thinking about the credit risk of that portfolio?
John Woods: Yeah. I mean, I'll start off and Don may add in here. I mean, there is -- we do have exposure like many of our peers do into the NBFI space. It's part of our -- the ecosystem of interacting in the private credit space and the private capital construct that we do a very good job of covering. I would say that, I'd hasten to add that the credit exposure for the places where we play is very low. You think about the kind of interactions that we do in whether it's business credit intermediaries or in the private equity space, that credit profile has been very low over time.
Don McCree: Yeah, I agree with that. And the growth hasn't been massive in terms of actually adding exposure. We've seen a little bit of growth due to higher utilization. So, you see that coming through in the numbers a little bit, but we very much like the structures that we have in place, both for the private equity complex and the private credit complex, and they're both kind of investment grade like in terms of their credit profile. So, very low losses, very strong structures, ABS kind of structures, particularly in private credit, and we feel very good about those exposures. And the other important thing is back to everything we're doing in the NBFI space, it's about a broad relationship. So, we're doing multiple different things with each of the people that we're lending to. So, it's not as if we're going out there and building a loan book. We're doing M&A with a lot of these complexes. We're actually distributing some of the private credit funds into our Private Bank and Wealth Management areas now. So, there's a lot of different relationship orientation and we're very selective in terms of the underlying clients that we'll actually bank.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. I would just add two other points of color. One is that the definitions for this category are changing a little bit. And so, some exposures that might not have been considered NBFI are now getting pushed into that a little bit. So, it's hard to do long period of time straight apples-to-apples comparisons, but I think once we get through the reclassification process, then going forward, have more continuity in those forecasts. The other thing is that where we are growing somewhat is in the Private Bank. And so that's a little bit of a different kind of complementary perspective to some of the bigger funds that Don's folks are covering. So, Brendan, I don't know if you want to add that, but we're making capacity there for kind of PE and VC funds where we know those firms extremely well and we want to be the bank to the fund complex and the partners if those firms. And so that's really good business. That was always really good business at First Republic, and we're growing that business here.
Brendan Coughlin: Yeah. The credit structures, as Don mentioned, we believe are well structured with incredibly low risk. One-year subscription lines, so the duration of it, we can -- if there's anything that we see that is worrisome, we can move on pretty quickly. We also in the Private Bank won't do the credit unless we have their operating cash management relationship. And so, a very deep relationship with the firm with strong underwriting and then eyes all over cash flows and the whole community that we're banking. So, we feel good about the exposure.
Manan Gosalia: Very helpful. And then, as my follow-up, just on the non-core loan sale in the first quarter, how should we think about the benefit to NIM from that sale? I know the year-end NIM guide is relatively unchanged. So, I was wondering if there's some offsets there, if there's a higher probability that you can hit the higher end of that guide?
John Woods: Yeah. We had anticipated that we would have an opportunity to accelerate in 2025. So that was included in the January guide broadly. So, the 3.05% to 3.10% is already incorporated this sale. So...
Bruce Van Saun: You may recall that on the first quarter call, I hinted that we were working on acceleration. So, we were pretty far down the track that we would get something done. So, when we had the guide, we had assumed that. So, it's not that dramatic of a lift to NIM, but we'll pick up basis points here and there. It all adds up and builds our path towards hitting those year-end numbers, those fourth quarter numbers.
Manan Gosalia: Perfect. Thank you.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. All right. Well, I think that brings us to the end of the call. Thanks again everyone for dialing in today. We appreciate your continued interest and support. Have a great day.
Operator: That concludes the Citizens Financial Group first quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-17 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ivy, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Lovin Thomas, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Lovin, you may begin.
Lovin Thomas: Thank you, Ivy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm stepping in today for Kristin, who is out sick. First this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our fourth quarter and full-year earnings presentation located on our investor relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page two of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on page three of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. And with that, I will hand it over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, thanks, Thomas. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. We were pleased to finish the year with a strong quarter as our financial results reflect good sequential revenue growth led by NIM expansion and capital markets fees, positive operating leverage, favorable credit trends, and a robust balance sheet across capital, liquidity and LDR. We are still seeing subdued loan demand, but we've more than compensated for that with 10 basis points of NIM expansion that drove sequential NII growth of 3%. Fees grew sequentially by 6%, paced by capital markets and mortgage. While expense growth was 3.5%, paced by hiring in private bank, private wealth, and commercial middle market, we still delivered positive operating leverage of around 50 basis points. Our credit trends are looking favorable with NPAs down sequentially, criticized assets trending down, and no surprises in charge-offs as we work through our CRE office portfolio. Given these trends and the contraction in loan balances, we added $162 million to our provision against $189 million in charge-offs, and our ACL-to-loan ratio increased slightly to 1.62%. We currently expect that the credit trends should continue and that we should be able to see credit costs come down in 2025. We continue to repurchase shares in the quarter $225 million, bringing the full-year total to $1.05 billion. We repurchased 28 million shares in 2024, or 6% of the beginning of year balance. With respect to execution of our key initiatives, we made further progress across the private bank, our New York City metro strategy, serving private capital, and growing our payments business. BSO efforts saw a reduction in non-core loans of $4.2 billion in 2024 with a remaining balance of $6.9 billion. We are looking for opportunities to accelerate the rundown, so stay tuned on that. In addition, we made further progress in exiting low-returning relationships in C&I and in reducing overall CRE loans. Our TOP 9 program was executed well, delivering $150 million in annualized Q4 run rate benefits, and we've launched TOP 10 with a target benefit of $100 million. The private bank, private wealth progress is worth spotlighting. The business continues to ramp up nicely, growing the customer base and hitting all financial targets. We reached $7 billion in deposits, $3.1 billion in loans, and $4.7 billion in AUM, and we were profitable in the quarter. We are confident in our ability to meet or exceed our goal of having this business be 5% accretive to our bottom line in 2025. And we added a banking team to Southern California in Q4 and this morning we announced an additional wealth team in South Florida. For the full-year 2024, we hit most line items in our beginning of year guide, that's shown on slide 34 with the exception of balance sheet volume. That said, we were able to repurchase more shares given the lack of loan demand. Turning to our 2025 outlook, we expect solid growth in NII given further NIM expansion and a resumption of modest net loan growth. Fees should grow nicely, paced by capital markets and wealth. We have confidence in this revenue outlook, so we'll step up investments in OpEx and CapEx to support key growth initiatives. We anticipate attractive positive operating leverage for the full-year of around 1.5%. Credit costs are projected to improve year-on-year, and we expect to see reserve releases continue throughout the year. We will manage our CET 1 ratio above the high end of our 10% to 10.5% range, given ongoing uncertainty, but we expect to continue with regular share repurchases. We've included some slides on our medium-term outlook and how the drag from our legacy swap portfolio will dissipate with time. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our medium-term 16% to 18% ROTCE target. Exciting time for Citizens. Our strategy rests on a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned super regional commercial bank, and the aspiration to have the premier bank-owned private bank. We've made steady progress and will continue to execute with the financial and operating discipline you've come to expect from us. I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering a great effort in 2024. We know we can count on you again this year. So with that, let me turn it over to John.
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. As Bruce indicated, we delivered results in 2024 that were broadly in line with our expectations at the beginning of the year. 3Q was our trough quarter, 4Q was a nice bounce back, and we are well positioned for growth in 2025. On slide six, you can see that we delivered underlying EPS of $3.24 for 2024, which includes a $0.45 drag from non-core and a net $0.05 investment in the private bank. Full-year ROTCE was 10.5%, which was 12% excluding these items. Despite loan volumes being lower than expected given market dynamics, net interest income came in broadly in line with our expectations for the year, down 9.7% as we delivered a full-year margin of 2.85%. Fees were up a strong 9%, led by a pick-up in capital markets, card and wealth fees, while expenses were managed tightly, up only 1.5%, notwithstanding meaningful investments to support the build out of the private bank and private wealth. We also manage to alter an uncertain credit environment, maintaining strong reserve coverage levels with credit losses coming right in line with our expectations at the start of the year. The transformation of our deposit franchise since our IPO became clear in 2024, as we managed through a very competitive environment against a backdrop of rapidly rising rates. Our deposit cost performance is better than the peer average, a meaningful improvement compared with prior rate cycles. And with the latest Fed rate cuts, we have aggressively lowered deposit costs in 4Q. Importantly, our financial strength has allowed us to execute well against our strategic initiatives, providing momentum as we head into 2025. We've opportunistically built out the private bank, which has raised $7 billion of deposits through the end of the year and as expected became profitable in the fourth quarter. We also continue to make solid progress building out our New York City metro franchise. We are investing in our payments platform and we are solidifying our commercial middle market coverage with investments in key expansion markets that complement our private bank success. I'll start with some of the highlights of the fourth quarter financial results referencing slides five and seven before we get into the details. We generated underlying net income of $412 million, EPS of $0.85, and ROTCE of 10.7%. This includes a negative $0.10 impact from the non-core portfolio, which will continue to steadily run off, creating a tailwind for overall performance going forward. As I mentioned, the private bank contributed to earnings in the fourth quarter, adding about a $0.01 to EPS. Importantly, we've returned to positive sequential operating leverage in the fourth quarter with a nice lift in NII and fees, even as we made important investments in the private bank and private wealth and added commercial middle market bankers in key expansion markets. We ended the year in a very strong balance sheet position with CET1 at 10.8% or 9.1% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal, a pro forma Category 1 LCR of 119%, and an ACL coverage ratio of 1.62%, up from 1.61% in the prior quarter. This includes a robust 12.4% coverage for general office, up from 12.1% in the prior quarter. We also executed $225 million in stock buybacks during the quarter. Next, I'll talk through the fourth quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on slide eight. NII was up 3.1% linked quarter, reflecting a higher net interest margin and slightly lower interest earning assets. As you can see from the NIM walk at the bottom of the slide, our margin was up 10 basis points to 2.87%, reflecting the benefit of non-core runoff, fixed rate asset repricing, and better deposit and loan betas, partially offset by our net asset-sensitive position as rates declined. With the Fed cutting rates to the end of the year, we executed our down rate playbook, reducing rates ahead of the cuts and bringing down higher cost deposit balances. Our cumulative interest bearing deposit down beta was about 50% better than our initial expectation. Moving to slide nine, fees were up 5.6% linked quarter, primarily driven by an improvement in capital markets. Capital markets saw strong loan syndication activity and a pickup in M&A, which benefited from seasonality and a general improvement in the environment. Debt underwriting was lower coming off a strong third quarter. Mortgage banking fees reflect higher MSR valuation with overall operating results remaining stable. The wealth business delivered a solid quarter with good momentum and AUM growth from the private bank, but that was offset by lower transactional sales activity. On slide 10, expenses were up 3.5% linked-quarter, primarily reflecting hiring for the private bank and private wealth build out and commercial middle market bankers to complement our private bank footprint in Southern California and Florida. Our TOP 9 program achieved a $150 million pre-tax run rate benefit exiting the year, which is above our original target of $135 million. And we have launched our TOP 10 program, which is targeting $100 million in run rate efficiencies by the end of 2025. On slide 11, average loans were down slightly and period-end loans were down 1.7% linked-quarter. This reflects the non-core portfolio runoff of approximately $900 million, a decline in commercial loans given paydowns in C&I and CRE against a backdrop of low client demand and lower line utilization. The private bank continues to make nice progress with period end loans up about $1.1 billion to $3.1 billion at the end of the year. Next, on slides 12 and 13, we continue to do a good job on deposits in a very competitive and dynamic environment. Period-end deposits were broadly stable linked-quarter with attractive growth in retail in the private bank offset by the continued pay down of higher cost treasury and commercial deposits. This was primarily tied to non-core loan run down and a proactive effort to optimize the liquidity value of deposits. The private bank continues to add customers and grow nicely with period end deposits up about $1.4 billion to $7 billion at the end of the year. Our retail franchise did a nice job raising deposits this quarter in low-cost categories, and importantly, we've seen strong retention as the CD portfolio turns over at lower rates. We also grew non-interest-bearing deposits by about $940 million linked-quarter driven by the private bank and seasonal flows in commercial. Combined our non-interest-bearing and low-cost deposits increased to 42% of total deposits in the fourth quarter. Overall, our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a very competitive environment. Our interest-bearing deposit costs are down 31 basis points linked-quarter, which translates to a 50% cumulative down beta. Moving to credit on slide 14, as expected, net charge-offs were broadly stable at 53 basis points, compared with 54 basis points in the prior quarter. A decline in C&I charge-offs was offset by an increase in commercial real estate primarily coming from the general office portfolio. Retail charge-offs were stable. Of note, non-accrual loans were down slightly, reflecting a decline in commercial given the resolution of a number of general office loans. Criticized loans were meaningfully lower in the fourth quarter, following relative stability over the past few quarters. We continue to make consistent progress in working out the general office portfolio with limited new inflows and to work out. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide 15. Our overall coverage ratio increased slightly linked-quarter to 1.62%, primarily reflecting the denominator effect of lower portfolio balances. While we maintain strong reserve coverage for certain portfolios such as general office, our overall reserve declined slightly in light of a broadly stable macroeconomic outlook and improving loan mix giving the runoff of non-core auto portfolio and originations in retail, real estate secured and commercial categories that have a lower loss content profile. The reserve for the $2.9 billion general office portfolio is $364 million, which represents a coverage of 12.4%, up from 12.1% in the third quarter as the portfolio continues to reduce. Note that the cumulative charge-offs plus the current reserve translates to an expected loss rate of about 20% against the March 2023 loan balance when industry losses commenced. Moving to slide 16, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio strengthened to 10.8%, which compares with 10.6% in the prior quarter. Adjusting for the AOCI opt-out removal, our CET1 ratio was relatively steady at 9.1%, despite the impact of higher long-term interest rates on AOCI in the quarter. Given our strong capital position, we repurchased $225 million in common shares and including dividends we returned a total of $413 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter. Over the full-year, we repurchased $1.05 billion in common shares, representing $28.1 million or about 6% of our beginning of year outstanding shares at an average price of $37.35 per share. Turning to slide 17, we view our overall strategy in three parts, a transformed consumer bank; the best positioned commercial bank amongst our regional peers; and our aspiration to build the premier bank-owned private bank and private wealth franchise. Slides 18 to 20 provide some updates on our positioning and progress, which you can read at your convenience. Note on slide 20, we've updated our private bank targets for 2025, given the success we've had to-date. We bumped deposits from $11 billion to $12 billion, and AUM from $10 billion to $11 billion. We adjusted loans to $7 billion, given the impact of higher rates on borrowing demand. We are tracking well to meet or exceed our 5% accretion estimate to Citizens bottom line in 2025. On slide 21, we provide an update on some of the tremendous progress in New York, since we made a play there about three years ago with HSBC's East Coast branches and Investors Bank. Moving [Technical Difficulty] Fed Funds rate of 4% and a 10-year treasury rate of 4.5% to 4.75%. We expect NII to be up 3% to 5%, driven primarily by an increase in NIM to about 3% for the year. We project spot loan growth in the low-single-digits overall and mid-single-digits excluding non-core. Loan growth will be impacted by non-core runoff, paydowns, and more selective originations in CRE and muted commercial loan demand early in 2025. We expect C&I to pick up in the second-half of the year as new money gets put to work. Private banks should see consistent loan growth throughout the year. We expect average loans will be down roughly 2% to 3% and overall earning assets to be down about 1%, which reflects the extent of the 2H ‘24 drop and continuing non-core runoff. Non-interest income is expected to be up in the 8% to 10% range, led by capital markets and wealth. We are projecting expenses to be up about 4% as we are confident in our revenue outlook and want to step up our investments and growth initiatives after a constrained 2024. Excluding the private bank and private wealth, the increase in expenses would be about 2.6%. We have provided a walk showing the key components of our 2025 expense outlook on slide 23. When you put the revenue and expense outlook together, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for 2025 of roughly 150 basis points. Our outlook for net charge-offs is to trend down to approximately $650 million to $700 million or high-40s in basis point terms. We will continue to work through the general office portfolio and given macro trends, the remixing of the balance sheet, and expectations for modest spot portfolio growth, we will likely see ACL releases over the course of the year. And finally, we expect to end the year with a strong CET1 ratio in the 10.5% to 10.75% range, which is above our medium term operating range of 10% to 10.5%, given the continued uncertainty in the macro environment. As we monitor the market environment and loan growth levels, we will opportunistically engage in share repurchases. It's worth noting that loan growth was below expectations in 2024 and we were able to offset the impact of share repurchases and less pressure on deposit costs. We would use the same playbook in 2025 if needed. On slide 25, we provide the guide for the first quarter. Note that the first quarter has seasonal impacts on revenue, namely capital markets fees, lower day count, reducing net interest income, and taxes on FICA reset and compensation payouts impacting expenses. Credit trends are expected to improve and we should end the first quarter with CET1 in the range of 10.5% to 10.75% with a good amount of share repurchases. Moving to slides 27 to 28, as we look out over the medium term, we have a clear path to achieving our 16% to 18% ROTCE target. Expanding our net interest margin is an important part of improving our ROTCE, which we project to be in the 3.25% to 3.5% range in 2027. However, given our balance sheet positioning and our asset sensitivity, if the Fed maintains an elevated Fed funds rate at or above 4%, this will help to deliver a NIM level at the upper end of our range or higher. On slide 28, we provide a walk to our target 16% to 18% ROTCE. We have significant NII tailwind driven by non-rate dependent terminated swaps amortization and non-core runoff, which will generate about 300 to 400 basis points of ROTCE through 2027. We add roughly another 100 basis points with the net impact of other dynamics such as positive fixed asset repricing, the runoff of legacy active swaps, and the offsetting impact of our naturally asset sensitive balance sheet. That puts you into the 15% to 16% range. We expect to generate solid returns from our legacy core business plus the successful execution of the private bank and other key initiatives I talked about earlier, which should drive meaningful revenue growth, generate positive annual operating leverage, and improving our efficiency ratio, which will add another 200 to 300 basis points to ROTCE. We should see some benefit from credit where we have been over-providing today versus a more normal environment, with charge-offs improving to the low to mid-30s basis points, reflective of the improved mix of the portfolio with less auto-increase and more private bank loans and C&I. AOCI impacts are providing a ROTCE benefit today, which should normalize with time. This impact will partially offset with share repurchases. In short, we feel very confident in our ability to achieve the 16% to 18% medium-term target. To wrap up, we delivered a solid performance in 2024, broadly in line with expectations. Importantly, we turned the quarter on net interest margin, delivered improving capital markets results, and remained disciplined on expenses, returning to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with a strong capital liquidity and credit position that puts us in an excellent position to drive forward with our strategic priorities. We are well positioned for 2025, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver our medium term 16% to 18% return targets. With that, I'll hand it over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, thank you, John. Ivy, let's open it up for some Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Scott Siefers: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Let's see, John, maybe wanted to start on sort of that medium-term margin outlook? Can you just sort of add some additional context on what gave you the confidence to bump up the top end of that medium-term range to basically the extra error between the 3.40% and the 3.50% at the top end of the range, please?
John Woods: Yes, sure. I think the main reason for that is just the outlook on rates. I'd say that when you think about where we were last quarter and in prior quarters, you know, the Fed was landing in a terminal, you know, rate that was well below 4% when we put this together previously. Now, when you see the Fed, you see the bond market discounting something closer to 4%, we've basically widened the expectation of range that you could see at the upper end. So 3% would be sort of consistent with our floor of 3.25%. But 4%, given our asset sensitive balance sheet, would be more consistent with a higher number than the 3.40%, we showed last quarter. And you may recall last quarter we said that, hey, a 3.50%-ish or a 3.75% Fed would be consistent with 3.40%. But now the Fed, you know, could land somewhere near 4%, and so that's the main reason why we, you know, we raised that. I think there are other reasons too. I mean, just getting, you see the confidence. We have a growing confidence based on our performance in the fourth quarter with a very solid 10 basis point increase in NIM. We've continued to opportunistically hedge to reduce the impact of rates falling into the future. So just a number of positive benefits that we were able to see that gave us the confidence to increase the upper end to 3.50%.
Scott Siefers: Got it. Perfect. Thank you for that. And then separately, I was hoping you could help to put in a little bit more context, sort of the higher fourth quarter costs and investments. I mean, I certainly understand them in light of what you're building with the private bank, but just maybe curious about where you stand such that you're confident that costs can hold more firm after that small additional lift that we would expect in the first quarter?
John Woods: Yes. I mean, I would say we did -- we put something in the slide deck there on slide 23 that you can take a look at. I mean, I think in 4Q for the full-year, but in 4Q, you know, we've been investing in the private bank all along and just given how well that's performed, that gave us the confidence to continue to invest and maybe accelerate some investments in the private bank through team advisor lift outs and also in the commercial bank where we're investing in our capabilities in Southern California and Florida. So a combination of those two things is what caused our expense number to be up a bit in 4Q. And maybe, Bruce, you want to add to that?
Bruce Van Saun: I'd also just add to that, Scott. For the full-year, we were still on our guide range of 1% to 1.5%. And so what I would say is that 2024, given some of the built-in revenue trajectory was a year where I think all banks, including ourselves, had to be very, very disciplined on expenses. When you start to see that revenue is improving, the revenue outlook is improving, which we saw that occurring in Q4, and we can see more visibility into revenue strength into next year than some of the things that you may be deferred that are really attractive investment cases, you start to lean in again a bit. So we started that process a bit in Q4. When you look at next year, we'll be guiding to about a 4%. But again, if you strip out the impact of private bank and private wealth, which we want to continue to, there's a great opportunity there to fill that void in the market. We want to keep disciplined investing into that, the rest of bank is down at roughly 2.5%. And so the top program usually provides about a 1% benefit. So we're leaning in a little bit across some attractive investment opportunities across the rest of bank, but still the overall numbers are kind of in a position where we should have quite a bit of confidence we can deliver positive operating leverage in 2025.
Scott Siefers: Perfect. All right. Thank you very much.
Bruce Van Saun: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead.
Erika Najarian: Yes. Hi, good morning. I just wanted to think about some of the dynamics that are more strategic than mechanical on the margin improvement, John. Give us a sense in terms of how you're thinking about deposit growth and the mix of that deposit growth and also sort of what the repricing cadence looks like? And given that the neutral rate seems to be settling around 4%, does the pacing change? Is the beta fast first and then slow down as loan growth comes back?
John Woods: Yes, a couple of comments related to that. I mean, I think strategic opportunities to grow deposits, you know, you see what we've been able to do with the private bank and we've raised our target there. You know, our performance in the last rate tightening cycle has been better than average and we've seen our opportunities to grow low cost actually be better than what we're seeing in a lot of our industry peers. So the core retail franchise is performing extremely well. The idiosyncratic opportunities in New York Metro and private bank are adding on top of that. And our commercial business is driving DDA growth as well. So from a strategic standpoint, the deposit franchise is an incredibly solid foundation as we head into this potential easing cycle. I mean, I think when you look at betas, we did outperform our own expectations in the fourth quarter with betas around 50%. When we were originally thinking around 40%, based on the rate outlook, we expect that betas can continue to increase. So we went with the earlier beta is we did get out of the gate pretty quickly and I think later, our opportunity to grow beta from here, we're going to end up seeing our betas get to low to mid-50%s, maybe by the time you get to a terminal 4%, so that you can do the math there on what the sequential betas look like, but feeling incredibly confident in the underpinning of the NIM trajectory given the deposit franchise.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, maybe ask Brendan to comment a little bit about deposits.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes, thanks for the question, Erica. Maybe a quick point on private, and I'll talk for a minute about core retail deposits. On private, our low cost deposits remain around 40%, so DDA [Indiscernible], despite the pretty, pretty healthy growth, the quality of the deposit book has been very consistent and very accretive to the overall mix to Citizens. And we expect that, while that could pull back a little bit, we expect the accretion mix to still be very strong throughout 2025. So that growth will both be in quantity and quality for the overall franchise, which is great. On the retail book, I've mentioned this on most every call, but the full-year performance for the retail portfolio was very, very strong against peers with benchmarks that we look at. We think we're somewhere in the range of 150 basis points better than peer average on low cost deposits, which is again largely DDA and [Indiscernible]. Our DDA book, the outflows sort of stopped around August, September, and we've been flattening out. We saw some very modest growth at the back half of Q4, including a pretty sizable tick up in [Indiscernible] in the back half of Q4. So the strength there is still very good. We believe we were indexed probably number one in the regional bank peer set, and retail banking core DDA growth for the full-year 2024. And there's nothing that I see that suggests that we won't continue to outperform peers on our relative low cost deposit performance. The other thing I would say is we've been very, very successful in our CD book turning over at lower yields with high retention. So in Q4 we had about $5.5 billion in CDs in the retail book turnover with over a 90% retention rate. And those CDs are coming in at about 100 basis points better in yield. And so when I look at the first-half of the year, we've got a little bit more at the $14 billion in CDs on the retail book that will also turn over. So that should give us some dry powder to drive those yields lower. And we expect to retain the vast majority of those balances, largely in deposits, with some trickling out into support for the wealth business and going into managed money in AUM. But that gives us a good amount of dry powder for thinking about the first-half of the year of bringing deposit yields in the CD book down.
Bruce Van Saun: Great.
Erika Najarian: Great. That's helpful. And just secondly, just a quick follow-up, and I just wanted to ask a bigger question of Bruce. One, John, given all those elements and the fact that you're entering at 2.87% for the year and you have a 3% net interest margin guide for the full-year, does that mean the exit is somewhere between 3% to 3.10%? And if so, Bruce, that tees you up for a very strong year, not just mechanically but strategically. I think the question that I was getting this morning is where are we in terms of the investment horizon with regard to the private bank and the private wealth initiative? In other words, you're setting up for great NII growth in 2026 and investors are wondering if you're going to continue to front load some of the investment spend in the wealth and private bank initiative?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. So just to your favorite question, exit rate on NIM, I would bump that up a little bit and say probably more like 3.05% to 3.10%. So that's that. Just in terms of how we think about the private bank, we've launched this back in the middle of ’23. And it's been a tremendous effort to get folks in place and support them appropriately and have them transition in customers. And it's been a really great success story, certainly not the finished article, more to do to get to White Glove Service, but feeling good about the trajectory that we're on. I want to just make it clear, though, that we're very committed to delivering our financial commitments on this business. We want to demonstrate that it is a profitable business that can deliver attractive returns and we're running it a bit differently than the way it ran at First Republic. So we have some guardrails around the kind of nature of the business we want to take on and the spreads we hope to achieve et cetera, et cetera. Over, you know, one thing that we wanted to deliver this year was to be profitable in the fourth quarter. We said we'd be profitable in the second-half of the year. We got to that in August. We had enough headroom that we felt confident that we could add another team in Southern California. As you know, Erika, when you bring in these private banking teams, they show up and they're all expenses initially, and then over time they transition in customers, and then the lines cross and they become profitable. So we still delivered a profitable fourth quarter, about a $0.01 of EPS. And so when we look at next year, depending on how fast that business is growing if we're hitting our targets, there may be opportunities to add additional teams, while still delivering the profitability of the 5% accretive to the bottom line. And by the way, that translates, now we're starting to get up towards that 20% ROTCE target for the business already by the end of next year. So we're keeping those guardrails in place as we grow the business. But you know, it's, there's such a big opportunity there. There's some great people out there who want to join the platform that we have to be thinking about and how to fill the void in the market and really build a great franchise. So I think we have that balance right and you can expect us to be disciplined in how we approach that and I'd like to see if we're running faster than projected that we're going to be leaning in and adding some additional teams. The wealth teams typically are accretive right from the get-go. So those we can keep doing throughout the year. It's more kind of the private banking locations, PBOs, and additional teams that we just need to fit into the overall financial dynamic that we're trying to deliver.
Erika Najarian: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Just on the timing of the ROTCE targets that you laid out, medium term, is that implied for 2027 or just on the liquidity on that?
Bruce Van Saun: And which targets, the MTO, the…
Matt O'Connor: Sorry, your -- sorry the 16% to 18% medium term. Any way to frame the timing?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, well, I think the medium term to us is by 2027 and, you know, we'll be on an arc upwards arc through ‘25 and ‘26 in order to get to that destination. So I don't necessarily want to put a pin in it as to whether we could get there in ‘26. There's possible scenarios that that could happen, but certainly by ‘27 we feel quite confident that we'll be there, Matt.
Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then you laid out the waterfall in terms of how you get there, and just to clarify, the operating leverage of 1.5% this year, obviously there's a nice improvement in that in the next couple of years to support that ROTCE level, right?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I think clearly as we continue to see the benefit of the kind of swap runoff and non-core runoff and the NIM lift, that really juices your positive operating leverage. And that, there's a big, you know, there's some contribution from that in ‘25, but it actually accelerates in ‘26. And so we would expect positive operating leverage to be even more in 2026.
Matt O'Connor: Okay, thank you.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Gerard Cassidy: Hey Bruce. Hi John. How are you?
Bruce Van Saun: Hi, good.
Gerard Cassidy: Bruce, can we take a step back for a moment? Obviously, we have a new administration coming in, and we're going to get a number of new heads of the different regulatory agencies. Maybe the most important change coming from the Vice Chair of safety and soundness at the Fed, with Barr stepping down about two weeks ago. When you look at it, how are you kind of thinking about what can change to the benefit for not just Citizens for the banking industry? What are you looking or hoping for that these new leaders can come in and really enable the banking industry to the Treasury Secretary nominee in his testimony get the banks more involved in the U.S. economy?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Well, I think we've started to make some headway already on that this year, Gerard, as some of the proposals that were a response to what happened in 2023 seem to be kind of overdone, overcooked in terms of, you know, changes to capital liquidity and funding frameworks that I think the industry pushed back and thought that they needed to be dialed back. And we were starting to make progress on that in any event. So I do think like putting that to bed and coming up with what are the final Basel III capital rules, what are we going to do with liquidity, what are we going to do with funding, and making sure that tailoring remains central to how the framework is set. That's kind of job one on the prudential side. I would say the other benefits could be just a refreshed look at supervision. There's a lot of folks who work really hard and we get really good advice and input from the supervisors, but sometimes things get overcooked a bit and you lose the forest for the trees. So just kind of making sure that, that is focused at the right level and trees is up to, have a little more flexibility in how we operate. That could be positive as well. And I'd say some of the pressure on fees that we've seen come out of the CFPB, they're not always net beneficial. They may make good headlines, but squeezing a balloon and you close down this and then the banks have to make a return, so they have to charge somewhere else. And so just having a, kind of, a more insightful view as to how to allow banks to operate with well-disclosed fees that actually benefit their customers, as opposed to constantly pushing on that. That would also be helpful. And then I'd say last thing, there's probably a need for more consolidation in the industry, particularly at the smaller end of the spectrum. And so kind of taking the sand out of the gears on that and allowing that to take place with more certainty, I think that would also benefit the industry. So I think a number of all that should allow banks to continue to have the capital to lean in, support economic growth. I think we've done a good job of that, and we want to continue to be able to do that.
Gerard Cassidy: Just quickly, in what you just said, Bruce, consolidation at the smaller end of the spectrum, how do you define smaller end? $10 billion in less asset-sized banks or something smaller?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I don't know where to draw that line, but certainly, you know, I'd say banks that are even in the 25 to 50 category just have a lot of investing to do to keep up with technology changes, business model going digital, cyber defenses, a lot of regulation. And so I just think there's a lot of great banks in that size category, but ultimately I think there'll be some, who feel that they can gain some benefits from scale. And so I think if the framework were more certain that you'd start to see consolidation all the way through from the very smallest banks, maybe up to those smaller regionals.
Gerard Cassidy: Great. And then as a follow-up question, can you guys, you give us very good detail on your commercial real estate portfolio and how you're working through the issues that the industry confronts on commercial real estate office in particular. Can you give us an update on using the baseball vernacular? What inning do you think we're in, in getting through this kind of pig in the python situation in commercial real estate and specifically office?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I'm going to start and turn it over to Don, but I'd say when we saw this happening, it kind of kicked off in the early part of ‘23 and we said this is a multi-year process to kind of work this out just based on the nature of the terms of the leases and kind of return to office dynamics, et cetera, that this was going to take a lot of play out. And so we've seen that consistently through the rest of ‘23 through ‘24. I think looking into ‘25 will still be in workout mode, but I think we're probably past the midpoint at this point, so maybe middle innings of the game and hopefully you know we see that start to really drop off as we exit ‘25. But I'll leave it over to Don.
Don McCree: Yes, Gerard, I think that's right. I'll channel my Bob Uecker, since we're memorializing him and you're analogizing baseball. But I think the good news on the real estate side, as Bruce said, we still have kind of ‘25 to work through. We are seeing almost no incremental deterioration based on the entirety of the portfolio over the last year or so. So everything like we've identified as problematic, needing to go through the workout cycle, estimation of losses is pretty much playing out as we expected. And we are getting toward the back end, as Bruce said, in ‘25. The good news is across the board in the real estate complex is liquidity is really coming back. And we're seeing, you know, this not necessarily in the office portfolio, but in the rest of the real estate portfolio. And that can ripple over as we get into later portions of ’25. So we're seeing the CMBS market very active, we're seeing the life companies very active, we're getting taken out of criticized assets at par, you know, in the non-office space, but in the multifamily space. So there are a lot of kind of encouraging signs that we're seeing across the board. And I think as John said in his remarks, we're seeing no new migration into our workout team. So there's a lot to be a little bit more optimistic about. We've got a ways to go to work out. And interestingly, a lot of the sponsors think that there's some, you know, brightness at the end of the tunnel. So they're dribbling in cash to keep the properties alive, because they think there might be an opportunity down the road. So it's elongating the workout cycle a little bit more than past cycles. But I think we feel like we have a really good handle on it and it's trending reasonably consistent with lower expectation.
Bruce Van Saun: And John, you have a stat. So the overall criticized assets came down sharply in the fourth quarter led by the drop in CRE.
John Woods: Exactly, yes, criticized levels down significantly. And overall, actually overall criticized is down 17% led by a reduction in general office, so that's great news.
Bruce Van Saun: That was in the order of like 30%.
John Woods: Yes, exactly, we got that. And Don mentioned inflows to outflows have really flipped around rather than inflows exceeding outflows. That's flipped around in the fourth quarter significantly. So inflows slow to a trickle and then upgrades outpace all of that in the fourth quarter. So turning the corner in the game back to the imagery was nice to see in 4Q.
Gerard Cassidy: Appreciate all the color. Thank you.
Bruce Van Saun: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Manan Gosalia: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the belly of the curve. How much of an impact does that have on both the asset and the liability side of the balance sheet? So I'm thinking from an asset side it gives you some more benefit from fixed asset repricing, but on the liability side maybe it makes it a little bit harder to drop those CD rates further. Is that something you guys are focusing on? You know, does it, is there a risk that if the belly of the curve keeps moving higher, could that weigh on some of those deposit betas from here?
John Woods: Yes, I'll go ahead. I appreciate the question. I'll comment on that. I mean, I'd broadly just make the point that we're asset sensitive, and we're basically asset sensitive across all of the key rates across the curve for the most part. When you look at the belly of the curve, that's actually driving our fixed asset repricing and when you see our net interest margin progression through time, that's consistently a positive. And so on a net basis, if the belly of the curve is rising, we're net beneficiaries of that. You know, on the funding side, when you think about CDs, you know, that out of the gate that's typically in a less than a one-year term, that can turn over. But net-net, our asset repricing would overcome even if the belly of the curve was consistently higher, that would be a net positive for us through time. And you can see that in our net interest margin. We've built in the curve that we see basically out the window through the medium term progression. And the fixed rate asset repricing is 15 to 20 basis points. You know, by the time you get to 2027 and that's consistently building through ‘25 into ‘26 and ‘27. So that's a net positive. I think the only place that our funding comes into play on the belly is maybe in the senior debt space. And we're really well positioned there. We're north of 4% of our WA. And so that's not a huge driver for us. But again, the asset sensitivity, higher rates basically is a net positive for us.
Manan Gosalia: Yes, I'm just thinking with you guys were actually ahead of the curve when the Fed was cutting rates and you were able to drop those deposit rates sooner. So I'm just thinking now that there's not as many rate cuts in the forward curve and the belly of the curve is higher, whether that's weighing on deposit costs at all?
John Woods: Yes, no, as I mentioned, we'll be able to get deposit betas up to the low to mid-50s from where we are today at around 50%. And if -- and that's based on the curve that where we have a cut in the second quarter and a cut in the fourth quarter. If, however, there are no cuts in 2025, our deposit betas would flatten out, but that's a net positive for us, because of our net floating position and loan yields would more than make up for the fact that deposit betas might not be quite as high, because we're asset sensitive. And I should mention that our asset sensitivity actually grows in ‘25 and ‘26 and ‘27. So on an all-in basis, our net interest margin is a beneficiary of rates being higher, because loan yields more than offset what the impact on deposit data might be because we're overall asset sensitive.
Manan Gosalia: Got it. Perfect. Thank you. And if I can just ask a follow-up on loan growth. You're looking for mid-single-digit spot loan growth, excluding non-core loans. Can you talk about the catalyst there? And also like where do you see loan growth coming from? Is it sponsors? Is it traditional middle market? Is it both?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I'll start and then John can give you more details. But I think we have been quite disciplined in making sure that where we're putting out loan capital that we're getting good returns. And so we haven't really sought to force the action. In fact, we've, through balance sheet optimization, have actually exited a number of relationships. In commercial, we're certainly trying to run down the CRE book a little bit, and then we have non-core set up to run down assets. I think the catalyst that we're looking for to actually get back to loan growth, which is certainly desired and desirable. The main building block here, the private bank, is I think likely to put on about $1 billion a quarter to get to the targets at the end of the year. So that's pretty idiosyncratic to us in having a startup business that's growing that we can count on for that kind of growth and not only in loans, but also in deposits. So if you take out that growth, then the spot loan growth drops, John, from mid-single-digits down to low-single-digits or something like that. So I think we're not really calling for any aggressive resumption in loan growth. We're anticipating that things will be relatively subdued, continuing into the first-half of the year, and then start to pick up in the second-half of the year in commercials. So we saw line utilization go down quite a bit in Q4, particularly subscription lines. So that new money deal machine, private equity, putting money to work, waiting for [Indiscernible] on that. That didn't happen in Q4. We don't expect it just because the calendar flipped the page to pick up right away in 2025. But I think that will begin to happen and we'll see all the benefits of that, higher capital markets fees, loan growth that comes along with that. But we're being cautious in terms of how much of that we put in to the forward forecast. And then on consumer, we just have a few of the areas that have consistently been able to grow, mortgage, e-lock, our card business, no great shakes there either, just some moderate level of growth. So, when you look across that, we've got some things running down. We have private banks steady as she goes. We have a resumption in the second-half of commercial and a little lower level of steady as she goes in consumer. So, John, I don't know if you want to add any color to that.
John Woods: No, I just had another point or two to emphasize. I agree with that. We said mid-single-digits, ex-non-core. If you think about a three legs of the stool, you hit all three. But if you private bank on its trajectory really is a huge driver, and is the largest driver getting us to that mid-single-digits. But if you look at it excluding the private bank and excluding non-core, we would be in a low-single-digits trajectory as Bruce mentioned. And when the consumer legacy is half of that and the other half of it is in commercial. Consumer legacy, you mentioned, Bruce, and in commercial, subscription and M&A activities likely to pick up.
Bruce Van Saun: In expansion markets and middle market.
John Woods: Exactly. So we've got expansion markets contributing as we see in 2025. The other important part is subscription line utilization is about as low as we've ever seen it. It's in the low-40s, typically in the mid-50s. And so we see some of that partial, we see some of that coming back, not all the way back. Fund finance, you know, that we've been successful at in the past will contribute, as well as asset-backed. And then, you know, I mean, I would just say that, you know, all of that put together keeps us in a good spot. And as we mentioned earlier, to the extent that this doesn't happen, as we mentioned earlier, we've been able to navigate a lower loan growth environment in ’24 quite well. We would run that playbook back, and you'd see more buybacks out of us with a stock price that's attractive as we see it below intrinsic value. And we'd at the margin likely deliver even better deposit performance, if that were to be the case. So I think we've got some nice optionality in 2025 to stay on our trajectory.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I would just say one final thing is that really the NII guide is as it was, as you saw in the fourth quarter, it's really driven by the NIM expansion. And so it's not as dependent on volume growth in order to deliver that. And then as John said, if you have -- if you don't see the volume growth, you have other levers such as you can repurchase your shares and then you won't push on deposits as much. And so you can be a little more disciplined on your deposit pricing. And so I'd say we feel quite confident overall in that NII guide for next year.
Manan Gosalia: That's really helpful. Appreciate the detail on here. Thank you.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, is that it? I guess that's it for the questions. We've got a lot of banks reporting today, so I hope everybody got a good night sleep last night and it makes it through the day. So thanks again for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day. Take care.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-16 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alan, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.
Kristin Silberberg : Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and CFO, John Woods will provide an overview of our third quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our third quarter earnings presentation located on our investor relations website. After the presentation, we'll be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. And with that, I will hand over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun : Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We continue to execute well through an uncertain environment. We've made good progress on our strategic initiatives, our balance sheet remains strong across capital, liquidity, funding and loan reserves and our profitability has stabilized and is poised to move higher. Let me start with an update on our initiatives. First, the private bank delivered another terrific quarter. We reached $5.6 billion in deposits, up from $4 billion in Q2, and our assets under management reached $4.1 billion. During the quarter, we opened two new private bank offices in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we added a new private banking team to cover Southern California. We reached breakeven in August and September and expect to be profitable in Q4 with good momentum entering 2025. Next, our commercial bank continues to demonstrate its capacity to serve private capital well. For the quarter, we were number two in the league tables for sponsor leveraged loan arrangements and we remain number one over the past 12 months. We continue to add quality talent to our coverage and our capital markets teams. Our New York City Metro initiative continues to show nice growth. We had 5% year-on-year growth in households and 7% growth in deposits. We look forward to being a key sponsor of the upcoming New York City Marathon as we continue to raise our brand profile in the market. We've executed well on TOP 9, achieving a Q4 run rate benefit of $135 million and we're finalizing the details of TOP 10, which should have a $100 million plus run rate benefit by end of 2025. Our BSO actions continue to proceed as planned. Non-core reduced by $1 billion in the quarter and we continue to use the liquidity generated to pay down higher cost funding like brokered CDs. We continue to execute actions in commercial to exit lending-only relationships and we're focused on our medium-term plan to reduce CRE exposure. With respect to our balance sheet, our CET1 ratio is at 10.6%. Adjusting for AOCI puts us at 9.2%. We repurchased $325 million in stock during the quarter. Our spot LDR was 80.8%, and our Federal Home Loan Bank advances remained low at well under $1 billion. We are not seeing much loan demand, but we remain hopeful this should start to pick up in coming quarters. Our P&L was impacted by the drag from forward starting swaps, which commenced in July as well as some fees that pushed out to Q4. Nonetheless, we did a good job managing expenses and credit is performing broadly as expected. Our Q4 guide shows a nice rebound in both NII and fees, leading to positive operating leverage in the quarter. We expect credit to remain broadly stable and we will continue to repurchase shares. For the full year, we will hit most of our beginning of year guide with the exception of balance sheet volume impacting NII and a modestly higher ACL build. We continue to have strong confidence in our medium-term outlook and we've added to the materials in the appendix to show more detail on our NIM progression. Lots of uncertainty in the environment remains, but we feel good about our capacity to manage through that and continue to execute on our broad strategy. Our strategy rests on a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned super regional commercial bank and the aspiration to have the premier bank-owned private bank. We will continue to execute with the financial and operating discipline that you've come to expect from us. With that, let me turn it over to John.
John Woods : Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, third quarter saw continued strong execution of our initiatives. And importantly, we believe the third quarter represents a trough in earnings as NIM tailwinds, strengthening fees and continued expense discipline will result in positive operating leverage prospectively. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity and capital levels and a healthy credit reserve. This positions us well to continue to execute on our strategic initiatives, which should help drive strong momentum in 2025 and performance over the medium-term. First, I'll start with some highlights of the third quarter financial results, referencing Slides 5 and 6. We generated underlying net income of $392 million for the third quarter, EPS of $0.79 and ROTCE of 9.7%. This includes a negative $0.11 impact from the non-core portfolio, which will continue to steadily run off, creating a tailwind for overall performance going forward. The private bank is making strong progress towards profitability reaching breakeven mid-third quarter and we expect it to start being accretive to earnings in the fourth quarter. Our capital position remained strong with CET1 at 10.6% at September 30 and/or 9.2% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal and we executed $325 million in stock buybacks during the quarter. We also maintained a strong funding and liquidity profile. Our pro-forma LCR is 122%, which is well in excess of the large bank Category 1 requirement of 100% and our period end LDR is 80.8%. Our ACL coverage ratio of 1.61% is down 2 basis points from the prior quarter, given an improved macroeconomic outlook and ongoing front book activity driving a mix shift, which lowered expected loss content in the loan portfolio. We increased our general office reserve to 12.1%, up from 11.1% in the prior quarter. Now I'll talk through the third quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on Slide 7. NII is down 2.9% linked quarter, primarily reflecting lower NIM and slightly lower interest earning assets. With respect to NIM, our margin was down 10 basis points to 2.77%, largely reflecting the impact from the increase in hedge costs as forward starting swaps kicked in during the quarter. Other NIM impacts were largely offsetting. Moving to Slide 8. Our fees were down 2.7% linked quarter with seasonality in capital markets and solid card and wealth results. On the heels of a very strong second quarter, our capital markets fees decreased 30% as deal activity slowed given seasonal trends and some M&A deals pushed into the fourth quarter. Year-on-year, however, capital markets fees were up 40%, led by bond underwriting and M&A advisory fees. Our client hedging revenue was down slightly as some clients delayed their interest rate hedging plans, given the potential for a faster pace of rate cuts after the Fed eased aggressively in September. Mortgage banking fees are down modestly given the decline in MSR results net of hedging. This was offset by securities gains we took in making adjustments of the investment portfolio. Our wealth fees were up slightly given growth in AUM from the private bank, which was somewhat offset by lower transactional sales activity. We continue to focus on building out our wealth business in both our branch based financial advisory activity as well as in private wealth, where we are adding teams in our private bank office geographies. Total assets under management now approximately $30 billion. On Slide 9, we did a nice job on expenses, which were down 1.3% linked quarter notwithstanding continued investment in our strategic initiatives. Our TOP 9 program is on target to deliver $135 million pretax run rate benefit by the end of the year. And we are planning to launch our TOP 10 program, which will target more than $100 million in run rate efficiencies by the end of 2025. We will provide more details for you on our next earnings call. On Slide 10. Period-end loans are broadly stable and average loans are down 1% linked quarter, reflecting limited loan demand as well as continued balance sheet optimization. We continue to run down the non-core portfolio to the tune of about $1 billion in the quarter. The core loan portfolio was up about $800 million with solid contributions from the private bank and growth in retail mortgage and home equity. On a period-end basis, the private bank is making good progress with loans up about $630 million to $2 billion. Excluding the private bank, retail loans were up about $750 million, reflecting growth in mortgage and home equity, while commercial loans were down about $580 million, reflecting paydowns driven by corporates continuing to issue in the debt markets, exits of lower returning credit-only relationships and generally lower client loan demand. Next on Slide 11 and 12, we continue to do a good job on deposits in a very competitive and dynamic environment. Average deposits are broadly stable with period-end deposits down 1%, driven by the paydown of higher cost treasury deposits tied primarily to non-core rundown. This was partially offset by $1.6 billion of attractive growth in private bank deposits. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 4 basis points linked quarter. However, total deposit costs were up only 2 basis points, while total cost of funds was stable. DDA balances were effectively flat linked quarter with growth in the private bank being offset by lower commercial. We anticipate that migration of lower to higher cost categories will drop off now that the Fed has commenced the cutting cycle. Overall, our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a very competitive environment. Our estimates indicate we ended the upgrade cycle with a terminal interest bearing deposit beta better than the peer average. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels. About 70% of our deposits are granular, stable consumer deposits and roughly 68% of our overall deposits are insured or secured. Moving to credit on Slide 13. The net charge-offs rose 2 basis points to 54 basis points, primarily reflecting seasonal impacts in auto. A decline in commercial real estate charge-offs was offset by the resolution of several non-performing credits in C&I. Non-accrual loans increased 10% linked quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in CRE general office, as we proceed with workout actions on a handful of loans. We believe we are near the peak of NPAs as criticized classified loans have been broadly stable for four quarters and loans and workout get resolved. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.61%, which is a 2 basis point decline from the prior quarter, reflecting an improving macroeconomic outlook and better loan mix given the runoff of the non-core auto portfolio and lower loss content originations in retail, real estate secured and commercial categories. The general office portfolio was down $150 million to $3.2 billion at the end of the third quarter and our reserve of $382 million represents 12.1% coverage, up from 11.1% in the second quarter. On the right side of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level. While rate cuts may be beneficial at the margin, we continue to expect this sector to be challenged. We believe our current reserve represents a severe scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns. So we feel the current coverage is very strong. Additionally, since the second quarter of 2023, we have absorbed $364 million of cumulative losses in the general office portfolio. When you add these cumulative losses to the reserve outstanding, this represents an almost 20% loss rate based on the March 2023 balance of $4.1 billion. Over the past six quarters, we have continued to work down the exposure to general office, with the portfolio down roughly $1 billion over the last 18 months to $3.2 billion at September 30, given paydowns of about $600 million in addition to the charge-offs I just mentioned. Moving to Slides 15 and 16. We have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio is a strong 10.6%, which compares with 10.7% in the prior quarter. And if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt-out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio increased from 9% to 9.2%. Both CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been above the average of our peers. Given our strong capital position, we repurchased $325 million in common shares and including dividends, we returned a total of $516 million to shareholders in the third quarter. Moving to Slide 17. Our strategy is built on a transformed consumer bank that best positioned commercial bank among our regional peers and our aspiration to build a premier bank-owned private bank and wealth franchise. First, we have a strong transformed consumer bank with substantial wealth revenue potential that is set to drive further deposit growth while efficiently managing costs and we are well positioned to continue gaining market share in the important New York metro market. Next, we believe we have built a leading commercial bank among the super-regional banks. We are focused on serving sponsors and middle market companies and high growth sectors of the economy. Our investments over the years in capital markets capabilities and coverage of the private capital space have positioned us well to take advantage when market activity picks up. With the Fed beginning to ease and fears of a recession subsiding, the movement in our commercial client base is decidedly more positive, which has us optimistic that we'll see a strong finish to the year and good momentum into 2025. And we are pleased to report that for the third quarter in a row, our capital markets business sits the top of middle-market lead tables, holding the number one sponsor middle market book runner position on a trailing 12-month basis. Moving to the private bank. I'm pleased to report that the effort is going very well and continues to gain momentum. We are growing our client base and now have about $5.6 billion of attractive deposits. This is a $1.6 billion increase from the prior quarter with roughly 34% non-interest bearing. Also, we are now at $2 billion of loans and continuing to grow. We recently announced the addition of a top private banking team in Southern California and we have plans to add new offices in the Bay area, which adds to the offices we've already opened in San Francisco and Mill Valley, California, Palm Beach and Boston. You should expect to see us opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities. Notably, our private bank revenue rose 64% to $49.7 million in the third quarter breaking even by mid-quarter. We are on track for the private bank to start contributing to earnings in the fourth quarter and add meaningfully to EPS next year. Moving to Slide 18. We provide a guide for the fourth quarter. This outlook contemplates a 25 basis point rate cut in each of November and December. We expect NII to be up about 1.5% to 2.5%, driven primarily by a 5 basis point improvement in net interest margin, reflecting the benefit of swaps given lower rates, deposit repricing, non-core runoff and favorable front book back book dynamics, partially offset by lower asset yields. Spot loans should be up slightly paced by private bank and commercial sponsor activity. Non-interest income should be up mid- to high-single-digits reflecting expected seasonal strength in capital markets. Our deal pipelines are robust and we expect to see a strong finish to the year. We also expect modest improvements across other key categories. Non-interest expense is projected to be up about 2%, and we expect to achieve positive operating leverage. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable, while the ACL should continue to benefit from non-core runoff and improving loan mix. Our CET1 ratio is expected to be broadly stable with about $200 million to $250 million of share repurchases. I called your attention to an updated slide in the appendix on our medium-term NIM walk, which projects us to be in the 3.25% to 3.4% range in 2027. To wrap up, we delivered a solid quarter in a dynamic environment with strong results in capital markets, wealth and card and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected. We are playing strong defense maintaining a robust capital and reserve position, a high level of liquidity and a more structural long-term funding profile, as we prepare for potential regulatory changes and any challenges the environment may bring. Importantly, we are also playing offense as we pursue our unique multiyear strategic initiatives, which will drive improving performance over the medium-term. We remain confident in our ability to hit our medium-term 16% to 18% return target. With that, I'll hand back over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun : Okay. Thank you, John. Alan, let's open it up for some Q&A.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
Scott Siefers : I wanted to start off with a couple of questions both related to the margin progression and that medium-term walk to which you alluded on Slide 23, as we kind of start to march upward. Maybe first, in the immediate term, can you sort of walk through the puts and takes that allow for the 5 basis points or so of margin expansion into the fourth quarter? And then, I guess, more importantly, as we sort of start the journey upward and think about that next year or so, it looks like that 18 basis points of time based benefits is largely programmatic, which all else equal would get us to like a 2.95.But of course, the wild cards are like the timing of the ebbs and flows of the swaps and the rate based impact. So maybe if you could sort of help, I guess, narrow the cone on the moving parts as we think about the next few quarters, please?
John Woods : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Scott. I'd say starting off with the fourth quarter. I mean, I think when you think about the progression there, one of the drivers -- several drivers of tailwinds that we're seeing. First off, I would highlight non-core, which continues to contribute about 2 basis points a quarter. And so that's the starting point. I think the second big driver is broadly the active balance sheet management, fixed asset repricing and front book back book that continues to play out on -- will continue to play out every quarter going forward. And that's a huge contributor. I'll offer up one of the highlights of the balance sheet transition as you get into the fourth quarter also relates to deposit migration. We've had negative deposit migration throughout the cycle. That's been kind of declining over time. And we're seeing late third quarter, early fourth quarter trends that tell us that, that's going to flip around to be more of a neutral, maybe a slightly positive going into the fourth quarter. And that's really significant for that to become less of a headwind than it's been. And given what's been going on in the past.
Bruce Van Saun : Just on the color on that let me just jump in here, John. But we have the private bank continuing to generate very attractive deposits and they've been growing well over $1 billion in $1.5 billion range the last two quarters. So that will be positively benefiting that mix. And then typically, seasonally, in the fourth quarter, we'll see an uptick in both commercial and consumer in terms of demand deposits. So we're counting on that as part of the equation.
John Woods : Absolutely. And I think just playing on that a little further. I mean, I think we are -- the other big category, we are slightly asset sensitive, but based on the non-core and those balance sheet trends that we just talked about those are more powerful. And are -- you got to keep in mind that the receipt swaps, which have been a headwind are going to flip over to a tailwind and be a mitigant to our asset sensitivity going forward. So they'll actually contribute into the fourth quarter. And so one of the important things we're also doing is being extremely proactive on down betas. Just taking all the learnings from prior cycles and what you've seen from our deposit portfolio, where our deposit betas on the up are now better than peer average from what we can tell. We're flipping all of that energy and capability into the down beta management being highly proactive in the consumer side of things. And on the commercial side, most of our deposits there are -- the majority of them are 100% beta anyway. But we're feeling really good about how we're really pouncing on this transition to a downgrade cycle. And all of that, when you add all that up, that gives us confidence that we're going to achieve that 5 basis points. And as I may mentioned earlier, the late 3Q trends and the early 4Q trends are very consistent with that trajectory. So that's the 4Q. I think the second -- there are similar themes, but the second question was taken me out to the fourth quarter of 25%. And you're right. If you look at the $277 million in 3Q, you're at the 18 basis points that's really time based, and it's just really baked in. We'll get to $295 million. And there's another, call it, I'd say in the neighborhood of 5-ish basis points of benefit that we can really expect such that we can get in that neighborhood of 3% NIM in the fourth quarter of '25 and the drivers are very similar. The tailwinds related to the growing front book back book. And when you think about our fixed loan portfolio and securities as that turns over under a wide range of rate scenarios, which is more kind of focused on longer end rates where the 10 year is going to end up in five year rates. We end up with anywhere from 200 basis points to 300 basis points of front book back book benefit for as that turns over every quarter, so over the next five quarters, that's a driver that we feel very good about. Our strategic initiatives on the deposit side with respect to private bank at New York Metro continue to contribute. And when you add all that up, we end up with what we think is something nearing 3% by the end of '25 and we still have a lot of down rate protection on. Keep in mind, we've got our swap portfolio is largely intact through the middle of 2026. So, we remain pretty well protected and slightly asset sensitive. But all those other factors offset it and give us a net positive as you get into the end of '25.
Bruce Van Saun : Yes, the one other thing is to the fourth quarter lift and then would add to that target as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Matt O'Connor : I guess just to drill down on the net interest income coming in weaker than kind of your thought maybe a month ago. Was that a bigger Fed cut and a little bit less loan growth? And kind of and then all the positive trends that you said is what we should expect from here? Or was there something help to throw out there, too?
John Woods : Yes. I'd say we are slightly asset sensitive. So 50, maybe a little bit more kind of than we expected. But I'd say that the deposit trends 3Q, in the trajectory of low-cost migration came down during the quarter, but they may be a little bit than we expected. And so, I think we got to the end of the quarter where we expected, but the average for the quarter in terms of migration was a little higher than we were thinking. But as I mentioned, that is now flipping around and as you look at the late September, early October trends that it was almost -- the bell went off there when the Fed pull the 50 basis point lever, we really are seeing that low-cost migration really flip to more of a neutral to slight positive. And so that's really what you can see going into 4Q.
Bruce Van Saun : And then on volume, too, I think we anticipated a little more loan growth that, I'd say, we had nice loan growth in the private bank, but not maybe quite as much as we thought. I think that's really just timing. And as rates come down that will continue to pick up similarly on commercial bank. We thought we'd see a little faster rebound in line utilization, particularly on the sponsor side. We're starting to see that. So again, I think that's kind of on the come and should -- that's why we have an outlook in the guide that fourth quarter, we should start to see slight growth in our spot loans, even comprehending the non-core rundown.
Matt O'Connor : And then separately, how do you think about operating leverage kind of more medium-term? Obviously, like net just income could be a bigger driver dollar-wise, if we just look at fourth quarter to kind frame it, you're guiding to revenues up about 3.5% versus costs up to 150 bps of operating leverage, but that's more driven by fees. Just thoughts on medium-term, how much operating leverage would you envision?
John Woods : Yes. I mean I think we'll talk more about this in January. But I mean, I think we have significant opportunity for operating leverage. When you look at the net interest margin reflating to that $3.25 to $3.40 range provides significant tailwinds and consistent operating leverage over time. We'll come back in January and frame that for you a little more in terms of what we expect in 2025.
Bruce Van Saun : The best thing about the NIM reflation is that there's no real cost of goods sold in terms of the impact on expenses. So that pretty much drops straight through. I think there's clearly going to be continued growth in fees led by capital markets, some of the things we're doing in the payments business, some of the exciting developments in our wealth business but those usually come with payouts and investments on the expense side. But nonetheless, I think the operating leverage should be quite positive when we look out over that 25 to 27 period. Brendan, maybe you could add couple comments.
Brendan Coughlin : One other comment I mentioned on the private bank is just remember that the cost base that we're working our way through right now is fixed on the short-term basis with the comp guarantees that we've given to the team. So as the revenue grows, we're kind of earning our way through the comp guarantees. So that's all straight positive operating leverage linked quarter where the revenue is coming without necessarily incremental expenses because we've essentially put that in. And then over time, that will work their way through the guarantee and we get the right scale, they'll grow with further linkage together. But right now, it's just straight revenue growth on top of the fixed expense base.
Bruce Van Saun : Yes. Good point.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.
John Pancari : Bruce, you just talked about the loan growth dynamics a bit. And maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit more on your confidence in that you're seeing this inflection in demand here that should drive a modest growth in the fourth quarter. What is the bigger catalyst? Is it the rate cut? Is it clarity you expect around the election? And then -- can you maybe help us think about where like the type of acceleration in overall loan growth that you expect you could see going into -- or as you look at 2025?
Bruce Van Saun : Yes. Let me start, and then I'm going to pass it to Don and Brendan to talk about their segments and their outlooks. But we're not calling for any heroics here in fourth quarter. So I think the guide is pretty much derisked from meeting significant step up in loan growth. But it is, I think worth noting that we're starting to see things build a bit. We said our biggest quarterly increase in the private bank and the pipeline is looking pretty good. So I think that will continue. And I think there, as rates come down, folks are willing to transact and borrow. I think it's a similar thing in the commercial bank, where there's lots of interest in private equity kind of starting to realize some exits and put some money to work -- that's -- so we see it by the amount of conversations that we're privy to with clients, but it's starting to build. But really, the dam has not broken yet. And so, I think we'll see that trend continue to flex up. But let me start first with Don and then maybe, Brendan, you could pick up a second.
Don McCree: Yes. I think you said it, Bruce. The leader in the clubhouse is subscription lines, where we saw some very strong growth late quarter and we're continuing to see it into the fourth quarter. And that's not really leveraged by us that we're doing. It's just activity in the private equity space that we're seeing build and we've seen a pretty nice utilization bump in that business. We haven't really seen it in C&I yet, but the conversations we're having with our core C&I clients, particularly in the middle market, with the economy kind of stabilizing rates coming down, it's just a general level of confidence that the business environment is going to be better as we get into '25, and that will result in more working capital utilization, more investment in their businesses. And remember, one of the things John said, one of the downdrafts we've had against kind of core loan growth has been a lot of activity where companies have been refinancing in the public securities markets. So we've seen stuff that's been on our balance sheet being refinanced and good for our fee lines. But it's put a little bit pressure on core asset levels. So -- we think a lot of that is behind us now. So the net growth we'll see in the core book should begin to grow as we get into '25.
Bruce Van Saun : Brendan?
Brendan Coughlin : Yes, I'll quickly hit on consumer and then private banking. On the consumer side, I just would remind folks at the pace of rundown on non-core is turning into a net positive. So last year, at this time, we were running off $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion a quarter and now we're in the consumer book and now we're in the $800 million to $900 million. So that's -- the linked quarter rundown is slowing a bit and that will continue into the future. And when we look at the growth portfolios, we're seeing decent growth in mortgage and home equity. And as rates pull back a little bit, we expect to see a modest pickup in mortgage originations activity. But as everybody knows, the majority of the country is locked into 3%-ish mortgage rates. And so our HELOC business is incredibly well positioned. We've got a real strength in that business where we're the very top of the league tables and national HELOC originations in the super prime space and you'll continue to see that grow. And I believe that product, it will be a main lever for U.S. consumers as the economy gets more confidence in footing for consumers to borrow against record equity in their homes that's been built up over the last five or six years. So we expect that to continue. The other tailwind -- headwind moving to a tailwind is likely student in a modest way with high rates student loan refinance product has been all that sidelined. And now with the federal government not collecting payments again on that portfolio and rates coming back down, we should see more late 20s, early 30 year olds who have great credit coming back in the money that see value in restructuring their student loan debt. So we're expecting that to modestly pick up, as we get into next year. On the private bank side, it's a little bit of the same story. Rates pulling back should really put more customers an attractive place to use credit. And right now, we're seeing a lot of cash transactions, whether it's on the resi side or business is sitting on the sidelines and we're hearing very strong feedback. But as rates pull back, they'll be more comfortable using credit versus just going cash temporarily on whether it's an investment home or facilitating business growth given that high net worth and ultrahigh net profile of that customer base. So we've got good confidence that the rate dynamic should drive a decent amount of embedded demand. And as everybody knows, we've also went to market very strong on the deposit side. We've been very focused on getting the operations up. There's a progression here on earning the customer's full wallet of do the day-to-day banking really well. Now they'll come from borrowing needs and then we'll build a dislodge well. So there's a natural sort of earned wallet share gain that we anticipate getting as we get into next year on the private banking side that will be supported by the rate environment.
John Pancari : And then a quick second one on credit. Can you just talk about the confidence that I believe you indicated that you've seen, you believe NPAs are peaking here this quarter. Maybe your confidence there, what gives you that? And then also on the confidence in the broadly stable charge-offs with the third quarter as you look at fourth quarter. I know your auto delinquencies were up pretty sharply year-over-year. So that would be beyond the seasonality. So I'm interested in what drove that and then thoughts on the reserve going forward?
Bruce Van Saun : Yes. Maybe I'll start, and then we'll pass it around whoever wants to jump in, feel free. But yes, I'd say the big issue that's well known that we've been managing through is the general office portfolio. And that one is going to -- it's a multi-quarter workout that has commenced in '23, it's with us all through '24. It will be with us for a good chunk of 25%. And we think we've got our arms fully around that. We've got very heavy reserves there. We've got our best people working with borrowers to try to come up with mutually satisfactory outcomes. But the timing of when you recognize the charge-offs and when something might go NPA moves around a bit and it's not always in our control. If a borrower decides to put a property up for sale then there are certain actions we have to take in terms of NPA recognition or charge-off recognition. So this quarter, we were on the low end of CRE charge-offs and we had a blip in CRE NPAs. But having said that the problem loan population that we're managing is pretty consistent. And so one of the things we take comfort in is when we look at criticized and classified loans across the board in commercial, they've been pretty stable now for four quarters. So that's the big thing. I'll see, Don, if you want to add any color on the CRE and then Brendan, if anything on the delinquencies.
Don McCree : I think that's exactly right, Bruce. I think that we've seen like zero surprises in our credit book for the last four quarters, and it's playing out exactly as we thought it was going to play out. And as Bruce said, we'll have charge-offs going through the general office portfolio for the next several quarters, but it's pretty much playing out as we expected. We had a little bit of a blip in C&I charge-off this quarter, which was things that have been in the workout teams for literally five, six, seven years, and they just happened to resolve this quarter. So I don't worry a lot about NPA moves, what I focus on is the class levels and the fact that those have been stable. The other thing we're seeing in the general real estate area is not in general office, but in general real estate. There's a lot of liquidity coming back into the marketplace. So it's accelerating our ability to move down the overall exposures in the book, which you know is a strategic matter or something that I want to do. And we're seeing nothing in the C&I book and broadly that is disturbing to us at all, that's quite healthy from an overall credit standpoint.
Brendan Coughlin : Yes. Consumer is broadly normalized and pre-COVID we're between 50 basis points and 55 basis points in net charge-offs. And that's where we are now. And while there's always a little bit of puts and takes. There's nothing that we're observing in the portfolio that's making me lose any sleep. And your question on auto, a couple of comments. One would be -- last quarter was -- on the charge-off side was very low, seasonally impacted, but also we had a very strong recovery month in used value. So this quarter was much more just a reversion to the mean. The other dynamic I would mention in auto, it's tough to read into published delinquency numbers, even though delinquency is relatively in check. But when you're not originating anymore, it takes 12 months to 18 months for a vintage curve to build up to its appropriate steady state and delinquency. So when you shut the pick it off on new originations, it's just a denominator issue that you've got other origination vintages that are normally progressing along their lines to our ultimate expected loss number and you're not getting the denominator benefit of a bunch of new flow coming in that has zero delinquencies. So when you decompose all that there's really nothing that we're worried about whatsoever in the auto portfolio. It's performing exactly as we priced it and exactly as we've expected it to.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.
Erika Najarian : My first question is for you, John. On the 10-Q, you had $30 billion of notional received fixed peso for swaps for both 3Q and 4Q and $30.9 billion for 2025. Obviously, Slide 24 would indicate lower notionals. Could you give us an update on whether you terminated those swaps. And maybe confirm the accounting for the swaps and that you would just -- those losses are crystallized and they would be in your NII for the duration of the swap life and then just as a follow-up, you mentioned a 3% NIM by 4Q '25. How many rate cuts would you need to ensure yourself of getting to that 3% level?
John Woods : Yes. I'll take those. So yes, I think during the third quarter, as you may recall, there was a period of time when the yield curve was discounting as many as seven or eight cuts over -- through the second quarter of next year was pretty aggressive, expectation of the pace of Fed rate cuts. We happen to have about $4 billion of short-dated receive-fixed swaps that were maturing in May of '25. And so what we opportunistically chose to do was to terminate $4 billion of swaps during the third quarter in an environment where there was approximately seven or eight cuts that we locked in that benefit, given the swaps are very short dated and really, we're only providing down rate protection through May, we felt like that was a good risk reward to lock in that benefit and lock in the contribution and protection against lower rates that the swaps were there to cover in the first place. Out the window, there are fewer cuts through May. So at least at this point, that was a round trip positive for us to move on from those swaps and they did exactly what they were intended to do, was to create that protection. The accounting aspects of it are that we amortize the impact of that over the remaining life of the swaps through May. So that will be amortized through but that impact will be, again, a lower impact or a more favorable impact than otherwise would be the case that we were to have held the swaps. And so that was the point of the terminations. So that's that one. And I think the second question was about 3% -- how many cuts. And the rate environment that we would -- there's a range of rate environments that would still be consistent. With that I mean I would say that we have a slightly asset sensitive position. So net interest margin is stable across a range of rate environments into '25 given the swap portfolio, it doesn't begin to drop off until mid-2026. So I mean, the forward curve out the window implies getting to around 350 by the end of '25, but we would be able to achieve that 3% at rate environments that would be below that level as well.
Erika Najarian : And my follow-up question is two-fold. First, could you explain the more favorable impact? I think I was thinking that as I amortize that impact of the terminated swap, it would just be the difference between the SOFR and received fixed rate through May 2025. So John, maybe give us some insight on what the more favorable treatment would be? And then just secondly, I just wanted to follow-up. I think that there are a lot of questions over being able to achieve that NIM expansion for next quarter, which you've explained well. I just wanted to sort of nail down what kind of deposit beta you are assuming in that 2.82% number for next quarter?
John Woods : Yes. So again, so when you terminate the swap, you basically terminate based upon the forward curve that's assumed at the time. And so the forward curve at that.
Erika Najarian : That's the difference. Got it.
John Woods : And then on the NIM expansion into the fourth quarter, highly proactive focus on this is going to get our deposit beta to be up to around nearing 40% by the end of the quarter. You've got all of the 100% beta stuff in commercial leading the way, but we're being highly proactive in consumer as well and just really taking all the learnings over the cycle over the last many years and applying that to how we continue to be able to drive solid deposit growth at a really attractive cost of funds. So that's the number that's baked in about 40% deposit beta in 4Q.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley.
Manan Gosalia : I wanted to follow-up on the deposit beta question. Do you have any more specifics on what your spot deposit rates are now that we're a month past the Fed rate cut how you expect that deposit beta to traject as we get further into the Fed rate cut cycle, right? So as we get -- as we get as more Fed rate cuts are behind us, does that make it easier or more difficult to continue to drop your deposit rates going forward?
John Woods : I mean I think if you kind of do the math there, if you -- based on the forward -- from the forward curve that we'll have two more Fed cuts in 4Q and we're using a curve that was after non-farm payrolls from a week or two ago. But after non-farm payrolls, you've got the 2 cuts. Based on that curve, and if you apply a 40% beta to what you think the average SOFR rate would be in 4Q versus 3Q, you can come up with the decline in net interest-bearing deposit costs on that basis. And second question, what was the second part of that question?
Manan Gosalia : The second part of the question was just as we get into -- as we get into, say, the middle of next year and we have a series of Fed rate cuts behind us. Does that make it easier to continue to drop deposit rates? Or does it make it harder to drop deposit rates because there's fewer cuts in the forward curve front there?
John Woods : I think the way to think about that is the longer the down cycle lasts, the more you can continue to contribute to ongoing lowering of deposit costs, but broadly, I think what we've said in the past was that our down cycle betas are going to approximate our cycle, so around 50% to 55%. And so we're going to be around 40% by the end of the fourth quarter, and it will gradually migrate to that 50% to 55% over the cutting cycle that's going to proceed over the -- in the coming years. And so you can kind of think about that gradual improvement in that way, I think.
Bruce Van Saun : Yes. But there was acceleration in the up cycle towards the later part of the cycle, which I think you mirror that on the downside.
Manan Gosalia : That's what I was getting to. That's really helpful. And then maybe just on the front book back book, I think you noted the 200 basis point to 300 basis point spread benefit. Can you talk about what balances we should apply that to? What are the fixed rate securities and loans coming due over the next year or so? And is there any room to use some of the excess capital for any securities positioning from here?
John Woods : Yes. I mean I think that's a good metric to use that this will be growing over time. So when you see when you see the activity and loan growth picking up over time, you're going to see this being a contributor over the next couple of years. I mean, I'd say that the what turns over in the back book quarterly basis in resi mortgage, call it around $750 million a quarter and that's a similar number for securities as well. When you talk about what turns over those are the balances that you would apply it to is the front book, back book, but that will continue to contribute and build on itself over the next couple of years.
Manan Gosalia : That's right. And would you do as securities repositioning from here? Is there any room to that?
John Woods : I mean that's not in our plans. I mean we'll look at -- we actively manage the securities portfolio and we -- on an ongoing basis but we don't have a large single repositioning.
Bruce Van Saun : And I would also just point to Slide 23 and some of the built-in momentum that we have to raise NIM, so that the need to expend capital to shift the timing on that NIM walk is not something that we need to avail ourselves of.
Operator: And at this time, you have no further questions in queue.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Great. Well, thanks again, folks for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support in Citizens. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-17 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alan and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.
Kristin Silberberg: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and CFO, John Woods will provide an overview of our second quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking are also here to provide additional colour. We will be referencing our second quarter earnings presentation located on our investor relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to you Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thanks, Kristen, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We announced solid results today and we continue to execute well through an uncertain environment. Highlights for the quarter include very strong fee performance, good deposit cost management, tight expense control, and credit metrics which were within expectations. Our balance sheet remains robust with a CET1 ratio of 10.7%. Our loan to deposit ratio was 80%. Our ACL ratio was 1.63%. And Federal Home Loan Bank advances are now below $600 million. Of note, we saw our revenues tick up relative to Q1. Our underlying PPNR grew by 2% over Q1. Our underlying net income grew by $13 million or 3%. We repurchased $200 million in shares over the quarter with our sequential EPS up 4%. The combination of our strong capital position, solid returns, and capital freed up from non-core rundown has allowed us the capital flexibility to support our customers and return capital to shareholders. Share count is down over 5% versus a year ago. Our fee growth was relatively broad as capital market fees continued their rebound, led by low syndications and bond underwriting. Wealth and card fees, both hit record levels. We also are seeing nice momentum in our well-positioned payments business. Our private bank had a terrific quarter. We reached $4 billion in deposits, up from $2.4 billion in Q1, and tracking well towards our year-end 2025 goal of $11 billion. We brought in two leading private wealth teams in the quarter, one from San Francisco and one from Boston, and we've reached $3.6 billion in assets under management at quarter end with nice momentum. Our commercial bank hired a middle market leader for Florida and for California during the quarter, two increasingly important states for us. Our overall commercial franchise continues to be well positioned in serving the middle market, private capital, and key growth verticals, and we look for our strong performance to continue in the second half. I should pause to give a shout-out to Don McCree for his appointment as Senior Vice Chair in June. Great recognition for his efforts over the years at Citizens. We have done a good job in executing on our strategic initiatives. TOP 9 is tracking well to targets, and we have commenced work on TOP 10, which will push into new areas like AI. Our BSO work is progressing well. Non-Core ran down $1.1 billion in the quarter. Commercial C&I is refocusing on deep relationships, and we have a medium-term plan to reduce our CRE exposure. Credit metrics are holding up fine outside of General Office. We continue the lengthy workout of General Office, which will take several more quarters before we see improvement. Roughly 70% of our office exposure is suburban versus central business district, where loss given defaults have been about half of CBD properties. The good news is that, we have our arms around the issue and we don't expect to see major surprises. Looking forward, we continue to be upbeat about our prospects. While there are still many uncertainties in the external environment, we feel we are in good position to navigate the challenges that may arise, and we maintain a positive outlook for Citizens over the balance of the year, as well as the medium term. Our strategy rests on a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned super regional commercial bank, and the aspiration to have the premier bank-owned private bank. We will continue to execute with the financial and operating discipline that you come to expect from us. With that, let me turn it over to John.
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce. And good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, second quarter results were very solid in a number of key areas, starting with the excellent fee performance driven by strong capital markets fees and record results in Wealth and Card. Also, we managed our deposit portfolio quite well, with stable balances and lower interest bearing costs in a competitive environment which positively impacted NII and NIM. Rounding out quarterly results, expenses and credit came in largely as expected. With respect to balance sheet strength, we continue to maintain a healthy credit reserve position and capital and liquidity levels near the top of our peer group. And importantly, we are executing well against our various multi-year strategic initiatives, including the buildout of our private bank. I'll summarize further highlights of the second quarter financial results, referencing Slides 3 to 6. We generated underlying net income of $408 million for the second quarter, EPS of $0.82, and ROTCE of 11.1%. Maintaining a strong balance sheet position is a top priority, and we ended the second quarter with CET1 at 10.7% or about 9% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal. We also maintained our strong funding and liquidity profile in the second quarter. Our pro forma LCR is 119%, which is well in excess of the large bank Category 1 requirement of 100%. And our period end LDR improved to 80.4%. On the funding front, we've reduced our period end FHLB borrowings by about $1.5 billion linked quarter to $553 million. We continued our programmatic approach to increasing our structural funding base with a successful $750 million senior debt issuance during the second quarter, and we added about another $1 billion of auto-backed borrowings. That was our fourth issuance, essentially completing our auto program, and it was executed at our tightest credit spreads to date. We also refinanced preferred stock in the second quarter by issuing $400 million of new preferred and redeeming $300 million of higher-coupon floating rate preferred on July 8. Credit losses of approximately $180 million were in line with our expectations. The NCO rate rose a little to 52 basis points reflecting loan balances coming in a little lower than expected. Our ACL coverage ratio of 1.63% is up 2 basis points from the prior quarter. This includes an 11.1% coverage for General Office, up from 10.6% in the prior quarter. Regarding our strategic initiatives, the private bank is doing very well, having generated $4 billion of deposits and $3.6 billion of AUM through the second quarter. Also, our investments over the years in the private capital and capital market space are playing out nicely, as demonstrated this quarter. Finally, we are excited about our top of house initiatives, including the ongoing benefits from BSO and TOP, as well as growing contributions expected from data and technology-related initiatives, such as generative AI and cloud migration. Next, I'll talk through the second quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on Slide 7. As expected, NII is down 2% linked quarter, reflecting lower net interest margin and loan balances. With respect to NIM, as you can see in the walk at the bottom of our slide, our margin was down 4 basis points to 2.87%, reflecting a 6 basis point increase in swap expense due to the 60 basis point decline in average receive rate in the quarter. This is partly offset by a net increase in NIM of 2 basis points from all other sources, including higher asset yields, non-core runoff, and good deposit cost performance, with interest bearing deposit costs down 3 basis points. Overall, our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a very competitive environment with our interest-bearing deposit data at 51%, which was down from 52% in Q1. Moving to Slide 8, our fees were up 7% linked quarter given strong results in capital markets and record card and wealth results. Our capital markets business improved 14% linked quarter with higher bond underwriting and loan syndication fees given strong refinancing activity. M&A advisory fees were down slightly off a strong first quarter. However, our deal pipelines remain strong and we expect to see positive momentum in the second half of 2024. It's great to see our capital markets business holding the number one middle market sponsor book runner position for the second quarter in a row. This reflects the benefit of the investments we've made in our capabilities since the IPO and demonstrates the diversification of the business. Card fees were a record, primarily given the full quarter benefit of the first quarter transition to a new debit card platform as well as seasonally higher purchase volume. We delivered record results in Wealth driven by increased sales activity, as well as higher asset management fees given the constructive market environment and contribution from the private bank which will continue to grow given the AUM increase in the second quarter from our wealth team hires. Mortgage banking fees are up modestly with a benefit from the MSR valuation net of hedging and an improvement in servicing P&L. Production fees were down slightly given a decline in margins. On Slide 9, underlying expenses were down slightly as we saw the normal seasonal benefit in compensation and we did a nice job managing our expenses while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives. Our TOP 9 program is progressing well and we continue to expect to deliver a $135 million pre-tax run rate benefit by the end of the year. We have commenced work on our TOP 10 program and will provide more details later this year. On Slide 10, period end and average loans are down 1% linked quarter as we continue to optimize our balance sheet and prioritize relationship-based lending. The linked quarter decline was driven by the runoff of our Non-Core portfolio of $1.1 billion. Core loans were broadly stable with a slight reduction in commercial balances, largely offset by an increase in retail. The decrease in commercial loans reflects paydowns and exits of lower return in credit only relationships, lower client loan demand, and corpus continuing to issue in the debt markets. Next, on Slides 11 and 12, we continue to do an excellent job on deposits in an extremely competitive environment. Period-end deposits are broadly stable linked quarter as seasonally lower retail deposits was offset by strong growth in the private bank. We continue to see a slowing rate of migration from demand and lower-cost deposits to higher-cost interest bearing accounts with the Fed holding steady, as well as the benefit of deposit market share gains with the private bank. As a result, non-interest bearing deposits are stable at about 21% of total deposits. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels. About 69% of our deposits are granular, stable consumer deposits, and approximately 70% of our overall deposits are insured or secured. This attractive deposit base has allowed us to efficiently and cost-effectively manage our funding costs in the higher rate environment. Our interest bearing deposit costs were down 3 basis points linked quarter given proactive management of our pricing strategy. Moving to credit on Slide 13. Net charge-offs were 52 basis points, up 2 basis points linked quarter reflecting broadly stable charge-offs and lower average loans. The commercial charge-offs in the quarter were largely driven by CRE General Office and the fact that C&I recoveries were higher in 1Q versus 2Q. This increase in commercial was largely offset by a decrease in retail, primarily due to seasonal trends in auto and runoff. Non-accrual loans increased 4% linked quarter, driven by increases in CRE General Office and multifamily, which has been reflected in the reserve level for the quarter. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.63%, which is a 2 basis point increase from the first quarter, reflecting broadly stable reserves and lower loan balances given non-core runoff and commercial paydowns and balance sheet optimization. Our reserve of $369 million for the $3.3 billion General Office portfolio represents 11.1% coverage, up from 10.6% in the first quarter. Additionally, since the second quarter of 2023, we have absorbed $319 million of cumulative losses in the General Office portfolio. When you add these cumulative losses to the reserves outstanding, this represents roughly a 17% loss rate based on the March 2023 balance of $4.1 billion. Over the past six quarters, the General Office portfolio was down roughly $900 million to $3.3 billion at June 30, given paydowns of about $500 million and the charge-offs I just mentioned. The loss experienced so far has been concentrated in the central business district properties with approximately 2 times the loss rate of suburban properties. Suburban exposure is 70% of our total at this point. On the bottom left of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the General Office reserve coverage level, which we believe represents a severe scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns, so we feel the current coverage is very strong. Moving to Slide 15, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio is a strong 10.7%, up 10 basis points from 1Q. And if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt-out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio would be 9%. Both our CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been among the top of our peers. You can see on Slide 16 where our CET1 stands currently relative to peers. Given our strong capital position, we repurchased another $200 million in common shares and including dividends, we returned a total of $394 million to shareholders in the second quarter. Moving to Slide 17, our strategy is built on a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned commercial bank amongst our regional peers, and our aspiration to build the premier bank-owned private bank and wealth franchise. First, we have a strong transformed consumer bank with a robust and capable deposit franchise grounded in primary relationships and high-quality customer growth. Notably, the transformation of our consumer deposit franchise is the chief reason that our deposit performance has dramatically improved from the last upgrade cycle. We are much more nimble in our deposit raising capabilities now with more levers to pull and better analytical tools. And where our beta performance lagged our regional peers last time, so far this cycle we are better than peer median. We also have a differentiated lending platform where we are prioritizing building durable relationships with our customers and we are focused on scaling our Wealth business. Importantly, we continue to make great progress improving digital engagement with our customers and increasing deposit shares we build our customer base, particularly in New York Metro. Next, we believe we have built the leading commercial bank amongst the super-regional banks. We are focusing on serving sponsors and middle market companies in the high growth sectors of the economy and we have full set of product and advisory capabilities to deliver to our clients. In particular, we are uniquely positioned to serve the private capital ecosystem which appears poised for a strong recovery after one of the slowest dealmaking periods in decades. We are starting to see a more constructive capital markets environment develop and our consistent position near the top of the middle market and sponsor league tables gives us confidence that we have a right to win as activity picks up. Finally, we're building a premier private bank, and that is going very well and gaining momentum. We're growing our client base and now have about $4 billion of attractive deposits, a $1.6 billion increase from the prior quarter, with roughly 30% non-interest bearing. Also, we are now at $1.4 billion of loans and continuing to grow. We recently opened private banking offices in Mill Valley, California and Palm Beach, Florida, and we are opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities with our Citizens Wealth Management business as the center piece of that effort. We added two exceptional asset management teams in the second quarter, one from San Francisco and the other from Boston, bringing the total private bank AUM to $3.6 billion, well on our way to hit our $10 billion target by the end of 2025. Importantly, our private bank revenue increased 68% to about $30 million in the second quarter, and we are on track to break even on the bottom line later this year. Moving to Slide 18, we provide the guide for the third quarter. This outlook contemplates a 25 basis point rate cut in each of September and December. We expect NII to be down 1% to 2%, driven by one last step up in swap costs this cycle. Noninterest income should be up slightly, reflecting seasonally lower capital markets, more than offset by a pickup across other categories. We expect non-interest expense to be stable. Net charge-offs are expected to be down modestly, and the ACL should continue to benefit from non-core runoff. Our CET1 ratio is expected to come in about 10.5% with approximately $250 million to $300 million of share reports currently planned. With respect to the full year 2024 guide we provided in January, we feel good about the overall level of PPNR. Revenues are tracking broadly in line with some puts and takes. NII is expected to come in at the upper end of the down 6% to 9% range, reflecting lower loan balances, with NIM trending modestly better. Fee should come in modestly above the range of 6% to 9% originally expected. You should expect us to continue to do well on expenses, which will be broadly in line with the January guide. We expect NII and net interest margin to rebound in the fourth quarter given swap costs that peaked in the third quarter with a return to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter. In addition, net charge-offs are trending in line with our January expectations. We continue to expect to end the year with a target CET1 ratio of approximately 10.5% and the level of share repurchases will be dependent on our view of the external environment and loan growth. To wrap up, we delivered a strong quarter with good momentum in capital markets, record results in wealth and card, and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected. Our capital levels are strong, near the top of our peer group, and we are maintaining robust liquidity and funding. Our unique multi-year strategic initiatives, including the buildout of our private bank are progressing well, and our consumer and commercial banking businesses are well positioned to drive strong performance over the medium term. Given these tailwinds, combined with strong execution and tight expense management, we remain confident in our ability to hit our medium-term 16% to 18% return target. And with that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce. Bruce Van Saun Thank you, John. Alan, let's open it up for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Go ahead.
Peter Winter: Good morning. Can you provide an update on the loan outlook in the second half of the year and maybe just talk about customer sentiment and what it's going to take to kind of move them off the sidelines?
John Woods: Yes, I'll go ahead and jump on that one. So, I mean, I think we're seeing pretty positive signs, for 2H as it relates to loan growth. When we look at the three different businesses that really will drive that, we've got the private bank, which has demonstrated the ability to not only grow deposits and AUM, but the private bank is actually penetrating its customer base and growing loans in the second quarter, and we expect that to actually continue and begin to accelerate into the second half. In the commercial space, customer activities picking up, we do expect to see, particularly in our sort of, you call it, M&A, advisory-related driven finance arena, we're seeing some opportunities in the subscription line space as well as some pick up in fund finance. And then in retail, we've been seeing some opportunities in HELOC and mortgage. So all three legs of our stool, as we call it, are starting to demonstrate the ability to really deliver on that loan growth expectation as you look out into the second half.
Don McCree: Yes, John, I'll jump in on that. It’s Don. I think one of the interesting things we've seen, and this goes to capital markets also, is a real pick up in new money activity over the last six to eight weeks as the interest rate cycle appears to be abating and the economy seems to be okay. So that's driving growth in subscription lines. That's driving a little bit more bullishness among our core C&I customers and it's certainly driving opportunistic activity among the PE firms. So, I think we'll see some decent growth in the second half of the year. Exact timing, I'm not exactly sure, but we did see at the end of the second quarter the beginnings of some pretty significant draws on our subscription loans.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, and I'll jump in too on the consumer and private banking side. The consumer story is a little complicated given the non-core run down. We're running down $800 million to $1 billion each quarter, but if you put that aside, the fundamentals of our core loan business are actually growing at a reasonable clip, really led by residential lending and a little bit in card. Our HELOC position remains incredibly strong. And with rates being higher than we had expected going into the year and our customers having the most home equity in their personal balance sheet in the history of the United States, our HELOC market position is reaping a lot of benefits for us. So we're seeing very strong HELOC growth despite the mortgage challenges, some modest growth in the mortgage portfolio. And we're starting to see a bit of a tick-up on the card book. And then turning to the private bank, really our offering is much broader than what the team that we hired was used to. So we're starting to see a diversification of that book. Early days it was really led by private equity and venture capital call lines. That's still a strength of the business model. We did see in this last quarter in Q2 a diversification towards consumer. So consumer is now 36% of the loan book versus in the low 20s earlier in the year. So mortgage is starting to pick up, some HELOC lending, and still continued strength in business banking and private equity. We expect that trend to continue.
Peter Winter: That's a great color. Thank you. And just on a separate question, the stress capital buffer came in higher than I was expecting. I'm sure it's higher than what you were expecting. Are there any plans to kind of reassess any of the businesses to help drive a lower [SCB] (ph)? Bruce, you mentioned some plans over the medium term to reduce the CRE exposure.
Peter Winter: Yeah, I guess we were a bit disappointed in the SCB result. And I'd say, I think the Fed overall does a pretty good job on credit. They are very conservative, but they have a lot of data to work from. And where we've consistently been frustrated has been on their modeling of PPNR. And so, our own modeling of PPNR is kind of much more robust. I think we do things like we pick up forward to starting swaps. We tailor the situation to the scenario where if rates are much lower, then we're going to see a pickup in mortgage fees and a pickup in capital markets fees, depending on the scenario. But anyway, I'd say the good news is, we have sufficient capital. We run at a conservative level. So having a higher SCB than we think is appropriate isn't really hindering our strategy. And so, I don't think, Peter, that we need to make significant changes to the business model. I think we're on the right track. Having said that, the balance sheet optimization is still places where there's work to do to optimize the risk-adjusted return that we make off the balance sheet and to hopefully improve some of the stress results on the credit side. And so, CRE, we can see, that run down, we popped up after we did the investors acquisition. A lot of that was low risk, multifamily. But certainly, we want to create the capacity to lend in areas that really further deeper relationships and we'll have more C&I kind of fill some of that void as we bring down CRE would probably be the biggest shift that you'd see on the balance sheet over time.
Peter Winter: Got it. Thanks, Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Next question, Alen.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open.
Erika Najarian: Hi, good morning. This question -- this first question is for John. John, I think you were at a conference in June, and you talked about, very positively, about an exit rate for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the net interest margin. I'm wondering if you could readdress that again and maybe put it in context of -- you noted that the swap costs were peaking in the third quarter. If you can give that in context on how you expect asset yields to traject as we think about that September and December rate cut. And obviously the 3 basis point improvement in interest bearing deposit costs are notable. It's often the trajectory from here, whether it's in context of the rate cuts and without.
John Woods: Yes, sure, Erika. I guess what I'll start off with is that, at the beginning of the year, we did indicate that we thought the exit NIM would be in that neighborhood of 2.85% or so. I'd say that as we've gotten into the middle part of the year, we expect that to come in a little better. So I think I did mention that at conference earlier last quarter and I think we can confirm that those trends continue to be looking good that we're going to end up a little better than what we expected. And broadly, what we said at the time was that, we saw loans coming in a little lower and pushed out a little bit more than we had originally expected, but that was getting offset, in part from better net interest margin trends, we were pleased to be able to print a very strong interest-bearing deposit costs number that was down 3 basis points this quarter. I think it's very likely that our interest-bearing deposit costs have peaked in the first quarter, that we had some nice opportunity to kind of price our rollovers of CDs in the second quarter, and that was a tailwind. I think there'll be some variability there, but I think 1Q is probably the peak, and that will provide a nice tailwind as you get into the second half of the year. I mean, broadly, the trends when you get into the fourth quarter are along the following lines. Every quarter, we're generating a couple of basis points of positive benefit from all other sources outside of swaps. And so given the third quarters, the last time that we'll see a step up in swap costs, really that the rest of the bank will be able to drive net interest margin rising off of that NIM trough in 3Q into 4Q. And the big drivers would be, there's a number of them. I mean, we've got non-core, which continues to run off and is providing about 2 basis points a quarter of net interest margin all by itself. You've got asset yields around 5 basis points or so, ex-swaps, given the front book, back book dynamic that we're seeing, which is in that 200 basis point to 300 basis point range from the standpoint of what's happening with securities and loans. And then, you have the initiatives with the private bank, which is accretive across the board, which is contributing. So all of those things I think you'll see contribute. And I'd say that getting that first Fed cut in late September would be also helpful. It's not necessary for us to stay on track for having a really strong rebound in 4Q, but it does help, I'd say, address the higher for longer pressures that -- pricing pressures on deposits that will continue to bump along until that first cut comes out from the Fed. So let me stop there and see if that addresses the number of the points that you made.
Erika Najarian: That does. And as you lay out the past, and you said a third -- from a rising past for the net interest margin from what you mentioned as a 3Q 2024 trough. I'm wondering about the size of the balance sheet. Do you feel like your mix is optimized? In other words, as your investors think about a normalizing NIM and multiply that by your balance sheet, is your balance sheet growth going to be in line with business growth, or will there be moves that you're making in terms of wholesale funding or whatever else that could move balance sheet growth sort of underneath business growth or above business growth?
John Woods: Yes, it's a good question. I'd say, I think there might be two different answers here. One is, in the second half of 2024, we have a -- at the balance sheet date here at June 30, we have a significant amount of excess liquidity. And so, you could see us deploy some of that into lending through the second half. And that's very powerful in terms of the ability to drive net interest margin. And so, we're pleased to be able to do that, given how strong our balance sheet position is at June 30. But I'd say when you zoom out and think about the median term, we without a doubt have opportunity to grow the balance sheet over time in line with business growth adjusted for the balance sheet optimization initiatives that we have in place, but that powerful combination of net interest margin reflating into that, call it, what do we say, 3.25% to 3.40% range plus the opportunity to grow the balance sheet over the medium term is really one of the -- is the primary and majority driver of our ROTCE targets over the medium term. So, I think maybe a little bit of transition in 2H where we'll probably deploy some liquidity, but then growing into 2025 and 2026 and beyond.
Bruce Van Saun: I would just add to that, Erika, is I do think we have one thing that's pretty unique to us, which is the launch of the private bank. So, if we just grow at kind of nominal GDP, kind of in the medium term for consumer and commercial, we should grow a little faster, because the private bank is scaling up. And certainly as the customer base grows and we keep adding and investing in the business, we should see additional growth there.
Erika Najarian: Well said, guys. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mr. Nash, if you could please check your mute feature on your phone.
Kristin Silberberg: Alen, maybe we can come back to Ryan. Let's move on to the next question and we'll circle back to Ryan. Operator Yes, one moment please. [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Scott Siefers: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe we could sort of pivot to the fee story for a moment. That's been a pretty solid story this quarter. And John, it sounded like we'll see maybe some seasonal capital markets weakness in the third quarter, but it feels like it's on a good trajectory. So just maybe some thoughts on the overall investment banking pipeline, how it looks, and then just broader thoughts on the main drivers as you see them for the fee-based outlook?
John Woods: I'll start off with the broader picture and maybe let Don tell us a little bit more about the capital markets pipeline outlook. But more broadly, I mean we're really pleased with our performance in the second quarter and printing another number one middle market sponsor position on the table. It's nice to see the second quarter in a row. 3Q is the typical seasonal period where it's a little down for capital markets and we expect that that may play out as it's done in prior years. But I think the floor in that seasonally down period is actually higher this year than it's been in prior years. So that's something to keep in mind, that given all of the investments, we actually sure will be down off a great 2Q, but the floor is probably higher than prior years, number one. Number two, the diversification not only within capital markets but outside of capital markets and all the investments we've been making in wealth. We had those two significant asset management teams that we brought on board plus all of our organic investments inside the private bank and broadly is really driving wealth fees. So here to see wealth fees be a bigger contributor in the third quarter. And just as you see the rate environment moving around, we're seeing opportunities in helping our customer hedge the exposure to rates. And so, we expect to see some benefit there. And just a number of other categories, including service charges and ability for possibly some mortgage banking opportunities, as rates seem to be stabilizing and down. So there's just a number of other categories, given the diversification of the platform, that will allow us to stay on track here as you head into the third quarter.
Bruce Van Saun: And also, just to add to that, we did take some regulatory cleanup items in other incomes, so that was suppressed in the quarter, which should bounce back next quarter. But with that, Don, why don't you give a little more color on kind of…
Don McCree: Yes, so it's interesting. The characteristics of the market are very favorable right now. There's enormous amounts of liquidity. And that drove really the first half of the year, which was primarily like a refinancing market. So if you look at transactions done in the core capital markets being syndicated lending and bonds, it was about 85% refinancing of existing exposures that were on people's balance sheet and extending maturities and the like. What we didn't see and what we're beginning to see is new money activity led by the private equity team. So as we move into a more favorable interest rate environment, a decent economic environment, we're starting to see the pipelines really grow on the PE side of the business. And frankly, that's where the big underwritings are, and that's where the profitability drives. M&A is hanging in there pretty well. Remember, we are primarily a middle market investment bank, so we do the mid-sized deals, $100 million valuation to $1 billion valuation, $100 million capital raise to $1 billion capital raise. So those have actually been more resilient than the really big ticket M&A deals, which are getting government scrutiny and getting held up in regulatory approval. So those seem to be moving along reasonably well. The place we haven't seen a lot, we've seen actually more than we saw last year, is in the IPO side of the business. There are a lot of IPOs that are kind of prepped and ready, but people aren't pulling the trigger and going to market. And some of that's been the aftermarket performance of the IPOs that have happened so far. But if we can continue to get the broadening of the equity markets and the high rise of the equity markets, you could see some of that begin to come. And then we have a pretty decent pipeline in the convert side and the follow on side. So it's broad-based. It's pretty encouraging. And I think the backdrop is very favorable for a good second half and a great 2025, frankly. And we think we've got all the pieces we need to take advantage of the markets.
Brendan Coughlin: I'd maybe just very quickly add on the consumer side, our improvement is very durable, sticky fee revenue. So the card changes that both John and Bruce mentioned, we reissued 3.5 million debit cards last quarter in a new contract that just drops directly to the bottom line. It's predictable and will stick around. Service charges has bottomed out. Mortgage we think will be in the zone, it could get a little bit of favorability if rates drop a little bit. And then the wealth AUM growth is sticky, durable, repeatable fee income. So that's what we're calling for, a steady continued upward momentum on consumer without a lot of volatility.
Bruce Van Saun: I'll just add one more thing, as we're beginning to see, it's interesting because the private banking teams never had a capital market business at their prior employer. And so we're starting to see some crossover activity among the private banking clients here coming on board into capital markets. I don't know if that's a second half thing, but I think that's a brand new opportunity from a client base that was never really resident at Citizens before.
Scott Siefers: Perfect. Thank you for that color. And then wanted to ask a little bit about the reserve and specifically the office reserve. I think we're up at 11.1% now, which is, of course, very, very high. I guess I'm curious about the factors, as you might think about them, that would allow you to start sort of absorbing losses with that existing reserve. In other words, what sort of allows that office reserve to start to come down rather than to continue to take off? I think when you talk about the reserve more broadly, you've pointed to non-core runoff as being the thing that might allow the reserve to benefit, but just curious about how office fits in there in particular.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I would say -- I'll start and let John add color, but I'd say that office, there's still a lot of uncertainty in that space. Just what we're seeing in terms of valuations, cap rates, the path of future interest rates. And so, I think we've played it conservatively with having a big reserve and then just kind of letting the charge-offs run through, while maintaining the reserve. I think you'd have to get to a point where you started to see things solidify a little bit and start to move in the right direction, so to speak. And I don't really see that happening actually for certainly this year. It will happen maybe sometime in next year. So we're kind of prepared for a slog here on office that we've got our arms around the properties. We know what the maturity schedules are. We've got good people working with the borrowers to deliver good outcomes. I don't expect we'll see any big surprises, but we'll continue to, I think, just work our way through it. At the point where we hit a kind of feel better moment when things start to look like they're moving in the right direction, that's when we'll be able to start to draw down on the reserve and we'll reap a nice benefit when that happens. John?
John Woods: Yes. I would just echo that point. I mean just having some growing confidence in valuations and seeing maybe transactions occur could be a likelihood of 2025 outcome. And so this is a multi-quarter probably multiyear journey that we're on. But given all the balance sheet strength, that we have with our capital position, we feel really confident that any uncertainties are expressed in the reserves and any other -- anything else would be supported by the capital. I would also mention that we're working the book down. I mean we started out at $4.2 billion, we’re down to $3.3 billion. So we're lowering the exposure every quarter we're working...
Bruce Van Saun: That's a good way through repayments and some of it is through [indiscernible] Nonetheless, it is coming down.
John Woods: Exactly. And we're getting some kind of payoffs and paydowns. We're getting -- we're working through the riskier credits and we're having conversations that have been accelerated given our maturity profile that we've had the opportunity to really lean in with our borrowers and when and if we've come to sort of extensions, we've been able to extract, in many cases, better positioning and collateral. So this is, as I said, a multi-quarter journey, and we're feeling good about our [indiscernible].
Bruce Van Saun: I’ll just elevate too, to the second part of your question is that, away from that, away from the General Office, we're still feeling good about what we're seeing in the consumer metrics, in commercial C&I and we run our reserve calculations based on scenarios. And clearly, the risk of recession seems to be less than it was a couple of quarters ago. And so, our need to keep adding to reserves for rest of the book would seem to be abating somewhat. So that's why when we say we'll continue to see -- we're calling out a slightly lower charge-off number in Q3, and then we have the trend of being able to draw down on those reserves, which I think will accelerate in coming quarters.
Scott Siefers: Perfect. All right. Thank you all very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. One moment please while we open your line Mr. Usdin. Your line is open, go ahead.
Ken Usdin: Okay, great. Good morning. Hey, John and Bruce, on the cost side, so you guys are doing early job keeping costs flat. You mentioned earlier, you're hiring some bankers. You obviously have the wealth management people. And I'm just wondering if you can help us understand like the growth that you have there and like where the top and extra cost program are in terms of the offsets to be able to kind of still hold the line? I know that it's kind of in line with your full year guidance, but just the puts and takes of kind of where we are at this point of the year in terms of -- is there just more to come on top to offset those hires and the growth and the strong investment banking results, et cetera? Thanks.
John Woods: Yes. Thanks, Ken, for the question. Just talking about TOP, it's been emblematic of who we are, as you know, for a number of years. The top line program is going to generate, call it, $135 million or so of run rate benefits when you get to the end of this year in 2024, the underpinnings of that program, we often have vendor contributions. That's a big driver. We launched the data and analytics contribution this year, which will continue into future years. We've had a really interesting ability to invest in our [fraud] (ph) program and a number of other opportunities, including branch rationalization that have underpinned a really strong TOP program this year. And that, of course, is the way over time, we have been able to invest in entrepreneurial and innovative initiatives, while not needing to cover that and to sell fund, those kinds of things. The TOP 10 program we're working on. And we're feeling good about the early opportunities. I think we have launched some analysis in the generative AI space, and we're live on a couple of use cases. And I think we're going to see an ability to broaden out there pretty nicely in terms of underpinning the next TOP program. There's a half a dozen of other areas, expanding data and analytics. What we're doing in our technology space, which converging our platforms with our ability to converge our mainframes and so I do think that we feel very good about the ongoing ability to make investments and self-fund those investments to the TOP program in -- as you get into the end of 2024 and into 2025 and maybe I'll just stop there and see if there's anything else I would like to add.
Ken Usdin: Okay. Great. All right. Second question, I know that you issued 400 preferreds and redeemed 300 at the -- in early July. And I think with that, you're still kind of in the 1.2%, 1.3% zone, maybe 1.3%, preferred to RWAs as you contemplate the buyback as you think about the SEB and all of that, like how do you just think about the overall capital stack in terms of like what your ultimate goals are for optimization of your capital position? Thanks.
John Woods: We're feeling pretty good about where we stand in the capital space. I mean, I think we basically think that around 1.25% is fine. We end up with -- we probably have more CET1, so when you look at the overall Tier 1 stack, we've got higher quality capital given the fact that we have more CET1 driving our overall Tier 1. 1.25% is fine, it’s probably -- we probably won't go much below that and a range of 1.25% to 1.50% of RWAs is probably where we'll operate. We have a number of issues out there that are coming into the ability to -- into call periods and into 2025. And so there could be some opportunities to refinance, just like we did this year, there are some very interesting refinance opportunities to lower our preferred coupon that we're paying on the preferred capital. So that's something we'll keep an eye on as we go forward into 2025.
Ken Usdin: Okay. Great. And sorry, just one to follow up on that last one. Just the -- so the RWAs have been coming down and your average earning assets have been kind of flat. And I know you talked a little bit about this earlier. But is kind of flattish on total balance sheet size, average earning assets. Is that the right way to think about things going forward given all the moving parts on both sides of the balance sheet?
John Woods: Yes. I mean, for 2024, I think the answer to that is yes, with growing RWAs. As I mentioned, we have excess liquidity at June 30 and you could see the overall balance sheet being basically in the same zone as where we are today, but the ability to basically deploy some excess liquidity into lending in the second half is really the plan. So we would see RWAs and loans growing from June 30 to the end of the year.
Bruce Van Saun: We can see some growth, though, in I'd say, spot deposits and spot loans in Q4 above that, about just deploying the liquidity. So just to be clear.
John Woods: Yes, agreed. We're going to see deposit growth and loan growth. It's just that given the excess securities that we have on balance sheet overall interest-earning assets are about where they will be maybe just a little bit higher.
Ken Usdin: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Manan Gosalia: Hey, good morning. If I try to back into the 4Q NII number using your full year guide and the 3Q guide, it implies 3% to 4% quarter-on-quarter increase in NII in 4Q. My question there is, what do you need to see that uptick in NII? I know there's some benefit from the -- on the swaps front, but do you also need to see loan growth. Do you need to see deposit costs continuing to come down? Do you need any help from rates? Can you help us frame that?
John Woods: Sure. Yes. And I'd say broadly that the majority of the increase in 4Q is really coming from net interest margin rebounding. So just allowing all of those positive tailwinds from net interest margin across the whole platform from noncore, the front book, back book dynamics and all of those drivers is the majority of the increase in NII for 4Q. However, there is a meaningful contribution expected from loan growth as well, and we talked about loan growth earlier in the call and how all three businesses, Private Bank, consumer and commercial are all expected to contribute to that in terms of how that plays out for the second half. When it comes to just that net interest margin number, as I mentioned, noncore front book, back book -- you also have increase in deposits that you just heard Bruce talk about that increase -- that's a better funding mix where we'll have more deposits and less wholesale funding as you get into the second half. Your other question about that deposit pricing and the rate cut. I think we're somewhat well balanced around whether the Fed cuts or not. We tend to have some offsetting forces there where we have some asset sensitivity and a net floating position that benefits with rates being a little higher, but then that often the higher for longer impact on deposit migration tends to keep us close to neutral. And so, whether we get a cut or not, I think we're feeling pretty good about the fourth quarter NII being a nice rebound and a meaningful increase versus 3Q. And then the last part I'll throw out there is, again, all the initiatives and how -- for example, balance sheet optimization and Private Bank are all accretive to net interest margin on a quarterly basis.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And I would just add to that as well that we also think that reminder that the Q4 is a seasonally strong quarter for fees. So I think there could be that rebound in NII kicking in Q4, strong feed quarter, continued discipline on expenses, credit seemingly moving in the right direction. So -- and then continued share repurchase. So you put that all together, you could have kind of a nice uptick in the Q4 results.
Manan Gosalia: That's really helpful. And then as a follow-up on the commercial middle market side, you outlined several positive drivers for lines picking up in the back half. Does that come with higher utilization? Or do you need to see lower rates for utilization to pick up? And maybe how does the uncertainty around the election? How is that factoring into your conversations with clients?
Don McCree: Yes, what we're assuming in our utilization growth as it's largely in the capital call and subscription lines. So we're seeing a little bit in the middle market. So I think the middle market trend will be a little bit longer. What we've seen our middle market companies do is kind of take their leverage levels down with economic uncertainty. So as the economy begins to show signs of stabilization, more certainty stabilization, maybe they get a little more aggressive investing in their businesses. And I was with a whole bunch of middle-market CEOs last week and every single one of them said they have were new investment plans over the next 18 months. So that will take a little bit longer. And I don't really see massive impact of -- from the election. I think you may get some market volatility based on what someone says day in, day out. But I think the medium-term trend is intact. And we are seeing -- I mean, the playbook we're going to run in California and Florida, which Bruce mentioned, is going to mirror the playbook we ran in New York, where we're having just extremely strong client acquisition as we bring experienced market bankers onto the platform, and they their clients with them. So very early days, but those pipelines are building kind of literally within two months of hiring the new bankers. So there won't be huge numbers of the asset, but that will be another tailwind for us, I think.
Manan Gosalia: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.
John Pancari: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Good morning.
John Pancari: Bruce, I think you talked about the expectation, the medium-term plan to shrink the CRE exposure incrementally from here. Just wanted to get an idea of where you think that could settle out? I mean, right now, your commercial real estate loans are about 130% of your risk-based capital plus reserves, where do you think it goes from that perspective post this expected runoff.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I'd say over the medium term, we'd probably take the pure commercial book down at least 25%. And that will come across the asset classes, obviously, want to be smaller in office, multifamily, we can lead that down a bit since we took a big upsurge with the investors deal. We will make room for some CRE opportunities with the private bankers since it's important part of their customer base. And so, there'll be a little bit of offset to that. But that kind of directionally gives you a sense as to kind of what the plans are. And as I said earlier in the call, I think we're making room for more C&I growth that we'd like to kind of flex and have a bigger loan capital allocation to C&I and a smaller to CRE over time.
John Pancari: Right. Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And related to that, my second one is on the private banking side. First, on the deposit side, the $4 billion in deposits, I know 81% of that is commercial, 36% of that is DDA. How much of those deposits are deposits with venture capital and private equity firms are related to that industry.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes. Of the commercial and business banking oriented deposits, the majority are from private equity and venture firms. But I would note that it's heavily led by operating deposits. And so the way that the relationship actually works is starting as their cash management operating bank, which is why the DDA and [indiscernible] percentages is so high in the business. So they're stable, predictable and generally lendable deposits. So we're pleased with the profile. If you think of the loans that have come in, obviously, the LDR of the private bank is quite low, and we've got a good amount of liquidity padding when you look at the lendability of the deposit base to continue to drive loan growth even within the profile of just the private bank. So we're pleased with the quality that you're seeing the loan book diversify to consumers. The deposit book has still remained in that sort of 80-20 split. But given the pace of growth, that obviously suggests that the consumer business is also growing at a pretty healthy clip. That just takes some time, and we do expect that to catch up. And it will diversify over time to more of a 60-40, maybe over the longer-term horizon 50-50. But…
Bruce Van Saun: With both deposits and loans...
Brendan Coughlin: Both deposits and loans, I mean the higher rates have held back on mortgage, obviously, and then the business banking and commercial deposit growth is quicker and lumpier, but we do expect that to continue to change over time, and we're pleased with the strength of the consumer opening these private banking offices, which should attract more of a high net worth individual as well.
John Pancari: Okay. Thank you. Then one last one. If you could just maybe update us on the likelihood of additional team hires on the private banking side. And then the Wealth AUM going up to about $3.6 billion there. I know you acknowledged that might be a tougher slog and -- but it looks like towards the end of the quarter that you had that big jump in AUM. Just curious if you could give a little bit of color around what's driving that recent upturn.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I'll start and pass it to Brendan. But I just want to make an overriding point is that, we want to demonstrate that we can run this as a profitable business. And so, when we initiated the launch of the private bank, we put some markers out there as to where -- what we were going to do this year, hitting breakeven in the fourth quarter. And then next year getting to numbers that had $9 billion of loans, $10 billion of AUM, $11 billion of deposits. That translates to 5% accretion to our bottom line. And so, we're still building the business. We're building the service levels. We're making investments in more support people, and we feel really good about the trajectory that we're on. We want to get that right, we want to get that flywheel running and hit those numbers before we start going crazy making investments in other regions and other opportunities. Having said that, if there are particularly unique situations that we can kind of fit in and execute over the next 18 months that are important locations, and they don't affect our ability to hit the numbers, we'll be open to that. And then the other thing is on the Wealth management side, we had a strong base with Card sell. We knew ultimately that we were going to have to expand the capabilities that we had by bringing in more teams. And the focus has been on a geographically situated teams that can be contiguous with the private banking teams that we've set up in San Francisco, Boston, New York and Florida. And so, so far, we've been able to bring two great teams like quality, everything, one in San Francisco, one in Boston. That's accounting for a big chunk of that rise in AUM with more to transfer in from their customer base. So we have momentum there. We also have a ton of folks interested in joining our platform. So we can have those conversations and keep bringing those wealth teams in because they don't really impact the near-term financials negatively that usually come in around breakeven with an opportunity to quickly turn into profitability. So Brendan, you can add to that.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes, you nailed [indiscernible] what you said. I would just say on the wealth side, we'll be very selective on the banking expansion until not only we make have confidence in hitting the financials, but also it's still built, and we're very pleased with how the build is going and we're attracting clients. The market is still quite disrupted both on the client side as well as the talent side. We're going to be very thoughtful and make sure that we're only attracting the highest of quality teams. We're being very selective on that. On the Wealth side, I would just say, look, for really the first time in our history, I think our right to win in private Wealth is at an all-time high. And there's a lot of inbounds we're getting from some of the highest quality advisers in the market. We're also being very selective there. I'd remind you all that we have long been on hunt for scale here, and we've looked at a lot of acquisitions. We've obviously done one or two over the years, but the economics have been a little out of reach with 10 plus your paybacks on tangible book value when you're buying RIAs, given the multiples that some of the private equity firms are paying. So the economics of the talent acquisition are significantly more attractive to us. Obviously, with de minimis tangible book value hit. And to Bruce's point, there's not really a large J-curve in the short term. So we're very pleased with the inbounds and talent that we're getting. We expect to continue to selectively add top end market, wealth talent to really round out the bankers that we hired. So we're looking forward to a strong second half of the year there.
John Pancari: Great. Thanks, Brendan.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Go ahead.
Gerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning, Bruce. Good morning, John. John, you talked and gave us good detail about the office portfolio of commercial real estate. And I think you said that some of your assumptions in the bottom left-hand corner of Slide 14 show that this downturn is far worse than historical downturns. Can you share with us two ideas or two answers. First is, when you look back, I think you guys have been aggressively attacking this portfolio for just over a year now. When you look back at those early workouts in the second quarter of 2023, how are the assumptions that you're using then compared to today? And then second, and I'm with Bruce that maybe this office problem doesn't resolve itself until sometime next year. What are you seeing incrementally in terms of valuations or losses? Is it still deteriorating in office? Or has it just stabilized and we just got to work through these portfolios?
John Woods: Yes. I'll go ahead and start off, Gerard. I mean, I think that earlier -- what's evolved over the last year or so has been our outlook with respect to valuations and NOI and what the rent rollovers would actually entail and at what speed we would see deterioration. So of course, our reserve levels are higher now than they were a year ago. Every quarter, we endeavor to put a ring fence around our exposures and give it our best attempt at forecasting what we think the evolution will be in valuations and NOI. I'd say that this quarter, we've done that again. And we feel like we've leaned in with this 11.1%, which really -- when you look at the property valuations steep to trough, that 72% has grown over the last year. And those have been the main drivers for why after charging off, we still end up with this reserve of 11.1%. But I'd say that there's still a lot of uncertainty left, but I think the variability, we're hopeful that the variability in this will start to decline as we continue to work through our maturities and have conversations with our borrowers and extract additional collateral and work through paydowns where we can -- this will be a multi-quarter event and it will take into 2025 [indiscernible]
Bruce Van Saun: I would just add that I do think the Fed starting to move rates lower will certainly be help here. So part of the reason the losses ended up higher than what potentially we thought back in early 2023 because those cap rates going up at inflation that was impacting NOI and things like that. And so, I think we've seen inflation now leveling off. And if the Fed starts to move rates down, that could also start to move things in the other direction. It's too early to call a victory here, but there are some positive signs. And I think lease up rates generally are actually holding or potentially getting a little better as return to office picks up. But again, that's not that significant in the big scheme of things.
Gerard Cassidy: Can we -- is it fair to say that the second derivative of the rate of deterioration that you guys are seeing, is it slowing in the office or…
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Yes. Definitely.
Gerard Cassidy: Okay. It’s yes. Okay, good. Thank you. Okay, and then as a follow-up, you guys talked a lot about private equity in your Slide 17, you show some great numbers. Obviously, number one in the sponsor business and your capital markets business is benefiting from that. So the question I have is, and it's not on the capital call or subscription lines, but it seems over the years for banks to win in this capital markets business with sponsors, you have to use your balance sheet to win this business. You've got to lend money to the sponsors. So can you share with us your exposure to, I guess, one of the line items and one of the regulatory reports is non-depository financial lenders that you lending to them. Can you share with us your exposure there? How you manage that risk? Because it seems like banking initial has been derisked, but maybe it's in the private credit side and the indirect exposure for the industry could come through that channel. Can you give us some color there, Bruce, or Don?
Don McCree: Yes. Hi, Gerard, why don't I take that? It's Don. So we bank the private capital sector in several different ways. We obviously have capital call and subscription lines, which are based on LPs, we have financing lines to some of the private credit organizations, which are kind of structured as almost like asset-backed lending, where we have diversified pools of loans underneath it, we have advance rates and the like. So it's actually relatively safe, almost investment-grade like lending, even if those complexes begin to take some losses on their underwriting portfolios. So we like those two businesses a lot. We're probably not going to grow them too much more across the entirety of the company because it is a large concentration already. But when you look at those non-bank financial numbers that includes insurance companies. There's a whole bunch of other exposures in there also. And then, of course, we land the riskiest stuff we do is to the underlying leverage buyouts and our strategy there forever has been very large holds. It's an underwrite to distribute business. The average outstanding is like $12 million on a given deal. So very diversified across a large group of leveraged credit. The book is actually shrinking, given the lack of market activity over the last kind of 1.5 years or so. So we feel like we're very well diversified and I've been doing this business, as you know, for a very long time and where you get really hurt is when you have big concentrations in leveraged loans and we see that with some of our competition, but we're not going to go there just because that's the way you run those businesses. So those are the really big pops.
Gerard Cassidy: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Georgia Bank. One moment while we open your line Mr. O’Connor. Your line is now open.
Matt O’Connor: Thank you. Good morning. Can you guys talk about how you think deposits will reprice down. I guess, the first kind of, call it, two or three Fed cuts versus and more sustained reduction?
John Woods: Yes, sure. I'll take that. I mean I think what we're likely to see under the first couple of cuts we're modeling out approximately 20% to 30% down betas in those first couple of cuts. The way the forwards have it playing out overall. The longer those cuts are in place, the more there's the opportunity to see rollovers of CDs, et cetera, and to lean in and price down. So the fact that we have, I think the forwards get down to around 4% by the end of 2025 and may start to get into the 3.50% range in terms of our outlook when you get out into 2026 and beyond. Through that full tightening cycle, we think that the full round trip could be -- could approach -- the down beta is good approach where up betas were. Our up beta is around 51%. I think the down beta could get up to that level over the full cycle, but it will be $20 million to $30 million for the first couple.
Matt O’Connor: Okay. And then thoughts on does deposit growth pick up a bit for, I guess, the industry and you've got some specific initiatives, obviously, but do you see some pickup in kind of broader deposit trends as well with some Fed cuts?
John Woods: Yes. I mean, I think broadly, we believe we're going to have deposit growth in the second half contributing from all three of our businesses. So 2Q is a seasonally down quarter. We saw that, and we're expecting that plus all of our initiatives that we have in place are going to contribute to deposit growth in the second half. We've got that one cut in September, and our outlook that will be helpful. I don't think that it's absolutely necessary to have that cut in order to continue to have deposit growth. But certainly, it would be helpful to get that deposit growth to stop kind of the migration aspects and the mix shifts that the industry has been seeing. And then as you broaden that out, when we have overall deposit growth and average deposits are higher, that will be consistent with a very positive funding mix because wholesale funding can be lower in terms of funding the balance sheet, and that's a tailwind for NII and NIM into the second half as well.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I would just add some color there, the uptick in private bank deposits in the quarter was $1.6 billion. And so you can see that we've really got a cadence and a rhythm in terms of kind of growing the book there and the private bank and bringing in the customer base. So we would expect to have again, something that most other banks don't have to drive deposit growth and having that unique business opportunity. And then there's generally some seasonality that's favorable in the consumer business and the commercial business. So I think the outlook for deposit growth in the second half is pretty solid.
Brendan Coughlin: The one point I would add on the consumer side is that, we a number of years in a row where we've outperformed on a relative basis on DDA low-cost deposits and with benchmarking that we see so far this year, we believe we're number one in the peer set and consumer for relative DDA performance, and we see that continuing. So we think the trends have stabilized up so much of our deposit strategy is grounded in the health of our DDA base and we expect whatever the market throws us that we'll continue to outperform peers and doing that for a long time now. And certainly, this year has been a real strength.
Matt O’Connor: Okay. Thank you.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. I think that's it for the queue. Thank you, everybody, for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and your support. Have a great day.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-17 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to Citizens Financial Group First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alan and I’ll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I’ll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.
Kristin Silberberg: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our first quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our first quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it’s important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to you, Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thank you, Kristen. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We were pleased to start the year with a solid quarter. We continue to play strong defense through an uncertain environment with a CET1 ratio of 10.6%, our LDR at 81%, our allowance for loan loss ratio of 161%, and general office reserves now at 10.6%. On the P&L, we are still seeing a modest decline in NII though our NIM was stable at 2.91%. Fees picked up by 3% sequential quarter, led by capital markets and card and expenses were flat. Our credit trends are in line with expectations. We repurchased $300 million of shares during the quarter as we free up capital from our non-core rundown. Our guide for Q2 and full year remain consistent with our expectations at the outset of the year. Our strategic initiatives are making good progress. The Private Bank is off to a good start, reaching $2.4 billion in deposits at quarter end. We expect momentum to accelerate further over the course of the year. We are also focused on building out private wealth management through further investment in Clarfeld plus several imminent team lift-outs. Our New York City Metro initiative continues to go well with the fastest growth of any of our regions and really strong net promoter scores. Our focus in the commercial bank of serving the middle-market, private capital and key growth verticals has put us in great position to benefit from a pickup in deal activity, which we expect to build further over the course of the year. And our TOP 9 program is being executed well, allowing us to self-fund our growth investments while keeping overall expense growth rate muted. While there are still many uncertainties in the external environment, we feel we are in good position to navigate the challenges that may arise and we maintain a positive outlook for Citizens over the balance of the year as well as the medium term. Over the past decade, we have undertaken a major transformation of Citizens. Our Consumer and Commercial Banking segments are positioned for success, and we are now looking to build the premier bank owned private bank and wealth franchise. Our balance sheet has been repositioned with an exceptionally strong capital liquidity and funding profile and we are deploying our loan capital more selectively to achieve better risk-adjusted returns. Our expense base has been tightly managed with AI offering the potential for further breakthroughs. Lots accomplished with more to do, clearly, exciting times for Citizens. With that, let me turn it over to John.
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, the year is off to a good start. First quarter results were solid against the backdrop of a more constructive macro environment, which supported an improvement in capital markets, stability in our margin and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with capital levels either top of our peer group, excellent liquidity and a healthy credit reserve position. Importantly, this positions us to execute well against our multiyear strategic initiatives, including the build-out of our private bank. Let me start with some highlights of our first quarter financial results, referencing slides 3 to 6 before I discuss the details. We generated underlying net income of $395 million for the first quarter and EPS of $0.79. This includes a negative $0.03 impact from the private bank, which is a significant improvement from the $0.11 impact last quarter as we start to see revenues pick up and we progress to our expected breakeven in 2H ‘24. It also improved the impact of the non-core portfolio, which contributed a $0.13 negative impact. While our non-core portfolio is currently a sizable drag to results, it is steadily running off, creating a tailwind for performance going forward. Our notable items this quarter were $0.14, which primarily consists of an adjustment to the FDIC special assessment and TOP and other efficiency-related expenses. Excluding these notable items, our underlying ROCE for the quarter was 10.6%. Playing through defense remains at the top of our priority list, and we ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet position with CET1 at 10.6% or 8.9% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal. We also continue to make meaningful improvements to our funding and liquidity profile in the first quarter. Our pro forma LCR strengthened to 120%, which is well in excess of the large bank category 1 requirement of 100% and our period-end LDR improved to 81% from 82% in the prior quarter. On the funding front, we reduced our period-end FHLB borrowings by about $1.8 billion linked quarter to a modest $2 billion. We also increased our structural funding base with a very successful $1.25 billion senior issuance and another $1.5 billion auto collateralized issuance during the quarter. And we have another $1 billion of auto backed issuance expected to settle this week. This is our fourth issuance, and it was executed at our tightest credit spreads to date. In addition, we expect to be a more programmatic issuer of senior unsecured debt going forward. Credit trends have been performing in line with our expectations, with NCOs coming in at 50 basis points for the first quarter. Our ACL coverage ratio of 1.61% is up 2 basis points from year-end. This includes a 10.6% coverage for general office, up slightly from 10.2% in the prior quarter. We are well positioned for the medium term with expected tailwinds to NIM that support a range of 3.25% to 3.4%. Regarding strategic initiatives, the Private Bank is doing very well. We continue to make inroads in the New York Metro and our latest top program is progressing nicely. In addition, we are poised to benefit from an improving capital markets environment with our investments in the business and synergies from our acquisitions positioning us to capitalize as activity levels continue to pick up. Next, I’ll talk through the first quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on Slide 7. As expected, NII is down 3% linked quarter, reflecting a stable margin on a 2% decrease in average interest-earning assets given lower loan balances and day-count. As you can see from the NIM walk at the bottom of the slide, our margin was flat at 2.91% as the combined benefit of higher asset yields and non-core runoff and day count were offset by higher funding costs and the impact of swaps. As expected, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta remains in the low 50s at 52%. And although we continue to see deposit migration, the rate of migration is slowing. Overall, our deposit franchise has performed well with our beta generally impact the peers. Moving to Slide 8. Our fees were up 3% linked quarter given a notable improvement in capital markets and good card results. The improvement in capital markets reflects a nice pickup in M&A activity and strong bond underwriting results. Our Capital Markets business consistently holds the top 3 middle market sponsor book renter position and this quarter, we achieved the #1 spot. Our deal pipelines remain strong, and we continue to see positive early momentum in capital markets this quarter with strong refinancing activity continuing in the bond market. In card, we had a nice increase, primarily driven by the benefit of a strategic conversion of our debit and credit cards to Mastercard. Our client hedging business was down a bit this quarter with lower activity in commodities and FX. The decline in mortgage banking fees was driven by a lower benefit from the MSR valuation net of hedging and a modest decline in servicing P&L, partially offset by higher production fees as margin improved while lot volumes were stable. On Slide 9, we did a nice job managing our underlying expenses, which were stable. We will continue to execute on our TOP program, which gives us the capacity to self-fund our growth initiatives. On Slide 10, period end and average loans are down 2% linked quarter. This was driven by non-core portfolio runoff and a decline in commercial loans, given paydowns and generally lower client loan demand, our highly selective approach to lending in this environment, along with exits of lower returning credit-only relationships. Commercial line utilization continued to decline this quarter as clients remain cautious and M&A activity was limited in the face of an uncertain market environment. Next, on Slides 11 and 12, we continue to do well in deposits. Year-on-year period-end deposits were up $4.2 billion driven by growth in retail and the private bank. Period end deposits were down slightly linked quarter given expected seasonal impacts in commercial largely offset by growth in the private bank and retail branch deposits. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were well controlled, up 6 basis points, which translates to a 52% cumulative beta. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels. About 68% of our deposits are granular, stable consumer deposits and approximately 70% of our overall deposits are insured or secured. This attractive deposit base has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in the higher rate environment. With the Fed holding steady, we saw the migration of deposits to higher cost categories continue to moderate. And with the contribution of attractive deposits from the private bank, non-interest-bearing deposits are holding steady at about 21% of total deposits. Moving on to credit on Slide 13. Net charge-offs were 50 basis points, up 4 basis points linked quarter. This includes increased commercial charge-offs related to pre general office, which were in line with our expectations. In retail, we saw a modest seasonal improvement. Non-accrual loans increased 8% linked quarter driven by general office. The continued runoff of the auto portfolio drove a modest decline in retail, while other retail categories were stable. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.61%, which is a 2 basis point increase from the fourth quarter, reflecting broadly stable reserves with lower loan balances given non-core runoff and commercial balance sheet optimization. The reserve for the $3.4 billion general office portfolio represents 10.6% coverage, up slightly from 10.2% in the fourth quarter. On the bottom left side of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level. We feel these assumptions represent a severe scenario that is much worse than we’ve seen in historical downturns, so we feel the current coverage is very strong. Moving to Slide 15. We have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio is a strong 10.6% and if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt-out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio would be 8.9%. Both our CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been among the top of our peers, and you can see on Slide 16, where we stand currently relative to peers in the fourth quarter. Given our strong capital position, we resumed common share repurchases and including dividends, we returned a total of $497 million to shareholders in the first quarter. On the next few pages, I’ll update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank, including our private bank. First, on Slide 17, we have a strong transformed consumer bank with a robust and capable deposit franchise, a diverse lending business where we are prioritizing relationship-based lending and a meaningful revenue opportunity as we scale our wealth business. Importantly, we continue to make great progress taking deposit share with retail deposits up 20% year-on-year as we continue building our customer base in New York Metro. Slide 18. Let me update you on our progress in building a premier private bank, taking the opportunity to fill the void left in the wake of the bank failures last year. Our build net is going very well and gaining momentum. We are growing our client base and now have about $2.4 billion of attractive deposits with roughly 30% non-interest-bearing. Also, we are now at just over $1 billion of loans and $0.5 billion of investments and continuing to grow. We just opened our newest private banking office in Palm Beach, Florida, and we are opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities with our Clarfeld Wealth Management business as the centerpiece of that effort. Next, on Slide 19, we have built a formidable full-service commercial bank, which consistently punches above its weight. Our multiyear investments in talent, capabilities and industry expertise put us in an enviable position to provide life cycle services to middle market, mid-corporate and sponsor clients in high-growth sectors of the U.S. economy. In particular, we are uniquely positioned to serve the private capital ecosystem. As evidenced by our consistent standing at the top of the sponsored lead tables, we are well positioned to take advantage of a more constructive capital markets environment and we are excited to start seeing the synergies from our acquisitions coming through in our results this quarter. Moving to Slide 20, we provide the guidance for the second quarter. We expect NII to decrease about 2%. Non-interest income should be up approximately 3% to 4%. We expect non-interest expense to be stable to down slightly. Net charge-offs are expected to be about 50 basis points and the ACL should continue to benefit from the non-core runoff. Our CET1 is expected to come in at about 10.5% with approximately $200 million of share repurchases currently planned. We are broadly reaffirming our full year 2024 guide. We expect NII to land within the range of down 6% to 9%, consistent with our January guidance, with margin coming in a little better than expected, offsetting the impact of lower loan demand. The other components of PPNR are also tracking to our January guidance. In addition, NCOs are trending in line with our expectations of approximately 50 basis points for the year. Our target CET1 ratio for 2024 is approximately 10.5%, and the level of share repurchases will be dependent on our view of the external environment and loan growth. Given the changing rate outlook, I wanted to update you on how the swaps and our non-core portfolio are expected to impact NII and NIM as we look out further in 2024 and beyond. We’ve included Slide 25 in the appendix, which shows the expected swaps and non-core impact through 2027. By 4Q 2024, we expect higher swap expense to be partly offset by the NII benefit from the non-core rundown. Looking out further, we expect a significant NII tailwind and NIM benefit from the impact of non-core and swaps over the medium term given runoff and lower rates. This will be partially offset by the impact of the asset-sensitive core balance sheet, resulting in a medium-term NIM range of 3.25% to 3.4%. To wrap up, we delivered a solid quarter, featuring stable NIM, strong fee performance led by capital markets and cards, tight expense management and in-line credit performance. We have a series of unique initiatives that are progressing well. Our consumer bank has been transformed. Our commercial bank is exceptionally well positioned and we aim to build the premier bank-owned private bank and wealth franchise. We enjoy a strong capital liquidity and funding profile that allows us to support our customers while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives. Given several tailwinds, combined with continued strong execution, we are confident in our ability to hit our medium-term 16% to 18% return target. With that, I’ll hand it back over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. And Alan, let’s open it up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Ryan Nash: Hey, good morning Bruce. Good morning, John.
Bruce Van Saun: Good morning.
John Woods: Good morning.
Ryan Nash: Maybe to start off with some of the guidance, you broadly reiterated – can you maybe just flesh out how some of the expectations have changed, particularly around NII, John? I think you noted you still expect to be in the range. But what are the main drivers to get you there and what would it take to be better than the low end? And just as a follow-up on the margin, you held it flat and it sounds like it could be a little bit better. How have the expectations change relative to the 280 to 285 and the 285 you were expecting at the end of the year? Thank you.
John Woods: Yes, sure. I’ll go and talk through that. I’d say, as you may have heard in some of the opening remarks, we do expect that net interest margin trends have been quite good. And so we do expect net interest margin to come in a little better, maybe at the high end of that range rather than where we were at the beginning of the year. And a lot of the drivers of that net interest margin can be pinned on the investments we’ve made in the deposit franchise over the years that are really starting to come to fruition. And when you look at it, deposit levels are better in the first quarter than we expected and interest-bearing deposit costs are a little bit better. So just – and funding overall, when you look at our borrowing mix has improved significantly. So that’s underpinning a lot of the net interest margin. And when you combine that with the other side of the balance sheet, where you see the front book back book dynamic playing out. It’s very powerful. And so we’re feeling better about NIM trajectory. And I think that’s what you’re seeing with respect to our confidence in hitting that that net interest income range, given the confidence around net interest margin. As you get towards the end of the year, as I mentioned, I think, previously, we said our guide would be around 280 to 285 in that range, I’d say we’re probably going to come in at the upper end of that range now when we look out and maybe a tad above, we’ll see as it plays out. And then we’ll see the loan just given where loan demand has started off the year, maybe average loans maybe towards the lower end of that original range. But those offset a couple of basis points of NIM equals about a percentage point on loans. So that math just works out to be right down the middle of the fairway in terms of our guide. What could cause it to come in a little better, continued execution of our strategic initiatives if we see our execution kind of accelerating across the private bank, and our other key initiatives on the deposit side. And let’s see how the second half commercial rebound plays out. We are expecting working capital starting to pick up in the second half. We’re expecting utilization levels to pick up. We’re expecting activity in general, even in the M&A front and M&A finance to be part of the story in the second half. And so if that starts a little earlier or it comes in a little stronger, you could see us coming in maybe towards the lower end of that original NII guide.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I would just add one thing, Brian, it’s Bruce. The fact that the loan demand is a little light is, I think, okay, given there’s a kind of loop to what we’re doing on the deposit side. So we’re not going to chase loan growth. And if, therefore, there’s a little shrinkage in the balance sheet, we can run off our higher cost source of either FHLB funding or broker deposit funding. So we’re taking full advantage of that, which is helping bolster the NIM. The other thing is with less loan growth, you end up freeing more capital. And so that gives us the wherewithal to step up and continue to repurchase stock. And I think our stock is great value here. So we’re all in on that.
Ryan Nash: Got it. And thanks for all the color. And just maybe as a follow-up, just – any color in terms of what you’re seeing on the credit side, which seems to be tracking in-line with your expectations? And maybe specific to office where we saw a jump in the losses this quarter relative to the past few. Maybe just some color on what’s driving that? Was that increased severity? Are you front-loading some losses? And when inevitably do you think we could see the allowance in that portfolio peak. Thank you.
Bruce Van Saun: Let me start and then flip to Don. But I’d say there’s no real surprises here, Ryan. So we can basically see all the office maturities. We’ve got kind of bespoke careful handling on all of the significant exposures that we have, and we’ve been working with the borrowers just to make sure that we can have a win-win situation. So we can come through getting the best return on our loans and borrowers can stay with their properties through a tough environment. And I think that’s all going well. So if you have one quarter where the charge-offs tick up $20 million or the next quarter, they go down $15 million, you’re going to kind of see some modest variation around that line, but basically to use a colloquialism, the pig is going through the python. And it’s going to take a few more quarters for that to fully work its way through. But we’re not seeing any surprises, which is the good thing about this. And so Don, with that, maybe you could pick up.
Don McCree: No, I think that’s exactly right. We’ve taken our general office from about $4.2 billion to $3.4 billion. So it’s actually coming down nicely, and the charge-offs have actually been modest. The – most of the charge-offs are where we’re selling out of properties and doing AB loan structures and basically deciding to move on. We’ve had quite a few paydowns also. So it’s not all doom and gloom. But I’d go back to what Bruce said, it’s name by name, property by property. We’ve got our workout teams fully involved. It’s kind of playing out exactly as we expected it to be. If I took myself back 1.5 years ago and looked at the office portfolio, there was a lot of uncertainty. I think there’s a lot more uncertainty now. So remember, I’ve got a huge amount of absorption capacity just in my P&L for any losses that are materializing, and our reserve levels for the portfolio are well above where the severity of losses to date have been. So we feel we feel like we’re going to work through this, as we said, over the next few quarters and begin to peak at the loss levels.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And I just – maybe, John, you can add to this, but in terms of where do we go from here – you can see that the coverage ratio on office remains high, and it’s gone from 10.2 reserves to 10.6, but that rate of increase is slowing and so we’ve been taking the full charge off through the P&L and holding the reserve at high levels. At some point, we’ll be able to start drawing down on that reserve. I don’t want to make the call on that. But just take note that, that build is starting to slow. And so I don’t know if it’s maybe later this year or beginning of next year. But we will eventually get to a point where we can start drawing down on those reserves, which will be good for P&L.
John Woods: Yes, I agree with all that, I’d just add a point or two. So what’s built into the 10 you’ll see it in some of our slide materials is an expectation of a 71% decline in property values. And that’s what drives this 10.6% reserve for remaining losses.
Bruce Van Saun: Which is more severe than anything we’ve seen historically, including the great financial recession by a wide margin.
John Woods: Exactly. And I think we should also mention that just given what we put behind us, implies another 6% of losses that we put behind us. So we’ve got 10.6 in the reserve. We’ve charged off about 6. So you’re up over 16% in terms of coverage, we feel pretty good about it, and that’s where we think the losses are going to play out. And as Bruce mentioned, we’ll charge-offs themselves, maybe they peak later this year or early next. But we think we’ve got the reserves covered.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, next question.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Go ahead.
Scott Siefers: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. John, maybe just a thought on how much longer negative deposit migration continues. I think the prevailing wisdom is it’s slowing, but just curious to hear your updated thoughts on kind of when and why we might trough.
John Woods: Yes. I mean, we’ve been saying for a while that things have been decelerating. And I’d say our deposit performance this quarter has been – has been excellent in terms of – versus what we were expecting coming into the year. So again, deposit levels overall look good. DDA flows and low cost to high cost, migration overall, continuing to decelerate. And I think you can – we can point to, if you look at where we are, we were at around 21% of DDA at the end of last year at 12/31 and that flattened out. We were at 21% at 03/31. So DDA for us is stabilizing. And the – however, the low cost to high cost, again, decelerating and as it will continue to decelerate. And what we’ve been indicating is that that’s going to continue until you see the first cut out of the Fed, which is historically what we would expect. But it’s getting to the point where it’s having a diminishing impact on net interest margin. And so when you elevate overall, the contribution that our deposit franchise is delivering for net interest margin trends is excellent. And we’re feeling very good about the trajectory, the DDA stability throughout the rest of ‘24 and getting back to growth because when you think about what’s idiosyncratic to us and the strategic initiatives that we’re launching, the private bank non-interest-bearing is accretive to the overall company. We’re at maybe around 30% or more. And so that’s dragging that number up. So I think we have some…
Bruce Van Saun: New York Metro offers another opportunity.
John Woods: And New York Metro as well as a really good point. So the combination of those strategic initiatives, we have some expectation of DDA flattening out and growing as you get into the latter part of the year. And that underpins the net interest margin quite nicely.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Maybe, Brandon, you can add some color.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes. Sure. We’ve been talking for a couple of years now around how – since so much of our deposit book comes through consumer that we believe that we’ve transformed the book to be pure like or better. And I would just reiterate that, that’s what we’re seeing. We were up modestly linked quarter on overall deposits in the consumer book with some benchmarking that we get from a variety of sources, we believe we were number one in our peer set linked order on DDA. So on a relative basis, we still have a lot of confidence that we’re outperforming peers and it’s demonstrating the franchise quality that we’ve built. When you look at the customer level, customer deposits have actually been quite stable around $31,000 per customer. And the remixing of, as John pointed out, is pretty dramatically slowing. And I think that’s kind of indicating that the COVID burn down is beginning to really run its course. So there may be a little bit more, but we feel pretty good that we’re getting kind of the end of that behavioral cycle. We look at overall deposits on an inflation-adjusted basis, they’re back to basically pre COVID. So I think we’re kind of nearing the operating floors here for consumer. Given the strength of low-cost deposits that we have had relative to peers. The other implication is how we’re managing interest-bearing deposits. I do believe that we’ve peaked in the consumer segment in Q1 in our cost of funds. And why do I believe that we had $3 billion in CD rollover in March alone that were priced around 5%. We’ve retained 75% of those as they flipped over and materially lower prices between 3% and 4%. So you start to see the tailwinds building in that you can imagine the cost of funds in the consumer segment potentially beginning to reduce. We’ll see how it plays out where rates are at. But I do believe we’ve sort of peaked here in Q1, and it’s really driven by the strength of our low-cost performance. So we don’t need to chase high interest-bearing costs as a result of that. So I feel really good about where we’re at.
Scott Siefers: Alright, good. Thank you very much for the color.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.
John Pancari: Good morning. One just on additional color on the loan growth commentary, I know you said it could come in throughout the low end of your initial expectation for the year and you have cited weaker line utilization at this point, where – if you can maybe elaborate a little bit where you see some weakness in what pockets and where do you see some ultimate strengthening there in terms of timing? And then separately, a similar question around your deposit growth expectation, I think for the full year, you had figured out at around up 1% to 2%. Any additional color you can provide and how you’re feeling around that guidance at this point?
John Woods: Yes, I’ll just start off on loans and others can add. But I mean, what we’re seeing is that utilization coming in a little lower in the first quarter and that than was originally expected. But nevertheless, we still see the – in the second half, the interest around putting some working capital to work and commercial activity starting to pick up is really going to drive the reversal of that utilization trend as you get into the second half. On the retail side of things, we’re still seeing good opportunities in relationship mortgage and HELOC and in the private bank, where we’ve gotten a nice start in terms of – which is mostly a commercial lending driven amount of activity in the subscription line space. And that we see that picking up. So all in, one it is playing out about as expected, meaning we may be just a little bit lighter on loans, but we had expected that would be the case. And then the pickup in the second half will be coming out of the commercial business and private bank. Maybe any other color.
Bruce Van Saun: That’s well said, Don, any color.
Don McCree: Yes. No, I’ll – I think it’s across the board on the commercial side. And Part of it is due to the booming bond markets. I mean, we’re seeing a lot of customers access the bond markets as opposed to draw down existing lines. And then I think there’s a positive to it also, not for loan levels, but customers are running with lower leverage levels because they’ve been concerned about the economy. We’re seeing a broad, more positive view of the overall economy across really wide swaths of our client base. So that would indicate that they’re going to get more active in things like plant construction, working capital, growth, M&A, and so that should drive some bounce back in the back half of the year.
Bruce Van Saun: Anything from you, Brendan.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes. The only thing I would add is maybe just strategically that there’s a lot of ins and outs under the cover. So, as we run down auto by essentially $1 billion and other non-court getting replaced with high relationship, high-returning asset growth, whether it’s on the HELOC side or the private bank. So the headline numbers that you see around our loan growth, what you have to dig into is the transformative use of capital that we’re doing around a handful of areas that have more durable, sticky revenue sources that are going to create more cross-sell around fees and other things over time. So we’re pleased with how that’s going.
John Woods: And then on the – you had a question about deposits. On the deposit side of things in the first quarter. as I mentioned before, we saw DDA flatten out for the first time in many quarters. So that is really good to see. We also saw low cost flatten out. So overall, we were at 42% last quarter in low cost, we’re at 42% this quarter and low cost plus DDA. So the deposit trends from a mix perspective have been favorable. And from a quantity level of deposits at the end of the quarter came in higher than expected. That’s driven by just strong execution and our strategic initiatives contributing as we mentioned earlier, New York Metro and Private Bank along with the blocking and tackling that Brendan and Don have been at for a number of years to invest in the franchise. And so all of those investments are paying off, and we do expect to see deposit growth supporting our loan growth in the second half of ‘24.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I would just – I would highlight that – just one last quick piece of color is that very pleased to see the Private Bank now has had kind of two quarters with $1 billion-plus of deposit growth and we certainly think that, that’s sustainable and could even accelerate. So the ship has landed, and we’re off to a great start, and we expect that to continue and even accelerate.
John Pancari: Got it. Alright. Thanks, Bruce. And then on the capital front, I did to see the resumption in buybacks, the $300 million in repurchases this quarter. With CET1 here at around 10.6 or 8.9% when you dial in the AACI scenario, how do you look at the likelihood of incremental buybacks from here. In terms of a pace of buybacks, do you think that that could be reasonable given where you’re sitting right now on CET1. Thanks.
John Woods: Yes. I think this capital position that we’ve generated and have maintained is really creating a lot of flexibility. And when you think about our capital waterfall, I mean our top priority is to put capital to work that is to support customers and clients that is accretive to our cost of capital over time. And that’s really what we want to do and that we’re expecting to do. And that’s what capital allows us that flexibility. It also cushions against uncertainties. And so there have been a number – we look at the macro and being at a very strong capital level to be there for our clients, but also to cushion the downside to the extent uncertainties manifest is another use of a strong capital position. When you get down into kind of other potential uses of the capital, we support our dividend, of course, at top of the list. And then if we’re left with elevated capital levels, then we’re able to give it back to shareholders, which we did in the first quarter, we’re planning to do that here in the second quarter. And that flexibility will continue into the second half. So as we monitor loan demand and the macro, that will play into the trajectory of buybacks in the second half.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And I would also just go back to an earlier comment that we have I’d say, a front-loaded plan this year because there’s less loan growth. In fact, there’s loan contraction earlier in the year that then turns around and we start to see loan growth in the second half of the year, that would, by definition, mean we need capital to support the loan growth and there’ll be less capacity for share repurchases. But anyway, we gave the – you saw the 300 number in the first quarter, John mentioned 200 in the second quarter. And then we’ll see where we get to in the second half. If the loan growth fully doesn’t materialize, we can actually just turn around and keep repurchasing the stock.
John Pancari: Alright. Thanks, Bruce. Appreciate it.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.
Peter Winter: Thanks. Good morning. You guys have maintained the net charge-off guidance for the year, but if we assume no rate cuts this year, could it lead to higher net charge-offs than forecasting just given kind of no relief on debt service coverage ratios or loans coming up for renewal at higher rates?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, what I would say on that is the broad credit quality is still very good. So if you look at our C&I book, that’s in really good shape. Companies weathered the pandemic and leaned our business models, locked in lower cost financing. They’re doing more of that now early in the year. So we don’t really see hotspots even with kind of a higher for longer scenario in C&I. Similarly, in consumer, we’re still in very good shape. The consumer is benefiting from still strong liquidity levels, a strong labor market. And so we haven’t seen any adverse migrations in delinquencies or NPAs or anything like that. So that’s the bulk of the loan portfolio. If you then kind of look at the commercial real estate and the general office in particular, that’s relatively small as a percentage of the overall loan book. And I think there’s potentially some trends. We’re watching the reports that return to office is picking up. And so maybe there’s a little counter trend in office that offsets the kind of additional burden of hire for longer. But I think at the margin, it’s not going to change that charge-off number materially.
Peter Winter: Got it. And then…
Don McCree: Peter, I’ll just that from my side. We made no assumptions in our forecast that we’re going to benefit from lower rates. Because we just didn’t know and that’s our credit policy. We don’t go out on the future curve. We run all our scenarios based on where rates are today. So I think you’ve got a peak-ish kind of rate environment. If it lasts another couple of quarters or even another year, I don’t think it’s going to make a material difference to the way we forecast charge-offs.
Brendan Coughlin: The only point I would add on consumer is that our delinquency levels are actually net down year-over-year. Q1 over Q1, led mostly by resi, but we’re seeing really no signs of stress on the book. As Bruce pointed out, so I feel really good and even in a higher for longer that unless there’s a big economic shock that we’re in really good shape.
Peter Winter: And then just quickly, just a follow-up on office. I guess, I believe that more than half of the maturities on office happened this year. So do you think net charge-offs could peak towards the end of this year, maybe early next year and then start to trend lower?
Don McCree: I – it’s really hard to forecast that. I think they will be early next year or late this year probably, but it depends how much we extend, how the negotiations go, how much capital is put into some of these transactions and working through the book loan by loan. It’s – I don’t have the crystal ball, I say exactly when the peak is. But I’ll go back to what I said before is we’re comfortable how it’s kind of progressing is progressing according to our expectations.
Peter Winter: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Ken Usdin: Hi. Good morning guys. Just a question on the fee side, it’s really nice to see the capital markets improvement as you would have been thinking as we are seeing more broadly. I am just wondering a couple of line items went well, a couple of items kind of went backward. Just wondering just how you are thinking about the fee progression, the drivers and what’s your pipeline look like relative to the better start point here for the first quarter capital markets. Thanks.
John Woods: Yes, I will start off and Bruce can jump in here. But I mean the drivers – I mean you look at the big three for us, capital markets, card fees and wealth trust and investment services are all, they are trending well, and we expect to be significant contributors in 2024. So, each of those businesses have had significant strategic investment over the years and even more recently. So, it’s really nice to see that the investments made in the capital markets business come to fruition. We had a good strong quarter in the first quarter, number one in the lead tables on the sponsor side, big rebound from the fourth quarter. And early in the second quarter, the activity – the pace of activity has continued, and we feel very good about the trends there, not only for 2Q, but for the full year. In the card business, we have made a strategic conversion to Mastercard, and that’s driving a number of positive developments there. And in the wealth business, as you know, all of the advisor hires the Clarfeld acquisition from a number of years ago are all coming together along with the private bank to drive those flows throughout 2024. So, we are feeling quite good about the trajectory for fees.
Bruce Van Saun: I would just say, to your point, Ken, also that there were those three strong areas. And then we had a little bit of weakness in some other areas, service charges, mortgage, the global markets, FX and interest rate lines were a little below our expectations. The good news there is there is nothing structural that we worry about. I think we will see bounce backs over the rest of the year, which will add to our overall growth and our confidence that we will maintain strong fee performance for the year.
Ken Usdin: Okay. Great. And just one more follow-up on the NII and the swaps and just looking at your Pages 25 and 26 from the deck. And it’s pretty clear that you are saying the increases you have made to the swap book are all incorporated in the guidance. So, that first quarter to fourth quarter, $35 million cumulative net interest income impact, is that inclusive of everything that is both like active as of now and then will prospectively still come on as the year progresses?
John Woods: Yes, it is. And so what that is, that $35 million is made up of about $50 million, primarily driven from active swaps that are outstanding. So, there is about $20 billion notional of active swaps outstanding. That grows to about $30 billion by 4Q. That’s incorporated into that number. But then it’s offset by the positive benefit from non-core of about, call it, $17 million or so, or $15 million to $20 million coming from non-core and that gets you to the $35 million drag. But really, when you play it out for the rest of the year, again, broadly, net interest margin trends are coming in a little better, incorporating all of our swap activity, what you see on Page 25 is just the receive-fixed swaps. We actually have pay-fixed swaps in the securities portfolio that are offsetting this, as well as of course, everything that’s happening in the core balance sheet. So, you got to kind of think at the broadest sense that NIM trends are actually coming in a little better. And then as you get out to later years, you start getting all of this tailwind is really baked in. And you start seeing the fact that terminated swaps begin to contribute. It gets to the point where you get out into 2026 and 2027 that a majority of, a super majority, if you will, of the tailwinds are actually baked in and aren’t rate dependent. But you have that right in terms of the 4Q components that incorporates everything on the receive-fixed swaps side plus non-core.
Ken Usdin: Yes. Okay. And I – yes, go ahead Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: And I would just add color there, Ken, is I think coming into the year, people were concerned about that step-up that we had forward starting swaps in Q2 and then more in Q3. The guide that we are giving and our confidence in the NIM outlook incorporate that. So, we are able to absorb that because higher for longer is better for the core balance sheet. We have some pay-fixed swaps we did in the securities book. So, we are able to absorb kind of that step-up in the swap book and continue to maintain confidence in the NIM outlook for the year.
Ken Usdin: Yes. That’s great, Bruce. And if I can just bring that all together, so you broadly affirmed your broader guidance of down 6 to down 9, and we kind of know the first quarter and have the second quarter outlook. So, what would be the biggest swing factors within that range based on all these points that you are making about the NIM coming in better and now knowing more of this detail about how the swaps will work.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. To me, it’s really volume would be the key to where we land in that range. So, do we actually see that strong growth in the private bank accelerating that could be strong for deposits and attractive deposit funding, and then the spread that they are making on their loans is also very attractive. So, that’s totally accretive to front book, back book. Do we see the growth in commercial that we expect come in, and I think we – based on our kind of pipelines and our conversations with our customers and also a feeling that the sponsor community. Right now, there has been a lot of pull forward in refinancing, but I think you are going to start to see some more new money deals in the second half of the year. So, I think that those volume factors will have a big impact. But the way we kind of see it looking out the window today, we are highly confident that those things will materialize. I don’t know, John, if you want to add anything.
John Woods: Yes, I agree with all of that. I would say that even with a little bit of lighter loan demand, we still think that range is good. Maybe it comes out at a higher end versus the lower end. But I mean I think that’s a swing factor. All the other components of the balance sheet are playing out well. Our outlook for deposit mix and funding mix is underpinning the net interest margin. I would hasten to add that those pay-fixed swaps that we added last quarter in 1Q and also in 4Q, have really driven really nice uptake in the securities yield. You see the securities yields up almost 40 basis points in the first quarter, and that’s offsetting – that’s a huge component of our balance sheet, and that’s a big driver. And then I should also make clear that the core balance sheet is contributing as well where we are seeing front book, back book on the loans side that is in the range of 300 basis points in the first quarter. And you are getting front book back on the securities book of around 200 basis points. So, there are good dynamics in the core balance sheet and all of the swaps were baked in.
Ken Usdin: You said we could come in at the higher end. I think you meant the better end.
John Woods: Yes.
Ken Usdin: Just for everybody’s clarity on that plan. Okay.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Matt O’Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Matt O’Connor: Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but I am curious when you talk about kind of this medium-term net interest margin. What are your thoughts on the size of the balance sheet? And I guess, specifically, like do you think the overall balance sheet will grow or is there the remixing, Clearly, you are running off the non-core book [ph] on the private bank. But do you envision kind of net balance sheet growth as you look out the next few years? Thank you.
John Woods: Yes. I would say that, we do expect the balance sheet to grow. It’s – I think we do have a balance sheet optimization program that’s turning over a certain portion of the portfolio. But when you look at the grand total of the initiatives that we are putting in place, I think you see interest-earning assets will be growing in the second half of the year. And as you get out over the medium-term, so I think that we have the opportunity to optimize and grow. And that’s our expectation.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I would say the kind of flex point is kind of middle of the year when we have done a lot of that heavy lifting on the repositioning, and then we start to see the private bank growth in commercial bank as we discussed, start to kick in. So, we should see net growth already in the second half of the year. And then kind of looking out ‘25 to ‘27, we would expect in a strong economy that we could get back to reasonably strong growth rates. Again, being selective where we play, focusing on primary relationships and primacy, but there is no reason we couldn’t grow back at nominal GDP the way we did for kind of many years before we hit the pandemic, and that plays into math that, the delivery of positive operating leverage, which is part of how you get your return on equity up. And so that’s the model we would like to get back to.
Matt O’Connor: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Thomas Detry [ph] calling on behalf of Gerard. Circling back to capital deployment quickly, you guys were pretty busy in 2023 in terms of strategic actions. Can you update us on how you are thinking about further investment opportunities for the franchise and how you guys prioritize organic growth versus team lift outs or even outright M&A?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. So, I would say that right now, we have a very full plate in terms of the things that we are investing in the organic growth initiatives we have. So, I would not – we are not really looking much at inorganic situations or opportunities. And so I want to just stay focused on great execution. There is a big pay-off for getting these initiatives right and they are all kind of on the trend line. I would say team lift outs, you mentioned is something that we are hinting at, at this point because while we have the private bank in place, and we have kind of Clarfeld as part of a private wealth complex, we need to scale up our private wealth capabilities to a large extent. And so we are having discussions with teams. And you can watch this space because I think you will start to see us build that part of the business out. But again, it will be prudent. We will treat them like they are kind of M&A transactions that are accretive and they fit our strategy and they are good cultural fits, but that’s kind of the only thing I would say that we are looking kind of outside. And to some extent, that’s organic. You could argue whether that’s organic or whether it’s acquisition like, but we are kind of using the same acquisition lens on these as if they were small deals. I don’t know, Brendan, if you want to put any color on that.
Brendan Coughlin: Maybe two quick points, one is that I would just say the interest in Citizens from a wealth management perspective is at a high, like we have never seen before. So, we are talking to some of the very best wealth managers across all the big brands in the United States. And so we are going to be very selective. But the interest in what we are doing here is quite unique and distinctive. So, we expect to board some top talent and really give a boost to our wealth strategy. But the point around capital that you mentioned, though, just to – even though we are mentally potentially thinking about the return metrics like we would an M&A deal. Keep in mind that a lift out or what we do with the private bank really is a very de minimis impact on capital. And so that’s why when you look – when we talk about the breakeven of the private bank being second half of this year, it’s really just eating through the expense guarantees and getting the revenue throughput. So, it has a very de minimis impact on capital. And the same will be true on wealth lift-outs where the teams we bring on board, it will be much more of a expense guarantee mindset and getting them through their revenue curve versus having any real material impact on our capital.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. That’s helpful color. Thank you. And then just separately on loan growth. C&I demand has obviously been pretty tepid despite pretty healthy growth in the economy as measured by real GDP, do you think that lack of C&I loan demand is being driven by just general customer caution, or are you guys seeing more competition from non-bank players like the private credit market and others?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I think it’s just a general caution about what’s going to happen in the economy, what’s going to happen with rates. And I think most of our companies have had good years, but they are still expressing caution. So, we are actually not losing business to private credit. It’s interesting. We are actually – it’s coming the other way because there has been opportunities to take loans that are out with private credit and move them over to the bank syndicated lending market, refinance those and kind of lock in lower cost financing. So, that’s been a big part of the story here in the first quarter, and it’s continuing into the second quarter. Don?
Don McCree: I think that’s right. I think the area that we see private credit most active is in the leverage buyout market, which we don’t hold a lot of that on our balance sheet anyway. So, they are a source of distribution for us. So, we have actually done a couple of deals in the first quarter where we have distributed into the private credit market. So, it doesn’t have a balance sheet impact that it helps drive some of our fee lines.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Your line is now open.
Dave Rochester: Hey. Good morning guys. Earlier, you mentioned that the flows were a major driving swing factor of that NII guide. I know you mentioned expecting a little less loan growth this year. But you mentioned possibly hitting the better end of that NII range. If for whatever reason, net loan growth doesn’t materialize in the back half and C&I growth only ends up filling in for the run-off that you are expecting? Can you still hit that NII guide for the year?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I mean I would say that we are still confident in the range. And so if things break our way, we could be at the better side of that range. If they don’t, we could be at the lower end of that range. So, I would still kind of use that as the guardrails. You would have to have kind of quite a bit of deviation from expectation to fall outside of that range.
John Woods: Yes. Great. And just to reiterate that point, what we have been saying is that we have an expectation that will come in at the better end of the range for net interest margin based on the trends that we are seeing and the performance we were able to generate in the first quarter. So, you would see us being at the upper end of that range, maybe a tad better. On net interest margin, that’s offsetting the fact that there is some lighter loan demand that we are also seeing that. You put those together, and we are right down the middle there in terms of that range, and we have got back to the point Bruce just made. And that’s our base case now that we are updating. And there could be puts and takes to that depending upon the volume point that Bruce made earlier.
Dave Rochester: Yes. Perfect. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW. Your line is now open.
David Konrad: Hey. Good morning. Sorry if I missed this earlier, but just kind of drilling down on the NIM discussion. Just looking at this quarter, curious on C&I yields dropped around 36 bps quarter-over-quarter. I didn’t think this was a heavy swap onboarding this quarter, but just curious where we are looking at that maybe in the next quarter before the swaps come on in the third quarter.
John Woods: Yes. I mean really what’s going on, as you have hit it. I would say, just broadly, I would try to make the point that all the swaps are incorporated into the NIM guide. And when you look at the underlying fundamentals of the loan book, the front book, back book is driving an increase in loan yields ex swaps. So, that’s the first point. As it relates to when you pull the swaps together from an accounting standpoint, why there is a negative impact from a swap standpoint, is that there was a mix shift. We had the swap notional didn’t change much, but we had some maturities at higher receives being replaced by some forward starters coming in at lower receives. And that overall – that net receive rate fell in the quarter, and that’s why you ended up with that negative impact just on that line itself. But again, overall, net interest margin was flat for the quarter. And when you put it all together with all the components, we had quite a strong net interest margin performance even incorporating that swap drag.
David Konrad: Yes, I agree. And then you talked about the securities book both the front book, back book and then the pay floaters coming out. But just curious your outlook for the growth of the securities book going forward?
John Woods: Yes. I mean I think we have gotten to the point where we had the liquidity build late last year. And that’s basically largely done. And so where you see the securities book right now as a percentage of our overall interest earning assets is about where we will be over time. As we grow loans, we will probably grow securities and cash on a similar mix basis from a volume standpoint, but the percentage of cash and securities to overall interest-earning assets at the end of the first quarter is about where we will be for the rest of the year. And I would hasten to add that when you look at that, that’s reflected of our deposit franchise and being primarily consumer and having a much higher proportion of insured secured deposits than most peers. And then if you crank it all through the way the Fed looks at standardized Category 1 banks, our LCR incorporating all of that at 03/31 was 120%, which is incredibly strong from a liquidity standpoint. And that’s played through based upon the balance sheet mix overall, including cash and securities.
David Konrad: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Manan Gosalia: Maybe as a follow-up to the last question, is there any change in how you are thinking through positioning in the medium-term with the expectation for fewer rate cuts coming through? So, with loan growth being a little bit weaker right now, deposit growth being pretty solid, as you noted, are you willing to put on a little bit more duration on the securities side? And separately, has it got cheaper to put in some downside protection on NIM as you look into 2025 and 2026. And is that something you are considering right now?
John Woods: Yes. I would say on the securities side, I would say there is a couple of objectives being addressed, and it’s the interplay between capital and liquidity and interest favors management. So, what we did over the last couple of quarters is we have added $7 billion of pay-fixed swaps that has paid off quite nicely because of our view that rates were likely not to be down, whatever, however many cuts we thought they were at the beginning of the year, five, six, seven cuts, we thought that was probably a little overcooked. And so we put on those pay-fixed swaps in part related to that. But in part related to the multiyear objective to reduce the duration of the securities book given how it will likely be treated from a capital standpoint. And so both of those objectives came into play when we shortened the duration of the securities book, which right now is about 3.8 years. We are likely to continue to shorten the duration book of that securities book over time and get down to something closer to 3 years [ph] or thereabouts. And so that’s really the driver there. But you got to look at the overall balance sheet and from an overall balance sheet standpoint, it made sense to add a little asset sensitivity in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And we had at 03/31, we remain an asset-sensitive balance sheet. When it comes to adding downside protection in the out years, we do note that we have a significant drop off of receive-fixed swaps when you get out into 2026 and ‘27. And I think entry points matter. So, if rates continue to stay elevated, and we think there is value there. We want to be careful that we don’t give up our upside that the C&I loan book provides us and we will do that when the entry points are attractive in terms of that trade and locking it in. And in general, that would be consistent with something that would be north of 4% of a receive rate out into ‘26 and ‘27, and we will be opportunistic as the rate environment plays out in terms of how we continue to protect the balance sheet over the medium-term.
Manan Gosalia: Got it. Very helpful. And then this morning, one of your peers has suggested that they are seeing corporate behavior shifting from NIB to IB. Are you seeing some of your corporate clients take another look at optimizing their NIB balances in the higher for longer rate environment recently?
Don McCree: I think it’s pretty much run its course at this point. We have had a little bit of a shift in the book, but it’s really slowed down. I think the clients have been pretty opportunistic in terms of taking advantage of higher rates. So, I would say our book and our mix is pretty stable right now, and we expect it to stay here.
John Woods: Yes. And I would say overall, you saw our DDA stable at 21% at the end of 1Q, 21% at the end of 4Q. That’s important. That’s the first time this has happened in a while. And so that stability we expect to continue as you get throughout the – for the rest of the year and actually see growth, as we mentioned earlier, based on other strategic initiatives and the private bank contributing.
Manan Gosalia: Great. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue. And with that, I will turn it back over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Well, thanks everyone for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support for Citizens. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T event teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-17 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Keeley, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.
Kristin Silberberg: Thank you, Keeley. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. First this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun, and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking, and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our fourth quarter and full year earnings presentation located on our investor relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation, and the reconciliations in the appendix. And with that, I will hand over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. 2023 was an incredible year in many respects. With the Fed's aggressive moves to subdue inflation, the West Coast bank failures, a surprisingly resilient economy, and several significant proposals from bank regulators, it was important in navigating this dynamic environment to focus first on playing strong defense while continuing to play disciplined offense and take advantage of opportunities in the market. Defense starts with the balance sheet and risk management, and I feel really good about how we ended the year. Our capital position is one of the strongest among the large regionals with a CET1 ratio of 10.6%, CET1 adjusted for AOCI of roughly 9% and a tangible common equity ratio of 6.7%. Our liquidity position is at an all-time best with a loan to deposit ratio of 82%, pro forma Category 1 LCR of 117% and 156% liquidity coverage of our uninsured deposits. Our ACL ratio is at 159% compared to 130% pro forma day 1 CECL, and general office reserves are at 10.2%. We continue to be very disciplined in terms of lending risk appetite and are focused on deep relationships which deliver stronger relative returns. We are using a non-core strategy to run off loans and free capital for better opportunities. On offense, we have several important initiatives we are driving, such as the private bank buildout, the New York City Metro initiative, our focus on serving private capital and growing our payments business. These are all tracking well. In particular, we are pleased to see the private bank team reach $1.2 billion in deposits soon after our launch in late October. Our financials over the course of the year came under some pressure, primarily given higher funding costs. Nonetheless, we delivered a 13.5% underlying ROTCE for the full year, with a 95% return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see smaller sequential declines in NII than in the prior quarter as the Fed last hiked in July and the pressure on funding costs has lessened. We saw a modest bounce back in fees, but are very encouraged by the tone of the markets in 2024 to date. Hopefully, we start to see our big capital markets pipelines begin to deliver. We took some meaningful cost actions in Q4 to set the stage for a very modest expense growth in 2024. We only had the private bank for two quarters, so if you normalize for that, we're actually reducing the legacy expense base by 1.4%. I should reinforce though that we are doing this while protecting our critical initiatives. Credit outlook continues to track expectations. CRE general office is being carefully managed. Losses are being absorbed in net charge offs. It's relatively predictable with few surprises so far. Away from that, credit quality is strong. In Q4 we saw a dip in absolute criticized loans and in the ratio which is a promising sign. On the capital front, we did not buy in any stock in Q4, given the charges related to the FDIC special surcharge as well as associated with our cost initiatives. We expect to be back in the market in Q1, and for that to continue through 2024. Turning to our outlook, we expect NII to continue with modest declines through midyear and then start to tick up. The exciting news on NIM/NII is that we project meaningful benefits from swap and noncore runoff over ‘25 to ‘27, which will power higher EPS and returns. We are poised for strong fee growth led by capital markets. Net charge offs will rise modestly, but we are likely to see ACL releases over the course of the year. Our key priorities for 2024 will be to continue to operate with a strong defense/prudent offense mindset. We have many exciting things on our technology, our digital, data analytics and AI roadmap that we need to deliver on. It's an exciting time for Citizens. We feel we are well positioned for medium-term outperformance. I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering in great effort in 2023. We know we can count on you again in the new year. With that, let me turn it over to John.
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. I'll start out with some commentary on 2023. We demonstrated excellent balance sheet strength while delivering solid financial performance. We were resilient through a turbulent environment, benefiting from near top of peer group capital levels and strong liquidity based on stable consumer insured deposits and diversified wholesale funding sources. This strength allowed us to execute well against our multi-year strategic initiatives while opportunistically building out the private bank. On Slide 6, you can see that we delivered underlying EPS at $3.88, which included a $0.51 drag from non-core, and an $0.11 investment in the private bank. Full year ROTCE was 13.5% after incorporating these items. Before I discuss the details of the fourth quarter results, here are some highlights referencing slides 4, 5, and 7. On the slides you can see we generated underlying net income of $426 million for the fourth quarter and EPS of $0.85. This includes $0.06 for our continued investment in the startup of the private bank and a $0.15 negative impact from the non-core portfolio. We had a significant increase in the impacts from notable items this quarter included on Slide 4. The largest driver was the FDIC special assessment, followed by elevated top and severance related expenses attributable to meaningful headcount reduction. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 11.8%. Our legacy core bank delivered a solid underlying ROTCE of 14.8%. Currently, the private bank startup investment is dilutive to results, but relatively quickly this will become increasingly accretive. The private bank is off to a very good start, raising about $1.2 billion of deposits through the end of the year, of which more than 30% are non-interest bearing. While our non-core portfolio is currently a sizable drag to results, it continues to run off, further bolstering our overall performance going forward. We ended the year with a very strong balance sheet position with CET1 at 10.6% or 9% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal and an ACL coverage ratio of 1.59%, up from 1.55% in third quarter. This includes a robust 10.2% coverage for general office, up from 9.5% in the prior quarter. We continued to build liquidity during the fourth quarter, achieving our planned liquidity profile. Our pro forma Category 1 bank LCR rose to 117% from 109% in the prior quarter. We also reduced our period end flood borrowings by $3.3 billion quarter-over-quarter to $3.8 billion, and our period-end LDR improved linked quarter to 82% from 84%. Regarding strategic initiatives, as previously mentioned, the private bank is off to a great start and TOP continues to contribute. In addition, New York Metro is tracking well, and we are poised to capitalize on the growing private capital opportunity. Next, I'll talk through the fourth quarter results in more detail, turning to Slide 8 and starting with net interest income. As expected, NII is down 2% linked quarter, primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin, partially offset by a 2% increase in average interest earning assets. As you can see from the NIM walk at the bottom of the slide, the combined benefit of higher asset yields and non-core runoff were more than offset by higher funding costs and swaps, the net impact of which reduced NIM by 3 basis points to the 3% level. The additional 9 basis point decline to 2.91% was due to the impact of our liquidity build which was neutral to NII. Our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta increased a modest 3 basis points to 51%, as the Fed has paused and we see continued but slowing deposit migration. We expect this moderating trend to continue until the Fed eventually cuts rates. Overall, our deposit franchise has performed well with our beta generally in the pack with peers. This is a significant improvement compared to prior cycles when our beta experience was at the higher end of peers. Moving to Slide 9. Fees were up 2% linked quarter given improvement in capital markets and a record performance from wealth. These results were partially offset by lower mortgage banking fees. The improvement in capital markets reflects increased activity with the decline in long rates in November driving a nice pickup in bond underwriting. Equities improved with strength in the back half of the quarter as the environment became more favorable. M&A advisory fees benefited from seasonality and an improvement in the environment given the better macro and rates outlook, although several transactions pushed to Q1. We see capital markets momentum picking up in Q1 as markets are positive and our deal pipelines are strong. The wealth business delivered a record quarter with higher sales activity and good momentum in AUM growth. The decline in mortgage banking fees was driven by lower production fees as high mortgage rates continued to weigh on lot volumes. The servicing operating P&L improved modestly while the MSR valuation, net of hedging, was lower. On Slide 10, we did well on expenses which were down slightly linked quarter even while including the impact of the continued private bank startup investment. Our reported expense of $1.61 billion increased $319 million, including notable items totaling $323 million, namely the industrywide FDIC special assessment of $225 million, and the impact of taking cost reduction actions to adjust our expense base heading into 2024. I'll discuss that in more detail in a few minutes. On Slide 11, average loans are down 2% and period end loans are down 3% linked quarter. This was driven by non-core portfolio runoff and a decline in commercial loans which were partly offset by some modest core growth in mortgage and home equity. Average core loans are down 1%, largely driven by generally lower loan demand in commercial, along with exits of lower returning relationships and our highly selective approach to new lending in this environment. Average commercial [line] (ph) utilization continued to decline this quarter as clients remain cautious and M&A activity muted in the face of an uncertain market environment. Next on slides 12 and 13, we continued to do well on deposits. Period end deposits were broadly stable linked quarter with an increase in consumer driven by the private bank offset by lower commercial. The decline in commercial deposits was driven by a proactive effort to optimize the liquidity value of deposits, running off approximately $3.5 billion of higher cost financial institution and municipal deposits during the fourth quarter. Absent this BSO effect, deposits would have been up by about 1.5% this quarter. Our interest-bearing deposit costs are up 19 basis points, which translates to 51% cumulative beta. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels with 67% of our deposits in consumer and about 71% insured or secure. This has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in the higher rate environment. With the Fed holding steady, we saw continued migration of deposits to higher cost categories with noninterest bearing now representing about 21% of total deposits. This is slightly below pre-pandemic levels, and we expect the pace of migration to continue to moderate from here, although this will be dependent on the path of rates and customer behavior. Moving on to credit on Slide 14. Net charge-offs were 46 basis points, up 6 basis points linked quarter. We were pleased to see that commercial charge offs were stable linked quarter, and we also saw a modest decline in criticized loans, as we continued to work through the general office portfolio. We saw continued normalization of charge offs in the retail portfolio along with seasonal impacts. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 15. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.59%, which is a 4 basis point increase from the third quarter, primarily reflecting the denominator effect from lower portfolio balances. We increased the reserve for the $3.6 billion general office portfolio to $370 million which represents a coverage of 10.2%, up from 9.5% in the third quarter, as we made modest adjustments to modeled loss drivers. We have already taken $148 million in charge-offs on this portfolio, which is about 4% of loans. On the bottom left side of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level. We feel these assumptions represent an adverse scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns, so we feel the current coverage is very strong. Moving to Slide 16, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.6% and if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio would be about 9%. Also, our tangible common equity ratio improved to 6.7% at the end of the year. Both our CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been in the top quartile of our peers, and you can see on Slide 36 in the appendix where we stand currently relative to peers in the third quarter. We returned a total of $198 million to shareholders through dividends in the fourth quarter. We paused our share repurchases in the fourth quarter in light of the FDIC special assessment. Having exceeded our target capital level for year end, we expect to resume repurchases in the first quarter. Nonetheless, we plan to maintain strong capital and liquidity levels that fortify our balance sheet against macro uncertainties and position us to quickly transition to any new regulatory rules that may impact banks of our size. On the next few pages, I'll update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank, including our private bank and our ongoing balance sheet optimization program. First, on Slide 17, the buildout of the private bank is going very well and clearly gathering momentum. Following our formal launch in the fourth quarter, our bankers have raised more than $1.2 billion of attractive deposits, with roughly 75% of that from commercial clients. This is a coast-to-coast team with a presence in some of our key markets like New York, Boston and places where we'd like to do more, like Florida and California. We have plans to open a few private banking centers in these geographies, and we are opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities, with our Clarfeld Wealth Management Business as the centerpiece of that effort. Moving to Slide 18, you are all well aware of our efforts in New York Metro. That's going really well, and we are hitting our targets there. And on the commercial side, as I mentioned before, we are starting to see momentum building in capital markets. This should translate into a meaningful opportunity for us as the substantial capital backing private equity gets put to work. Next on Slide 19, we continue to be disciplined on expenses. It's important to remember that a key to Citizens’ success since our IPO has been our continuous effort to find new efficiencies and then reinvest those benefits back into our businesses so we can serve customers better. We've effectively executed our TOP 8 program, achieving a pretax run rate benefit of about $115 million at the end of 2023. And we've launched TOP 9 with a goal of an exit run rate of about $135 million of pretax benefits by the end of 2024. The new TOP program is focused on efficiency opportunities from further automation and the use of AI to better serve our customers. We are executing on opportunities to simplify our organization and save more on third party spend as well. Last year, we exited the auto business, and we also exited the wholesale mortgage business in the fourth quarter. We are also adjusting our expense base through further meaningful actions. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our headcount by about 650, or approximately 3.5%, and we have also taken a hard look at our space needs and are rationalizing some of our corporate and back-office facilities. Given all this work, we are targeting to limit our underlying expense growth in 2024 to roughly 1% to 1.5%, with a net decrease in legacy Citizens expenses of 1.3% to 1.5%, being offset by investments in the private bank. Playing prudent defense is at the top of our priority list given the challenging year we saw with the turmoil that began back in March and the uncertain macro outlook. So, we are reworking both sides of the balance sheet through our balance sheet optimization efforts. Slide 20 provides an update on our efforts to remix the loan portfolio through our non-core strategy and optimization on the commercial side with a focus on relationship based lending and attractive risk adjusted returns. On the left side of the page, you'll see the relatively rapid rundown of the remaining $11 billion non-core portfolio, which is comprised of our shorter duration indirect auto portfolio and purchased consumer loans. This portfolio is expected to decline by about $6.4 billion from where we were at the end of the year to about $4.7 billion at the end of 2025. And as this runs down, we plan to redeploy the majority of remaining cash paydowns to a reduction in wholesale funding, with the remainder used to support organic relationship-based loan growth in the core portfolio. The capital recaptured through reduction in non-core RWA will be primarily reallocated to support attractive growth in retail and commercial lending through the private bank. In the broader consumer portfolio, we are targeting growth in the home equity, card and mortgage, which offer the greatest relationship potential. Moving to the right side of the page, we are also working on the commercial portfolio, exiting lower return credit only relationships and focusing on selective C&I lending with multi-product relationship opportunities. We are leading more deals in our front book, improving spreads while also improving the overall return profile of the book. In the appendix, we have included more information covering the broad contours of our BSO program, including how we are managing our high-quality deposit book, remixing our wholesale funding, managing our securities portfolio and positioning our capital base against the backdrop of a changing macro and regulatory environment. Moving to Slide 21, I will take you through our full year 2024 outlook, which contemplates the early January forward curve and a Fed Funds rate of 4.25% by the end of the year. We expect NII to be down 6% to 9%, with changes in our swaps book contributing to about half of that decline, and average loans down roughly 2% to 3%. However, we expect spot loan growth of 3% to 5%, with private bank growing over the course of the year and commercial activity picking up in the second half. On the deposit side, we expect spot growth of 1.2% -- I'm sorry, 1% to 2% and well controlled deposit costs with a terminal beta in the low 50s, before rate cuts are anticipated to begin in May. We expect our net interest margin to trough around the middle of the year and average in the 2.8% to 2.85% range for the full year, and we expect to exit the year around 2.85%. We've included Slide 23, which shows the expected swaps and non-core impact through 2027. In 2024, we expect higher swap expense to be partly offset by the NII benefit from the non-core rundown. You'll find a summary of our hedge position in the appendix on Slide 38, which demonstrates how the 2024 headwind, which is incorporated in our 2024 NII guide, reverses to a substantial NII tailwind in 2025 and beyond, as the current forward curve is realized. For example, there is an expected improvement in NII contribution from swaps in 2025 year-over-year of approximately $371 million with continued meaningful benefits in 2026 and 2027. Non-interest income is expected to be up in the 6% to 9% range depending upon market environment, led by a nice rebound in capital markets. We expect expenses to be up about 1% to 1.5%. Excluding the private bank, this would be down 1.3% to 1.5%. We have provided a walk showing the components of our 2024 expense outlook on Slide 22 to provide more context. NCOs are expected to average about 50 basis points for the year as we continue to work through the general office portfolio and expect further normalization in retail. Given macro trends, our remixing of the balance sheet through commercial BSO and the non-core strategy and expectations for modest portfolio growth, we will likely see ACR releases over the course of the year. We plan to resume share repurchases in the first quarter in the $300 million range with more over the course of the year depending upon market conditions and loan growth. Taking that into account, we still expect to end the year with a strong CET1 ratio of about 10.5%, which is at the upper end of our target range. Putting it all together, we expect to return to sequential positive operating leverage in the second half of the year with PPNR troughing in the second quarter 2024. Moving to slides 24 and 25, as Bruce mentioned, we are well positioned to deliver attractive returns. As we look out over the medium term, we have a clear path to achieve a 16% to 18% ROTCE. We expect to generate solid returns from our legacy core business with a substantial NII tailwind given swap portfolio runoff. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage with strong expense discipline and we are well positioned to grow fees meaningfully given the investments we've made in our capabilities over the past few years. We also expect a meaningful contribution from the private bank as it matures and a tailwind from the runoff of the non-core portfolio as we redeploy that capital and liquidity. We will continue to operate with a prudent risk appetite and focus on returning a meaningful amount of capital to shareholders through our repurchase program and targeting a dividend payout of 35% to 40%. Over the medium term, we expect our CET1 ratio to remain within a target range of 10% to 10.5%, about 50 basis points higher than our prior target range, given continued uncertainty in the macro environment. On Slide 26, we provide the guide for the first quarter. Note that the first quarter has seasonal impacts due to lower day count impact on revenue as well as taxes on compensation payouts impacting expenses. To wrap up, we demonstrated the resilience of the franchise and maintained strong discipline in 2023 as we worked to position the bank to continue to deliver attractive returns to shareholders over the medium term. We delivered solid results this quarter and we ended the year with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position that puts us in an excellent position to drive forward with our strategic priorities and take advantage of opportunities that may arise. We are continuing to optimize the balance sheet and we are focused on allocating capital where we can drive deeper relationship business and improve performance over the medium term. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Keeley, let's open it up for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.
Peter Winter: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Good morning.
Peter Winter: Can you guys provide some color on the drivers to that spot loan growth, including some details about the contribution from the private bank and what you're thinking in terms of commercial line utilization?
John Woods: Yeah, I'll just start off and others can add. But I mean I think those are the two drivers, as you mentioned. When we look out into primarily the second half of 2024, we are seeing an expectation that commercial activity will pick up. Loan utilization is flattening out here, we expect early in the year. And then so that'll be part of the driver. We also have had some BSO activity in late ‘23 and early ‘24 that we expect to moderate in the second half of the year as well. So you're going to see a number of nice tailwinds on the commercial side. And then on the consumer side of things, we are seeing opportunities with good relationship business in the mortgage space and in HELOC, which has been a very nice and consistent driver for us. But those are the main drivers. Then, of course, broadly, the private bank, which has gotten off to a great start on the deposit side of things in late ‘23, we're going to see some of that loan opportunity pick up in ‘24. So those are the big, I would say, components of seeing that spot loan growth.
Bruce Van Saun: Maybe, Brendan, you could talk a little bit about what you expect for private bank lending.
Brendan Coughlin: Yeah, sure. Well, I would start by -- just a quick comment on Q4 for the private bank. Obviously, strong deposit print and I think demonstrating that the strength of the strategy can be very diversified and led by wealth and deposits and not necessarily requiring low interest lending to dislodge the relationship. So we're really excited about the print and the start by the team. Having said that, we do expect lending to pick up steam in 2024. Given the interest rate environment, mortgages are obviously challenged on the retail side. So the lending has been more heavily led by commercial lending, which has skewed in the private equity and venture space, which we're really comfortable with the risk appetite and the profile of that business. And it's been critical to start to dislodge personal private banking relationships from the ecosystem of private equity and venture. So we're off to a really good start. I suspect, given the forward curves, that the first half of the year will continue to be led by commercial principally and private equity and venture lending. Over time, we expect the loan book to be much more balanced and have more retail lending, home equity lending, mortgage lending coming in at scale as the rate environment dictates opportunities there. We also expect to lean into partner loan programs to help connect the corporate side of private equity venture with private banking and personal banking. So you'll start to see an asset diversification over time, but the first half of the year, we would expect it to still be more heavily weighted on the corporate side.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Great. Don, anything to add on the commercial side?
Don McCree: Yeah. I think if you look back at the fourth quarter, the things that dampened our loan growth a little bit were it's about 50% utilization, 50% BSO with a little bit of bond execution sprinkled in there. So people that were carrying slightly higher balances on the commercial side, a lot of them went to the bond market when rates kind of backed off in the last six weeks of the year. And that's continued into this year. So I think the particular area that we're excited about as we get into the back end of 2024 is the private equity space. I mean, that group of clients has been basically dormant for almost two years. There's lots of conversations going on. We're hearing from most of those customers that they expect to get a lot more active and that'll drive utilization on our capital call lines, which is at an all-time low right now. So, I think that's what the real driver is.
Bruce Van Saun: Great. Peter, did you have another question?
Peter Winter: Yes, just a quick follow-up. That's helpful. But on just the fee income, you talked about up to 6% to 9%. You did mention, the pipeline is strong for the capital markets, but just if you could give some color on the puts and takes on the fee income side.
Bruce Van Saun: John?
John Woods: Yeah, just kind of the main drivers of that. It's basically a continuation of some of the trends we're seeing in the fourth quarter of 2023, where capital markets is starting to pick up again, pipelines are incredibly strong. And I think that the lead driver seems to be M&A advisory. That's picked up in 4Q, not only due to seasonal factors, but just in terms of a more constructive backdrop. We're also seeing, as you get in -- out into ‘24, pick up and underwriting, both on the bond side and on the equity side, and so -- and solid contributions from global markets as well. But -- so those are some of the drivers as we see them beginning in Q4, continuing in Q1 with excellent pipelines and playing out over the rest of ‘24.
Bruce Van Saun: You might add something on wealth, Brendan. I don't know if you want to. We expect continued really strong growth on wealth fees.
Brendan Coughlin: We do, and we spent a year of slow and steady progression continuing to get all-time highs in the wealth management business. But given the private bank investment, 2024 is going to be a really important year. We're out in the market looking to attract a lot of talent. We've made a number of key hires in Q4, both on the leadership side as well as at the advisor side. And so getting the ecosystem of the bankers that we hired in the summer, connected with top and market wealth managers is critical for us. We're rebranding the platform to Citizen private wealth management to connect the private banking and wealth side together hand in glove. And so we do expect steady and significant growth out of wealth over time really connected into the private banking ecosystem. So we're pleased with the momentum, but there's a lot more to come and we hope if we execute well on the private banking initiative.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, very good.
Peter Winter: And just on mortgage banking.
Brendan Coughlin: Yeah, so John hit some highlights on Q4 for mortgage. Production was down a bit. Our underlying servicing business was up modestly. And then our hedge performance was down over a big quarter in Q3, Q4. I think as we look the outlook going forward, we obviously announced the exit of the wholesale mortgage business. If you rewind the clock back to prior to the Franklin American acquisition, we were under scale in mortgage and really were trying to diversify the business. We've done that really successfully in hindsight. It was an incredibly well-timed acquisition and we performed exceptionally well through the COVID years. And as we exit that period of time and look forward, our MSR concentration versus peers is really strong. It's a little bit on the high side. We looked at our business model and said, wholesale mortgage, we're one of the only lenders in there. The margins were really challenged and the outlook for rates don't necessarily suggest a [boom lift] (ph) of refi activity in the medium term. And so wholesale mortgage being a non-relationship business, we decided that it was time to move on and we're committed to correspond it. We're really committed to retail mortgage for relationship lending. But despite rates coming down, we do expect the mortgage market to be, call it, a $2 trillion originations platform in 2024, which is about a normalized mortgage market. So we should see some modest uptick in originations. And with rates coming back down, the servicing business might see a little bit of offsetting pressure. So I think we feel like we're in the right zone in terms of mortgage performance with where we're at Q4, within a range of normal volatility. And we're going to make sure that we're executing on driving up returns higher and making sure allocating balance sheets to deep relationship based customers, whether it's in the private bank or in the core retail business, to continue to offer that product to our very best customers.
John Woods: Yeah, just to wrap it all that up, in ‘24 we do expect volumes to improve as well as margins. So that's another tailwind if we get into next year in terms of the production business.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, Peter. Next question.
Peter Winter: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Matt O’Connor: Good morning. Can you guys elaborate a bit on the expense cuts that you did this quarter in terms of where they're coming from? And obviously you're leaning in on the private bank, but kind of ex that, have you made sure you're not cutting too much during these initiatives and the ones that you've had in prior years?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. I'll start off here. But I think we have been very, very diligent in kind of looking at staffing levels across all the different activities in the bank and seeking efficiencies. There's always the playbook where if you kind of eliminate your bottom X percent of performers and redistribute some of the work that you can run a little leaner. And so we've gone through that exercise to make sure that we won't be caught short in any areas. We carved out important areas like risk and audit and some of the control areas so they were spared kind of from taking reductions. And then we also carved out the areas that are important investment activities. And so, the rollup of all that, Matt, comes to a relatively modest number, 3.5% of total staff count. But I think we're kind of lean and mean and in good fighting shape as we enter into 2024.
Matt O’Connor: Okay, that's helpful. And then just separately, the deposit growth that you've had from the private bank, have you disclosed what that rate is? I think a third of them are not expiring, but what's the blended rate? And I guess are you using promotions, whether it's rate or other stuff to help grow those? Thanks.
John Woods: Yeah, we haven't really talked about that, but I mean, I think what we should look at is that this is accretive to the low-cost profile top of the house. When you look at DDA and operating accounts, it's extremely attractive mix that we've seen come in early days. So we're extremely encouraged about our expectations for this to be a very sort of solid franchise deposit fully funding our loan growth that we expect on that side of -- on the other side of the balance sheet. So, yeah, I would say the mix is quite good and overall cost, very attractive and accretive to top of house.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, I would -- there's a Slide 11, Matt, that lays out a pie chart of the character of the deposits, but DDA and then checking with interest, which are very low costs, roughly 40%, very little term, and most of that in kind of liquid savings and money market with no promotions that are outside the norm of what we're offering to the core franchise.
Matt O’Connor: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.
John Pancari: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi.
John Pancari: Just a couple questions on the credit front. Charge-offs came in at around 46 basis points in the fourth quarter. You expect an average of about 50 basis points overall in 2024. Can you maybe talk to us about where you expect losses to peak and to hit that 50 bps for the full year and what gives you confidence that they can remain there? And then similarly, on the reserve front, I know you added to reserves in the fourth quarter, but you implied you could see releases in 2024. What do you need to see to drive the releases? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. So I'll start and then John can then give some more color. So I think that the kind of push that we've seen higher over the course of ’23, that could continue a little bit higher into ‘24. So going from 46, say, to 50 is kind of twofold for the most part. One is that CRE general office is, we're watching the maturity wall and we're on top of all these credits very carefully and we're working them out. And as I said in my opening remarks, a lot of this is fairly predictable. So kind of we can look ahead six months, nine months, we can kind of anticipate where we might have to do some restructurings and where we might take charge-offs. And so I think we have good visibility into that. It's a long process on CRE General Office. I think we'll have this with us all through ‘24 and likely into ‘25 as well. But again, the important thing is, I think we're well-reserved for it, and it's baked into that charge-off run rate. The second area is really just continued normalization on the consumer side, which has been extremely slow and gradual, but we're still slightly better than where we were pre-COVID. And so that will just gently push up as we go forward. And so that would be the other driver. I'd say the good news is that in C&I, we're not really seeing any kind of hotspots and so we feel that we have a pretty good outlook for broad C&I through 2024. On the question of the ACL is, this year we've been consistently building each quarter. And if you get to the scenario where there's likely a soft landing or a very shallow recession, we've put away enough reserves that I think we will be able to start to draw that down. And so time will tell on that, but you can already see that we've been starting to kind of reduce the amount of kind of reserve bill from absolute provision over charge-offs in this quarter. It was flat. It was $171 million over $171 million. And so even if charge-offs can pick up a little bit, I think it's likely that you could see the need for provision building from having provisions exceed charge-offs reduce as we go through the year. I don't know, John, if you want to add any color to that.
John Woods: Yeah, just a little bit. I think that all makes sense. And I'd say that the drivers of where you want to be with your reserve is, we have a relatively conservative economic environment predicted over the horizon which is a mile to moderate adverse outcome. So that's built in We think that we're seeing stabilization in terms of the performance of the back book in our loan book. So we see visibility into the charge-off outlook. And then the build, which could be the other driver of ACL when you're building loans, what we're rotating away from and building into, there's actually a net flat to improved profile in terms of the very high quality origination front book in the private bank and commercial that we're putting on the portfolio in ‘24 while other stuff, maybe a higher ACL load is running off in the back book. So those are the things I would just add to what Bruce said.
John Pancari: Great. All right. Thank you for that. And then separately, on the capital front, you indicated that you expect to resume buybacks in the first quarter of ‘24. And maybe if you could help us possibly quantify the pace of buybacks that's fair to assume. Could you be back at that $200 million quarterly rate or how should we think about that? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Well, at this point, we've given a kind of firm estimate for the first quarter of about $300 million. So we probably, with benefit of 2020 hindsight, could have bought some in the fourth quarter, but water under the bridge for [10/6] (ph). So we have a little above-target capital to kind of play with, if you will, in the first quarter. And then in the first half of the year, we're not going to have much net loan growth. Non-core is going to be running down, and we don't really see the flex in lending coming till the second half in the private banking commercial, as John indicated. So I think the buybacks would tend to be more first half oriented, but a lot can happen over the course of the year. And so I kind of defer from giving a kind of quarterly run rate just to say we'll have a solid print in the first quarter and likely more in a second quarter and then we'll see how the year plays out.
John Woods: Yeah, and I just would reiterate our capital priorities are a strong dividend, and if we have opportunities to put capital to work, serving clients and driving great really strong risk-adjusted returns. That's our preference. And when that moderates a bit, that's when you see us give it back in the form of buybacks. And so we're in an extremely strong position to be able to have the opportunity to trade.
Bruce Van Saun: And one last add-on point to your add-on point is I would say I'm really happy to be buying my stock at these levels because we think it's great value.
John Woods: That's it.
John Pancari: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ebrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Good morning.
Ebrahim Poonawala: I guess maybe one question for you, Bruce, as you think about capital deployment, you've been pretty busy last year in terms of the strategic actions. Just wondering, where do you see, like, as you look at investment opportunities for the franchise, are you done for now in terms of putting the big pieces in place, or how are you thinking about new things and new investments that we could see either on an organic basis, team lift-outs, or just outright M&A?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, good question. I would say the orientation right now is for backing our organic initiatives. So we've mentioned the private bank and we need to continue to invest there to get that off the ground and make it a big success. And we've been investing in the New York marketplace and certainly to get your brand awareness up is expensive proposition, but we're doing that and that is showing very good results. There are certain businesses like payments that are, I think, going through a lot of change and that change always presents opportunities. And so making sure that we're investing to position ourselves to deliver for clients and continue to gain share and grow that business, those are the things that kind of come top of mind that we're very focused on. I think in terms of acquisitions and our fee-based capabilities, we've made significant investments over time in commercial. And so our M&A size and scale is at quite a good level. So we could be selective there. Don't see anything imminent, but there's possibilities that if there's an industry vertical that makes sense, maybe we could do something there. And then wealth, we've been looking at trying to buy some things. We bought Clarfeld, which turned out to be a fantastic acquisition, but I think the orientation the rest of this year is to really go the lift-out route and to bring teams onto the platform. And so we're hard at work on that to try to scale up Citizens' private wealth. So I would say the franchise is in good shape. There's a lot of initiatives in place that will, I think, have us outperform from a growth standpoint relative to our peers. So I think we can sit back and be selective in terms of deploying capital inorganically.
Ebrahim Poonawala: That is helpful. And I guess just one follow-up in terms of -- for whatever reason, when you look at your NII, the fee revenue guide in particular, just maybe talk to us around expense flex. If some of these things don't play out as expected, should we anticipate some level of, like, expense offset or are you kind of pretty tight given just everything you've done on the cost side?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, I mean there's always opportunities to look to flex your expense base down. I think we've been pretty hard at it here to get to this level. And I'd say the strategic initiatives offer you some flexibility, but again, if you're looking at the medium term and the longer term to try to scrape to come up with $0.03 to $0.05 or something of that magnitude, if that puts at jeopardy your trajectory on things like private bank, it wouldn't appear to be a really advisable decision to take. So we will always look at that. You know you can trust us to do that. But at this point, we're trying to manage for both near-term delivery but also with an eye towards the medium term and really getting that ROTCE back into the kind of targeted range.
Ebrahim Poonawala: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Scott Siefers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Bruce Van Saun: Good morning.
Scott Siefers: John, I think you've got five great cuts built into the guidance. Just maybe a broad thought on sort of where that balance sheet is geared now. In other words, I guess more specifically, how would more or fewer cuts impact the NII outlook?
John Woods: Yeah, I mean, I would say that we're very close to neutral one way or the other, really up or down. And -- but I'd say that I think what's important to the outlook is we have deposit migration continuing to moderate every quarter. And it continued this quarter. We expect it to continue next quarter. But, our outlook is until you get that first cut, it still doesn't completely go away. So we have an expectation the first cut comes in the second quarter and we get down to around 4.25%. I think that's still holding around. We're looking out the window today in the neighborhood of what the forward curve might indicate. I would say that if there's a slight bias, if the cuts came in a little fewer this year, that would probably be okay. But nevertheless, that first cut is key. And a general normalization in an orderly fashion over time is what we think is very good for our balance sheet. Again, staying around neutral with maybe a slight benefit if rates come in a tiny bit higher in ‘24.
Bruce Van Saun: The other aspect to that too is just we've had an inverted curve for a long time. So, when you think about the medium term, presumably we get back to a point where there's a normal yield curve, which also benefits NII.
John Woods: Yeah.
Scott Siefers: Perfect. Thank you. And then also, John, for you, so the liquidity building efforts have introduced some noise into the margin rate, even if they've been NII-neutral, I guess, just looking at the guidance, presumably that's going to be less of a factor going forward, but just maybe a thought on sort of where we are in that journey.
John Woods: Yeah, I’d say we're basically -- we've achieved our objectives with respect to our liquidity bill. This is the headline there. And it’s -- we believe a very strong kind of position being around 117% of the requirements for Category 1 banks. I think that matches our objectives and therefore going forward you will not see liquidity being a headwind to net interest.
Bruce Van Saun: I think that was something we were talking about in the back half of the year. It affected us in Q3. It affected us in Q4. If you actually look at, I think, one of the dialogues on these calls a way back, are we going to exit the year close to 3% underlying? Well, we actually did do that. The underlying performance on our NIM was quite good. It only dropped 3 basis points, which is showing up well relative to everybody who's reported so far. But that liquidity build, which is neutral to NII, took us down another 9. So we end up exiting closer to [290 than to the 3] (ph). But that liquidity build is kind of done. And so we can just focus on not having that, exercising that from the conversation and just focusing on what the underlying drivers are from here on out.
Scott Siefers: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Ken Usdin: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. One follow-up. You mentioned the PPNR bottoming in the second quarter. I'm just wondering, do you expect NII to bottom coincident with that, or would there be a slight timing disconnect based on how the swaps work through?
John Woods: Yeah, I mean, I think that is the driver. Basically, that we are looking at NII being at 70% of our revenues. So yeah, the NII's going to bottom in that quarter as well.
Bruce Van Saun: But in Q3, Ken, then you'd have other things kicking in, like fee growth strong, long growth starting to kick in. And so even though the swap is incremental, forward starting swaps, then I think we'd have to look at the whole dynamic around what we expect to see in the business performance that would allow us to absorb that.
John Woods: Yeah [indiscernible] later. But PPNR troughs in 2Q.
Ken Usdin: Well, I'm sorry, John. Can you just clarify that again? I didn't want to speak over it.
John Woods: Yeah. And I think we're mentioning that the NIM trough is 3Q, but the PPNR NII trough is in 2Q.
Ken Usdin: Okay, got it. And then just looking out at the longer term guidance you gave just talking about the 3.25%, 3.40% medium term NIM range, it seems like that most of that can be gotten from the three buckets that you show, just getting curing from the fourth quarter level. And I see that you put in a 3.25% end of ‘25 Fed Funds rate. So I'm just wondering how you expect deposit costs and just beta to traject, and I know there's a lot of moving parts in there too because of the growth that you're expecting as well, and mix changes, but just can you maybe just start by just talking about if you're getting to the low 50s on the way up, just how that expects to act and influences that medium-term NIM range? Thanks.
John Woods: Yeah, it's a big driver. I mean, I think the big puts and takes there. I mean, you've got the swap portfolio, which is a big tailwind as we've talked about. But if you go over to the deposit side of things, we are looking at deposit migration stabilizing around mid ‘24 after that first cut in May. You see deposit migration stabilizing. And then as cuts continue, we start flipping to down beta type of expectations versus the up beta. And we look at the early 2000s as being instructive for a lot of this, where that tightening -- that loosening cycle or rate cutting cycle would imply a 35% to 40% down beta for the first call it 100 to 150 basis points. And so that's a good, I think, yardstick to think through our expectation that in the early part of the cycle, our down beta will be less than the full up beta, so our full up beta is low 50s, but nevertheless we're going to get big contributions from down beta and that will grow over time getting close to where the up beta ended up.
Ken Usdin: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.
Erika Najarian: Hi. Good morning. I just had one follow-up question. Putting all your answers together, John and Bruce, about the outlook for 2024 and the underlying dynamics of net interest income, it seems to me that if we put together what you just said to Ken about deposit betas in Slide 23, that despite the exit rate of your net interest margin forecasted to be 2.85% in the fourth quarter, based on everything that you've told us, it seems like you'll see a three handle in terms of that underlying NIM that Bruce discussed in 2025. Is that a good bridge to thinking about where you're exiting in ‘24 and then that medium-term range that you gave us?
John Woods: Well, I would say, well, we're exiting ‘24 at 2.85%. We've indicated that's where fourth quarter of ‘23 is going to -- no, fourth quarter of ‘24 will be. And so that's headed to the 3.25% to 3.40% range. And so you would see us crossing that 3% level in ‘25 sometime, on the way to 3.25%.
Erika Najarian: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.
Gerard Cassidy: Hi, Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Hey, Gerard.
Gerard Cassidy: Bruce, you guys have done a great job from when you went public to where you are today in transforming this company. So I'm curious on your medium term outlook for ROTCE, on the improvement you highlight that the private bank you're targeting at 20% to 24% ROTCE. Can you share with us the mix of how you get there, meaning what percentage of revenue do you think you need to reach from fees versus net interest income? And then also what kind of pre-tax margin do you think you'll need to get to that 20% to 24% target?
John Woods: Yeah, maybe I'll just start off with that, Gerard, it's John. I mean, I think, our fees to total revenues are in the neighborhood of 25%. And I'd say over the medium term, you're going to see that migrate closer to 30%. And that would be consistent with a balance sheet optimization efforts where all of the capital we're putting to work on the front book would have relationship opportunities with attractive deposit and fee-based opportunities associated with it at a much greater rate than what we're seeing running off in the back book. And so that's going to drive that fee percentage up closer to 30%. And I think that the returns that we expect from a, call it, the ROTCE return that you're seeing in the medium term is consistent with a return on tangible assets that's north of 1%. So you see that getting closer to 125 basis points as a way to think about what the returns are on the asset side.
Bruce Van Saun: John, you're answering at the comprehensive company on that MTO page. I think, Gerard, is focused more specifically on the private bank mix. But there, I would say, it will build over time, the fee percentage, as we kind of get the wealth cross-sell. But we should at least be at kind of where we are today in 75%-25%, and then I think there's kind of upside from that over time. And I do think the spread on the private bank assets is very significant today, given the high percentage of low-cost deposits in there. We haven't really seen the loans come on in size yet, but generally capital call lines tend to be priced with a nice return. And I think some of the other business lending and HELOCs and things that will maintain our price discipline and achieve a good spread there as well. So I think if you looked at kind of mature private banking models to have a 20% to 25% return on equity is realistic. I don't know, Brendan, if you want to add to that at all?
Brendan Coughlin: I think it's well said. I won’t repeat it. I just would reiterate that I think the performance in Q4 is in line with what we would have hoped for in terms of the financial profile to drive that type of return over time. Obviously, more loan growth on the come and a lot of it will come down to our ability to drive wealth at scale and recall our targets end of 2025 are $11 billion in deposits, $9 billion in loans, and $10 billion in AUM. So if we deliver that profile, the kind of expense composition, the profitability profile we're seeing so far is aligned with that return. So we're going to work hard to deliver it and hopefully our performance from Q4 sustains in the first half.
Gerard Cassidy: Very good. And then following up, Bruce, maybe some thoughts from your perspective on what we might see in this Basel III endgame. Obviously, there's a lot of talk about scaling it back and maybe it's going to be a delayed implementation because of all the changes. There's a big focus, as you know, as we all know, on the operating risk in the capital markets businesses. But for the regional banks, it seems like it's more that numerator including the unrealized bond losses than the available for sale portfolio. But any thoughts for Citizens, how you might benefit from a scale back of what was initially proposed and what will be the final proposal?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, I would say that for banks of our size, the things that we've focused the most on have been RWA increases to certain lending activities that would potentially reduce the supply, the appetite to lend in those areas because it would erode the economics. So things like mortgage lending to lower income people or credit card lines attracting capital and small business lending attracting more capital. I think those flaws in the proposal have been well chronicled. And even though they don't result in a meaningful RWA inflation for us, I mean, we're stewards of the US economy and we'd like to see those things adjusted. That's been for kind of banks our size. I think the kind of main thing at top of the list, I think the operational risk kind of increases affect the bigger banks more, but nonetheless they seem to have a fairly big bump on the scale. And so that likely, I think, will have a rethink. And maybe those come down to some extent. That would benefit everybody, but probably the big banks more than banks like ourselves.
John Woods: Yeah, and maybe just add -- just a quick add to that is that even if the Basel III endgame had gone through as initially proposed, a very modest impact from an RWA standpoint on us. And as it relates to AOCI, as we mentioned earlier, we're expecting that likely survives. But in our case, we're at 9% by deducting the AOCI opt-in, and that's an incredibly strong number. So we sort of think about what's going on there is really behind us and really in the run rate, if you will, when it comes to that.
Bruce Van Saun: I think that's a good point that John just raised, Gerard, is that given the strength of our capital position both pre- and post-AOCI, we can absorb any of these regulatory capital impacts, but really not worry about them. Many of our peer banks are still kind of catching up and getting in position and having to kind of hold back on capital distribution which is really not something that we're worried about given this capital strength. So we're more able to kind of play offense and not have to play catch up, which is a good position to be in.
Gerard Cassidy: Absolutely. In fact, Bruce, you bring up a good point in your guidance on the median term for the total company, legacy, core, ROTCE of 15% to 17% percent. You guys point out significant share repurchases. Should we interpret that to be a combined dividend payout and buyback ratio of 100% percent of earnings, then once we get the final rules and we're all set to go? Is that a fair number to [put] (ph) for you guys because you are well-capitalized?
Bruce Van Saun: That's right, if you go back to the time of the IPO and the number's been over 100% and under 100% and all over the place, but if you just looked at like a 10-year average, almost 10 years, it's about 75%. And so having enough capital to actually grow your business and lend to customers, you have to certainly work that into the equation. But to the extent, as John stated the priorities, dividend is number one, using capital to support organic growth principally in the loan book and then repurchasing shares. I think if we get our returns into that level, we'll be returning high levels of our earnings back to shareholders both through the dividend and through consistent share repurchases. We should be viewed as a capital return story.
John Woods: Yeah, and I think we had a 95% capital return with performance in ‘23, so it's in that 75% to 100% range over time.
Gerard Cassidy: Thank you. Appreciate the color.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Manan Gosalia: Hi, good morning. Just to follow up to the down beta question on deposits, a few of your peers have talked about how commercial deposit rates are coming down or would come down quickly, but there's likely to be some more pressure on the consumer side continuing from here. They've talked about basically consumers still moving towards high rate accounts. And given that you do have a big core consumer deposit franchise, I was wondering what you're seeing right now and what your expectations are on consumer behavior as rates come down?
Bruce Van Saun: Brendan, you want to take that?
Brendan Coughlin: Yeah, sure, I'll take that. Well, let me start big picture and then give you a little color on Q4 and expectations. So we've been talking for years that the investments we've made in transforming the consumer deposit base have truly been transformational for our performance. And I think that's what we're seeing here now that our consumer book is performing. At a worse case, peer-like, but certainly there are signs that we may be outperforming peers. We look at benchmarking. Our DDA balances were almost 300 basis points better than peer average this year, or last year rather, in 2023. And our net deposit growth was actually a couple hundred basis points better than peers as well, while our betas have been modestly better. So you look at that equation, better deposit growth, better beta, really grounded with an outperformance in DDA. That's a good place to be, and I expect regardless of what consumer behavior conditions we face in 2024 for our relative outperformance to sustain, and we're seeing those signs already. Having said that, on an absolute basis, what we saw in Q4 was a slowdown in consumers' deterioration and excess stimulus. It's still going on a path of normalizing, so we're still seeing that continue, but the pace of normalization has begun to slow and I think we should see that sustain in the first half of the year as rates start to tick down. On the interest-bearing side, competitive dynamics haven't really shifted yet. It's still fairly aggressive out there on CDs and money markets, but we believe we've got more levers than most with Citizens Access as a platform where we can contain interest bearing growth on the higher cost side, not put contagion, so to speak, into the full retail bank to reprice all of our interest bearing deposits gives us a real competitive advantage. And we're thinking about the private bank in some ways in a similar way. So we've got all the tools to compete. We do expect, as the rate curve follows as projected, interest-bearing deposits on the consumer side will start to come down as well. And we're starting to think about a mix of balances. We've got a lot of CDs that potentially can roll over here in the first part of the year that we'll be looking to have more balance and put some of those balances into liquid savings to give us more levers to manage down betas over the course of the year. So all that is to say I feel pretty good about how we are situated. We're starting to see good dynamics with the consumer expected to continue and I've got a lot of confidence that we will outperform peers in whatever environment comes our way.
Manan Gosalia: Great, thank you. And then just to follow up on credit, given the move lower in long end rates, can you talk about anything you're seeing in the non-office CRE portfolio, like maybe in multifamily? How do things like the debt service coverage ratios look today versus a couple of months ago, and how do you expect that to trend given where the forward curve is right now?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, I would just answer broadly that we feel good about the multifamily portfolio, its characteristics, its relatively small loan sizes, a lot of fixed term loans, good diversification geographically. And so we, I think, felt that loss content there was going to be quite low. But now, obviously, with rates ticking down, that provides more kind of air in terms of the distance between the debt service coverage ratio and kind of cash flows. And so we feel that it's helpful, but we weren't worried all that much previously. So anyway, that's…
John Woods: Yeah, I would just hasten and add that it's very different than general office. I mean the capital markets are still active in the context of buying and selling multifamily properties and that will just provide further tailwind to that activity.
Bruce Van Saun: There's a lot of liquidity there.
John Woods: Yeah, there's liquidity there. Buyers and sellers are still transacting. So it's just a very different night and day situation compared to general office, and certainly rates which won't have much of an impact maybe on the general office, will very much have a positive impact on the multifamily construct that was already okay to begin with.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Very good.
Manan Gosalia: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions in queue. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Great, Keeley. Thanks again, everyone, for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support. Have a great rest of the week. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-18 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Greg, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded.  Now I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin. 
Kristin Silberberg: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our third quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color.  We will be referencing our third quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix.  And with that, I will hand over to Bruce. 
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We continue to execute well through a challenging environment. Our focus has been on playing strong defense and maintaining a strong balance sheet. During the quarter, we grew our CET1 ratio to 10.4% near the top of peers, while still buying in $250 million in stock with Non-Core loan runoff of $1.4 billion and deposit growth of $500 million in the quarter, we lowered our spot loan-to-deposit ratio to 84% at quarter end. We focused on building up our liquidity even further, given geopolitical uncertainty and the regulatory direction of travel, adding almost $4 billion to cash and securities.  We also built our ACL further to 1.55%, well above our pro forma day 1 CECL reserve of 1.3% and with our General Office reserve now at 9.5%. While the balance sheet has been a principal focus, we continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives, which should drive strong medium-term performance. Our Private Bank is being built out. We had a soft launch during the back half of Q3, and we brought in around $500 million in deposits and investments.  Full launch is scheduled over the next several weeks. We're executing well on our New York City Metro push, our deposit strategies, our TOP programs, our ESG initiatives and our payment strategy.  Our underlying EPS for the quarter missed the mark slightly at $0.89 as several capital markets deals slipped from Q3 to Q4, given late quarter market volatility. This was the weakest capital markets quarter since the third quarter of 2020, three years ago and prior to several acquisitions like JMP and DH Capital. The good news here is that the pipelines remain strong and we continue to maintain and grow our market share. NII expenses and credit costs all track to expectations.  We included what we hope is an informative and useful slide in the deck, Page 5, which breaks out results for our legacy core business, our Private Bank start-up investment and the drag from Non-Core. Note the legacy core performance shows Q3 EPS of $1.08, NIM of 3.33% and ROTCE of 15.3%. The Private Bank should turn positive by mid-'24 and be nicely accretive in 2025 and Non-Core will dramatically run down over the next several quarters. This dynamic will help offset the drag from forward starting swaps and help propel results higher over time. Given the continued macro uncertainty and pressure on revenue from higher rates, we've initiated a zero-based review of expenses in an effort to keep expenses flat in 2024. We'll report further on this on our January call when we give 2024 guidance.  For Q4, we expect to see key trends begin to stabilize. NII will decline, but by less than in the past 2 quarters. Fees should bounce back somewhat, though the extent is market dependent. Expenses and credit costs should be stable, and we should buy in a modest amount of stock given continued solid earnings and loan runoff. This has clearly been a challenging year for regional banks like Citizens. Rest assured, we are working hard. We're navigating the current turbulence well, and we're taking the actions to position us well for the medium term.  And with that, let me turn it over to John to take you through more of the financial details. John? 
John Woods : Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the third quarter, referencing Slides 5 and 6. For the third quarter, we generated underlying net income of $448 million and EPS of $0.89, this includes the Private Bank start-up investment of $0.05 and a negative $0.14 impact from the Non-Core portfolio.  Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 12.5%. On Slide 5, you'll see that we provided a schedule separating out our Non-Core runoff portfolio and the start-up investment in our new Private Bank from our legacy core results, so you can see how those impact our performance. Our legacy core bank delivered a solid underwriting ROTCE of 15.3%. Currently, the Private Bank startup investment is a drag to results, but relatively quickly, this will become increasingly accretive, 5% EPS benefit in 2025. Similarly, while Non-Core is currently a sizable drag to revenues, it will run off quickly, further bolstering our overall performance and partially mitigating the expected impact of forward starting swaps.  Back to Slide 6. Total net interest income was down 4% linked quarter, and our margin was 3.03%, down 14 basis points, both in line with expectations. Deposits were up slightly in the quarter, reflecting the ongoing resilience of the franchise. We continued our balance sheet optimization efforts, further strengthening liquidity during the quarter given the uncertain geopolitical environment and in preparation for potential changes to liquidity regulations, increasing cash and securities by about $4 billion.  In addition, the Non-Core portfolio declined by $1.4 billion, ending the quarter at $12.3 billion. While we await clarity on new liquidity rules for Category 4 banks, it is worth pointing out that we currently exceed the current LCR requirements for both Category 1 and 3 banks. Our period-end LDR improved to 84%, while our credit metrics remained solid with net charge-offs of 40 basis points, stable linked quarter.  We recorded a provision for credit losses of $172 million and a reserve build of $19 million this quarter, increasing our ACL coverage to 1.55%, up from 1.52% at the end of the second quarter with the increase primarily directed to raising the General Office portfolio reserves from 8% in 2Q to 9.5% at the end of 3Q.  We repurchased $250 million of common shares in the third quarter and delivered a strong CET1 ratio of 10.4%, up from 10.3% in the second quarter. And our tangible book value per share decreased 3% linked quarter, reflecting AOCI impacts associated with higher rates.  Turning to Slide 7 on net interest income. Linked-quarter results were down 4% as expected, primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin, which was down 14 basis points to 3.03%. As you can see from the walk at the bottom of the slide, the decrease in margin was driven by deposit repricing, which includes mix shift from lower cost to higher interest-bearing categories, noninterest-bearing deposit migration as well as the mix impact of the liquidity build I mentioned earlier. These factors were mitigated by positive impacts from asset repricing and rundown of the Non-Core portfolio.  Our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta is 48% through 3Q and which has been rising in response to the rate cycle and competitive environment. Our deposit franchise has performed well with deposit betas generally in the back of peers. This is a significant improvement compared to prior cycles when our beta experience was at the higher end of peers. Our sensitivity to rising rates at the end of the third quarter is roughly neutral, down slightly versus the prior quarter.  Moving to Slide 8. Fees were down 3% linked quarter, driven primarily by lower capital markets and card fees, partly offset by the increase in mortgage banking fees. The Capital Markets fees outlook was positive early in September, but with market volatility and higher long rates picking up to the end of the month, we saw a number of M&A deals pushed into the fourth quarter, resulting in lower linked quarter M&A advisory fees as well as lower bond underwriting. While we continue to see good strength in our deal pipeline, uncertainty continues around the timing of these deals closing given the level of market volatility.  Card fees were slightly lower, reflecting lower balance transfer fees. The increase in mortgage banking fees was driven by higher MSR valuation, the servicing P&L provides a diversifying benefit, which in the quarter more than offset the decline in production as higher mortgage rates weighed on lock volumes.  On Slide 9, we did well on expenses, keeping them broadly stable linked quarter, excluding the $35 million Private Bank start-up investment.  On Slide 10, average loans are down 2% and period end loans are down 1% linked quarter. The Non-Core portfolio runoff of $1.4 billion drove the overall decline, partly offset by some modest core growth in mortgage and home equity. Average core loans are down 1%, largely driven by generally lower loan demand in commercial, along with exits of lower returning relationships and our highly selective approach to new lending in this environment. Period-end core loans are stable. Average commercial line utilization was down slightly this quarter as clients look to deleverage given the environment and higher rates. We saw less M&A financing activity in the face of an uncertain economic environment.  Next, to Slide 11 and 12. We continue to do well on deposits. Period-end deposits were up $530 million linked quarter, with growth led by commercial and consumer deposits broadly stable. Our interest bearing deposit costs were up 39 basis points, which translates to a 48% cumulative beta.  Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels, and with 67% of our deposits in consumer and about 70% insurers secured. This has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in this rising rate environment. As rates rose in the third quarter, we saw continued migration of lower-cost deposits to higher-yielding categories with noninterest-bearing now representing about 22% of total deposits. This is back to pre-pandemic levels and we would expect the decline to moderate from here, although this will be dependent upon the path of rates and consumer behavior.  Moving to credit on Slide 13. Net charge-offs were 40 basis points stable linked quarter with a decrease in commercial, offset by a slight increase in retail driven by auto, which normalized following a very low second quarter result. Non-accrual loans increased 9% linked quarter to 87 basis points of total loans, reflecting an increase in General Office. We feel the rate of increase in non-accruals is decelerating after a jump in Q2.  Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.55%, which is a 3 basis point increase from the second quarter, which reflects a reserve build of $19 million as well as the denominator effect from the rundown of the Non-Core portfolio. We increased our General Office coverage to 9.5% from 8% in the second quarter. You can see some of the key assumptions driving the General Office reserve coverage level, which we feel represent a fairly adverse scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns. As mentioned, we built our reserve for the General Office portfolio to $354 million this quarter, which represents coverage of 9.5% against the $3.7 billion portfolio. We have already taken $100 million in charge offs in this portfolio, which is about 2.5% of loans. In setting the General Office reserve, we are factoring in a very severe peak to trough decline in office values of about 68% with remaining 18% to 20% default rate and a loss severity of about 50%. So we feel the current coverage of 9.5% is very strong. It's worth noting that the financial impact of further deterioration beyond our outlook would be manageable given our strong reserve and capital position.  We have a very experienced CRE team who are focused on managing the portfolio on a loan by loan basis and engaging in ongoing discussions with sponsors to work through the property and borrower specific elements to de-risk the portfolio and ultimately minimize losses. I should also note that about 99.2% of CRE General Office is in current pay status. Moving to Slide 15. We have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.4% as we look to grow capital given the dynamic macro environment and new capital rules proposed by the bank regulators. We returned a total of $450 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We plan to maintain strong and growing capital and liquidity to levels that fortify our balance sheet against macro uncertainties and position us to quickly transition to any new regulatory rules that may impact banks of our size.  Turning to Slide 16 and 17. I'll update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank, so that we can deliver growth and strong returns for our shareholders. First, on Slide 16, we've included just a few of the business initiatives we are pursuing to drive improving performance over the medium term. On the commercial side, we highlight how we are positioned to support the significant growth in private capital. Although deal activity has been relatively muted recently, many sponsors have meaningful amounts of capital to deploy. So there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for M&A and capital markets activity given the right market conditions.  We have been serving the sponsor community with distinctive capabilities for the last 10 years and we've established ourselves at the top of the middle market sponsor lead tables. And our new private bankers will significantly expand our sponsor relationships, and we stand ready to leverage our capabilities in this space when sponsor activity picks up. We also think there is a tremendous opportunity in the payment space, and we've been investing in our Treasury Solutions business developing integrated payments platforms and expanding our client hedging capabilities.  On the consumer side, our entry into New York Metro is going very well with some early success attracting new customers to the bank and growing deposits about 9x faster than in our legacy branches, as we leverage our full customer service capabilities to drive some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network. The build-out of the Private Bank is also going very well. These bankers have hit the ground running and have already brought in around $500 million in deposits and investment balances through a soft launch in the back half of Q3. This is a coast-to-coast team with a presence in some of our key markets like New York, Boston and places where we'd like to do more like Florida and California.  We plan to open a few Private Banking centers in these geographies and build appropriate scale in our wealth business with our Clarfeld legacy Wealth business as the centerpiece of that effort.  Turning to Slide 17 on the top left side is our balance sheet optimization program, which is progressing well. The chart illustrates the relatively rapid rundown of the Non-Core portfolio, which is comprised of our $9 billion shorter-duration indirect auto portfolio and purchased consumer loans. This portfolio is expected to decline by about $7.6 billion from where we are now to about $4.7 billion at the end of 2025, and as this run found, we plan to redeploy the majority of cash paydowns to building core bank liquidity with the remainder used to support organic relationship-based loan growth in the core portfolio.  The capital recaptured through reduction in Non-Core RWA will be reallocated to support the growth of the Private Bank. In summary, this strategy strengthens liquidity has already been a source of about $3 billion of term funding ABS issuance this year. It builds capital by reducing RWAs and it's accretive to NIM, EPS and ROTCE.  Next to our TOP program on the right side of the slide. Our latest program is well underway and on target to deliver a $115 million pretax run rate benefit by year-end. Our TOP programs are essential to improving returns over the medium term and we are ready to launch on top 9, looking for efficiency opportunities driven by further automation and the use of AI to better serve our customers. We are looking at ways to simplify our organization and save more in third-party spend as well.  In light of pressure on revenue given the rate environment, we are targeting to keep 2024 underlying expenses flat. On the technology front, we have a very extensive agenda with a multiyear next-gen tech cloud migration, targeting the exit of all of our data centers by 2025 and the program to converge our core deposit system onto a cloud-based modern banking platform. We've come a long way in modernizing our platform since the IPO.  And on the ESG front, we recently announced a $50 billion sustainable finance target, which we plan to achieve by 2030 and commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035. And we are working diligently to help our clients prepare for and finance their own transitions to a lower carbon economy.  Moving to the outlook for the fourth quarter on Slide 18. Our outlook incorporates the Private Bank and assumes that the Federal rate steady through the end of the year. We expect NII to be down approximately 2% next quarter, given the impact from noninterest-bearing and low-cost deposits migrating to higher cost categories, albeit at a decelerating rate, more than offsetting the benefit of higher asset yields, Non-Core runoff and day count.  Based on the forward curve, we expect the cumulative deposit beta at the end of 2023 to be approximately 50% and to rise to a terminal level of low 50s percent before the first rate cut. Noninterest income is expected to be up 3% to 4% with a seasonal pickup in capital markets depending on the market environment. Noninterest expense should be broadly stable, which includes the Private Bank and excludes the anticipated FDIC special assessment. Net charge-offs are expected to rise to approximately mid-40s basis points as we continue to work through the General Office portfolio and expected further normalization. We feel good about our reserve coverage around the current level and the ACL level will continue to benefit from loan runoff.  Our CET1 is expected to increase to approximately 10.5%, with the opportunity to engage in a modest level of share repurchases, the execution of which will depend upon our ongoing assessment of the external environment. Beyond the 4Q '23 guidance, as I mentioned earlier, we are targeting flat 2024 underlying expenses. This includes the Private Bank on the Non-Core portfolio and excludes the anticipated FDIC special assessment. Also, we've included Slide 25 in the appendix on the swaps impact through 2027. We expect higher swap expense in 2024 to be partly offset by the benefit to NII from the Non-Core rundown.  Notably, the swap expense drag will reduce meaningfully over 2025 through 2027 as swaps run off and the Fed normalizes short rates. In addition, the impact of terminated swaps is dramatically lower in '26 and 2027.  To wrap up, we delivered solid results this quarter while navigating through a dynamic environment. Importantly, we made good progress positioning the company with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position, which will serve us well as regulatory requirements are finalized and if the environment becomes more challenging. Our balance sheet strength also positions us to take advantage of opportunities through our strategic priorities as we continue to strengthen the franchise for the future and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns.  With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce. 
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Greg, why don't we open it up for some Q&A. 
Erika Najarian: My first question is for John. John, there has been a lot of feedback from investors on uncertainty over the NII trajectory for '24 in the environment of higher for longer. And I think you know where I'm going here. I think that investors are trying to sort of square the $11 billion, $12 billion increase in notional swaps, right, at a received fixed rate of 3.10% in the second half of next year and trying to square that in a higher for longer environment with some of the balance sheet optimization. So if you could just sort of take us through a little bit of the moving pieces and perhaps simplify it for the investors listening in terms of how that impacts your NII trough timing, what happens after you hit trough and are you still confident in what you said, I guess, a month ago and that you could exit 4Q '24 with a 3% NIM? 
John Woods: Thanks, Erika. Maybe I'll take that a little bit in reverse order because it may help us with the jump off conversation. So we -- net interest margin came in as expected in the third quarter. So we've talked about that at 3.03%. I think that the two big forces that I would talk about broadly as you look out into the fourth quarter, would be our basic ongoing deposit migration and how that is expected to play out.  So I'd say that if you look at overall net interest margin, I'd say that we're going to see another, call it, mid-single-digit sort of headwind into the fourth quarter just on the entire balance sheet outside of liquidity build. And so that 3.03% kind of gets to close, it comes in right around that 3%. So that's kind of playing out the way we expected, notwithstanding the fact that we are seeing ongoing migration, I'd say that, that's holding about where we think it should be. The other item, as you may have seen in some of our walks in the slide deck is the fact that given the uncertainty and regulatory environment, we've endeavored to actually build liquidity in a much more meaningful way. That liquidity build is NII neutral. But it does have a nominal impact to the net interest margin. And so you could see that being an impact in the fourth quarter, so it was a couple -- maybe 2 basis points or so in the third quarter. That could be maybe another, call it several basis points as you get into the fourth quarter. So you can see things playing out as we expect in the fourth quarter.  When you basically get to the 2024 dynamics, once you reset the table in the fourth quarter, the big puts and takes are we do have the swap portfolio increasing as you get into -- it's flattish when you get in the first half of the year, but it rises in the second half of the year. It happens that as it relates to '24, that's about when the forward curve would start implying that cuts are starting to come in. So I'd say that when you think about some of the mitigants to the outlook, with the swap portfolio, you're going to have potentially the Fed beginning to cut in the second half of 2024. You have the ongoing benefit of the Non-Core portfolio. You've got the growing accretive contributions from the Private Bank. And with long range being where they are, asset front book, back book is will contribute positively.  And then just the broader balance sheet optimization efforts that we're doing across the bank. I think are all the areas that I would highlight as nice mitigants to what we're seeing play out. Let's see where the rate environment plays out. I mean the forwards have it in 1 place. We have Bloomberg economist consensus are probably 50 basis points lower than where the forwards are. But I mean, Nevertheless, we see this potentially playing out to a very manageable and, frankly, growing momentum as you exit 2024 on the net interest margin. 
Erika Najarian : And just to clarify, are you still confident that you could exit taking all out account -- exit 4Q '24 have a NIM of about 3%. And based on sort of what you're telling us, it sounds like the -- if the Fed doesn't cut as the forward curve indicated, that would be the risk to that 3%. 
John Woods: Yes. I think in the fourth quarter, I'd say that we're all else equal we're getting around that 3% level, depending upon the impact of liquidity builds, which are NII neutral. That is that liquidity build piece that I would say, which is kind of sort of set that aside, just given where we are, it doesn't drive NII. So you're thinking about the net interest margin that drives NII, we're going to be in that neighborhood of 3% ex liquidity build. 
Erika Najarian: Got it. And I'm going to step back after this because I think I'm taking up too much time. I just want to clarify I'm asking about 4Q '24. Are you talking about 4Q '23? I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page. 
John Woods: 4Q '23, yes, sorry, I need to make sure that was clear, all everything I was just saying was about in that last bit was that we're getting around that 3% level, give or take, at the -- in 4Q '23 ex liquidity build and the liquidity build is NII neutral. So if you're trying to think about where we're driving NII, it's around that plus or minus 3% level ex liquidity build. For 2023 and all the other forces that we talked about earlier, we're -- as you're going into '24, when I was ticking off the tailwinds from Non-Core, Private Bank, asset front book, back book and BSO, all of those are tailwinds into '24, which will be mitigants along with, let's see where the rate cuts actually start kicking in, in the second half of '24.  And we'll see where we exit 2024. But that's something we'll come back to you on in terms of adding more color in January as we typically do. And we'll assess our environment and all of those forces and puts and takes at that time. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. 
Scott Siefers: I guess I want to revisit that fourth quarter margin just to make sure everybody is on the same page. But the reported margin, it sounds like will be below the 3%, however, right, because you do -- and I know it will be dependent on liquidity build, but it sounds like you do anticipate liquidity build. So will we be talking kind of something in the [mid-2.90s]? Would that be sort of the reported expectation? 
John Woods: It will be lower. It just depends on the NII neutral liquidity build that we determined to be appropriate. So it's sort of -- it's -- I think it's useful to talk about an ex liquidity build, given the fact that that's the driver of NII, and there'll be possibly additional -- just in terms of the variability of cash and how that gets funded, it will be -- that's flat to NII, but it will be a denominator effect that would take the NIM below that plus or minus 3% that I talked about before, but not an NII driver. 
Scott Siefers : Yes. Okay. All right. Perfect. And then maybe as we look out just in terms of sort of the handoff from the Non-Core loan runoff to more visible Private Bank growth. When do we sort of think that will become sort of more neutral from -- in terms of visibility to the balance sheet? Like when would we expect the loan portfolio to sort of level out? 
John Woods: Yes. I think that we were saying that we think that the Non-Core runoff will be a continued driver of sort of in the first half of -- in 4Q and the first half of '24, you'll see some declines in the loan portfolio. But in the second half of '24, we start seeing the Private Bank contributing as well as organic contribution starting to see loan growth such that year-over-year, we would have an expectation you'd see us starting to see loan growth in the second half of '24. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from D.A. Davidson. 
Peter Winter: Just -- I was wondering on the credit side, we've just seen, in general, some pre-announcements on charge-offs in the shared national credit space. Can you just remind us what your exposure is to shared national credits and how you fared in the recent exam? 
Don McCree: So do you want me to take that, John? 
John Woods: Sure.
Don McCree : So, just in general, as I think -- there's a lot of focus on shared national credits. Actually, when we came through the exam this year, we had more upgrades than we had downgrades. So we didn't have any forced charge-offs in terms of our shared national credit book. We've been taking our participations down as part of our BSO exercise. We've there about 10 basis points -- 10% lower than they were a couple of quarters ago. I think there's a lot of focus on shared national credit. We treat participations or share of national credit deals exactly as we treat every other credit extension. So one, it has to return people think about it as hanging paper and then deploying loans and not returning. We go through the exact same process, whether we're participating or leading a transaction or a sole lender. And then also, we do full credit analysis of every single extension that we make, whether it be shared national credit extension or not. So our SNC book doesn't perform any worse than any other book that we have in the bank. And actually, in some cases, it's larger credits, so they might perform marginally better than some of the middle market assets that we have on the book over time. 
Brendan Coughlin: Yes. And I think just as part of BSO, as Bruce said, as part of BSO in general, we're kind of looking at the total relationship returns. And if we went into credit as a participant thinking we can kind of move left and become a more important bank, that's not panning out. We're not getting the cross-sell we anticipated, then we're extricating ourselves at the next available opportunity. So I think you'll continue to see that trend. 
Don McCree: Yes. And let me just pick up on that. Just in the last quarter, back to the loan growth question, we had about $900 million front book loan originations, offset by about $1.6 billion of BSO activity. So we're really churning the book towards full relationship credits and away from some of those participations that Bruce mentioned. And I think a lot of the competition is doing exactly the same thing. We see people supporting their lead bank relationships and moving away from more speculative future opportunities. 
Peter Winter : Got it. And then -- just can you just provide a little bit more color maybe on the deposit repricing and migration and how you see it playing out with a longer -- higher for longer rates just impacting the deposit pricing pressures?
John Woods : Yes, I'll go and handle that. I mean, I'd say, first off, I mean, I think when you look at our performance from a deposit beta standpoint, we feel like we're basically in the pack with what you're seeing across the industry, which is a really positive results compared to where we were last cycle, which is part of the ongoing investments we've been making in primacy and product capabilities and delivering the entire bank for our customers. So we're really kind of pleased to see where we -- how things are playing out cycle to date.  That said, we still are -- and frankly, when you look at the overall metric of noninterest-bearing to overall deposits were around 22%. That's basically back to where we were pre-pandemic. We've seen a decelerating migration out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing and seeing decelerating migration even inside of the interest-bearing book. Nevertheless, it's getting smaller every quarter. We would expect to see that really dissipating over the coming quarter or two and that's really what you see when you get late in the cycle and the Fed's on hold. So feeling very good about that trajectory. 
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Maybe, Brendan, do you track very carefully how we're doing versus peers and some of our strategies to continue to maintain that low-cost focus. So maybe you can add some additional color. 
Brendan Coughlin : Yes, sounds good. So much of our low-cost deposit book is in the consumer space and obviously was buoyed through the pandemic by all the stimulus. We saw the rundown of the stimulus rate peak in May, and it started to abate as we got into the summer and the fall, although it's still kind of spending down at a decent clip. We do have a lot of analytics, benchmarking analytics on how we're doing, and this is supportive of John's commentary that the franchise is performing in a very different level than it did the last upgrade cycle.  We believe we're #2 in the peer set in terms of DDA consumer migration. So we're performing exceptionally well on the DDA side. And when you look at beta on the consumer side, as compared with the growth that we're getting, it appears for about 400 basis points to 500 basis points better in net growth on the consumer book through the cycle so far and our betas are mildly better. So more growth slightly better cost on the core book. That's excluding Citizens Access. That's a real indicator of the quality of franchise and the quality of the customer base that we've moved from sort of a community banking, high-priced deposit focus to deeply engaged primary banking relationships.  So we expect the pay down of low-cost deposits to continue to slow obviously, dependent on rate environment and the economy that potentially could change. What I do feel really confident in is that our relative performance to peers will be strong and we'll continue to outperform on the consumer side and the stability of our low-cost book. At the individual customer level, they still have a little bit more liquidity in their balances than they did pre-pandemic, that's largely held by affluent and high net worth individuals, our mass market book and even in the mass affluent space, they've sort of moderated back down to operating floors.  So I think those are all signs that would support the continued slowdown in the rundown of low-cost deposits pending any recessionary impact that may bring them below operating floors. So we feel pretty good. And just on the uninsured and insured deposit front, we saw a little bit of a blip on the uninsured in March. And since March, that has been incredibly stable and all parts of the book have been growing.  So all the fundamentals point to continued trajectory of stability and certainly continue to outperform. And then in addition to that, we're controlling what we can control is we're performing in the top quartile in the United States in terms of household acquisition growth. The New York market, as John pointed out, is helping to give us an extra lever to drive low-cost deposit growth over and above just the portfolio trends, which are generally out performing. So we do believe we've got a distinctive amount of levers for the franchise to continue to outperform in the medium-term outlook on low-cost deposits. 
Peter Winter : Very helpful. And then just one quick housekeeping. I just want to confirm, John, you said that the private -- the expense outlook for next year being flat. That includes the Private Bank build-out expenses? 
John Woods : Yes. The underlying expenses to be flat next year, including the Private Bank as well as Non-Core. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. 
Kenneth Usdin : Just a follow-up on that last question. John, I just wanted to ask you, I know that the Private Bank buildout was $35 million of cost this quarter. Just wondering if there's any changes to your expectation of what that would trend like going forward as part of that cost commentary? 
John Woods: I think Brendan will probably have some color on this. So it's pretty similar into the fourth quarter. And then, of course, into next year, you see it starting to migrate towards a -- instead of being an EPS drag, it gets back to breakeven when you get out into 2024. And then more broadly, a 5% contribution to EPS is our outlook there. But... 
Brendan Coughlin : Yes. There'll be into Q4, some very modest upticks in the low 40s potentially. And the reasons for that, we hired the majority of the team as you all know, in the early part of the summer, the influences on that nudging up our successful securing of various different Private Banking offices coast-to-coast to house the team and start to bring in customers into the platform, some operating expenses clients come on board as well as we're playing some very selective second-tier office. There's still a lot of talent in motion and this quarter after the first 150. We also hired another 25 really top A-list talent folks in all of those same offices that we opened in the summer. And so we're going to be selective. But as we see the right talent pop up, we're going to grab them -- add them to the team. So... 
Bruce Van Saun: The other thing, just in the way the comp is structured, Ken, that the folks who came over on guarantees as if they're fully producing. So as the revenues come in, there won't be incremental costs. They'll just be kind of earning those pay levels. So another factor to consider. 
Kenneth Usdin : Yes, that's a great point. And then as a follow-up, you guys have done a great job over the years on the TOP program and just I take your commentary about holding costs flat, inclusive of these extra builds that would imply a real turn exiting the year given that you ramped through the year on cost this year. And John, I know you mentioned AI as a piece of that increment. But you've done 100 plus of TOP each year. I'm just wondering like where else would you be digging in across the organization to get that magnitude of what seems to be a pretty meaningful implied to extra cost save out of the numbers next year. 
Bruce Van Saun: So it's Bruce. And let me start off and then John can amplify. But the TOP program, I think, has been a real consistent contributor to our ability to deliver positive operating leverage. But to actually get to flat for next year, we have to go beyond that. So we've geared up a very nice TOP program and we're adding to it. But I think we're going to have to look at kind of employment levels broadly to see where we can extract some folks and we'll look at certain business activities that may be less important going forward than what we have been engaged in historically.  We've already done some of that this year. So we downsized the mortgage business quite a bit. We exited the auto business. So I think it's a combination of actions. It's continuing to find ways to upsize TOP, leverage things like AI, where we can do that. look at our overall board structure and staffing levels and see if we can pinch some efficiencies there and then look hard at our business mix and figure out where the key years not to just have a knee-jerk revenues, there's revenue pressure in the environment. So let's really take a hard knife at all expenses. We have to be judicious about where we're cutting and protect the things that we feel are really going to help us grow and outperform in the medium term. So things like the private banks, things like the New York Metro expansion. There's things that we're going to ring fence and then there's other areas we're going to have to go a little harder with the knife. John? 
John Woods: Yes, I think that covered it well Bruce and just ongoing the fundamentals, our bread and butter of focusing on organizational related items and third-party spend and the like. And I won't repeat all the categories that Bruce articulated, but we've got a fundamental underpinning that we feel like we have the opportunity to broaden out with while protecting the initiatives that are going to help us outperform over the medium term. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. 
Manan Gosalia: You have 67% of deposits from consumer, so a strong franchise there. And you noted that you should outperform peers on a relative basis. But one of your large peers noted last week that banks may still be overearning on NII. So I guess my question was, how do you see competitive factors playing out for consumer deposits next year, especially if the rate environment stays higher for longer? 
Bruce Van Saun: Brendan, do you want to? 
Brendan Coughlin : Yes. We certainly have seen continued heavy competition for consumer deposits. You're seeing kind of money market and CD rates in the mid-5s in some spots. We feel like we're competing really, really well on that. Obviously, it's supported by our transformation on low cost, that's where you kind of start on how you manage strong NII levels and NIM levels as having a solid foundation of low-cost, highly engaged customers. We have probably more levers than others have to manage through whatever the competitive intensity ends up coming our way in 2024.  Certainly, we have Citizens Access, which has been an incredibly positive tool for us to grow interest-bearing deposits in a smart way with really sticky relationships, but also it helps not put too much contagion into the retail banking system with heavy kind of window rates on the front of the branches that may drive in hot money and bring the franchise into non-relationship-based banking. And so that's been an incredibly effective tool to both raise money and also protect how we manage and compete on interest-bearing costs. We've also -- where we have competed in the core franchise with some of the more aggressive rates. We've done it in an incredibly relationship-based way. So the access into -- no pun intended, with Citizen's Access, access into higher rates on deposits of your core banking customer of ours requires you to be in a relationship product. We call it Quest or a private client, which is our mass affluent or affluent value proposition. So when you do more with us, you get more, that strategy has enabled us to be more targeted in how we think about introducing interest-bearing costs into the environment that we're able to protect and retain balances in a really thoughtful way versus reprice the entire book in some spots. So it's intense out there. We expect that to continue through the first half of the year as deposits are sort of hard to come by through the U.S. banking system, but we think we've got the right tools and the right levers to continue to win and compete well with our peers. 
John Woods: And just maybe just to add, that's all great points there. And then just to add one other point about this. I mean, the rate environment is not -- is expected to become more constructive, I guess, is the point. Meaning if you're raising deposits in a world where the yield curve is inverted or at best getting less inverted. That's always going to be a tricky situation for banks until it becomes a more stable upward sloping situation, which I think is more likely to be the case as you get into '24 and certainly to the end of '24, when you start seeing lower short-term rates and nevertheless, an attractive long-term rate where we can basically deploy our capital and make a positive return. So that's really what I think is going to shake out as you get into '24. 
Bruce Van Saun : I mean the other one last piece of color I would add is that as we enter 2024, we're still kind of having a net loan shrink, and that will eventually turn around as the Private Bank starts to put on loans, and we'll see where the economy is. But we won't really need to we're not pressured to grow deposits given that dynamic on loans. We can still see the LDR improve just by keeping loans stable or even letting them drop a little bit. So factoring that into the calculus of do you really need to be aggressive given that's your dynamic around loans and deposits that helps you manage the cost of your deposit franchise. 
Manan Gosalia : Great. I appreciate all the color there. And just separately on the LCR requirements, you mentioned that you're compliant in both Category 1 and Category 3 now and that this build is also NII neutral. But I guess the question is, how much more do you think you need to build from here? And how do you think about that increasing your asset sensitivity in the long run? 
John Woods: Yes. I mean I think we should say -- a couple of questions in there. I mean I think the regulatory requirements are generally inducing banks to become more asset sensitive. You got the issue of more broadly, if the long-term debt rule goes in, that would be along with having to hold liquidity that is shorter duration, that's going to cause asset sensitivity to grow over time. We're naturally an asset-sensitive bank. And those forces would cause us to be more asset sensitive. So that will -- we'll have to consider in the coming and during the transition periods, whether it makes sense to moderate those positions with all balance sheet types of actions.  But nevertheless, there's generally a tailwind of asset sensitivity being created from the regulatory environment, but also idiosyncratic to us, our Non-Core portfolio as that runs off that's mostly a fixed book and that has a tailwind to asset sensitivity. We're around neutral now. So going becoming a bit more asset sensitivity over time is some of the underlying forces there that I would say are in place, and we'll decide as the environment plays out, whether how and whether to moderate that.  And again, the liquidity build is NII neutral. So it's really not a driver. And it's something that, again, at the NII guide of down 2% is really driven by basically having a -- the ex liquidity build NIM decline is really the driver of that and it equates to the 2% that you're seeing in the guide. So that's the way to pull it all together for 4Q. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Connor from Deutsche Bank. 
Matthew O'Connor : A lot of talk earlier in the call in terms of net interest income trajectory for next year and all the puts and takes. But I just wanted to circle back on that. In a stable rate environment to kind of higher for longer when and around what level does the interest income dollars start to bottom? 
John Woods: Yes, I mean we're still working through our 2024 outlook, right? So we're going to be much more, I would say, transparent about what our expectations are for '24 as you get into planning season here and completing that. And of course, we do that in January. With that said, we -- broadly, as you look at the swap trajectory for us into '24, we have a swap portfolio growing right around the time that the forwards would indicate the Fed would begin to cut. As a matter of fact, and as I mentioned earlier, there's -- you could actually see deviation around that. And we happen to have a view that that it's likely that it will actually come in a little lower than where the forwards have it coming in at the end of '24. So that will be a mitigant. And as I mentioned, the Non-Core rundown is a mitigant. And Private Bank as that grows is, of course, accretive. The other thing I'll mention, I mean, if you get the on '24 and you look at what's happening in the '25 through '27 timeframes, it's certainly more consistent with a more neutral Fed posture that would represent, regardless of what the transition is in '24, that would represent a significant tailwind getting into '25 through '27, as you see the swap portfolio being more of a neutral impact to net interest margin and NII.  And so working our way through '24, we get some really nice tailwinds. And that's just on the Acosta portfolio. We also have a locked in and baked in tailwind from the terminated swaps which run off, as you can see on our slide, in a significant way over '25 to '27. So I would call '24 a transition year while the Fed normalizes rates and our balance sheet optimization takes hold with Non-Core and creates a lot of momentum as you look out into '25 and beyond. 
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I would just add a little color here, Matt, to you and Erika's question. I think Erika was looking for John to say, are you still holding a 3% in the fourth quarter this year and the fourth quarter next year. I think the reluctance to draw a line in the sand on 3% is the amount of the liquidity build and that -- some of the cards from the regulators on new liquidity regulations aren't turned over yet. So just putting that aside, if you just say that's a bit of an unknown -- do we still have an ambition to have our exit rate at the end of '23 be roughly the exit rate at the end of '24. Yes, that would still be the ambition. We have to go through the work, as John said, to go through kind of the budget process for next year, but that's still where we'd be hoping to arrive. 
Matthew O'Connor : And then just in terms of the impact of rate cuts versus higher for longer scenario, what's -- what does hire for longer do versus the rate cuts? Because it sounds like you're still a little asset sensitive, but the roll-on of the swaps would obviously benefit from rate cuts, so what's the net impact if rates are stable versus what the forward curve has for next year? Is it better or worse? 
John Woods: Yes. I'd say that where we're positioned, we're right around neutral. A small increase in rates is actually positive to our platform. A large -- we tend to calculate this stuff using the 100 basis point and 200 basis point gradual rises, we're relatively neutral in those kinds of calculations, which you'll see disclosures on in our 10-Q. But when it comes to just another hike, or -- and those kinds of conversations, meaning we tend to -- in those environments continue to make money and have a positive impact to NII. The other -- so generally, the forward curve is favorable to us. I think we like the tracking of the forward curve. We start getting cuts at the end of '24 and that allows the continued front book, back book. We like the long end being more anchored a little higher. That helps, too, in terms of our originations on our fixed rate loan book. So again, and it also provides opportunities to later on lock in higher rates to the extent that, that's desirable. So the forward curve is, I think, constructive for us, plus or minus is fine. I think large moves either way is where we would say it starts to kind of create potential headwinds. But other than that, we're feeling -- we would feel okay with it. 
Matthew O'Connor : Okay. So to summarize, steeper is better as a good rule of thumb? 
John Woods: I'd say forward curve is better and plus or minus is not going to move the needle very much. So having some cuts at a slow -- I mean in general, over the long term, banks do better we're maturity -- were maturity intermediary, when rate -- when we have an upward sloping yield curve. So the short rates are at 5.50. We think that it's more constructive to see short rates around 3.00 to 3.50 over the long term. We also think it's constructive to have a 10-year that's north of 4% in that same environment. So therefore, a gradual decline from 5.50 down to about 3.00 to 3.50 over the next two years, we think it's not only good for us, but good for the industry and allow us to get back to an upward sloping yield curve. And I think that, that's the environment where we would be performing in a very good way. That said, we pivot and manage to the extent that the rate environment migrates differently than that. But that's the one that I would say works out the best for us and the industry as a whole. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. 
Vivek Juneja : I guess I have a couple of clarifications given all the discussions going on. John, when you said -- let's start with expenses. You talked about underlying expenses to be flat next year. But then you also said that includes Private Bank and Non-Core. Non-Core is not included in the way you define underlying expenses. So are you saying both underlying, which is core and reported expenses are both going to be flat next year? 
John Woods: No, I'd say underlying expenses at the top of the house will be flat next year, '24 versus '23. Underlying includes Private Bank, it includes Non-Core overall CFG expenses will be flat in '24 versus '23. 
Bruce Van Saun: Underlying does not exclude those things today, the back that includes those things. 
Vivek Juneja : Okay. So I want all these definitions, everybody has a little difference, so it's important to clarify that. The second one, I guess, John, going back to the rate discussion, just to get my head wrapped around that. If I heard you right, just in response to Matt's question, is that small increase in rate is beneficial to NII. But then rate cuts is also positive. So I'm trying to reconcile how both scenarios are positive for you? 
John Woods: Yes, I can clarify that, Vivek. I mean a small increase in rates from here would drive some NII -- a small amount of NII and a small decline would be a small negative in terms of the small decline in NII, but they're both quite small which is why we're calling ourselves neutral. But just -- but from a positioning standpoint, it would be a small positive if rates rose from here and let's say, one additional hike for example. Let's say if the Fed has a hike in the fourth quarter in November or December, we'll see an NII contribution to that. A small cut goes the other way and also -- but not a significant decline if there was a cut.  Yes. And to be clear, that's -- and the difference here is what happens immediately, say, in the next quarter versus what happens over time. We are very constructive and feel very good about a gradual decline in rates where the short end gets down to 3% to 3.5% over, call it, a quarterly period of time. We think that's very good as it gives time for balance sheets to adjust and to have front book, back books continue to get locked in and be supportive of a healthy balance sheet migration over the next, call it, a year or two as our balance sheet optimization continues to take hold with Non-Core runoff, et cetera. So we would -- our balance sheet does well with an upward sloping balance sheet that we'll migrate to over the, call it, the '24 and early '25 period. 
Vivek Juneja : And one more clarification -- that's helpful. On the expenses, Bruce, when you talk about stable for next year, what are you assuming for capital markets? Are you assuming capital markets revenues and therefore incentive comp goes up? Or are you just using current level? Any color on that? 
Bruce Van Saun : Yes. Well, we haven't given the full guidance yet on '24, but there is a variable element of pay that if revenues go up in capital markets that pay would go up. That's probably the 1 area that has the rates tied to revenues across the bank. And we would have to contemplate that as we go through the budget process. So we said we're targeting the flat expenses for next year, and we would incorporate our view on kind of where the capital markets fees are going to be and then what additional payouts would result from that. And then we'd have to find ways to offset that elsewhere in the bank. 
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.
Bruce Van Saun : Okay. Thanks again for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-19 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alan, and I will be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.
Kristin Silberberg: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our second quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our second quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. And with that, I will hand over to you Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. The turbulent external environment continued in the second quarter, but we continue to navigate well and we delivered solid financial performance. In particular, we're pleased with the strong results we achieved around capital, liquidity and funding. Our CET1 ratio grew by 30 basis points to 10.3% in the quarter and we were able to repurchase in excess of $250 million in stock. We grew spot deposits by 3% or $5.5 billion and our spot loan-to-deposit ratio improved to 85%. Our federal home loan bank borrowings dropped by $7 billion to $5 billion and contingent liquidity grew by 20% to $79 billion. For the quarter, we posted underlying earnings per share of $1.04 an ROTCE of 13.9%. NII was down 3% reflecting higher funding costs, in line with our expectations. Non-interest income grew 4%, slightly less than expected as capital markets saw a few deals pushed to the third quarter. The expenses were broadly stable as expected and credit cost continue to be manageable. One of the highlights of the second quarter was the opportunity to secure a significant influx of talent, largely from the First Republic platform to meaningfully augment our Citizens Private Bank and Wealth Management business. While expense investments will lead revenues in 2023, we project the business to be accretive in 2024 and significantly profitable in the medium term. In our presentation this morning, we will highlight this initiative in more detail. And we'll also review several other compelling initiatives that we believe will lead to strong medium-term outperformance. Execution of these initiatives continues to be strong. We're setting up a non-core run-off portfolio as a centerpiece of intensified balance sheet optimization efforts. We expect around $9 billion of loan run-off, largely in auto by the end of 2025. This capacity will be utilized to fund more strategic loan portfolios, to pay down high-cost debt, and to build cash and securities. In parallel, the Private Bank will grow loans over this period by $9 billion, which will be funded by $11 billion of incremental deposits. The net benefit of all of this is a better deployment of capital, along with the positive impact on earnings per share, ROTCE and liquidity. We've also included more detail on our CRE loan portfolio. Our general office reserve is now at 8%. While we continue to see increases in criticized assets and charge-offs in this particular portfolio, we believe losses are manageable and readily absorbed by reserves and our strong capital position. Looking forward, we anticipate that the environment while stabilizing, will continue to be challenging. Our net interest margin will decline again in Q3, given higher funding costs. We expect our terminal beta to reach 49% to 50% at year end. Our fees to continue to grow sequentially. Expenses will be well-controlled and credit should be broadly stable. We will further build our CET1 ratio while continuing to repurchase shares. Overall, we're holding in okay on current-period performance with mid-teens ROTCE in 2023, while making the investments to deliver a stronger franchise, attractive growth and returns, and afforded by balance sheet over the medium-term. We continue to build a great bank and we remain very excited about our future. Our capital strength and our attractive franchise, position us to attract terrific talent and to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. With that, let me turn it over to John to take you through more of the financial details. John?
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the second quarter, referencing Slide 5. For the second quarter, we generated underlying net income of $531 million and EPS of $1.04. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 13.9%. Net interest income was down 3% linked-quarter, and our margin was 3.17%, down 13 basis points with funding costs outpacing the increase in asset yields. We delivered very strong deposit growth in the quarter, reflecting the strength of the franchise with spot deposits up 3% or $5.5 billion. Period-end loans and average loans were down 2% quarter-over quarter, reflecting the impact of our balance sheet optimization efforts, including our ongoing run-off of auto. These dynamics improved our period end LDR to 85% and our liquidity position remains very strong. We reduced FHLB borrowings by about $7 billion to approximately $5 billion outstanding at quarter-end and we increased our available liquidity by 19% to about $79 billion. Our credit metrics and overall position remains solid. Total NCOs of 40 basis points are up 6 basis points linked-quarter as expected, primarily reflecting higher charge-offs, increased general office. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $176 million and a reserve build of $24 million this quarter, increasing our ACL coverage to 1.52% up from 1.47% at the end of the first quarter, with the increase directed to the general office portfolio. We repurchased $256 million of common shares in the second quarter and delivered a strong CET1 ratio of 10.3%, up from 10% in the first quarter. And our tangible book value per share is down 2% linked-quarter, reflecting AOCI impacts associated with higher rates. On the next few slides, I'll provide further details related to second quarter results. On Slide 6, net interest income was down 3%, primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin, which was down 13 basis points to 3.17% with the increase in asset yields, more than offset by higher funding costs, given the competitive environment and migration from lower cost categories. With Fed funds increasing 500 basis points since the end of 2021, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta is 42% through the second quarter which has been rising in response to the rate and competitive environment and is generally in the pack with peers. Our asset sensitivity at the end of the second quarter is still approximately 1% which is broadly stable with the prior quarter. Our received fixed cash flow swap position is similar to the prior quarter as we held off on adding further protection as rates continued to rise during the quarter. Moving on to Slide 7, we posted a solid fee performance in a challenging market environment. Fees were up 4% linked-quarter with card fees showing a seasonally strong increase from higher transaction volumes and increases in wealth and mortgage banking fees. FX and derivatives revenue was modestly lower. Capital markets fees were stable with market volatility through the quarter continuing to impact underwriting fees, largely offset by increased syndications and M&A advisory fees, despite a few deals being pushed into the third quarter. We continue to see good strength in our deal pipelines and are hopeful that deal flow picks up in the second half. Mortgage fees were slightly higher as production fees increased with market volumes, partially offset by lower margins and lower servicing fees. And finally, wealth fees were also up slightly reflecting growth in AUM. On Slide 8, expenses were broadly stable linked-quarter as seasonally lower salaries and employee benefits were offset by higher equipment and software costs, as well as higher advertising and deposit insurance costs. On Slide 9, average and period-end loans were both down 2% linked-quarter, reflecting balance sheet optimization actions in C&I, as well as the impact of planned auto runoff. Education was lower given the rate environment, but this was offset by modest growth in mortgage and from equity. Commercial utilization was down a bit as clients look to deleverage, given higher rates and we saw less M&A financing activity in the face of an uncertain economic environment. On Slide 10, period-end deposits were up $5.5 billion or 3% linked-quarter with growth led by consumer up $3 billion and commercial up $2 billion. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 47 basis points, which translates to a 101% sequential beta and a 42% cumulative beta. Strong deposit flows and a very successful auto loan collateralized borrowing program initiated during the quarter contributed to reducing FHLB levels by about $7 billion. Given our BSO objectives, we grew deposits, which drove a favorable mix-shift away from wholesale funding. As a result, our total cost of funds was relatively well-behaved up 38 basis points. Next, I'll move to Slide 11 to highlight the strength of our deposit franchise. With 67% of our deposits skewed toward consumer and highly-diversified across product mix and channels, we are able to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in a rising rate environment. We increased the portion of our insured and secured deposits from 68% to 70% linked-quarter and when combined with our available liquidity of $79 billion, our available liquidity as a percentage of uninsured deposits increased to about 150% from around 120% in the first quarter. As rates grew another 25 basis points in the second quarter, we saw continued migration of lower-cost deposits to higher-yielding categories, primarily in commercial with noninterest bearing now representing about 23% of the book. This is back to pre-pandemic levels and should stabilize from here. Moving on to Slide 12. We saw a good credit results in retail again this quarter and higher charge-offs in commercial. Net charge-offs were 40 basis points, up 6 basis points linked-quarter, which reflects an increase in the general office segment of commercial real-estate, partly offset by a slight improvement in retail, primarily due to the strength in used-car values. Nonperforming loans are 79 basis points of total loans, up 15 basis points from the first quarter, reflecting an increase in general office, which tends to be lumpy. It's also worth noting that overall delinquencies were lower sequentially with retail and commercial both improving slightly. Retail delinquencies continue to remain favorable to historical levels. Turning to Slide 13, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We increased our allowance by $24 million, which includes a $41 million increase in CRE general office, even after covering charge-offs of $56 million. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.52%, which is a 5 basis points increase in the second quarter. The runoff of the noncore portfolio primarily auto, facilitated the reallocation of reserves to CRE. The reserve coverage in general office was increased to a strong 8%. On Slide 14, you'll see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level which we feel represent a fairly adverse scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns. As mentioned, we built our reserve for the general office portfolio to $313 million this quarter which represents coverage of 8%. In addition to running a number of stress scenarios across the general office portfolio, we continuously perform a detailed loan level analysis that takes into account property-specific details, such as location, building quality, operating performance and maturity. We have a very experienced CRE team more focused on managing the portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis and engaging in ongoing discussions with sponsors to work-through the property and borrower-specific elements to derisk the portfolio and ultimately minimize losses. Our reserves reflect this detailed view of the portfolio as well as the key macro factors we set out on the page. The property value, default rate and loss severity assumptions we are using to set the reserve, are adequate for the risks we currently see and are significantly more conservative than what we've seen in previous CRE downturns. It's worth noting that the financial impact of any further deterioration behind what we expect would be very manageable, given our strong reserve and capital position. On the following Slide 15, there are some additional disclosures we are providing this quarter to give more detail on the type and location of the general office portfolio. You can see out of the $3.9 billion general office portfolio, 94% is Class A or B with the majority in suburban areas, which seem to be performing better than central business districts. On the bottom left-hand side of the page, it highlights that the portfolio is quite diversified across geographies, as well as the top 10 MSAs, listed on the bottom right-hand side. Broadly for New York MSA, we are starting to see return to office trends picking-up and more than 80% of the portfolio was outside Manhattan where property dynamics tend to be more favorable. Washington DC is 100% class A&D and 95% suburban. Moving to Slide 16, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.3% as we look to add capital given the uncertain macro and regulatory environment. We returned a total of $461 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Turning to Slide 17. You'll see that our CET1 ratio is among the highest in our regional bank peer group. This strong capital level reflects a relatively conservative approach since the IPO in maintaining robust capital levels. If you incorporate the removal of AOCI opt-out, our adjusted CET1 ratio would be 0.5% and we also expect that this replace us near the top of our peer group again this quarter. We expect to maintain very strong capital levels going forward with the ability to generate roughly 20 basis points of CET1 ratio post-dividend each quarter in 2H '23 before share buybacks. So, as you see, we've been focused for a while and playing really strong defense with a focus on capital, liquidity, funding and maintaining a prudent credit risk appetite. And that's the job one. Even long before the turmoil we saw in the first quarter. But we also recognized the need to continue to play offense. We need to be selective, investing in initiatives that will grow the franchise where we have a right to win. Over the next few slides, I'll spotlight a few of the exciting things we're doing and ensure that we can deliver growth and strong returns for our shareholders. First, on Slides 19 and 20, we were excited to announce a few weeks back that we hired about 50 senior private bankers and 100 related support professionals who were with First Republic. As many of you know, for a number of years, we've had an interest in growing our wealth business, both organically and inorganically. So we made a number of investments on the organic side, hiring financial advisors and converting that business from a transactional business to a very customer-centric financial planning approach. That's been a slow and steady build over the years. And then we supplemented that with the Clarfeld acquisition a couple of years ago and that's gone incredibly well. So, with our customer-centric culture, our financial strength and the full range of products and services we offer, we were the perfect fit for these bankers. We really admire their approach to delivering the bank to their customers in a unique way with white glove service. This is really a coast-to-coast team with a presence in some of our key markets like New York, Boston, and places where we'd like to do more like, Florida and California. In fact, we think the overlap with JMP in San Francisco is extremely complementary. These bankers serve the types of customers we are seeking to attract to the bank, high and ultra-high-net-worth individuals and families, often the strong connections to middle-market companies with a particular focus on private equity and venture capital firms, serving the innovation economy. We have a great deal of work ahead of us to integrate these teams and ensure that they are positioned to deliver that bank to their clients. We plan to open a few private banking centers in key geographies and build appropriate scale in our wealth business with Clarfeld as the centerpiece of that effort. We think this is going to be extremely attractive from a financial perspective. These teams and their staff, about 150 people in total, on-boarded late in the second quarter with revenue begin to ramp in the fourth quarter. Financial impact for the second half will be $0.08 to $0.10 of EPS plus an initial notable cost of about $0.03 for 2023. These bankers have hit the ground running and are out-working to build their book of business and we expect the effort to breakeven around the middle of 2024. By 2025, we expect EPS accretion of roughly 5% with 2025 year end projections of about $9 billion in loans, $11 billion of deposits and $10 billion of assets under management. So overall, a very exciting advance for us. Now let's go to Slide 21, and I'll walk you through how we'll be managing our balance sheet over the next few years. Since the IPO, we're prudently growing our balance sheet while managing the mix of assets and funding with an eye towards maximizing returns. With the increase in rates since the end of 2021, plus the advent of quantitative tightening and more recently, the heightened competition for deposits, we are entering the next stage of the journey with a plan to focus on attractive relationship lending, while lowering our LDR, which will improve our liquidity profile and benefit returns. In order to make this effort clear and show the benefits we expect, we've established a $14 billion non-core portfolio which is comprised of our $10 billion shorter duration indirect auto portfolio and lower relationship purchased customer loans - consumer loans. This portfolio will run down fairly quickly with about $9 billion of run-off expected by the end of 2025. Moving to Slides 22 and 23, you'll see that as the non-core loan portfolio runs down, this allows us to pay down higher-cost funding and redeploy capital into more strategic lending and our investment portfolio. We will also be growing relationship-based lending to the private bank and raising deposits to self-fund that growth. Despite the size of the run-off portfolio, we expect to see modest loan growth in 2024, picking up in 2025, driven by opportunities across retail and C&I as well as our private bank effort. The net result of these actions is an improved liquidity profile with a better loan and funding mix and higher returns. Next on Slide 24, a quick update on our entry into New York Metro where some really exciting things are happening. With the branch conversions behind us, we are full steam ahead working to serve our customers and capitalize on opportunities. We continue to be encouraged by our early success. We've seen strong sales in the branches as we leverage our full customer service capabilities to drive some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in their network. Most importantly, we have seen a steady improvement in our Net Promoter Scores. On the commercial banking side, we've got a strong new leadership team in place with local talent joining from larger firms and we are seeing some early success leveraging our new visibility to build pipelines with middle-market firms. And we are looking forward to what we can do with our new private banking capabilities in the market. On Slide 25, we have a great opportunity to build on Citizens Access, our national digital platform that has been focused on deposits for the last few years. We moved to a modern fully cloud-based core platform and we are trying to add checking capabilities later this year. Down the road, we plan to converge our legacy core system with this modern platform. We are confident that a single integrated platform will be more cost-efficient and flexible in meeting our client's needs. We aim for this to be a complete digital bank experience to serve customers nationwide with a focus on the young mass-affluent market segment. And on the right side of the page is CitizensPay where we have been very innovative in creating distinctive ways to serve customers. CitizensPay has been the top customer acquisition engine for the bank with very high promoter scores and this has been a great performer from a credit perspective. We have some fantastic partners on the platform for a while, such as Apple, Microsoft, Best Buy, BJ's and Vivint. And we are always very excited to welcome new partners like Peloton, Tre, The Tile Shop and Wisetack to platform. On Slide 26, I'll highlight how we are positioned to support the significant growth in private capital. Over the last several years, private capital fundraising had led - has led to record deal formation, M&A activity and substantial fees. The activity has been relatively muted recently and many sponsors have not deployed meaningful amounts of capital. So there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for M&A and capital markets activity. We have been executing a consistent strategy to serve the sponsor community with distinctive capabilities for the last 10 years and we've done a great job moving up to the top of the sponsor lead tables, particularly in the middle market. We have made significant investments in talent and capabilities, including five advisory acquisitions since 2017. And our new private bankers significantly expand our sponsor relationships and capabilities. Our success supporting private capital has been a large part of our strong capital markets performance over the last few years and we are poised to capitalize on the next wave of sponsor activity as the path of the economy becomes clearer. Let's move to Slide 27 for an update on our TOP program. Our latest TOP 8 program is well underway and progressing well. Given the external environment, we have decided to augment the program to protect returns as well as ensure that we can continue to make the important investments in our business to drive future performance. We have increased our targeted benefit by $15 million to $115 million by accelerating some of our other efforts and to further rationalize our branch network and reduce procurement costs. We have also begun planning for our TOP 9 program, looking for efficiency opportunities driven by further automation and the use of AI to better serve our customers. We are also looking at ways to simplify our organization and find even more savings in procurement. Continuous improvement is part of our DNA and I'm very confident that we'll continue to deliver these benefits to the bank. Moving to Slide 28, I'll walk through the outlook for the second quarter for Citizens, which excludes the impact of the Private Bank and I will also provide some comments for the full year. The outlook takes into account another rate increase, followed by Fed on hold for the remainder of this year. For the third quarter, we expect NII to decrease about 4%. Noninterest income to be up by approximately 3%. Net interest expense should be broadly stable. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable to up slightly. Our CET1 is expected to rise modestly from 10.3% with additional share repurchases planned, which will depend upon our ongoing assessment of the external environment. Relating to the full year, our liquidity position is quite strong and given the BSO actions I discussed earlier, we will continue to build on this, targeting an LDR of low-to mid-80s by the end of the year, positioning us well for anticipated regulatory changes. Worth noting we are already - we already are fully LDR compliant with Category 3 bank requirements. Based on the forward curve, we are expecting a terminal interest-bearing deposit beta of 49% to 50%. Our net interest margin should begin to stabilize in Q4 as the Fed is expected to reach the end of the rate hike cycle. We are off to a great start of drilling up the private bank, and we expect the EPS impact of this to be $0.06 in the third quarter and $0.02 to $0.04 in the fourth quarter. So we really think of this as a capital investment. To wrap up, our results were solid for the quarter as we continue to navigate a turbulent external environment. We are focused on positioning the company with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position, which will serve us well as we continue to navigate a challenging environment ahead. Our balance sheet strength also positions us very well to focus on our strategic priorities to continue to strengthen the franchise for the future and deliver attractive returns. With that, I'll hand back over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thanks, John. Alan, let's open it up for some Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Van Saun, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the conference call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Go ahead.
Scott Siefers: Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question is just on the sort of accretion to the margin from the balance sheet optimization. Do you have a sense for what sort of steady-state margin from Citizens might look like after that is completed. I guess, it doesn't necessarily have to be a specific number, but just in your view how powerful is that accretion from these activities? And I appreciate that sort of the backdrop of the 4.2% yield versus the 5.5% funding costs.
John Woods: Yes, I'll go ahead and start off. Thanks for the question. I mean, I think, broadly, we're seeing the impact of the rate environment on our net interest margin. We're managing it quite well as the Fed is continuing on its hiking cycle. And as you get into the end of the year, taking into consideration all of the balance sheet optimization activities, we see NIM flattening out and kind of holding it around 3% or so, as you get to the end of the year. The tailwinds from balance sheet optimization are meaningful and will continue to build into '24 and so those are the big drivers there, I think that also contributing to that NIM stability would be the fact that we think that balance sheet migration is starting to stabilize. And also you can ignore the fact that the Private Bank itself as you get out into '24, would start to deliver accretive NIM. So we're feeling good about the profile after we get through this last hikes from the Fed here in July, watching that NIM starts to stabilize as you get into the end of the year.
Scott Siefers: Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then is it possible to put sort of a finer point on the, I guess 8% to 10% - pardon me, $0.08 to $0.10 of cumulative expected EPS drag from the Private Bank initiatives. Certainly appreciate the sort of the loan and deposit in asset management or assets under management outlooks, but maybe any broad sense dollar value of expected revenues and expenses as we look into the second half.
John Woods: Yes. And it's a little bit front-end loaded as the expenses will come in and drive probably more in the neighborhood of $0.06 of that $0.08 to $0.10 happening in third quarter with $0.02 to $0.04 really into the fourth quarter. And it's primarily expenses in the neighborhood of $40 million or so, as you get into the 3Q and 4Q and but the loan book starts to build later this quarter and into 4Q. So that gives you the front-end loaded of that $0.08 to $0.10 into 3Q.
Bruce Van Saun: The one thing I would say to that, Scott, it's Bruce, is, this is a very sound approach to scaling up the wealth business. We've been looking for acquisition ideas and it's been very expensive with very long tangible book value earn backs, many times would be over five years, which is beyond our appetite. So to actually do this in a kind of de novo build-up basis, you incur some capital expense in the short run, but it's almost the same as if you kind of equate it to an outlays that ultimately starts to generate revenues. And the nice thing about this is that it's accretive already in the second year and kind of earn-back on this thing is under two years. So we look at it really less as a driver of how does it affect the near-term EPS. But look, there is a capital outlay, which we burn some expense dollars to get it off the ground and then all of a sudden, it's making us money and it really ramps very nicely and can achieve something like a 5% accretion in 2025, which is kind of within 2.5 years, in the second year of doing a deal If you compare that to some of the other transactions that we've done, including the bank acquisitions, it's pretty darn powerful. So very excited about this opportunity.
Scott Siefers: Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Go ahead.
Erika Najarian: Hi, good morning. John, I was just wondering if you can help us with lots of moving pieces that's sort of unfurling in front of us. So, just I guess, the first question is, you noted stability in the 3% - at the 3% level. Does that mean that fourth quarter 2024 will be at about the third quarter level? I'm just wondering sort of how those dynamics play out in terms of what you expect to the - how the balance sheet trend for the rest of the year or those sort of the run-off continue to pressure it at that level and what does that fourth quarter NII about look like from a range perspective.
John Woods: Yes. I mean, I think from the NIM standpoint, you're talking about '23, just confirming, Erika, is that - 
Erika Najarian: '23. And building out of '24 fund.
John Woods: Yes, no, you referenced '24. But the answer is actually a little bit similar, but what we do see is, after the Fed hikes here in July and that the impact of that burns in in the third quarter that we do see NIM flattening out there between 3Q and 4Q, having a more flat profile as you get into the end of the year around 3%. So maybe a touch higher in 3Q net interest margin, but seeing that profile begin to flatten out and I think the key drivers of that, the pieces in parts as I mentioned, we're starting to see the deceleration in deposit migration, the negative deposit migration. So that's a good early green shoot, that's consistent with the fact that our DDA levels are basically where we were back to pre-pandemic. And so that ends up being at an expected landing zone as you get into the end-of-the year. So we'll see that flattening out. You'll see the tailwinds from this - from the runoff block starting to kick in, the reallocation of that capital and liquidity into relationship lending and the ability to pay-down some higher-cost funding as you get into the end of the year. And so that starts to bolster net interest margin, which we do think carries into '24, and we think that there are a number of positive developments in '24 that would allow us to hold that NIM out into even beyond the fourth quarter.
Bruce Van Saun: And I would comment, Erika, that this was a really important quarter for us to kind of get the deposit level where we wanted to get the Fed - the Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings lower and really take a big step in lowering the LVR. And so we paid up a little bit to achieve that and the impact of that full quarter effects the third quarter guide, but I think at this point, we feel that we don't need to continue to really aggressively grow deposits. We can have a more stable deposit profile. As John indicated, less migration from non-interest bearing to interest-bearing and so there won't be kind of a full quarter impact of an aggressive plan that affects Q4 from Q3, because we'll be kind of looking at a more stable profile in Q3.
Erika Najarian: Got it. And so, thank you for that, Bruce. So, as I think about the fourth quarter, is it fair then to say that your guidance implies NII of $1.52 billion for the third quarter, so do we assume that we're at or around that range for the fourth quarter and as we think about the puts and takes of 2024 and John, I have to bring this up because few investors were noting - I think now at Slide 31, where you have some swaps rolling-off that have very heavy weighted-average fixed rate that you're receiving. So as I think about $1.52 billion perhaps is a starting point plus or minus, I assume that the - your guide were down 100 basis points. NII for the full year down 1.2%, it's still valid if we assume rate cuts next year and includes those swap roll-off. So that's sort of the first question. And the second is, how does balance sheet optimization impact that sensitivity? So I'm assuming that's extraordinarily static. So - and I'm assuming that's from - both sides are paying off more debt next year as you were waiting for these loans to come on and then - as you wait for these loans, you're also putting it in higher-yielding in cash. So, if you could just help us think through the moving pieces as it relates to that original disclosure because I think investors are thinking about the potential for rate cuts next year.
John Woods: Yes. Maybe I'll just start off in a couple of areas. Just when you think about NII, similar numbers that you're throwing out there are probably a little lighter than where we will see them come out. I think our NII be a little better than that and into fourth quarter, I think we have some opportunities to - if interest earning assets are going to be stabilized, as Bruce indicated and net interest margin stabilized, so we think the NII has also stabilized at that solid levels. So that was I think the first question that you had. I mean I think the - 
Bruce Van Saun: Just to put a point on that too is, any swap impacts are in our forward guide, Erika. So we've already contemplated that. So there's nothing and they didn't really move. We didn't do any adjustments in the second quarter, so.
John Woods: Yes, there is a very limited adjustments. Things do roll-off and come on, but broadly, our asset sensitivity profile was pretty stable quarter-over-quarter, meaning we are - we were still asset sensitive. So a rate rise, which we're about to get from the Fed does actually contribute to NII and net interest margin for us. So from that perspective, all of that has been built into the commentary that we've been giving you in terms of swap roll-off and our ongoing positive asset sensitivity. Again, when you get - when you think about net interest margin over kind of the next several quarters, we have a number of tailwinds. You've got flattening out non-interest-bearing migration. So that's no longer expected to be a big headwind. You've got the run-off book that we talked about and that runoff book is going to be rotated into relationship lending at higher yields. So the runoff - 
Bruce Van Saun: Paying off high-cost debt.
John Woods: And paying down high cost funding, right, so which - where we have a negative kind of spread situation there. We already mentioned the fact that the Private Bank is going to start contributing to the balance sheet later this year and that the net interest margin on that is actually accretive to the overall legacy bank. I think, throughout there is that, just front book back book dynamics, where you basically have originations in the front book. Just in the securities portfolio alone, there's 300 basis points positive front book, back book in terms of - we're actually creating a bigger security stock, but we're doing at the right time where securities yields are actually historically quite favorable. And so we're putting a lot of way from that standpoint. And we're seeing back into the loan book, spreads on our front book originations are higher than they were. And for example in C&I, spreads are up 50 basis points over the last year, year-over-year. So that's also a tailwind and all those things are the things that are going to help us manage the fact that - manage the rate environment and the other items that we have -- 
Bruce Van Saun: So I think what John described, Erika, is a number of tailwinds that should be positive. So if the Fed is cutting next year, that potentially is a negative, but we have these positive things to offset that, which gives us kind of that stable view on the NIM into '24.
Erika Najarian: Got it. And just to wrap it up, just because I got a few emails to clarify and I'll step aside. It sounds like you're sensitivity hasn't changed or whatever that fourth quarter number is, which is stable to the third quarter, that down 1.2% on down 100 is still valid, but then the balance sheet optimization will get you closer to stable despite Fed cuts.
John Woods: Yes, agree. So balance sheet optimization plus the fact that when if rates were - rates begin to fall, if they do, we don't have that happening in the fourth quarter by the way. We have that happening in '24. We have the Fed on-hold for the rest of the year and we have the Fed just based on the forward curve, right, having the Fed ending around 4% in '24. So it's really until '24, where you see those down rate scenarios. And in the down rate scenario, I mean, that's where deposit betas start working for you rather than against you. And so, then you start getting some of that coming in as well as the fixed loan portfolio that creates a buffer when rates start to fall and so I would just add those two things to all the other tailwinds I already articulated as to why we feel like we could hold the stable NIM.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I'll just close and you got an extended period of time here, Erika, and we're very interested in NII and NIM, which I'm sure is on a lot of investors' minds. But, kind of bigger picture is, we're kind of transitioning the loan book to things that are more strategic and offer better returns on capital and better opportunities for cross-selling deepening with customers. And so we're kind of working through a transition period this year and even into next year. It's a little hard to give you full guidance at this point, given a lot of uncertainty still in the market. We're giving you our best instincts at this point on that. But I feel quite confident that as we kind of emerge through '24 and then even look out to '25, that - kind of, with the lift-off of this Private Bank effort and the kind of run-down of these less strategic portfolios that we're going to get a lot of benefit from this and we're really poised to do quite well, I think looking out into kind of back-half of '24 into '25.
Erika Najarian: Yes, Bruce that Private Bank lift-out is a bold move. I think everybody just wanted to figure out what that run rate look like and I think this conversation we just had, clarified that run rate. So, thank you.
Bruce Van Saun: Sure.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.
Nathan Stein: Hi, good morning. This is Nate Stein on behalf of Matt O'Connor. Just one question from me. So the capital build was good this quarter with the CET1 rising to 10.3% from 10% and guidance calls for this increase again in 3Q. Just wanted to ask how high are you willing to let the ratio get to?
Bruce Van Saun: I think - it's Bruce. I think, by the end of the year, we could see it getting to 10.5% which is a bit above our stated range have been 9.5% to 10%. I think given all the uncertainty that's out there in the economy plus direction of travel from regulators, that managing it up like that is sensible. Having said that, we're still generating quite good returns, which gives us the ability to kind of nudge that up from here in terms of the ratio, but also repurchase our stock, which we think is great value at the current pricing. So that's how we're looking at it. And then, as we go through 2024 at this point, our early thoughts would be kind of more of the same that we can at least hold that 10.5% and maybe build on it based on what we see from regulators. But we have the wherewithal to be in the market buying our stock on a consistent basis and holding or building that ratio further.
Nathan Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go ahead.
Gerard Cassidy: Good morning, Bruce. Good morning, John.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi, Gerard.
Gerard Cassidy: Bruce and John, can you guys share with us, obviously, Vice Chair Barr came out with a speech last week talking about RWA increases that will lead to higher capital levels for all banks over $100 billion in assets. Have you guys given some thought on where this could be - where you could be most impacted by the new Basel 3 Endgame that maybe will come out next week. And then second, as part of this, this week Bloomberg reported that there may even be some RWA increases for residential mortgages which really hasn't been discussed. And how are you guys approaching, what could be coming possibly as soon as next week?
Bruce Van Saun: Let me start up. Quickly flip it to John. But, clearly, I would say there's mixed views on whether that's - sound proposal at this point and I think the industry itself - liquidity itself very well through the pandemic, through this period of turmoil in the first half of the year and I think many folks have commented that the industry has strong capital and so in response to three idiosyncratic bank failures, is it appropriate that the thing that needs to be fixed is more capital in the banking system.  I don't know. I question whether that's appropriate, and we'll see how it plays out. I think there'll be lots of dialogue around that. I think from our standpoint, by moving our capital position higher, we're anticipating any of what could come down the pike is something that we can absorb. We're in a very strong position relative to our SCB, which, by the way, we still have some questions about how it landed where it did but nonetheless we're well above that. And we're well above if the AOCI filter goes away, we already have sufficient capital to meet our new propose SCB. So we're in a position of strength, Gerard. I think we can still deliver the kind of returns we aspire to over time as we get through this transition period and hit our medium-term financial targets. But I would kind of at least comment that I'm not sure that that's the answer when we had a series of management supervisory failures and poor asset liability management. That really was the problem that caused this term off, not a lack of capital in the banking system. So I'll get off my soapbox and I'll pass it over to John.
JohnWoods: Yes, I agree with all of that. And I think the issue is in credit RWA versus operational risk RWA, Gerard. So, I think there was the view that there would be some puts and takes on the credit risk RWA and maybe it wouldn't be much of an increase expected at the regional bank level, but I did see - we did see those reports on residential mortgages. We'll see how it all plays out. But on the operational risk side of things, with a complex fee-based sort of businesses are where a lot of that is directed and it's not just - we don't have much of exposure - as much of exposure to that as maybe some other banks in the industry do. So broadly we felt like that we would be impacted possibly a little less than most and we're sitting with capital a little more than most. So from that perspective, we feel pretty well-positioned for the uncertainty of the regulatory. We are making process and as you heard from Bruce, we're growing capital into the end of the year and I think a 10 - something in the neighborhood of 10.5% CET1 is a pretty strong mitigant to anything that might come down the road from the Fed.
Gerard Cassidy: Great, thank you, guys.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead.
Ken Usdin: Hi, thanks, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the strategic remixing and wondering, can you give us some color on the types of loans and deposits that you think will come over as part of that - those new hires in the Private Bank. I mean, obviously, the First Republic mix have been kind of low-rate mortgages and high-rate CDs. I would expect that not the type of NIM you're looking to be adding. So just wondering just - what those producers you are expecting to bring over and also kind of we could see it in your AUM expectation, but it looks like it will be more NII delivering as opposed to fees.
Bruce Van Saun: Turn that over to Brendan.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes, so, we are really excited obviously about this initiative and it's a very strategic acceleration of our Wealth Management business. But to your point, it does come with scaling up the bank as well while we are aiming to recreate a lot of the customer experience magic that existed in these private banking models. We're going to make some structural changes to make sure that the profile of the business that we get is accretive at the top of the house. So what you can expect from us is disciplined credit pricing that while will be competitive, we're not going to kind of lead with undercutting the market and pricing to make sure we have the right margin. We will have an incredibly disciplined credit appetite. We don't expect to take a step forward or step in the wrong direction in terms of credit risk profile. In fact, we think this will enhance the credit risk profile with very low-risk loan generation. We are going to ensure that we're driving lendable deposits on the balance sheet that we put out relative to the Private Bank that we're getting core operating deposits, whether that's from individuals or from businesses. It's really important that we maintain a sound liquidity position in this growth. And lastly, from a compensation perspective, we're going to rationalize the compensation model the best we can within the confines of a private bank to ensure that those - the combination of those factors give us a return profile that can be accretive at the top of the house on overall ROE, but also on things like NIM. So the balance sheet on the deposit side, certainly we have the mix of cash management operating deposits as well as interest-bearing. But we are going to heather all relationships to being primary banking, whether it's corporate or whether it's personal. So you could expect low cost DDA to be mixed in with interest-bearing for a healthy profile primary banking relationships. On the asset side, I'd say we're expecting about a 50/50 mix, what I would call sort of consumer personal retail lending and small-business and corporate lending. And on the personal lending side, really the large asset classes are going to be mortgage, home equity, and eventually partner loan program, where we are putting capital to individuals to engage as a partner and a higher-end consulting firm or private-equity firm, very traditional low-risk assets. But this lodges the operating deposits and ultimately lead you to AUM. And on the business side, as mentioned earlier, the profile of the team we got over, does have a bent towards the innovation economy. So we're expecting capital call line lending to dislodge operating deposit relationships with private equity and venture. And small segment where it's appropriate relationship-wise on potentially multifamily in a very-high credit environment where we can also secure the personal wealth relationship. All of our balance sheet usage will be oriented around full end-to-end customer relationships that include deposits and ultimately AUM growth. So it's a very integrated end-to-end business model and we feel like we've got the right recreation of the service strategy, married with the right corrections to the business model to ensure we get better profitability and also a stable business model that can withstand the test of time. If that - we think we can get a really good growth around this, but we will control the growth with a guardrail of adequate profile of the business that will be healthy and profitable over the long haul.
Ken Usdin: Great color. Thank you, Brendan. And just one more question on the other side of the BSO. John, obviously talking a lot about the consumer side of the non-core portfolio here. Can you just dig and just let us know, you previously had done a lot on the commercial portfolio. And I'm just wondering, have you done any key currently deep diving into the CRE book, as you've talked about on the credit side. What might there still be to do on the commercial side of the portfolio in terms of BSO from that perspective. Thanks.
John Woods: Yes. I mean, I think, and as you know in this portfolio that we set up, that's - it's entirely a retail portfolio in terms of that $14 billion, but there are nevertheless in parallel BSO activity is continuing in the commercial side, and let Don talk about that.
DonMcCree: Yes, so we've been at this for probably three or four years now as we just grown out relationships where we haven't been able to achieve across all that we've thought we have been achieved when we were going into the credit, several years ago. So it's really an ongoing effort. It's been running about $1 billion a year, and we probably will be running about that same pace. The good news is we've been able to replace some of that with growth in places like New York Metro, where we see a good amount of opportunity on a full wallet basis, particularly in the middle market, as we bring on these new hires. On the CRE side, as everybody knows, there is not a lot of liquidity, but there is some liquidity and we're actually moving some of our exposures after the agencies and then do some private capital also. So we'll try to liquefy CRE, particularly multifamily over the next couple of quarters, couple of years to the best we can bring those overall exposures down, even though they're performing pretty well.
Ken Usdin: Good. Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Go ahead.
John Pancari: Good morning. Just on the capital side, I heard you in terms of the CET1 trajectory from here, and that it does still allow for some repurchases. Maybe could you help us frame out what's a reasonable pace of buybacks we should assume which is similar to $250 million that you did this quarter?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I would say that is something we felt comfortable with in Q3. We were going through the Q2. We were going through the CCAR process at the time, but we saw the opportunity to build kind of have our cake and needed to build the ratio while also repurchasing shares and I think we'll still be in that position. So we still have noncore kind of rundown working for us, which is releasing RWAs. So you should again have a chance to somewhat - have your cake and needed to both in Q3 and Q4.
John Pancari: Okay, thank you, Bruce. And then on the non-interest bearing mix stabilizing at the 23% near the 2Q level. Now what gives you confidence in the stabilization? I know you mentioned that you're not pushing as aggressively. You don't see the need to now on competition on pricing, is there anything that will beyond that in terms of depositor behavior that you're beginning to see that gives you that confidence that this is where it's bottoming?
John Woods: Yes, I think there's two items that we look at. One is just the - as we are getting back to the historical place that the platform generated noninterest-bearing pre-pandemic, and so that's been sort of a foundational spot that we think creates some solidify of the operating accounts in both retail and consumer. So that's one really important spot. So around that 23% level is about how we see it. And then the second item is that, in the second quarter, we started to see some deceleration for the first time in several quarters. We started to see the turn and deposits kind of migration decelerating. And then we have a number of, I would say activities on the product and low-cost strategy front that we're seeing some really positive uptick on in retail, in particular, and so - 
Bruce Van Saun: Let's ask Brendan to pick up and add some color.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes, couple of quick points, just a quick recall, as we've talked over the last bunch of quarters. The consumer portfolio has been under a five-six year transformation for quite some time and it's in a very, very different starting points through the beginning of the cycle than ever before for this franchise with significant improvements in things like customer primary - primacy growth and households, or mass-affluent mix has improved and low-cost deposit profile has moved up. So coming into the cycle, we were very confident that we'd be more pure like or maybe outperform and data that we're seeing with benchmarking suggested in the consumer bank, we are indeed better-than-average versus peers right now on all the mentions interest-bearing cost, beta, as well as low-cost control. So we feel pretty good how we're performing against peers, it is starting to stabilize. So the excess surge deposits have burned down maybe by about 60%, so there's still a little bit out there. But a lot of those are starting to be sticky and turn into wealth creation. If you dissect the various different segments, the wealthier segment is still having some modest outflows of rotation into interest-bearing as well as rotation outside of the banking industry. So year-over-year the wealthier segment is down about 10%. We're seeing the mass-affluent segment in deposits on a per customer basis about flat and the mass-market portfolio has actually increased in net deposits and that's a function of a lot of our strategies that we put in place to really drive primacy and activity and engagement. And so we've seen a bit of a bottoming at the lower end in terms of DDA balances. What we have done to drive that is a lot of product innovation. So we did things like get your paycheck two days early. It doesn't seem like a big deal, it's actually an incredibly big deal. That's driving a lot of primary banking behavior. We've got technology we put in place that when you open a new DDA, you're automatically porting over your direct deposit that seems very operationally oriented. But it actually is a dramatic improvement that things like primary banking behavior which drives low-cost deposits. We've made overdraft perform through our Peace of Mind 24-Hour Grace program and a variety of other things, which has also driven a lot of primacy and we're starting to really rev up the engines on household growth. Overall, all of those things contribute to some controllable. So we're - I think we're outperforming peers on the market, given our starting point in the cycle and we're continuing to invest to try to further outperform through all of these different initiatives and strategies. It is the long game. These are driving primacy in low-cost deposits. It takes a while to build up scale, but I feel like we've got a lot of the right things in place in addition to outperforming on our back-book to win the game uncontrollable where we're at right now.
John Pancari: So, well, your two-thirds of the deposit base and have all these great strategies you have done. You've also been investing in payments capabilities and some new products like sustainable deposits. Maybe you could just offer a brief comment.
Don McCree: Yes, that's right. I mean, we've been broadening out our deposit base quite nicely and as Bruce said, it's a combination of just the growth in the cash management business overall and bringing on more clients on the cash management side. As I said, in New York Metro, the things that we're adding are really full wallet for cash management relationships and those bring really nice deposits. And then on the product side, we've done a lot around green deposits and carbon offsets deposits in our ESG strategy that was approved to be quite profitable. We've built out escrow products and bankruptcy products. So there's a variety of product development things which are attracting nice operating deposits with some nice breadth for them.
Bruce Van Saun: Right. Thank you.
John Pancari: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.
Manan Gosalia: Hi, good morning, I appreciate all the detail on the office book. It looks like you have a pretty conservative assumption baked into your CRE office reserve levels of 8%. What - I guess the question is, what would you need to see to take that up even more. Or over the next few quarters, as some of your office portfolio comes up for renewal, should we expect the reserve levels go down as you have more normalized NCOs in that portfolio?
Bruce Van Saun: Let me start. And John or Don can add. But we feel quite good about A), the overall nature of what we have, and B) then - so there's good diversification, good quality characteristics. We have some really good people that are really focused hard on this and they are monitoring this loan-by-loan. They see the upcoming maturities to get way in front of those. So we're having good dialog with borrowers. And I'd say, we did a good job - relatively good job in the first half of absorbing some of maturities. Probably about 30 loans, I think came up for maturity, which is about the number that we're going to have in the second half and it's about the number that we're going to have in the first half of next year. It's about the number that we're going to have in the fourth quarter and next year. And if you look at the net result of that, while we have an increase in criticized, we have an increase this quarter was a little lumpy in NPAs in this sector and that probably levels off. I'd say, we were able to build our reserve and absorb charge-offs. So we took $56 million in charge-offs. So that's another kind of 1.5% loss content. If you look at the 8%, it's effectively higher while what we just absorbed. And so, could we go for another few quarters with absorbing charge-offs on a pay-as-you-go basis with what we're providing and hold the reserve flat? Yes, possibly, that could happen. And then at some point, does that tip over and then you don't need as much reserves because you burned some of those losses through your charge-off line. So anybody, that's just a little color about how we think about it, John. I don't know if you want to add anything to go direct to Don.
John Woods: Yes. I'll just reiterate the fact that, as you mentioned, we took $56 million, that's a 1.5%. So that - we've got 8.5% - we got 8% set-aside, so that implies a 9.5% coverage for the losses through the cycle and we think that's pretty darn adequate, matter of fact, very strong. And so, I think that - as you also mentioned NPLs flattening out and charge-offs kind of getting in the run-rate rather than step-change from here which I think is important to reemphasize. And maybe just turn it over to Don.
Don McCree: I think you guys have said it was 26 loans, so you're pretty close to the 30. That's pretty good that you know that. But I think the thing I'd emphasize is we've literally gone through every single loan one by one. Everyone is different. It's property-specific, it's MSA-specific, it's rental-specific, its sponsor-specific. And we're just seeing - we're starting to see outcomes. And outcomes are a property gets extended and renegotiated with the sponsor. You might have a little bit of equity injected to improve interest carry, and you might charge it off. So - and I think that we have a pretty good eye to the path of the book as we look forward. And things could always change, but I think we feel pretty comfortable that we've been very conservative based on what we see. And I will emphasize, I mean, we're not originating anything really of any scale and origination. So our whole origination team, in addition to our credit team, in addition to our work path team, is focused on working with our sponsors to basically - 
Bruce Van Saun: In the office sector.
Don McCree: In the office sector, yes. And the rest - by the way, the rest of the real estate, both multifamily and industrial data centers, I think, it looks like it's holding up extremely well. We're really not seeing any weakness that concerns us at all in the rest of those slip up.
Manan Gosalia: That's very helpful. Thanks for the fulsome answer. Just to move on to capital. Is there any color you can share on what drove the increase in the stress capital buffer this year? I know that mortgage was something that was a little bit of a headwind for the whole group, but any other information you glean from your conversations with the Fed. And then maybe what you need to do to bring that down in future years?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I - we haven't really had the full debrief. So we are getting that set up so we can go through and kind of understand their models better. I think that's been one of the concerns of the industry that it's not that transparent to us. But kind of when we look at the results, there's a couple of things that could have been a factor. So one is the build of the allowance when we took relatively high charge-offs we had a significant build was built into their models, which we didn't have in our models. And that alone probably cost us 30 basis points of a 60% increase or something like that. So that's one thing that we'll want to talk about and understand better. And then questions about we did a deal and did the onetime expenses get incorporated or we've done a lot of hedging in the falling rate scenario are our hedges getting full benefit. So we just have some questions that we want to poke at. But in any case, I think the bigger point here is that we can roll with this 8.5% and we have plenty of capital, and we have an appreciable buffer versus that capital. So it really doesn't affect kind of our capital management strategies. But we would like to see it get kind of back into line. We think it's a bit elevated relative to where it should be, and we'll be having those conversations with the Fed in the coming weeks.
John Woods: Yes. I think that as you get past this year, where we have those integration expenses, and there's a hypothesis that, but that will roll off as you get into next year. And we'll have another bite at the apple next year given the fact that we're going to be doing this again. And in the end, the SCB is not our constraint. Our constraint is our own view of what capital we need to be prudent to support our business. And frankly, where the Fed and the regulators are headed with required kind of levels outside of the SCB is going to be our constraint. So we're going to be, as Bruce mentioned earlier, about 200 basis points over the SCB by the end of the year and probably heading towards earlier compliance with whatever the Fed comes out within most. So we're feeling pretty darn good about the capital position, notwithstanding the SCB.
Manan Gosalia: Got it. And the BSO should have a positive impact on your risk-weighted assets. Should that also have a positive impact on the SCB?
John Woods: No, it will - it might. I mean, I think more importantly, it will - it gives us flexibility to rotate RWA capital into relationship lending and return that capital. To the extent that those front book opportunities are not there, we probably have the opportunity to do both, where we rotate that capital into relationship lending and provide an ability to buy back. It doesn't have a direct impact on the SCB.
Manan Gosalia: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja. Go ahead.
Vivek Juneja: Hi, thank you. Just a follow-up on the First Republic banker question. Bruce, Brendon, would requirements do you - what are your pricing assumptions? You said you're trying to bring the pricing to yours, but then what are the assumptions for what the bankers need to deliver to be able to recoup their - or earn their guarantees? And secondly, given that this was a white glove service, which is obviously very expensive, what changes are you planning to make to that to be able to get to your hurdle profitability targets?
Brendan Coughlin: Yes. Yes, thanks for the question. We already, prior to the lift-out of the private bankers, had a relationship-based pricing in play in all of our asset classes, including mortgage. So when you bring heavy levels of deposits in AUM, we price down modestly for that. So we don't have any intention of changing what we already do. And so our new private bankers will have access to the same relationship pricing grids that we've had in play for a while. So as you think about pricing and yields of things like mortgages or even some of the small business commercial lending, we're not expecting a dramatic different profile in terms of profitability or yields from legacy Citizens in how we operate the business to make sure that we're considering the full relationship and that we're really competitive in pricing. But we're not undercutting the market by a material amount that will deteriorate either lending return - 
Bruce Van Saun: And I think the corollary to that is that the teams that came over understand that.
Brendan Coughlin: They do.
Bruce Van Saun: So I'd say the one thing that they won't have in their arsenal is deeply discounted mortgages. But I think they come in with their eyes wide open on that. And quite honestly, the deeply discounted mortgages are probably now back on your balance sheet because people aren't refinancing those at a good clip. So they'll probably sit there for a long time. But anyway, we will kind of do business in a commercial way. And again, the bigger the relationship, the better the pricing generally. And so I think the team coming over is very comfortable with that.
Brendan Coughlin: And another question around expenses, implied in the comments that John and Bruce both made around breakevens inside of 2024 is the team's production covering kind of TOP guarantees to come over. So we've been really thoughtful about how we do that. But obviously, we've got the way these folks get paid is on a book of business model. And they're going to go out and develop a lot of business, and we're going to give them the runway to do that. We had a lot of debate with them on the appropriate timing to make that happen and make sure the operations excellence is available here at Citizens. The cost of that is considered in all of our guidance and commentary we made about the profitability of the business. And we're already well underway on tinkering with the way the bank works to make sure we're creating the conditions for them.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And I'd say there, we probably had the brakes on a little bit to make sure that we get it to the level because you kind of get one shot with some of these customers. And so we've got a full effort on making sure that we get to the standards that we need. I would say one other silver lining from that also is that, that will help us up our game in customer experience more broadly, the kind of initiatives that we're taking to make sure that we make this a great experience. There'll be some things that spin off from that, that we can move to other parts of the bank, without a question.
Vivek Juneja: Okay. Thank you. And for a follow-up, just Don. Don, what are you seeing on the whole sponsor side given with high rates in the market? When - what level do you expect it to come back to even in '24, say, just given if rates stay high, yes, some cuts, but I don't think anybody is expecting it to go back to where we were 1.5 years ago? So any thoughts on what level of activity do you think we get back?
Don McCree: We'll see. High level, our pipelines are about 30% higher than they were at this time last quarter. So we're seeing the pipelines build. Sponsors are certainly engaging in conversations whether they can get to actual transactions or not, although there have been. Some there was a Worldpay transaction that was announced a few weeks ago. So we're beginning to see some transactions. Remember, one of the things that we benefit from, and I've said this a couple of quarters, is we tend to play in smaller deals, right? So we're $100 million to $750 million to $1 billion in terms of deal size, whether it be advisory or financing. We were number one in the middle-market leveraged finance league tables in the last quarter. Volumes were down, but we were the number one institution playing. So we're gaining share for what's available. So do I think we're going to be back to 2021 levels? No. But I think if you get stability in rates, it's the beginning of deal formation will happen, and it will just depend on valuation dynamics between sponsors and sellers. And there's just a lot of companies in our portfolio that just need to sell. They want to sell for generational leases. So there are things that are available, deals make it over-equitized just to keep the interest burden down if value doesn't come down. But we're starting to see a lot of conversations going. So I don't think we're going to be off to the races, but I think it's going to continually build. And I think '24 could be a pretty good year.
Vivek Juneja: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.
Bruce Van Saun: All right. Thanks, Alan, and thanks again, everyone, for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-19 09:45:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Citizens Financial Group First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Allan, and I will be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.
Kristin Silberberg: Thank you, Allan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our first quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our first quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page two of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it’s important to review our GAAP results on page three of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to you Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Hey. Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. First quarter many unexpected challenges in the environment. Nonetheless, we proved resilient and adaptable and we delivered a solid quarter for our stakeholders. We maintained a strong capital, liquidity and funding position with our CET1 ratio at 10%, our TCE ratio at 6.6% and a solid deposit franchise that skews two-thirds consumer. We have seen the churn in the deposit market continue to diminish since the bank failures with our deposits broadly stable in the month of March. For the quarter, we posted underlying earnings per share of $1.10 and return on tangible equity of 15.8%. Our NII was down 3%, reflecting day count impact, slightly lower earning assets and a stable net interest margin of 3.3%. Non-interest income and non-interest expense came in broadly as expected, both impacted by seasonality. Our credit metrics are also trending as expected and we built our ACL to loans ratio to 1.47%, which was up 4 basis points during the quarter and it’s 17 basis points higher than our pro forma day one CECL ACL ratio. We repurchased $400 million in shares during the quarter, which reduced our share count by 1.7%. In our slide deck, we tackle head on some of the industry issues that investors have been concerned about. I will let John run through the details, but the headline is that we have strong confidence in our capital, liquidity and funding position. We have been conservative in maintaining a capital ratio near the top of our peer group in focusing on a stable consumer oriented and granular deposit base, and in establishing a prudent credit risk appetite and reserve level. While we had some commercial real estate exposure, we feel good about our diversification, the asset characteristics and the borrower quality. CRE criticized assets and workouts will increase during the cycle, but we currently expect losses to be manageable and we have already set aside meaningful reserves. On the regulatory front, it is clear that some changes will occur. Our hope is that the response is thoughtful and appropriate, leaving the bank landscape that has served our country so well intact and even stronger than before. In any case, we anticipate any changes will follow a review and comment process with any provisions likely to be phased in gradually. While much of the past month has been focused on playing strong defense, we continue to play prudent offense by investing in and advancing our strategic initiatives. We will clearly prioritize deposits, deepening and efficiency initiatives for the balance of 2023. Our New York City Metro integration is progressing extremely well with a successful core conversion of Investors Bank in February and growth metrics that are well ahead of plan. Our outlook for 2023 still shows attractive ROTCE for the full year despite the challenging environment. There’s still a great deal of uncertainty, which makes forecasting more difficult, but we remain confident in the strength of our franchise and the ability to weather the storm. We are building a great bank and we remain excited about our future. Our capital strength and attractive franchise should position us to be nimble and to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. With that, let me turn it over to John to take you through more of the financial details. John?
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the financial results referencing slide five. Big picture, first quarter results were solid against the backdrop of volatility in the macro environment. We continue to progress against our portfolio of strategic initiatives, including the well-executed conversion of the Investor platform in February. For the first quarter, we generated underlying net income of $560 million and EPS of $1.10. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 15.8%. Net interest income was down 3% linked-quarter given the lower day count and lower interest-earning assets. Our margin was stable at 3.3%. Period-end loans and average loans were down slightly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the impact of our balance sheet optimization efforts, such as our ongoing runoff of auto. Deposit levels declined in the quarter primarily due to the impact of seasonal factors, the compounding impact of the rate environment and particularly earlier this occurred in the quarter. Importantly, our deposit levels were broadly stable during the market turbulence in March. Our quarter end LDR is 89.8% and our liquidity position remains very strong with current available liquidity as of today of about $66 billion. Our credit metrics and overall position remains solid. Total net charge-offs of 34 basis points are up 12 basis points linked-quarter, in line with ongoing normalization trends. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $168 million and a reserve build of $35 million this quarter, increasing our ACL coverage to 1.47% up from 1.43% at the end of the fourth quarter, with most of the increase directed to the general office portfolio. Our current coverage ratio is about 17 basis points stronger than our pro forma day one CECL reserve of 1.3%. We repurchased $400 million of common shares in the first quarter and delivered a strong CET1 ratio at the top of our target range at 10% and our tangible book value per share is up 6% linked-quarter. Before I walk through the details of the results for the quarter, let me address some of the industry issues that are top of mind on slide six. First, we have a very strong capital base, which is one of the highest in our regional bank peer group, even if one were to include the rate driven unrealized losses on all of our investment securities. We have a quality deposit franchise, which has performed very well since the turbulence, which began in early March. We continue to see the benefit from all of the investments we have made since the IPO with 67% of total deposits from Consumer and a well-diversified Commercial portfolio with about 66% of our clients using us as their primary bank. Finally, 68% of deposits are insured or secured. Our liquidity position is quite strong with a diverse funding base, ample available liquidity and strong risk management capabilities. In fact, our LCR level exceeds what would be required as a Category 3 bank at March 31, 2023. Looking at credit, our metrics continue to look solid. Retail is normalizing, but is still performing quite well as the employment picture remains strong. On the Commercial side, our focus is on the CRE portfolio and on general office in particular, which is impacted by back-to-work trends and rising interest rates. We have a very strong reserve coverage of 6.7% on the general office portfolio and I will go through some of the details later. And lastly, the market is concerned about how the regulators may respond to the disruption in March, which in our view, was unique to the banks in question and not reflective of broader in regulation or management lapses. We will watch closely how things develop, but in any case, we think the process will be thoughtful and deliberate. Finally, we believe we are well positioned for any increase in regulatory requirements, given our diverse business model and current excess capital and liquidity regulatory ratios. Let’s drill into the details on the next few slides, starting with capital on slide seven. We ended the quarter with one of the highest capital levels in our regional bank peer group with a CET1 ratio at the top of our target range of 10%. This strong capital level reflects our prudent approach to deploying capital as we prioritize driving improved returns over the medium-term. If you include the rate-driven unrealized loss on debt securities and AOCI, our adjusted CET1 ratio would be 8.7%. If you remove the unrealized losses in HTM, our tangible common equity ratio would reduce by 20 basis points to 6.4%. All of these ratios are expected to be near the top of our peer group again in this quarter. We expect to maintain very strong capital levels growing -- going forward with the ability to generate roughly 25 basis points of capital post dividend each quarter and before share buybacks. We have $1.6 billion of repurchase capacity remaining under our current Board authorization, timing of repurchases will be dependent on our view of external conditions. Next, I will move to slide eight to discuss our deposit franchise. As you can see, our deposit franchise is skewed towards Consumer and highly diversified across product mix and in terms of the various channels we can tap. About 67% of our total deposits are Consumer, up from 60% at December 31st, which puts us in the top quartile of our peer group and roughly 68% of our deposits are insured by the FDIC or secured, which is up from 60% at year-end. Demand deposits represent about 26% of the book, down slightly from 27% at year-end as customers have naturally rotated towards higher yielding alternatives. On slide nine, the headline is that our deposit performance since midyear 2022 following the Investors acquisition and the commencement of QT [ph] has been in line with industry performance. We outgrew both the industry and peer average in the second half of 2022. We entered 2023 expecting that the normal seasonal deposit outflows in the first quarter would be somewhat exacerbated by the higher rate environment and we saw a little more of that than we had forecast by about 1% and but most of that happened in January and February. Given our rundown in auto, we were willing to let some deposits run off early in the quarter trying to hold the line on betas. In March, we saw some elevated inflows and outflows as customers across the industry can look to diversify their deposits in the wake of bank failures, but overall, our deposits were broadly stable during the month. This strong performance is attributable to investing heavily in our deposit offerings and capabilities since the IPO and this will remain a focus as we continue to build a top performing bank franchise. On slide 10, we highlight some of the things that we are doing to attract deposits and drive primacy with our customers. In Consumer, we have developed a compelling set of products and features that drive higher customer satisfaction and encourage them to do more with us. We have strong analytics capabilities and compelling offerings such as Citizens Plus in our Private Client Group, as well as Citizens Access, our digital bank to leverage. And with the final conversion complete at Investors, we have a substantial opportunity to take deposit share in the New York Metro market. On the Commercial side, we have invested heavily in our treasury solutions capabilities with a state-of-the-art platform and strong talent to serve client needs. We continue to add better tools for our clients to manage their cash and drive higher operational deposits, as well as innovative products and capabilities to attract deposits. Moving to slide 11. We are monitoring the commercial real estate portfolio closely given the softening macro environment and the pressure of rising rates impacting refinance needs. The general office sector is a particular concern as tenants rethink their space needs given the remote work trends. Given these pressures, we are evaluating our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress, in particular, CRE office. It’s worth noting, however, that near 100% of our borrowers are current on their obligations with NPLs under 50 basis points. We are starting to see an increase in criticized assets and have added workout resources, but given the diversity and quality of the portfolio, we feel the credit costs will be manageable. Our total CRE allowance coverage of 2% includes an elevated coverage for the general office portfolio of 6.7%. On slide 12, we drilled down a bit on the $6.3 billion office portfolio, which includes $2.2 billion of credit tenant and life sciences properties, which are not as exposed to adverse back to office trends and are expected to perform quite well. The remaining $4.1 billion relates to the general office segment, which we feel is reasonably well positioned across type, geography and suburban areas and central business districts. About 90% of the general office portfolio is income producing and about 70% is located in suburban areas and the majority is Class A. Next, I will provide further details related to first quarter results. On slide 13, net interest income was down 3%, given lower day count, which was worth about $29 million and slightly lower interest-earning assets. The net interest margin of 3.3% was stable with the increase in asset yields offset by higher funding costs. With debt funds increasing 475 basis points at the end of 2021, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta has been well controlled at 36% through the end of the quarter. We continue to dynamically adjust our hedge position so that we have down rate protection in the second half of 2023 and through 2026. As we approach the height of the rate cycle, we have managed our asset sensitivity down from roughly 3% at the end of last year to a more neutral 1.1% at the end of the first quarter. Moving on to slide 14. We posted solid fee results despite seasonality and headwinds from market volatility and higher rates. These showed some resilience in a challenging environment, down 4% linked-quarter with seasonal impacts in capital markets and service charges, partly offset by strength in FX and derivatives revenue and a modest improvement in mortgage banking fees. Focusing on capital markets, market volatility continued through the quarter and syndications and M&A advisory fees were seasonally lower. We continue to see good strength in our M&A pipelines and signs that deal flow should pick up as the year progresses. Mortgage fees were slightly better with higher production fees as we are seeing volumes rising and margins improving with the industry reducing capacity. This should continue to benefit margins over time. And finally, card and wealth fees posted solid results for the quarter. On slide 15, expenses came in better than expected, up only 2.8% linked-quarter, given seasonally higher salaries and employee benefits, as well as the impact of an industrywide FDIC surcharge implemented at the beginning of the year. On slide 16, average loans were down slightly a bit over the quarter as inflation and supply chain pressures continue easing and clients are adjusting inventories to reflect this, as well as lower CapEx in anticipation of reduced economic activity. Average retail loans are down slightly, reflecting the planned runoff in auto, which was largely offset by growth in mortgage and home equity. On slide 17, average deposits were down $4.7 billion or 2.6% linked-quarter, driven by seasonal and rate-related outflows. As I mentioned earlier, the majority of the deposit decrease occurred in January and February, with balances broadly stable in March. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 51 basis points, which translates to a 73% sequential beta and a 36% cumulative beta. Moving on to slide 18. We saw good credit results again this quarter across the retail and Commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were 34 basis points, up 12 basis points linked-quarter, which reflects continued normalization. Non-performing loans are 64 basis points of total loans, up 4 basis points from the fourth quarter as an increase in Commercial was offset by improvements in retail. Retail delinquencies were broadly stable with the fourth quarter and continue to remain favorable to historical levels, but we continue to closely monitor leading indicators to gauge how the consumer is faring. Turning to slide 19, I will walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We increased our allowance by $35 million to take into account the growing risk of an economic slowdown and the outlook for losses in the Commercial portfolio, particularly general office. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.4%, which is a 4 basis point increase from the fourth quarter. The current reserve level calculation contemplates a moderate recession and incorporates expectations of lower asset prices and the risk of added stress on certain portfolios such as CRE. Moving to slide 20. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10%, which is at the top end of our target range. Tangible book value per share was up 6% in the quarter and the tangible common equity ratio has improved to 6.6%. We returned a total of $605 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Shifting gears a bit, on slide 21, we continue to make good progress with our push into the New York Metro market. We were very excited to complete the branch and systems conversion at Investors in February, which went very smoothly. With that behind us, we are full steam ahead working to serve our customers and capitalize on opportunities to capture market share. We continue to be encouraged by the strong early momentum we are seeing in the branches where customer satisfaction has been improving significantly and we continue to see some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network across the legacy HSBC and Investors branches. We have also seen some good early client wins and a growing pipeline in Commercial. We look forward to making further strides as we leverage the full power of our product lineup and customer focused Retail and Small Business model across the New York market. Moving to slide 22 for a quick update on our TOP 8 program. Our latest TOP program is well underway and progressing well. Given the external environment, we have begun to look for opportunities to augment our TOP 8 program in order to protect returns, as well as ensure that we can continue to make the important investments in our business to drive future performance. We will have more to say about this in the coming months. Moving to slide 23. I will walk through the outlook for the second quarter and give you an update on our outlook for the full year that takes into account a modest economic slowdown with the Fed expected to raise rates by 25 basis points in May and then begin easing late in the year. For the second quarter, we expect NII to decrease about 3%. Non-interest income is up mid-to-high single digits. Non-interest expense should be stable to down slightly. Net charge-offs should remain in the mid-30s basis points. Our CET1 is expected to come in above 10% with some share repurchase planning depending upon our view of the external environment. Moving to slide 24. As we think about the full year, we remain focused on maintaining strong capital, liquidity and funding position, while sustaining attractive returns. Of course, there is a continued level of uncertainty in the current environment. For the full year 2023, we expect NII to be up 5% to 7%. We are focused on initiatives that will stabilize and even grow our deposits modestly from first quarter levels over the remainder of the year. Non-interest income is expected to be up mid-single digits. Non-interest expense is expected to be up about 5%. Net charge-offs are expected to be in the mid-to-high 30s basis points. Our current reserve level contemplates a moderate recession and known risks and there should be less of a need for further reserve builds given anticipated spot loan decline for the year as auto runs down and our CET1 ratio is expected to be above the upper end of our 9.5% to 10% target range. At 10% to 10.25% assuming stable market conditions, our share repurchases are expected to build over the course of the year. To sum up on slide 25, we delivered a solid quarter despite expected -- unexpected challenges and are ready for the uncertainty that lies ahead in 2023. Our strong capital, liquidity and funding position will serve us well to move forward with our strategic priorities and deliver attractive returns this year as we balance the need for strong defense with the imperative of continuing to play prudent offense to strengthen the franchise for the future. Even as we navigate through the current challenging environment, we reaffirm our commitment to our medium-term financial targets. With that, I will hand back over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Allan, let’s open it up for some Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Go ahead please.
Erika Najarian: Hi. Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Good morning.
Erika Najarian: As we contemplate your original net interest income guide of 11% to 14%, now up 5% to 7%. Could you walk us through what the major changes are in assumptions and how much of it was cyclical, such as the deposit runoff, higher beta and how much of it could be a little bit more structural as you anticipate the different rules such as carrying higher liquidity funded by wholesale funding?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. Let me start and I will quickly flip it to John. But I would say, Erika, that really we are just recognizing what we have seen on -- in the deposit markets and the cost of deposits is going up. I think that was partly a response to kind of the Fed rapid rises and money funds becoming alternatives. So there was, I think, a greater sensitivity around earning a return on cash that kicked in and then that was, I think, further exacerbated by the bank failures in March. And so I think there was kind of heightened velocity of deposits moving around the system and so to retain those deposits, folks had to increase rate paid. We feel that we did a pretty good job here. We came into the year expecting that there would be some seasonal outflows in Q1, and since we had built deposits in the second half of the year and then we had auto running down, so less volume on the asset side, we were prepared to let those run down by about 3.5% in the quarter. We actually saw about 1% higher than that in the runoff, but in any case, we tried to hold the line on betas and I think the betas that we posted are slightly better than peers that have reported at this point. So, but if you kind of play out the rest of the year, we are going to be paying more for our funding than we thought coming into the year and that’s pretty much the big driver. I would say there might be kind of a little more disciplined in terms of who we are extending credit to, given I think probably a higher likelihood that we could see a shortened shallow recession. So there might be a little volume impact there from slightly lower earning assets and maybe there’s a little mix where we are holding a little precautionary cash. But if I had to kind of put it in order, I would say, number one is the cost of deposits, and maybe slightly the volume on assets, and then thirdly, would be composition. So, John, I will flip it to you.
John Woods: Yeah. Those are the right points to focus on. I’d say you break it down, Erika, between rate and volume. On the rate side, as you heard from, Bruce, we have the migration from a deposit standpoint, you are going to see the full year effect of that, of what’s happened over the last quarter or two and the drivers of that are well documented. We have got the cycle with higher rates and quantitative tightening going on that’s causing those forces to kind of hit us. I would also say that beta move up a bit more than maybe we had planned given the outlook. So we were, I think, in the high 30s prior, maybe we are in the low 40s through the cycle. So we are building that in. You also mentioned that from a liquidity standpoint, I think, we feel very good about that. From that, we are already compliant. If we had -- if we were a Category 3 bank, we are already compliant on the LCR. But from a volume standpoint, we are in rundown in auto, we are looking at some balance sheet optimization initiatives in Commercial and so you will see the LDR fall throughout the rest of the year. And then, finally, I would say that, the other things I look at on the positive side, I mean, our loan betas are from a cumulative standpoint will still exceed cumulatively where we are coming out on deposits. So you will see that mid-to-upper 40s on loans versus the low 40s on deposits. You got front book, back book when the Fed finally kind of pauses and starts to cut. You will see a lot of the balance sheet continue to contribute over the quarters post maybe a possible pause and cut that the Fed may kind of engage in. So lots to...
Bruce Van Saun: Right. You might have add too John about the swaps that we continue to dynamically recalibrate the swaps to provide protection for the event that the Fed ultimately moves lower.
John Woods: Yeah. I think it’s a really good point. I mean when you think that’s that what we are just talking about is the 2023 sort of story. I mean when you get into the end of 2023 into 2024, this cycle compared to last cycle, we have a lot more down rate protection in place for the second half of 2023 and into 2024 than we might have had in prior cycles, Bruce notice.
Bruce Van Saun: This will help support a good guide for 2024.
John Woods: Yeah.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah.
John Woods: Yeah.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. And I guess just to close this off, Erika, I would say, if you look at the outlook for the year, kind of the one thing that got marked down was really NII. We still feel pretty good about the fee outlook. We are going to work a little harder on expenses and probably bring that in below where we thought coming into the year. I’d say credit provisioning should be about kind of where we thought coming into the year. We are still angling to repurchase shares over the course of the year. So our expectation is that we can continue to deliver return on tangible equity in the kind of mid-teen area and just reflective that it won’t make quite as much net interest income this year, but still investing in the things to position us to have a good kind of runway into 2024.
Erika Najarian: Thank you. I will let one of my peers ask more detail on the swap fee calibration, because I think that’s important as we think about NII for 2024, but since we have you, Bruce, I want to ask you about how you are thinking about these anticipated regulatory changes for regional banks. I think that -- I am glad that you said in the prepared remarks that it takes time, right? You have the NPR, which could come out end of the year or a year from now, a year common period has been a phase-in. So as we think about what the market is anticipating, whether it’s TLAC or getting rid of opt out on AOCI, and of course, you said you are already LCR compliant. How are you thinking about managing your capital relative to your stock down at time, right? So it seems like banks can ever buy back as much at the time when they should be buying back and the potential in 2024 for some non-banks to be in bigger trouble and potentially taking market share, but balancing that with what’s going to be potentially tighter requirements on capital and liquidity. How much are you front-loading that versus thinking about the opportunities that can come your way if you remain as profitable as you say you are going to remain?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. Great question. And I guess just to set the big picture, Erika, that I would say, first off, I don’t believe that the answer to the two bank failures is more regulation on regional banks. I think those were idiosyncratic situations and there was sufficient regulation. So you basically had business models that were not well diversified and the banks grew too fast and stretch management capabilities, the supervisors didn’t really do their job and so I think there will be a thoughtful review of what were the issues and then how to address them. I think it’s probable that there will be some tightening around liquidity and capital, and probably, closer reviews of how banks are handling their asset liability management. There may be other aspects of this in terms of the overnight repo facility and creating a kind of viable drain on bank deposits in the money funds and should they change that and deposit insurance and should they take a look at that. So there’s a bunch of things that I think will come under review. Specifically, with respect to us, I think, the good news is that we have managed our capital at the high end of our peer group and so we are already compliant. We would be if we ended up having the AOCI filter removed, we would be in compliance today. The same thing John pointed out, the LCR. We have run that at a high level. We won very rigorous internal liquidity stress testing regimen that we would already be in compliance with the Category 3 bank as well. So the fact that we have managed the balance sheet conservatively, we are already in compliance if they go kind of heavier regulation if it ends up going down that path, I think, we are in good position. So I think we will have and the fact that these will be phased in over kind of, I’d say, two years or three years gives us lots of capital flexibility to be buying back our stock or taking advantage of other situations where that could arise. And if it’s strategically and financially compelling, I think, we have the capability to go on offense. So anyway, that’s kind of my thoughts on that, it was good to kind of stay conservative even when we had lots of questions as to why aren’t you leveraging your capital structure more where you are keeping your CET1 target so high. Guess what? We keep it that way, and we run conservative for precisely these air pockets that you are always going to experience turbulence and high capital and high liquidity is your best friend in these circumstances.
Erika Najarian: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Peter Winter: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to just follow up on Erika’s question on the NII guide. I was wondering could you be a little bit more specific on the outlook for margin and loan trends going forward?
John Woods: Yeah. I will go ahead and get started on that. So the guide being up 5% to 7%. What we built into that, as we mentioned, is the fact that we are going to have some downward kind of impact on margin coming from the deposit migration, as well as increased beta assumptions that we are building in. So it’s -- there’s a lot of uncertainty here and a lot of things to play out. But to try to frame it a little bit, go out to -- if you think about where we may end -- 4Q 2023 where we may end the year, we are starting the year at 330. We may end the year, call it, in a wide range, maybe 310 to 320 and if things kind of if there’s good execution and some trends maybe end up going our way, we will end up at the high end of that range, and vice versa on the lower end. And then so I’d say that when you think about playing it out throughout the year, there will be a step down as you work through the year with maybe a little bit of weighting into 2Q and things basically flattening out into the second half of the year. But like I said, there’s a lot of uncertainty there and -- but that helps -- hopefully, that will help give you a frame. And then you have got, as we mentioned, on the volume side of things, we do have the auto rundown, which we began last year that will be -- is built into that guide, as well as the ongoing work that we are doing in Commercial and balance sheet optimization. So you put all that together then that gives you the NII guide.
Bruce Van Saun: I would just add to that, a good answer, John, that this is an opportunity. We have always been on a balance sheet optimization path. But I think we are really intensifying our focus there. So businesses like indirect auto where it was a good place to kind of part liquidity and we run the business well. We service it very well. But it’s not really that strategically important to us. It doesn’t have direct customers that we cross-sell to, because those customers, frankly, are customers of the dealerships. So looking hard at those business and say, if deposits are more dear, what do we have on the left side of our balance sheet where we don’t have deep relationships and we are not making the best risk adjusted returns. And so during this year, I think we are going to really focus on making sure that the right side of the balance sheet in terms of deposit quality is as strong as it possibly can be and that where we are lending money we are doing that to true customers that we have deep relationships, whether they are Consumer, Small Business or Commercial and so we will take the opportunity this year to potentially have a little bit of a reset and even intensify those efforts. So we will really love our balance sheet going into 2024.
Peter Winter: Got it. And if I could just ask about deposits, the outlook. I recognize deposits stabilized in March and you have done a lot of work to improve the deposit franchise. But it just seems like in this environment to keep deposits stable to growing deposits from here could be a little bit of a challenge, not only for you. And I was wondering if you could just give some color on some of the deposit opportunities?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. Why don’t I stop at the start at the top and then maybe I will turn it to Brendan and Don to talk about what we are doing in Consumer and Commercial. We did put a slide in their Peter about some of those opportunities. And so, I think that, right now we just need to kind of get through this earnings season and see the cards turned over and continue to trend, hopefully, of less and less turbulence and getting back to a more comp situation. So that’s where kind of stability comes in. And by the way, through -- halfway through April, we are still kind of trending stable to even slightly up. But then the initiatives that we have long invested in and the value propositions that we have both for Consumer and some of the new innovation we have on the Commercial side, we think should start to play out and then we can start to build back deposits. But why don’t I first turn it to Brendan to talk about Consumer.
Brendan Coughlin: Yeah. Thanks. So the Consumer -- in the Consumer business have got sort of kind of three segments of deposits, the Traditional Retail, Wealth Management and then Small Business. And it’s kind of progressing as expected, has been chatting mode over the last couple of quarters. We certainly have customers coming into the cycle that have excess deposits and liquidity from pre-COVID. We are seeing very, very small earn down rates, but nothing that is unexpected. And broadly right in line with trends from mid-summer last year through this quarter. As John pointed out, through March, on all three of those portfolios, we saw 60% to 75% increase in inflows, but the same sort of increase on outflows broadly just moving money around it. So we were very stable on net balances across those businesses through the month of March. We feel really good about the underlying health. Over the last eight years, we have invested a lot of time and energy in making our Consumer deposit base much more granular. Our primacy rates, so whether customers consider us a primary bank or not is up dramatically to above peer levels. That’s a good thing. That means stability in low cost deposits when payroll is coming in. We have done things like added benefits like early pay for consumers, which is an encouragement to bring payroll and direct deposit over that’s going quite well adds more granularity and stability of the deposit base. So when I look at levers to continue to have strong deposit performance for the rest of the year. There’s a couple of things in the Consumer Bank that we are really, really focused on. One, John mentioned New York City, New Jersey, household growth, getting more customers. That is going well. We are performing at the top end of our peer set in terms of net market share gain and household growth. We expect that to continue in all of our markets and supported by the really early momentum in New York City and New Jersey that we expect to continue. We have also made a pretty meaningful pivot into customer relationship deepening. So we have rolled out program, as Bruce mentioned, Citizens Plus, which the simple concept is you do more with us, you get more, really encouraging customers to bring more of their wallet to us. We have seen very, very strong take up on that, a 300% plus improvement in customers going into these relationship propositions, encouraged by the breadth of the offering and bringing more to us and profitability of those customers almost doubles when they migrate up. So we think that will give us a shot in the arm as customers look at us to consolidate relationships over. And then maybe last would be Citizens Access. So and it gives us a great lever to raise deposits as we need it, but it also gives us a great lever to cost contain interest-bearing deposits in the Consumer Bank, which will allow us to have much more manageable betas in the core bank where we can focus on relationship banking and not deposit raising for the sake of deposit raising and when we need to contain deposit growth, we can do it in a very targeted way through Citizens Access. That’s proven to be exceptionally effective for us and we had a great quarter in growing Citizens Access here in Q1.
Bruce Van Saun: Don?
Don McCree: Yeah. So on our side, I think, a lot of it surrounds the Payments and Treasury Services business. You have heard us talk for the last couple of years about the investment we are making in that business. It has not only been around the core operating services, but also a lot of work around deposit franchises and liquidity franchises, frankly. One of the things we haven’t talked about is we have a liquidity advisory service and the liquidity portal, which goes beyond deposits, but allows us to capture customer funds even if they are on balance sheet. And then on the deposit side, over the last couple of years, we have introduced five or six new products. We have talked about the green deposits, talked about carbon offset deposits, we have talked about escrow deposits. So the product sets quite broad. The other thing we saw during the disruptions is we added about 300 new deposit clients, a lot of which interestingly came out of the JMP franchise as they referred some of the technology customers onto our platform. Some of those are funded up. Some of those aren’t funded up. But like Brendan said, the core of our franchise is really the primary core relationships and the operating relationships and about 66% of our deposit base is really with core primary relationships. And the last thing we are doing is we have turned the deposit business into a primary thrust sell. So where we were asking for capital markets business, when the capital markets were, we are now asking for deposits and we are framing the deposit raise in the context and overall relationship and have gotten a very good response from a lot of our clients.
Bruce Van Saun: Great.
Peter Winter: That’s great.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks.
Peter Winter: Thank you for the detailed answer.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Scott Siefers: Good everyone. Thanks for taking the question.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks,
Scott Siefers: I was hoping you might be able to speak at sort of a top level about how Commercial customers are behaving now with their operational deposits, like are they keeping less in operational deposits than they would have previously and then just spreading that money across several banks, which would imply maybe you lose some, but gain on, in other words, higher churn.
Don McCree: Yeah.
Scott Siefers: Maybe thought what Commercial account openings have looked like over the past month or so?
Don McCree: Yeah. As I mentioned, we have opened about 300 new accounts over the last month, which has been encouraging. I’d say at the top end of the client base we have seen more diversification activity. So the public companies, which had excess deposits kicking around the system, some of which were search deposits, some of those flowed out and went to other banks and then on the flip side, some of them flowed into us as customers balance their deposit accounts, so kind of net neutral on that. And then the other thing we have seen, frankly, and this is far before SVB and some of the disruption is clients are, because the capital markets are kind of quiet and the lending markets are kind of required, clients are using some of their cash to fund their operations and fund CapEx. So we have seen a little bit of a drift out in terms of just utilization of excess cash balances. And then the -- I’d say, the core operating deposits have stayed pretty flat. I mean people are basically toggling between ECR and deposits, if there’s a toggle, but I’d say, the kind of core funding of operational activities is relatively flat.
Scott Siefers: Okay. Perfect. Sorry, I had missed that 300 accounts over the last month, but I appreciate all that color. And then maybe separately, it sounds like you had some fairly constructive comments about the possibility for investment banking to recover over the course of the year, maybe in the second half. Just maybe a little more color on how you are expecting things to traject from here, please?
Don McCree: Yeah. I think we will see. It’s going to depend on what happens in the marketplace. I will say that over the last couple of weeks, we have seen a pretty strong bid in a lot of different asset classes, particularly the syndicated loan underlying asset class. So there’s some signs of life in the market, whereas it was dead quiet at the beginning of the year. We are starting to see some transactions actually clear the market some and kind of and some get restructured in ways that are, I would say, not more aggressive, but more regular way from various structured transactions that were happening over the last couple of months. So good signs of life. I’d say our pitch activity and our pipelines are extremely robust. And I would come back to what I said a couple of times is in things like our M&A business, we are a middle-market investment bank and so we play in smaller-sized transactions, say, $250 million to $1 billion, not the $5 billion to $10 billion transactions. So the financing dependency that’s in a lot of our pipelines is not as difficult as it is for the mega transaction. So we think as things begin to stabilize and recover and the rate cycle begins to come to an end, we will see activity in the second half of the year and we are seeing that in our pipeline. And then remember, we also have a very diverse set of capabilities now. So we are doing a lot around private equity, we are doing -- placing equity for clients into, for example, a family office or a lot of pitch activity around convertible bonds. So while some traditional full market products might not be fully back yet, we have a wide arsenal that we are actually deploying on behalf of that.
Bruce Van Saun: And let me just add to that as well and maybe flip it to John. But, Scott, the fee guide is supported, I think, broadly not reliant just on capital markets coming back. So we have a positive outlook across card, across wealth, the cash management business, mortgage, at market. So it’s fairly broad.
Don McCree: Yeah. Let me just add one more thing, Bruce. So if the first quarter is an indication we were down about $14 million quarter-on-quarter in syndicated finance. We were up about $13 million in our interest rate products and commodities hedging businesses. So diversification of those fee streams to Bruce’s point is quite important.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah.
John Woods: Yeah. Just picking up on that, so I was going to make that exact point just in terms of the bond and equity diversification along with M&A and cap markets. But in terms of cards, I mean, we do see some positive outlook in card as well, primarily in the credit card space. In mortgage production volumes and margins starting to recover a bit and that’s really good to see after quite a few quarters with headwinds there. And so -- and then on the wealth side of things, that has just been steady for us and is continuing even early April activity has been quite strong and so we are feeling good in the wealth space. So it’s sort of diversified across four, five categories in terms of what we are seeing for the 2023 outlook.
Scott Siefers: Perfect. All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. One moment, please. We are having a technical difficulty. Mr. Cassidy, your line is open. You may proceed.
Gerard Cassidy: Thank you. Hi, Bruce and John.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi.
John Woods: Hi.
Gerard Cassidy: John, you talked about lowering the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet. Can you share with us how quickly you could take -- can take that to neutral if you want -- wanted to as the rate environment shifts possibly towards the second half of the year and then also the cost or the strategies you would use to do that?
John Woods: Yeah. I mean, the way to think about that is, we are pretty close to neutral now and when you are down around 1%, there are a number of assumptions that go into that calculation, including deposit migration, et cetera. And so if your models are off one way or the other, you could easily be neutral. When we think about that when we consider the fact that we have a view that the Fed may hike one more time and may be on hold. But inflation -- if inflation is more persistent and stubborn, things could rise, right, from here. So we nevertheless don’t try to overcook things one way or the other, but gradually getting back to neutral has served us well and so you have to think about that 1% split between what’s typically hedgeable and what is a little less hedgeable and the short end is more hedgeable. So the construct of what short rate exposure is, is actually less than 100%, I am sorry, less than 1%. We are actually 60-40 skewed towards the short end. So to close that down would not take very much at all, would be typically a shift in balance sheet outlook and/or additional resi fixed swaps. But more broadly, we basically layered on a number of transactions to basically get our coverage for the rest of 2023. We have got about $20 billion of coverage in resi fixed swaps for the rest of 2023 and more like $26 million or so for 2024 and so we are sort of thinking of ourselves around neutral with protection to the downside. And I would offer up that, that will result if, in fact, the Fed does at the lower rates by a lot. We have a view that we will end up with a trough NIM that’s well above what we saw in our last cycle. So much more stable and a much more narrow corridor of net interest margin than you might have seen from us in the past.
Gerard Cassidy: Very good. And Bruce, I like the branding you are doing in New York with the Giants, looking forward to the day that Citizens becomes the bank of the Yankees. But with that as a follow-up on retail, this is maybe for Brendan. You guys gave us really good detail on slide 31 on the FICO scores. And a theory out there, I don’t know if it’s true or not, that the FICO scores have been inflated, because of what we came through during the pandemic, some people claim as much as 70 points. Do you guys buy into that theory, and if so, would you then expect maybe the behaviors of your customers to be different than what the actual FICO scores are?
Brendan Coughlin: Yeah. Great question. There is a theory out there that FICO scores were inflated with all the stimulus and delinquency going down really fast. The good news is our credit underwriting is fairly sophisticated and while FICO is an input, it tends to be one of about 100 things that we look at, including free cash flow and a whole bunch of other different metrics in all of our businesses. And so we have taken that into account in our underwriting that the range of real FICOs versus actual printed FICOs during COVID was incorporated into all of our credit metrics as we kind of made new loans over the last three years or four years. So we feel really good about that and I think the performance is showing that we think so far, at least we got that right. And as John pointed out, we are seeing the Consumer book normalize, but both delinquency and charge-offs are still south of where they were pre-COVID and we are not seeing an unexpected acceleration of delinquency or charge-offs given the environment really across any of the asset classes. So I know over the years have been questions about some of the businesses that were faster growing in Consumer and unsecured like students that are Citizens Pay business, those are well under control despite the great clubs surrounding us. So we feel really good about where we stand right now for Consumer credit, given the health of the Consumer and the quality of our underwriting standards. And lastly, yeah, we have tightened a bunch in the last six months to nine months just as a cautionary measure. So as we are kind of tightening up on things like auto on just size of balance sheet around the fringes in almost every single one of our asset classes, we have made credit tightenings, not because we are seeing anything we don’t like just in an abundance of caution to make sure that we don’t have any tail risk in any of the portfolios. So as everything we can see right now, we feel pretty good.
Gerard Cassidy: Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open. Go ahead.
John Pancari: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi.
John Pancari: On the expense side, I think, Bruce, you had alluded to potentially being able to come in below the expense expectation, the 5% expectation may be for the year as you are focusing on that given the topline pressures. Can you maybe give us a little more color there what you are looking at and how material of a potential benefit you could have on that front as you see the topline pressure building on the NII side?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. I will start and flip to John. But we had -- coming into the year we were going with a 7% guide, some of that was reflective of the HSBC and ISBC full year effects and then some was the higher FDIC premiums. We have marked that down to 5%. So clearly in recognition that will have some compression in the net interest income. We are going to work really hard to try to protect the bottomline and so I think that’s what we have circled at this point. Clearly, TOP remains an open program and we have lots of ideas in terms of are there other things that we can kind of get working on and actually have a benefit this year. Some of them may actually have a benefit for next year. But, certainly, we have got our folks taking a hard look at what else we can do on the expense side. But at the same time, we are trying to make sure that we protect all of the investments in our future, the important strategic initiatives across Consumer and Commercial, across technology and our overall client experience organization so that when the storm clouds pass we are growing faster than peers and we are in a good position to grow both customer base, as well as our revenues. So that’s the balancing act is to keep looking for efficiencies, while making sure that we are prioritizing the things that really are important to future positioning, John?
John Woods: Yeah. I think that’s well said. I would just add that we are take -- we try to calibrate our expense base along with the revenue base that’s being projected here. And so I think you could very well see an upside in TOP 8 in the coming months. We are working on that. The couple of areas that we are thinking about expanding on is the further simplification of our operating models all of our -- we have taken a look at -- a harder look at all of our third-party spend, reimagining how we operate from an automation perspective is something that structurally we have been making investments in and we can double down on that going forward. And just making sure everything we are doing is absolutely focused on our core objectives of growing a top performing bank, generating low moderate cost deposits and investing in our customers and clients. And so when you put a sharp eye on all of that, you often come up with opportunities to basically create additional efficiencies and we have demonstrated that over the years and then we are going to intensify those efforts here in the coming months.
John Pancari: Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just secondly, on the commercial real estate front, can you give us a couple of stats that you might you have -- you may have on that in terms of, as you are looking at refreshing or reappraising some of the properties in office. Can you give us what you are seeing in terms of some of the value declines, we had a peer of yours indicate 15% to 20% value decline in some of the office reappraisals? And then, separately, I know you indicated that you are seeing some pressure, you expect pressure on commercial real estate criticized loans. Do you have what the percentage increase was in commercial real estate criticized and what’s the ratio?
Don McCree: All right. General criticized is running at about 24% for the office space. I don’t have it for the overall real estate book at the time, but office is what we are very focused on. We haven’t seen a lot of appraisals yet, because we are not really in the restructuring mode, the ones we have seen have actually been modestly better than we expected. I don’t have the exact downdraft. But our entry LTVs are around 60%. So there’s a lot of cushion in our underwriting of commercial real estate. As Bruce and John said, we have really staffed up our workout teams and we are really putting each individual property, each individual MSA under the microscope. We are focused on maturities. In the office book, we have about 60% of the book maturing by the end of 2024. So it’s not a huge amount and we have a majority of the risk in the book swapped or fixed in terms of interest rate protection. So while we are beginning to engage client-by-client, remember the way -- we are very kind of focused on who we are doing business with. So client selection is very important. MSA is very important, suburban versus urban is very important and so we think we will have some trouble in the book and we are going to have to restructure a lot of the transactions, it’s going to be very manageable in terms of the overall loss content.
John Pancari: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Due to time constraints, we will now turn the call back over to Mr. Van Saun.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. So, again, thanks everybody for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and your support. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-17 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Keeley, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.
Kristin Silberberg: Thank you, Keeley. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our fourth quarter and full-year earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions.  Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page two of the presentation. We are also referencing non-GAAP financial measures. So it's important to review our GAAP results on page three of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to you, Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thanks, Kristin. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We're pleased with the financial performance we delivered for the fourth quarter and the full-year and we feel well positioned to navigate through an uncertain environment in 2023. We are playing strong defense with a robust balance sheet position and highly prudent credit risk appetite. At the same time, we continue to play disciplined offense with continuing investments in our growth initiatives. We are focused on building out a prudent, sustainable growth trajectory over the medium-term. I'll comment briefly on the financial headlines and let John take you through the details. For the quarter, our underlying EPS was $1.32, our return on tangible common equity was 19.4% and the efficiency ratio was 54%. Sequential operating leverage was 1% and sequential PPNR growth was 2.6%. Leading our performance was 2% sequential NII growth, reflecting NIM expansion of 5 basis points to 3.3% and relatively stable loans given the impact of a $900 million reduction in our auto portfolio. Growth was 1% ex this impact. Deposits were solid with 1% sequential growth, and our LDR remained stable at 87%. Our fee businesses showed resilience and diversity given a challenging environment, down about 1% sequentially. A number of M&A fees pushed into Q1 and mortgage results were softer than expected. We maintained stable expenses in the quarter, and credit metrics remain good. We boosted our allowance for credit losses to 1.43% of loans, which compares with pro forma day 1 CECL levels of 1.30%. We restarted our share repurchase activity in Q4, buying $150 million of stock and we ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 10% at the top of our targeted range. For full-year 2022, we delivered underlying EPS of $4.84 and ROTCE of 16.4% as we captured the benefit of rising rates and our strengthened deposit base. The results handily exceeded our beginning of year guide, which we included in the appendix of the presentation. With respect to our guidance for 2023, we assume a slowdown in economic growth to 1% for the year, two early Fed rate hikes and a Q4 cut and inflation getting below 3% by Q4. We project moderate loan growth, partially offset by continued run off in our auto book of close to $3 billion. Overall, we see solid NII growth as NIM gradually rises to 3.4% over the year, a roughly 8% growth in fees to kind of rebound in capital markets fees over the course of the year, solid expense discipline with core expense growth ex acquisition and FDIC impacts of 3.5% to 4%.  We announced today our TOP 8 program, which targets $100 million in run rate benefits and about 80% of that is expense impact. Credit should be manageable with net charge-offs in the 30 to 35 basis point range and we expect to build our ACL to 1.45% to 1.5% of loans. We expect to repurchase a meaningful amount of stock given strong profitability, modest loan growth and limited expectation for acquisitions with our CET1 ratio forecast near the high end of our 9.5% to 10% range. Capital return to shareholders should approach 100% and yield to investors of our dividends plus capital return via repurchase put TOP 12%. So, all in all, a very strong year of execution and delivery for all stakeholders by Citizens in 2022, and we feel we are well positioned in 2023 to continue our journey towards becoming a top-performing bank. We continue to make good progress in executing on our strategic initiatives across consumer, commercial and the enterprise. We've transformed our deposit base and are reaping the benefits. We've adjusted our interest hedging to protect against lower rates through 2025. Given the improvement in our ROTCE over time, we are raising our medium-term target to 16% to 18% from 14% to 16%. We've stayed focused on positive operating leverage. We've captured the benefit of moving to a more normal rate environment, and we still have plenty of upside in our fee businesses as market conditions improve. Exciting times for Citizens. I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering a great effort in 2022. We know we can count on you again in the new year. And with that, I'll turn it over to John.
John Woods : Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Big picture, 2022 was a strong year for Citizens with significant delivery of strategic initiatives against the backdrop of uncertainty and volatility in the macro environment. Most notably, we closed our acquisitions of HSBC and ISBC. We captured the benefit of higher rates with strong NII and NIM, and our balance sheet and interest rate position were well managed.  While fee revenues were impacted by the environment, we are very well positioned across our businesses to capitalize on the upside potential when markets normalize, particularly in capital markets. Mortgage margins and volumes should recover over time, and we are excited for the growth prospects arising from our wealth investments. We are actively managing our loan portfolio, focusing on allocating capital where we can drive deeper relationship business into 2023 and beyond. We continue to maintain good expense discipline, delivering in excess of $115 million of pre-tax run rate benefit through TOP 7, generating 4.7% underlying positive operating leverage for the year and 16.4% full-year ROTCE. Let me give you the headlines for the financial results, referencing slide five. For the fourth quarter, we reported underlying net income of $685 million and EPS of $1.32. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 19.4%. Net interest income was up 2% linked quarter with 5 basis points of margin expansion to 3.3% and relatively stable loans given a planned reduction in our auto portfolio. Period ended average loans are broadly stable linked quarter, up 1%, excluding auto runoff. We grew deposits up 1% linked quarter and our LDR was stable at 87%. Fees showed some resilience in a challenging environment, down 1% linked quarter. We saw a modest improvement in capital markets fees driven by underwriting and M&A, but this was more than offset by a drop in mortgage fees and a CDA DDA impact in our FX and IRP business. Expenses were broadly stable linked quarter. Overall, we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of 1% linked quarter, and our underlying efficiency ratio improved to 54.4%. Our credit metrics were good, with NCOs of 22 basis points, up 3 basis points linked quarter. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $132 million and a reserve build of $44 million this quarter. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.43%, up from 1.41% at the end of the third quarter and approximately 13 basis points above our pro forma day 1 CECL adoption coverage ratio. Our tangible book value per share is up 5% linked quarter. Next, I'll provide further details related to the fourth quarter results. On slide six, net interest income was up 2% given higher net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.3% was up 5 basis points. As you can see on the NIM walk on the bottom left-hand side of the slide, a healthy increase in asset yields continues to outpace funding costs, reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. With Fed funds increasing 425 basis points since the end of 2021, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta has been well controlled at 29% through the end of the fourth quarter. Moving on to slide seven. We posted solid fee results despite headwinds from continued market volatility and higher rates. These were fairly stable, down 1% linked quarter with lower mortgage and FX and derivatives fees, partly offset by an improvement in capital markets fees. Focusing on capital markets. Market volatility continued through the quarter. However, underwriting and M&A advisory fees picked up. We continue to see good strength in our M&A pipeline, including several deals that were pushed into Q1. Mortgage fees were softer as the higher rate environment continued to weigh on production volumes. We have seen pressure on volumes moderating and size of the industry reducing capacity, which should benefit margins over time. Servicing operating fees were stable. Card and wealth fees posted solid results for the quarter.  On slide eight, expenses were well controlled, broadly stable linked quarter. Our TOP 7 efficiency program delivered over $115 million of pre-tax run rate benefits by the end of the year. We are excited to announce the launch of our new TOP 8 program, and I'll cover that in a few slides. On slide nine, average and period-end loans were broadly stable linked quarter but up 1% ex auto runoff with 1% growth in commercial, reflecting demand in asset-backed financing and growth in CRE, primarily reflecting line draws and slower paydowns. We have seen commercial utilization moderate a bit over the quarter as inflation and supply chain pressures continue easing and clients are adjusting inventories to reflect this as well as lower CapEx in anticipation of a softer economy. Average retail loans are down slightly, but up 1% ex planned runoff in auto, given growth in mortgage and home equity, which bring an opportunity for deeper relationships and better risk-adjusted returns. On slide 10, average deposits were up $1.4 billion or 1% linked quarter, with growth primarily coming from term deposits, money market accounts and Citizens Access Savings. Overall, commercial banking deposits were up 2.4% and consumer banking deposits were broadly stable. We feel good about how we are optimizing deposit costs in this rate environment. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 67 basis points, which translates to a 29% cumulative beta, broadly consistent with our expectations. We began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity and funding profile including significant improvements through our deposit mix and capabilities. We achieved overall deposit growth this quarter, and we will continue to optimize our deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits. Overall liquidity remains strong as we reduced our FHLB advances by $1.3 billion and increased our cash position at quarter end. Our period-end LDR improved slightly to 86.7%. Moving on to slide 11. We saw a good credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were 22 basis points, up 3 basis points linked quarter, which is still low relative to historical levels. Nonperforming loans are 60 basis points of total loans, up 5 basis points from the third quarter, given an increase in commercial, largely in CRE. Retail delinquencies continue to remain favorable to historical levels but we continue to closely monitor leading indicators to gauge how the consumers vary. Although personal disposable income remains strong, debt service as a percentage of disposable income has essentially returned to pre-pandemic levels while consumer confidence has stabilized as inflation has eased. Turning to slide 12, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. While our current credit metrics are good, we increased our allowance by $44 million to take into account the growing risk of an economic slowdown. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.43%, which is a modest increase from the third quarter. The current reserve level contemplates a moderate recession and incorporates expectations of lower asset prices and the risk of added stress on certain portfolios, including those subject to higher risk from inflation, supply chain issues, higher interest rates and return to office trends. Given these pressures, we are watching our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress, in particular, CRE office. Back on slide 32 in the appendix, we have provided some additional information about the CRE portfolio. Our total CRE allowance coverage of 1.86% includes elevated coverage for the office portfolio while the multifamily portfolio has a much lower reserve requirement. The $6.3 billion office portfolio includes $2.2 billion of credit tenant and life sciences properties, which are not as exposed to adverse back-to-office trends. The remaining $4 billion relates to the general office segment for which we are holding a roughly 5% allowance coverage. About 95% of the general office portfolio is income producing and about 70% is located in suburban areas. Moving to slide 13. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10%, which is at the top end of our range. Tangible book value per share was up 5% in the quarter, and the tangible common equity ratio improved to 6.3%. We returned a total of $350 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our strong capital position, combined with our earnings outlook, puts us in a position to continue to return capital to shareholders through additional share repurchases. Shifting gears, a bit. Starting on slide 14, we'll cover some of the unique opportunities we have to drive outperformance over the next few years. We have tried to be very disciplined in prioritizing the areas that we think have big potential and where we have a right to win. So, in Consumer, we've got four big opportunities. First is our push into New York Metro. We are investing in brand marketing, doing well in the technology conversions and putting our best people against the market opportunity. We are encouraged by our early success with some recent client wins in commercial and the HSBC branches driving some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network. The full ISBC conversion is just around the corner on President's weekend, and we look forward to making further strides as we leverage the full power of our product line-up and customer-focused retail and small business model across the New York market. You will see more details on slide 28 and 29 in the appendix. Importantly, we achieved about 70% in run rate of our planned $130 million of investors' net expense synergies as of the end of the year and we expect to capture the rest by the middle of the year. We also continue to expect that the integration costs will come in below our initial estimates. Moving to wealth. We've launched a number of exciting initiatives with Citizens Private Client and CitizensPlus as we orient the business towards financial planning led advice. These should really help us penetrate the opportunity with our existing customer base. On slide 15, our national expansion is another area where we have a great opportunity to build on our digital platform that has been focused on deposits for the last few years. We've moved that to a cloud-based platform, and we are adding our other product capabilities so that we can offer a complete digital bank experience to serve customers nationwide with a focus on the young mass affluent market segment. Where we might have only had a lending or deposit relationship before, our vision is to build a national platform that allows us to serve our customers in a comprehensive way. And we have also been very innovative in creating distinctive ways to serve customers. Citizens Pay, for example, is an area where we have significant running room. We've attracted many new partners, up about 150 versus a year ago, which should really ramp the business. And we built an industry-leading home equity business, powered by our innovative fast line process, which is enabled by advanced analytics and digital innovations that have drastically reduced originations time. Moving to the Commercial Bank on slide 16 and 17. We filled in all the product gaps. Acquisitions brought us M&A and other advisory capabilities, and we built out debt capital market capabilities organically. We've hired some great coverage bankers and we are focused on high-growth regions around the country and the right industry verticals to serve larger companies. We also have a very strong sponsor coverage and are well positioned to support private equity capital. Bottom line, we have aligned ourselves with the attractive opportunities with a full product set to drive significant market share and fee revenues. Moving to slide 18. We are excited to announce the launch of our latest TOP program. Even as we push forward on offense with our strategic initiatives and acquisitions, it is important to remember that a key to Citizens success since our IPO has been our continuous effort to find new revenue pools and realize efficiencies and then reinvest those benefits back into our businesses so we can serve customers better. We've effectively executed our TOP 7 program achieving a pre-tax run rate benefit of approximately $115 million at the end of 2022. And we've launched TOP 8 with a goal of an exit run rate of about $100 million of pre-tax benefits by the end of 2023, with that split about 80-20 between efficiency and revenue-oriented initiatives. Moving to slide 19. I'll walk through the outlook for the full-year, which contemplates an economic slowdown and the end of December forward curve view of two 25 basis point Fed hikes before an expected 25 basis point cut in the fourth quarter. We expect solid NII growth, up 11% to 14%, and we project our NIM to gradually rise towards approximately 3.4% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Our overall hedge position is expected to provide a NIM floor of about 3.2% through the fourth quarter of 2024 and a gradual 200 basis point decline across the curve, commencing in Q4 2023. In the fourth quarter, we took actions to transition $3 billion of active swaps from 2023 to forward-starting positions in 2024. And we've done even more so far in January to rebalance the distribution of down rate protection. You'll find a summary of our hedge position in the appendix on slide 30. We expect moderate loan growth with average loans up 4% to 5%. We are targeting about $3 billion of spot auto runoff as we shift the portfolio towards products with more attractive risk-adjusted returns. We expect total average earning assets to be up 3% to 4%. On the deposit side, we see 3% average deposit growth and a 2% to 3% spot deposit decline with cumulative deposit betas at year-end reaching the high 30s. These are expected to be up 7% to 9% with a capital markets rebound building over the course of the year. Noninterest expense is expected to be up roughly 7% or about 3.5% to 4% if you adjust for the full-year effect of the HSBC and investors acquisitions and the FDIC premium increase. If the year unfolds as we expect, we should be able to drive about 400 basis points to 500 basis points of positive operating leverage. Given current macro trends and portfolio originations, we expect that our ACL ratio will rise to the 1.45% to 1.5% level, depending upon how the economy fares. We expect our CET1 ratio to land at the upper end of our target range of 9.5% to 10%, even with our target payout ratio approaching 100%. All of this translates into a ROTCE in the high teens for 2023. On slide 20, we provide the guide for Q1. Note that Q1 is seasonally weak for us with the day count impact and seasonality impacting revenues and taxes on compensation payouts impacting expenses. Moving to slide 21. As Bruce mentioned, we have completely transformed the franchise since the IPO, executing well against our priorities and achieving our desired performance targets, and we are ready to raise the bar, lifting our ROTCE target of 16% to 18%. The key to the further ROTCE improvement is continuing to deliver positive operating leverage. As we look out over the medium term, we should see a recovery in loan and deposit growth and we will continue to be balance -- continue our balance sheet optimization efforts to focus on deep relationship lending to maximize risk-adjusted returns. We are well positioned to grow fees meaningfully. And even if rates come down a bit, we expect NII to benefit from the protection we have put on through the swap portfolio. You should expect us to stay disciplined on expenses. Credit is projected to be stable as the economy strengthens. And we continue to focus on returning a meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders through our repurchase program and targeting a dividend payout of 35% to 40%. Over this timeframe, we would expect our CET1 ratio to remain within our target range of 9.5% to 10%. To sum up, slide 22, we delivered a strong quarter against the backdrop of a dynamic environment, and we have a positive outlook for 2023. We are ready for the uncertainty of an economic slowdown in 2023 with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position. We've taken actions to protect our NIM and we are being prudent with respect to our credit risk appetite and loan growth. At the same time, we are moving forward executing against our strategy and making important investments in our business that we believe will deliver sustainable growth and outperformance over the medium term. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun : Okay. Thank you, John. And operator, why don't we open it up for Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler.
Scott Siefers : It sounds like you guys rebalanced some of the hedges in the fourth quarter and are continuing to do so year-to-date so far. I was hoping you might please just expand upon how you're thinking on how those changed since last quarter and sort of how you intend to position yourself?
John Woods : Yes, I'll go ahead and start off. I mean on the big picture, we -- asset sensitivity last quarter was around 3%. We're a little bit below that this quarter just given the way the outlook for the balance sheet appears to be playing out in 2023. So as we're -- as you've seen over time, we've taken our asset sensitivity down. We are -- most of that asset sensitivity is really driven by the short end of the curve, which we expect to remain elevated throughout 2023. And as a result, we're looking at some of the down rate protection that we had in place in 2023 and just repositioning that out of spot-starting active swaps into forward-starting swaps into 2024 and beyond. So we're looking to looking to basically push that out and basically get that down rate protection smoothed out into the '24 and '25 periods rather than holding on to all of that down rate protection here in '23. That's the main objective in what we were doing in the fourth quarter, and we've done a little bit more of that in early 1Q. And then more broadly, we're looking at net interest margin, that corridor, if you will, we're trying to protect that corridor with -- at the low end, if rates were to fall by 200 basis points out in 2024, that you'll see a floor of around 320. So you see that 320 to 340 corridor being something that over time is more narrow than you would have seen from us maybe in past cycles. So that's the main objective.
Bruce Van Saun : And I would just add to that, Scott, in our view in the macro is that the Fed likely moves maybe most or twice the forward curve as they'll move up 25 basis points a couple of times and then stop. And then typically, they would pause for six or seven months before they would cut. And so if there's a cut happening, it likely happens very late in the year and maybe it could be early next year. So guided by that view, that's kind of why we're pushing out that downside protection a bit.
Scott Siefers : Terrific. And then just a separate question. It looks like fees will need to rebound fairly meaningfully following the first quarter to hit the guide? I know, Bruce, you had mentioned an expectation for improved capital markets through the year. Maybe just a thought or two on how you see the main drivers of that fee guide as the year progresses, please? 
Bruce Van Saun: Sure. So, I think really, you put your finger on it there, Scott, is the capital markets business. We've had really strong pipelines this year. But because of the volatility because of the fact that the Fed is still moving higher, that's created uncertainty and just an inability to actually get the money to work from private equity or some of the deals done because the financing hasn't been there the way it's been in the past. And so I think as you -- going back to that macro forecast as the Fed is likely nearing kind of the destination in terms of peak rates. I think that starts to loosen up the markets, the financing markets, you'll see less volatility and a lot of the business is kind of clocked into our pipeline will start to print and get delivered, and we'll start to see more transactions. So just by reference, most of the quarters this year, our capital markets revenues were at $90 million to $100 million. If you go back to the fourth quarter of 2021, we had $184 million of fees, so roughly double that level. So we thought coming into this year that we'd have much stronger levels of revenue generation. But the good news is we still have a great overall focus on the right sectors in the market. We've got a great team. And so, I think you'll see that start to rev up as we see the market conditions improve. Beyond that, I'm also quite optimistic. We've made a lot of investments in the wealth business. And again, there, if you start to see some stability in the asset markets, we should get a kind of tailwind from that plus the investments that we've made. So, feel confident about that. And then I'd say mortgage is so washed out. I keep thinking it can't go any lower, and it did in the fourth quarter. But I think you're starting to see people exit the business and coming out of the business. And so you'll start to see margins expand, and I think volumes will tick-up as we go through the year, again, linked back to the Fed reaching the destination and some stability on rates. So those would be the big things. I'm happy to pass the horn here. Don, do you want to say anything else...?
Don McCree: Yes. I think you've pretty much covered it on cap markets. I said this last quarter, I'll just remind people, again, we are a middle market investment bank. So we're not dependent on these giant transactions that need $5 billion of financing. We do singles and doubles all day long, and our pipelines are reasonably strong with a very heavy content of private equity who is a watch with cash. So, there will be transactions. If you don't get regular way transactions, you're going to get a lot of restructuring transactions. So, there's minority capital. There's a lot of different ways to skin the cat. So, we're relatively optimistic about what's ahead of us in the coming year. 
Bruce Van Saun : Yes. Brandon, anything…?
Brendan Coughlin : I think you nailed that pretty well. I'd say well for the year, we're projecting slow and steady, continued progress, and it's a bit of a hopeful coiled spring when the equity markets really come back. But as long as they're stable, we should see some growth. I'd say the other bright spot is debt and ATM fees that continue to hit records both through customer engagement and primacy and all the investments we made in the health of the franchise that's also translating into our deposit quality, also some restructure on vendor relations and such that's giving us a bit of a boost there, too. So that should be a continued area of slow and steady progress. On the other side, there will continue to be a little bit of pressure still on overdraft income and service charges, but we're sort of near the -- that's in the run rate. Most of that's in the run rate. So we're sort of near the bottom, which is good that we'll move away from being a headwind for us, real soon.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. 
Peter Winter : I wanted to ask on credit. John, you mentioned that most of the increase in nonperforming loans was commercial real estate. I was just wondering, was that office related? And if you can just give a little bit more color on what your outlook is for office?
John Woods : Yes. Maybe I'll just talk about the coverage levels. Just broadly, as you may have seen in our materials that the CRE coverage from an allowance standpoint is around 186 basis points. But when you carve out some of the really high-quality stuff in multifamily and credit tenant lease and life sciences, you get to our general office segment, where we have very healthy coverage of around 5%. So there are some -- we are seeing some trends there that are telling us that we should be putting away some reserves to deal with the back-to-office trends that are a headwind in that space. So, you got good healthy coverage of around 5%. We are seeing some of that tick into the nonaccrual space. I would say more broadly, that will -- even though that goes into nonaccrual, our overall pre-LTVs are typically around 60%. And so, you got to distinguish from non-accruals for actual loss content. And so even though we're putting some allowance away, we feel like that's commensurate with the loss content that we see in the book. And I'll just stop there and…
Bruce Van Saun : Hey, Don, do you want to add?
Don McCree : I'll just say for the office portfolio, but CRE in general, it's first and foremost, who's the sponsor and who's the investor, and we have a very high-quality group of investors that we do business with, which are largely institutional. Second is what MSAs are you in and where are you? And we think suburban will do better than urban. As we said in the comments, we're heavily weighted to suburban. So, we're going through every single property in the office portfolio. We'll restructure a lot of them with the sponsors. We restructured one already this year where the sponsor-contributed equity. So, we're comfortable around where we are with the coverage ratios right now, but we'll be active in restructuring the portfolio. But we kind of like the contours of what we've got.
Peter Winter : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, can you just talk about what changed in the updated margin guidance of towards 3.40 versus the prior guidance of 3.50? Is it just the higher deposit beta outlook?
John Woods : Yes. I'll go ahead and cover that. I mean I think more broadly, it's two overall comments, really the -- just given the pace and speed of rate changes and the impact on the migration of the deposit mix that we expect as you get into 2023 is really most and the majority of what we're looking at. So -- and that migration manifests itself in two ways. It's really the amount of DDA migration that we see as well as the cost of our relatively low-cost deposits that we're seeing not only within our platform but across the industry. So from that perspective, just kind of marking that to market with respect to what we're seeing in the trends in the fourth quarter and the rate and curve outlook that we see going throughout the rest of '23, I would hasten to add the -- what's embedded in there nevertheless, is a transformed deposit platform that back -- prior to the pandemic, we would have had DDA percentages that would be in the low 20s compared with a majority of the portfolio being outside of DDA, of course. But you fast forward to where we are in the fourth quarter, and we're at 28% of our deposit franchise is sitting in DDA. That's a significant increase versus pre-pandemic. And we expect to end the year in the sort of the mid- to high 20s in the DDA space, down a little bit from where we are today, but nevertheless, still very high quality. When you add in consumer CRE and consumer savings, which is other low cost, you end up with still about 15% or more of our deposit portfolio sitting in low-cost categories. That's up from the low 40s prior to the pandemic. So, this has been a multi-multiyear transformation of the deposit franchise. So I think we're basically just calibrating what we expect in 2023, which is with the majority of what we saw in terms of the decline from 3.50 to 3.40. I think you could also add in what's going on with the curve and front-book, back-book as well. When you look at it just how quickly rates are rising, the front book originations take a longer time to contribute. And from that perspective, we're seeing that being a driver as well. And then not only the speed of -- I guess, the last point I'll make is not only the speed of rates rising, but the inversion of the yield curve is something that is also pretty -- is a headwind to front-book, back-book. Just to end it with nevertheless, front-book, back-book is a positive tailwind over time. We're seeing 300 basis point of positive front-book, back-book across securities and our fixed rate lending businesses, that's still a tailwind. And that's going to be a driver into 2023 with net interest margins rising just not by quite as much as we thought last quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Kenneth Usdin : Wondering, Bruce heard your earlier comments about we're at 1.30 ACL day 1 adjusted for the deals in the low 1.40s now and your comments about 1.45, 1.50 year-end. I'm just wondering if you can help us, given that you're slowing loan growth and letting the auto book run out, how do you just help us understand what you're seeing in terms of what your CECL impact might be looking ahead versus the impact of slower loan growth in terms of that endpoint that you're expecting? 
Bruce Van Saun : Sure. I'll start. John, you can pick up. But I'd say what we've done for the past several quarters is kind of keep looking forward as to what's the macro forecast and are there any particular segments of the portfolio that could come under stress given that the Fed has continued to push higher and the economic growth has been downgraded. So I think there's -- like I read today that over 60% of the leading economists are projecting a forecast for this year. So the reason that we've been building gradually is just taking that into account. I think at some point, you kind of get the cards turned up in 2023, and you'll have more information and less uncertainty, but we don't see that where we sit today. So I think it's prudent to continue to view the course -- likely course, is that the ACL will go up a couple of basis points a quarter like we've done and get into that 1.45 to 1.50 range. At some point, then you'll have seen whatever the recessionary impact is, and then you'll be looking forward and then you may get to the point where you can release some of those reserves depending on what your charge-off experience is. Clearly, Ken, the slower loan growth plays into that, to some degree is mitigating what the build could have been, but anyway, those are the dynamics that like, John, I don't know if you want to add to that?
John Woods : Yes. I'll add that. I mean just for the last couple of quarters, we've had a mild-to-moderate recession built into the. And so our peak-to-trough GDP decline that we have built into our models are 1.5%. That would be a moderate recession at this point. I think the changes you may have seen in the second half of '22 were not quite as much on the expectation that there would be a recession as much as what the collateral value outlook really impact was. So when you think about house prices and used car prices, et cetera, we've been increasing the amount of decline expected. So you've got sort of the low to mid-teens declines now built into our models for both house prices and auto prices over the foreseeable and kind of period. And so that's really -- and that's not really driving a lot of losses, just we've been having a lot of recoveries in the portfolio over the last year or so. And so you may then -- you might see some lower recoveries and that will have the -- you saw our loss that's built into our loss forecast for '23. But I think that's an important item that you saw in 4Q in terms of our outlook for 2023 and 2024.
Kenneth Usdin : Got it. Okay. And just one quick follow-up on the capital point. You're nearing 100% implies a nice incremental step up in the buyback. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the mix of the dividend versus the buyback going forward, yet you obviously moved to $0.42 in the third quarter. Should we also think about that you would be moving the dividend up in line with increased earnings potential as well within that context?
John Woods : Yes. I'd say what we do here is every year, we're on a cadence where post-CCAR, we basically take that as the opportunity to broadly update our capital return profile. Over the medium term, we're looking at 35% to 40% dividend payout. And you saw that in some of our medium-term outlook. We've updated that this is going to be more of a buyback return year in '23 because of the outlook for RWAs. But we take a look at a dividend policy and earnings outlook and update whether there should be a change in the dividend after CCAR. 
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And I would just add to that, Ken, that clearly, with the uncertainty in the environment, we are being cautious in terms of the lending of kind of risk appetite. And so, I think that, in and of itself, creates some additional capital versus what we've had in prior years. I also think we still have our plate full integration of existing acquisitions and we haven't seen a whole lot that's attractive at valuations that we're interested in on the acquisition front. And so I think the combination of operating at very high profitability levels with ROTCE returns in the high teens plus more modest loan growth than historical, more modest acquisition activity than historical creates the opportunity. And I think it's appropriate given the uncertainty and chance for recession that returning capital to shareholders is the right course of action here. So you could expect we would like to raise the dividend during the course of the year, and we'd also like to get close to that 100% return of capital to shareholders.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.
John Pancari : On the overall deposit dynamics, I know you expect a 2% to 3% year-over-year spot decline. Can you maybe give us a little more color on how you expect overall deposit trends to progress through 2023 to get to that 2% to 3% spot decline? Maybe help us with the magnitude of declines that you think is reasonable here in the coming quarters as you look at deposit flows?
John Woods : Yes, sure. I'll jump in there. I mean I think...
Bruce Van Saun : You can just start and then maybe pass it to Don and have Brendan.
John Woods : Sure. Yes. That sounds good. Yes. I mean, I think overall, as I mentioned before, we're seeing deposit migration from a DDA perspective as well as from some of our lower cost levels. But broadly, the mix is superior and improved compared to pre-pandemic. I think we're around 28% DDA in 4Q, that's probably going to tick down a bit, call it to maybe 27% or so by the end of the year. That's part of the story. I'd say the -- some of the higher cost deposits in money markets and savings will be part of the runoff as well such that you get to something along the lines of 2% to 3% declined spot-to-spot end of '22 into '23. And so I'd say that you end up with some, again, improved mix compared to pre-pandemics, but a little bit of mix softening as you get throughout '23. And I'll just...
Bruce Van Saun : I would just add -- I would add to that is that I'd say we did not take in as much surge deposit as many in our peer group. We have a consumer-tilted deposit base, which tends to be more stable. And so, we've been monitoring that surge deposits quite carefully. And we have seen it actually be more sticky than we initially expected. I think where you'd see a slight runoff probably is more on the commercial side where treasurers have other alternatives besides bank deposits to move some money out. But again, we're relatively protected there because we didn't take in a lot of that money in terms of search deposits. So maybe, Don, you could comment here or Brendan?
Don McCree : Yes. I think our spot is down a little less than 2% year-to-year. We actually ended this year a little higher than we thought we were going to because we had some nice inflow at the end of the year. But back to -- I think John said it in comments, we've really transformed our deposit base really off the back of our treasury services business, so both specialty deposit offerings, we've got two that we're now in the market with around ESG, green deposits and carbon offsets and then just the strengthening of our DDA deposits with our treasury services business gives us more stability than we would have had in prior years. So, we feel pretty good about that projection. And we're -- in general, we're really managing the balance sheet from a BSO standpoint and really we're avoiding most new transactions given just the shyness around the credit environment and the uncertainty, and we're moving clients who aren't generating positive returns off the franchise and off the balance sheet. So it gives us a little bit of a dynamic that we don't really need to go chase deposits because we're keeping the loan side relatively modestly in terms of how it grows.
Brendan Coughlin : Yes. Without being too redundant to what John mentioned, I'd say consumer has been broadly stable on deposits, which is a really good thing. And the story for us is going to be controlling the mix, but all indications are quite positive. We look at a lot of benchmarking data, and we're pretty confident that we're performing in the top quartile of our peer banks in terms of retention of low-cost deposits as well as interest-bearing deposit costs so far in the cycle. It's sort of midway through the cycle. So we've got to stay disciplined and manage it well, but it's been driven by a lot of health improvements, household growth, improvements in primacy, mix shift to Bruce's point, we were 45% mass affluent and above five years ago, we're now 60% of our customer base is mass affluent and above. So, the quality has been quite good. On the stimulus front, what we're seeing is the bottom two deciles of our customer base is essentially at the paycheck to paycheck. So that stimulus has already burned off and is in the rearview mirror. So the stimulus that remains with us tends to be with the more affluent customers, whether that's actual stimulus check. So that's balance parking that happened during COVID for not making mortgage payments and not traveling, et cetera, et cetera. We're not actually seeing that burn off as much as we're starting to see that rotate out of low-cost deposits into interest-bearing, which is natural given the stated interest rate. So, we're managing that really tight. All the investments we've made in the franchise, whether analytics, new products, the introduction of CitizensPlus in our Private Client Group as well as having Citizens Access to fence off interest-bearing deposits to maintain discipline in the core have all been really big levers for us to manage well. And all indications we see so far is that we're right on track with where we want it to be and dramatically outperforming where we were last time and up rate cycle and at worst, in line with peers, but some signs that we may be doing a bit better, which is a big turnaround from where we were five, six years ago.
John Pancari : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then separately on the commercial real estate front, I know you stated 60% LTV on overall commercial real estate. Is that origination? And then do you happen to have refreshed LTV? I know you mentioned that a lot of your deals have sponsor participation, but we're hearing that with sponsors exiting or refinancing out certain deals that's impacting the LTV, so the refreshed LTVs may be a better read, particularly on the office front.
John Woods: Yes. The office -- the 60% was the office LTVs in terms of not the overall CRE book. So, we think those are still pretty good. We're refreshing the property by property. We haven't gone through and done a total refresh on the entirety of the book yet, but we're kind of working on the maturing quarter-by-quarter maturities and working with the sponsors to either refinance out, inject equity or adjust the value of the portfolio. And that's what drove the NPL this quarter. It was really one real estate deal.
John Pancari : Okay. Sorry. So that 60% is a refresh number on the office side? Or is it at origination?
John Woods : It's all throughout origination.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. 
Unidentified Analyst: This is [Megan Stein] (ph) on behalf of Matt O'Connor. On capital, so the 9.5% to 10% medium-term CET1 target range, that's well above the regulatory minimum. You've built reserves a lot, and it seems like the conversion time line of ISBC is going really well. So I guess my question is, I hold so much capital down the road given solid reserves and successful deal integration time line?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I would say part of it is just the philosophy of liking to have a strong balance sheet. And so, I think 9.5% to 10% is a strong ratio. You've seen over time that we've originally had a target of 10% to 10.5%, and we've been kind of sliding that down as we -- our profitability goes up. And I think the stakeholders gain more confidence that we have a good strategy, and we're executing well. So it wouldn't surprise me at some point where we start to manage down in that range. I think the time of 2023 today, we're looking at a potential recession to be at the top end of that range makes sense. But once we get to the other side of that to start to move that down and maybe manage that closer to the bottom end of that range will provide more leverage. And then at that point, I think we could step back and say, do we still need 9.5% to 10% or can we skinny that down a little bit? So I think that's all in front of us, we thought at this point, given the dynamics around 2023, it wouldn't make sense to actually move that target range down.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And just a -- second question is just on loans. So, the $3 billion auto runoff will offset growth in other areas this year. What are your expectations for other loan categories in 2023 coming off of a strong 2022?
John Woods : Yes. I'll go ahead and start there and others can chime in. But I mean, I think when you look out into 2023, we still see very, very strong opportunities in the commercial space and within C&I. And I think something to always keep in mind is our utilization is well below where historical levels would imply we should be. And so as you get into the later part of the year, you see some recovery in investments, in inventories and CapEx and possibly M&A, which actually provides financing opportunities. We see lots of opportunities across commercial. And that's really one of the main drivers. When you get into consumer, we're looking at home equity being a place that a place that we like and card and Citizens Pay would contribute as well. So that wraps up to a stable year-over-year loans and back to the point around that being taking that otherwise RWA that would have been deployed against auto and some other categories with lower risk-adjusted returns and giving that back to shareholders.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. 
Manan Gosalia : I just wanted to follow up on the NIM line of questioning. I think you brought down the floor for NIM from 3.25% to 3.2%. Is that also a function of what you mentioned on the DDA migration and the curve and also the fact that you pushed out the forward swaps. Is the biggest variable on that number, mostly the cost of funding side? Or I guess would there be any changes to that 3.2% number, the Fed cuts rates sooner?
Bruce Van Saun : Yes, I'll start and flip to John. It's Bruce. But I think the two numbers are tethered together. So if the 3.50% is now seen to be 3.40%, then your floor is going to also commensurately move lower. The good news is, in a way, is that we've tightened the bottom side of that range. So previously, it was 3.50% down to 3.20%, 3.25%. So, it was 25 basis points and now it's 3.40% to 3.20%. So, it's 20 basis points. So anyway, I think we -- certainly, John's initial answer on the movement down has been focused more on migration, the DDA and low-cost migration, but then also some of the impact from the yield curve on front book back book has been the other dynamic. So those are the things that we're watching. But John, you can out from there.
John Woods : Yes. I'd say the only thing I'd add, just to remember, we constructed -- we modeled that 3.20% and there's a lot of assumptions that go into that with respect to what the mix of the balance sheet would be, et cetera. And what we're assuming is a 200 basis point gradual decline in 2024 that would get you down to that 3.20%. And given that we are still asset sensitive and we haven't closed out that position, that's really what you're seeing in terms of the decline in net interest margin. So as and when we continue to look at ways to lock in protection against down rates, you could see that 3.20% move around based on hedging activities as well as updated views on what the mix of the balance sheet is likely to be in the context of what's the Fed...
Bruce Van Saun : It's a very dynamic process. So we look and see where the forward day rates are going to be. We have our own view of that. We see what the valuations we can get in the hedge market are. And you can be assured, I think we played our hand quite well so far, and we'll continue to stay really focused on.
Manan Gosalia : I appreciate that. And then separately, just on the program. Can you unpack some of the drivers there of the $100 million in pre-tax benefits and maybe how quickly those can come out from the expense base over the course of the year?
John Woods : Yes, I'll go and cover that. I'd say the one dynamic to keep in mind is that we tend to form these programs and generate a year-end run rate benefit that will contribute for each of them. Mostly on the one hand, the $100 million will build throughout '23 so that it gets to a run rate when you get to the fourth quarter of '23. But keep in mind, we did the same thing with TOP 7. So, there's a full-year effect of TOP 7 that comes in. And so when the programs are reasonably similarly sized, you can almost use that as an estimate of what the contribution is in any given year. And so you have maybe a combined $100 million plus contribution from the full-year effect of TOP 7 hitting '23 and the in-year effective TOP 8 hitting '23. And so the big drivers of that really you've got the traditional areas that we focus on, which is third-party costs and vendor cost management, which is an area that's been contributing over the years as well as continue to optimize the branch network. And just being really careful about ensuring that our organizational approach is fit for purpose with respect to what we're trying to accomplish in '23. So those are more traditional areas. The other places we're looking at that have been more recent include maturing our Agile delivery model away from a waterfall approach to agile and next-gen technology initiatives continue to contribute as well. We're working towards a data center exit in 2025. We're looking to migrate to the cloud from our internal applications, and that's contributing in '23 as well. But there's a lot of very strategic sort of initiatives that are built within the TOP 8 program and we're excited about it. It's part of who we are, and we're looking forward to deliver against that next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
Vivek Juneja : A couple of questions for you folks. Firstly, the deposit betas that you expect to get to the high 30s. Given the pace of change in the fourth quarter, should we and your expectation for rate hikes early in the year and not after that, should we expect you get to that in Q1? Any color on that, on the pace of it, especially given how rates have been going up?
John Woods : Yes. I mean I think we'll not get there in Q1. That is an over-the-year expectation in terms of the cumulative growth. I mean I think you'll see the growth in cumulative betas begin to moderate and flatten out. You have the big jumps early in the cycle. So, we began and go way back to the second quarter of '22, our cumulative beta was 6%. And then you get to the fourth quarter, the cumulative beta is 29. So you've got 23 points just in '22 and you'll have -- and then we're looking for in '23 is another 9 points. So, this -- and it will increase over time. You won't get to 38 in the first quarter and will gradually...
Bruce Van Saun : Deposit tend to replace reprice with a lag. So even after the Fed pauses, you still see a little bit of upward pressure on those betas.
John Woods : That's right.
Vivek Juneja : But I would -- okay. But then does that mean, Bruce, the bulk of it is probably early on and just a little further increase after that, after the Fed is done?
John Woods : I'd say the majority in 1H and it continues to trickle-in in 2H, and that's built into our outlook.
Vivek Juneja : Okay. Different question, a second one. Fee income, your guide of about 7% to 9% growth in full-year '23 versus '22. How much of that would you expect would come from capital markets or at least what's in your forecast that you're thinking how much comes from capital markets?
John Woods : Yes, I think there's a big part of it. I mean, back to the big drivers, you had capital markets, and you heard about card fees from Brendan and wealth from Brendan as well. So those are the three big ones. You see mortgage really potentially rebounding as well.
Bruce Van Saun : A little bit of rebounding.
John Woods : But a big part of it would come from capital markets from the underwriting perspective and M&A advisory, just as we may have mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw some deals pushed from 4Q into 1Q. So that's going to support the capital markets business, which, by the way, over the years, has really become a very diversified capital markets business itself. I mean just broadening out M&A advisory, underwriting and loan syndications. Those businesses really tend to really diversify our overall fee outlook. But yes, a good part of it and a good chunk of the growth in '23 comes from capital markets.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks. 
Bruce Van Saun : Okay. Great. So, thanks again, everyone, for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-19 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alan, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded.  Now I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.
Kristin Silberberg: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our third quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our third quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We delivered another very strong quarterly result in Q3. Rising rates positively impacted our net interest income and net interest margin. Fees and expenses were broadly stable and credit performance remains excellent. We grew average loans 2% and deposits 1% as our liquidity and funding position remains strong and our CET1 ratio of 9.8% is above the midpoint of our 9.5% to 10% target range. Our TCE to total asset ratio sits at 6.1%. Performance metrics include a net interest margin of 3.25% and that's up 21 basis points. We had positive sequential operating leverage of 6%. We had hit an efficiency ratio below 55% and our return on tangible common equity was around 18%. We built our credit reserves by $49 million with our ACL at 1.41%, and that's above the 1. 3% day 1 CECL reserve adjusted for the Investors acquisition. Beyond these impressive financial results, we've continued to make good progress in executing our strategic initiatives. In Consumer, we launched Citizens Private Client, which will help drive wealth opportunities. We migrated our national digital bank to a modern cloud-based platform. We continue to grow share with Citizens Pay, and we're executing well on our expansion into New York City Metro region. In Commercial, we've successfully integrated recent acquisitions like JMP and DH Capital into our coverage and product model. Our M&A pipelines are at record levels and our geographic and industry vertical build-out is delivering strong results in terms of market share gains. Enterprise wide, we're successfully ramping up our TOP 7 program, while building out TOP 8. Stay tuned on that. Our NextGen Tech program has really been the standout initiative that has been a game changer for us. These programs demonstrate our mindset of continuous improvement finding ways to run the bank more efficiently so we can deliver positive operating leverage and self-fund investments for our future. We're also doing some interesting things in DSG such as developing a carbon offset program for clients as well as investing in a virtual power agreement that delivers clean energy, and we have more interesting innovation in the pipeline. As we look forward to Q4 in 2023, we feel that we are well positioned to deliver strong results and to keep growing and enhancing our franchise value. We are well prepared for challenges that may materialize in the macro environment with a really strong balance sheet position and highly prudent credit risk appetite. But we also plan to keep playing disciplined offense with continuing investments in our growth initiatives. The current environment gives us a great opportunity to prove our metal and deliver responsible, sustainable growth. One aspect that we emphasize in today's presentation is our confidence in the quality of our deposit base, but we've been able to transform over time. We've had good deposit stability over the past couple of quarters, as some peers are seeing outflows, and our deposit betas are back in line with the pack. We're seeing very strong loan betas and expect these to remain above deposit betas through 2024, assuming the current forward curve. As a result, our NIM will continue to rise more gradually as time goes on. We've also layered in sizable net interest rate hedges to protect NIM and ROTCE through 2024 if the Fed reverses and brings down short-term rates, moving off of the zero bound for short rates has unlocked the value of our deposit franchise and significantly benefited our ROTCE. With a clearer macro outlook and less market volatility, we feel the value of our commercial bank build-out will also manifest, benefiting further our ROTCE. So very exciting time for Citizens.  And with that, I'll stop and turn it over to John to cover the financials in more detail. John?
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with our headlines for the quarter, referencing Slide 5. We reported underlying net income of $669 million and EPS of $1.30. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 17.9%. Net interest income was up 11% linked quarter, driven by a 21 basis point improvement in margin to 3.25% and 2% growth in average interest-earning assets. Average loans are up 2% linked quarter, with 3% growth in commercial. Fees were fairly stable, down 2% linked quarter as our client hedging business returned to more historical levels following an exceptional first half of the year and mortgage results softened a bit. Capital markets fees and service charges were stable. We remain highly disciplined on expenses, which are up 1% linked quarter. Overall, we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of 6% linked quarter, and our underlying efficiency ratio improved to 54.9%. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $123 million and a reserve build of $49 million this quarter, which reflects an increased risk of recession, partly offset by improvement in portfolio mix. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.41%, up from 1.37% at the end of the second quarter and compares with a pro forma day 1 CECL reserve of approximately 1.3%. Our tangible book value per share is down 8.6% linked quarter, driven by the impact of higher long-term rates on AOCI. We continue to have a very strong capital position with our CET1 ratio at 9.8%, just above the midpoint of our target range. Next, I'll provide further details related to third quarter results. On Slide 6, net interest income was up 11%, given higher net interest margin and 2% growth in interest-earning assets. The net interest margin was 3.25%, up 21 basis points. As you can see on the new block in the bottom left-hand side of the slide, the healthy increase in asset yields outpaced funding costs, reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. Moving to Slide 7. With the current expectation for the Fed to rates further, we are confident that we will continue to realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out. Our asset sensitivity has driven a significant improvement in NII year-to-date and those benefits will continue to accumulate into the fourth quarter and compound into 2023. Our overall asset sensitivity increased to approximately 3.3% at the end of the third quarter, up from 2.6% for the second quarter, primarily driven by the impact of variable rate loan originations. Our asset sensitivity will allow us to have further upside as the forward curve continues to evolve. We expect cumulative loan betas to exceed the positive betas through the rate cycle. Our interest-bearing deposit beta is tracking well within our expectations, and the ultimate outcome will depend upon the pace and level of Fed rate hikes from here. So far in this cycle, with Fed funds increasing 225 basis points since 4Q '21, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta is well controlled at 18% through the end of the third quarter. On a sequential basis, our deposit beta was 26%. We began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity and funding profile, including significant improvements through our deposit mix and capabilities. We will continue to optimize our deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits. We continue to execute our hedging strategy to managing a more predictable and stable outlook for NII as we benefit from the higher rate environment. You'll find a summary of our hedge position in the appendix on Slide 23. In the third quarter, we did an additional $10 billion of hedges with a focus on extending our protection out through 2024 and beyond, primarily through forward starting swaps. We expect our NIM to rise to 3.5% or better by the end of 2023 and for our overall hedge position to provide a NIM floor of about 3.25% through the fourth quarter of 2024 if we see rates come down by 200 basis points across the forward curve before it could move higher with further hedge actions. Moving on to Slide 8. We posted good fee results despite headwinds from continued market volatility and higher rates. These were fairly stable, down 2% linked quarter as our client hedging business returned to more historical levels following an exceptional first half of the year. Car fees were strong again this quarter, while capital markets and service charges were stable. Focusing on capital markets, market volatility continued to impact the bond and equity markets. M&A advisory fees picked up nicely, but this was offset by lower loan syndication revenue amid increased economic uncertainty and market volatility. We continue to see good strength in our M&A pipeline to continue to build with strong pinch activity and a growing backlog. While current market volatility may constrain the ability for deals to close, capital markets fees should see some seasonal improvement in the fourth quarter, particularly in M&A advisory even more broadly if markets settle down. Mortgage fees were softer as the higher rate environment weighed on production volumes, which more than offset the fact that production margins improved modestly this quarter, but still remain below historical levels. We are seeing signs of the industry reducing capacity, which should benefit margins over time and servicing operating fees were stable. Wealth fees are $5 million lower linked quarter given the impact of lower market levels on AUM. And in other income, we saw a seasonal benefit from our tax advantaged investments and an increase in leasing revenue. On Slide 9, expenses were well controlled, up 1% linked quarter. Our TOP 7 efficiency program is continuing to make good progress and is on track to deliver over $115 million of pretax run rate benefits by the end of the year. Average loans on Slide 10 were up 2% linked quarter driven by 3% growth in commercial with growth in C&I and CRE, given modestly higher loan utilization and slower paydowns. Retail loans increased 1% with growth in mortgage and home equity, offsetting planned runoff in auto. Period-end loans were broadly stable linked quarter given higher-than-usual end-of-quarter C&I line paydown, which were generally redrawn after quarter end. On Slide 11, average deposits were up $1.3 billion or 1% linked quarter, with growth coming from retail term deposits and Citizens Access savings and commercial banking deposits were broadly stable. Deposit costs remain well controlled. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 38 basis points, which translates to an 18% cumulative beta. We feel good about how we are optimizing deposit costs in this rate environment, and our performance to date is reflective of the investments need to strengthen our deposit franchise since the IPO. Overall, liquidity improved as we reduced our FHLB advances by $2.3 billion and increased our cash position at quarter end. Moving on to Slide 12. We saw good credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were 19 basis points, up 6 basis points linked quarter, but still very low relative to historical levels. Nonperforming loans were broadly stable at 55 basis points of total loans. Given the higher risk of recession, we are watching our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress, in particular, pre office, leveraged loans and selected nonprofit sectors. At this point, we aren't seeing significant issues emerge. Also, the leading indicators for consumer continue to be stable and favorable to pre-pandemic levels. Personal disposable income has declined from stimulus-driven highs but remains above the pre-pandemic 2019 average. Spending for travel and restaurants remain steady and above pre-pandemic levels, while credit card and home equity line utilization are still well below pre-pandemic levels. And retail delinquencies continue to remain favorable to historical levels. Turning to Slide 13. I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We continue to see very good credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios. While we aren't seeing stress in the portfolio at this point, we increased our allowance by $49 million to take into account an increased risk of recession, partly offset by improvement in portfolio mix. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.41% which is a modest increase from the second quarter. If you recall, when we adopted CECL at the beginning of 2020, our coverage ratio was 1.47%. However, given the Investors acquisition and some shifts in the portfolio mix, we estimate our pro forma day 1 CECL allowance to be approximately 1.3%. The current reserve level contemplates a shallow recession and incorporates the risk of added stress on certain portfolios including those subject to higher risk term inflation, supply chain issues and return to office trends. Moving to Slide 14. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 9.8%, which is slightly above the midpoint of our target range. This, combined with our strong earnings outlook puts us in a position to resume share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Tangible book value per share and the tangible common equity ratios were both reduced by the impact of higher long-term rates on AOCI. We have increased our held to maturity portfolio for about 30% of total loans at quarter end which has helped to mitigate the impact of rising rates. Our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed, and you can expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage capital allocation. Shifting gears a bit. On Slides 15 and 16, you'll see some examples of the progress we made against the key strategic initiatives and what's on tap for our businesses in the near term. Since we closed the Investors acquisition in April, we've been executing against a phased approach to the integration. In the second quarter, we began originating mortgages on our systems. And since then, we have completed the conversion of mortgage servicing. We also successfully completed the conversion of more than 10,000 Investors' wealth clients, representing about $1.6 billion in assets to our platform. We have a lot more to do, but I'm pleased to say that we are on track to complete the deposit and branch conversions in mid-first quarter 2023. We have included a high-level integration timeline in the appendix on Slide 22. Importantly, we remain on target to achieve our planned $130 million of run rate net expense synergies by the end of 2023 of which approximately 70% will be achieved by the end of 2022. We also continue to expect that the integration costs will come in below our initial estimates. In the last three years, we have launched a collection of new banking products and features that make it easier to bank with us. Last week, we announced the next step in that evolution with CitizensPlus, which provides financial rewards, banking features and tailored advice that grows with customers from everyday banking to personalized wealth management. This includes Citizens Private Client our new expanded wealth management offering, which will launch by the end of the year. We are fully committed to driving momentum in our wealth business. And as part of the launch, we are hiring more than 200 new financial advisors and relationship managers. We continue to make meaningful strides forward with our national digital strategy and tech modernization. Earlier this year, we migrated Citizens Access to a fully cloud native platform, and we launched a national storefront adding mortgage and education refis to the portal. Over the next year or so, we plan to expand our national storefront, adding card and checking first and then Wealth and Citizens Pay. As we add products to the platform, we have an exciting opportunity to build relationships across a growing national customer base. Our vision is to migrate our core branch deposits to this modern platform over time, which will be a key change in efficiency and flexibility in terms of implementing upgrades and enhancements. We are also growing our innovative Citizens Pay offering, which is currently at about 160 merchant partners and expanding across targeted verticals. Over the next year, we are working to launch a new mobile app and a unique customer direct experience. Moving to the commercial business on Slide 16. Over the past eight years, we've invested heavily in talent and product capabilities in M&A, corporate finance, bond and equity underwriting, FX and commodities and so on. Despite the challenging environment, we remain near the top of the league tables, consistently ranking in the top 10 as a middle market and sponsor book runner and helping corporates and private equity sponsors access capital through the public markets. We have also integrated our cash management and global market solutions as well with our coverage. We are excited about the potential synergies from our recent acquisitions as we target growth in key verticals the JMP acquisition gets us much deeper into the growing healthcare, technology and financial services sectors, expands our equity underwriting and adds research capabilities and DH Capital expands our capabilities in the Internet infrastructure, communication sectors, software and next-generation IT services. These businesses are exceptionally well positioned for when markets reopen. Moving to Slide 17, I'll walk through the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect NII to be up roughly 3%, driven by the benefit of higher rates with a margin rising to the 3.3% to 3.35% range. Average loans are expected to be stable to up modestly as commercial growth is partially offset by order rundown. These are expected to be stable to up modestly. Noninterest expense is expected to be stable. Net charge-offs are expected to be approximately 20 basis points to 22 basis points. We expect our CET1 ratio to land near the upper end of our target range of 9.5% to 10%. And our tax rate should come in at approximately 22%.  With respect to the full year, we continue to track well and expect to beat our full year 2022 guidance across key P&L categories and performance measures. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for full year 2022 in excess of 5%, with fourth quarter sequential positive operating leverage of about 3%. We also expect to deliver a full year efficiency ratio of about 57% with the fourth quarter coming in under 54%. And we expect to deliver a full year ROTCE in excess of 16% with the fourth quarter well above both Q3 and our medium-term target range of 14% to 16%. To sum up, on Slide 18, we delivered a strong quarter amid a dynamic environment, and we are optimistic about the outlook for the fourth quarter and into 2023. We expect to continue to see significant benefits in our net interest income from the higher rate environment. Our diverse fee business is driving solid results and our capital markets business, in particular, is well positioned for when markets stabilize. And our commitment to operating efficiency remains a hallmark. We are well prepared for a slowdown in the environment with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position, and we are being prudent with respect to our credit risk appetite and loan growth. At the same time, we are playing some offense, executing well on strategic initiatives in each of our businesses that will deliver medium-term growth and outperformance.  With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Alan, why don't we open it up for some Q&A?
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
Scott Siefers : If you could expand a little on your thoughts regarding NII dynamics into next year? I thought the 3.50 year-end '23 margin expectation. That was definitely a highlight. And I think just generally, your comments about loan betas overwhelming deposit betas sort of cumulatively those suggest some confidence that and I should continue to grow after the Fed stops tightening, but I just would love to hear your thoughts on the puts and takes and the additional color you might be willing to add.
John Woods : Yes, sure. So just break it down into two overall categories. You've got the net interest margin dynamic, which is a big driver, and we're messaging that. We expect our net interest margin to continue to rise. I think loan betas in the last cycle for us were up near 60% or so this cycle, we're doing some more hedging. So you could see our loan betas dropping a little bit. The nice part about that is that it provides a downside protection. So you're going to see loan betas in the mid- to -- sort of low to mid-50s. You compare that to a deposit beta, that we previously messaged, would be around 35% or so. Rates have been up 100 basis points since then. I mean you could see our deposit betas may be getting into the upper 30s or thereabouts given -- cumulatively what's going on with rates in the last -- in the recent couple of months. So you take that dynamic and see cumulative loan betas and exceeding deposit betas and that drives names higher. We're also remixing on the loan side into more variable. You're seeing the strength of the multiyear investments on the deposit side playing. And then let's not forget the other aspects of the balance sheet where you've got securities book and that securities book is funded primarily by DDA and some wholesale. And so you can see the front book, back book dynamics really taking hold where you've got securities yields on the front book in the fourth quarter somewhere between 4.50% and 5% with a 2% runoff. And so that's pretty powerful when you've got essentially a strong DDA underpinning what's going on there in the securities book. So those are some of the net interest margin dynamics. If you flip forward to the other side of things where you see our opportunity for continued loan growth, we're -- you're seeing us rotate into more of a variable rate approach, solid opportunities in home equity and other aspects in the retail side. But commercial is -- we're feeling optimistic on the commercial side and that's going to drive loan growth into '23. It will be economic environment dependent. But nevertheless, the underpinning of rising NIMs, I think, is really what gives us the confidence to continue to see that NII improving into '23.
Scott Siefers : All right. That's perfect color. And I guess just with rates having moved so much, just curious about your thoughts on sort of the Citizens Access products. What kind of trends are you observing about sort of the stickiness of those customers? How much is loyal? How much are sort of shopping for rates? And are your tactics at all changing with regards to that product?
Bruce Van Saun : Brendan, why don't you take that one?
Brendan Coughlin : Yes. Thanks. We're seeing some decent growth in Citizens Access. And the digital native customer still existing out there, and it's waking up a little bit as rates have gone up. So we're -- it's been a very, very effective strategy for us. The customers are loyal to Citizens. We're seeing good augmentation from those customers, a very real brand engaged customers. And the customer base is growing. So our balance growth is coming from both sides, new customer acquisition and existing customers bringing us more as we brought rates up. But most importantly, it serves to sort of have an isolated deposit-raising strategy to protect the core bank from needing to bring in rate-sensitive customers into the bank. We're really relationship focused in our core franchise and the combination of the health of our deposit franchise improvement led by DDA and privacy of our customers has been really showing up well. So our deposit betas in consumer are dramatically different than they were in the last cycle. And it's really for both of those points, the turnaround and the health of the customer franchise and the core bank and then the effective strategy of using access both to drive national growth but also to have a much more targeted and isolated way to grow interest-bearing deposits. It doesn't make us reprice our whole book. So we're really pleased with how it's playing out. And Citizens Access is right where we thought it would be, and it's being executed really well.
John Woods : Then the strategic aspects of Citizens Access that over time is just another benefit of that platform.
Brendan Coughlin : Correct. I think that's what, obviously, we've messaged on these calls before. But the integration of our Citizens Access deposit platform with all of our national lending businesses to make our national platform much more integrated and customer strategic. John mentioned the launch of our new app and our cloud-based migration. We are making really sizable progress on bringing together all of our national capabilities to deepen those relationships as well as just sort of the deposit angle that we launched with a couple of years back.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.
Erika Najarian : My first question is for you, Bruce. You have teased that your TOP 8 is underway. And as we think about how much you've improved the bank, and John has certainly helped balance sheet and Brendon and Don have helped balance sheet positioning, what is your vision for what Top could accomplish? So we're looking at a bank clearly outperforming the market today, outperforming expectations. It feels like a lot of the big rates of change have been accomplished in the previous 7 plans. So and that's sort of the genesis of the question. What do you envision TOP 8 to accomplish?
Bruce Van Saun : Yes. Well, Erika, I think when we ended up hitting the TOP 2 and TOP 3, we were getting questions as to how much re-architecture and reengineering of how you're running the bank is left. Is the -- are you now picking the fruit that's really high in the tree. And yes, it was getting higher in the tree. But I think what we've been able to do is exhibit this mindset of continuous improvement that we're not going to be satisfied with how we're running the bank and we're going to look at all aspects in terms of how we're staffed and organized and our vendor relationships and other kind of efficiency new technology deployment to deliver more efficiencies. And so over time, that's just become part of our DNA here. And so we're not going to rest and say, well, we just had another successful result with TOP 7. Let's take a breather, you really can't take a breather because we have investments that we want to fund in our future, the business initiatives that we list on a couple of the slides in Consumer and Commercial, and that requires net investment in CapEx and OpEx and in order to fund those things, having these top programs and finding efficiencies to self-finance those investments and keep the overall rate of expense growth modest is the equation that we've used to drive ROTCE from the 5% when we started at the IPO to 18% levels today. So I think you're going to continue to see us pursue that mindset of continuous improvement and don't be surprised when we have a successful announcement and execution of TOP 8 that there might be even more TOP programs down the road after that.
Erika Najarian : Got it. And just a few clean-up questions. Thank you so much for giving us a lot of color on the ACL. I'm wondering what the weighted average unemployment rate that you assume in the 1.41 ACL today. And just, John, a quick clean-up question to Scott's line of questioning. As we think about the NII dynamics into next year, what are you assuming about deposit growth and deposit mix shift?
Bruce Van Saun : Yes. I'll just take the -- the first one is, we're using some fairly conservative assumptions when we set the ACL. So I would characterize it as a moderate recession rather than a short recession. And the unemployment levels get up over 6% is kind of where we've modeled it. So we think we're being fairly conservative, but we reassess that each quarter. So John, I'll hand the deposit question over to you.
John Woods : Yes, sure. And I think some of the trends that you'll likely see into the fourth quarter continue into '23. But I'd say the couple of items I'd highlight are starting with the customer value proposition that you're seeing us continue to invest in. It's been multi-years to build this deposit platform. And in both Consumer and Commercial those investments are coming to fruition and demonstrating themselves that we're continuing to invest. So you're seeing just core deposit growth coming from that. And you heard Brendan and us talk about CitizensPlus as an example of the core growth that we think can give us some unique ability to take some share into '23. Citizens Access and the retail CD arena is a place where we -- we have taken that down close to zero. And so that will come back a bit in that category. Let's not forget New York Metro. We've entered New York Metro and we're starting to see really nice uptake that once we converted HSBC, we're going to convert ISBC in the first quarter in '23. So we suspect that we're going to start to see some lift coming out of that. And then just broadly in commercial, the product and coverage investments that we've been making over the years and continue to make will offset what we're building in what I've just described will offset our expectation, we're going to have some DDA migration as rates rise. So that's built into our outlook and built into the NIM guide that we're going to have some realistic expectations of the migration. So it was just some of the areas I would highlight.
Operator: Your next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Matthew O'Connor : Some really good detail on credit back in the appendix, Page 24 for retail and 25 on commercial. And obviously, you guys have improved the mix in both areas over the last few years. But are there any signs of weakness within certain kind of customer groups that you could point to? And then like what leading indicators might you suggest that we watch and that you pay attention to.
Bruce Van Saun : Yes, I'll start and then maybe turn it over to my colleagues for some additional color. But Matt, I think what continues to be very positive is that the expectation that things will normalize back to pre-COVID levels continues to be deferred. And so we're only seeing very slow migration in terms of consumer charge-offs and NPAs and delinquencies still kind of better than pre-pandemic period. And I would highlight there that our focus on very high-quality borrowers in these portfolios, super prime and high prime, those folks are still doing pretty well through the current environment and have a lot of liquidity. And so we feel really good about where things sit in Consumer. Similarly, in Commercial, over time we've migrated to lend to kind of bigger companies, so mid-corporate space companies with in excess of 500 in revenues, and they tend to be more diversified and better credits. And so we also see very solid performance metrics across all the things, NPAs and charge-offs, et cetera. On that side, you've got to go to the usual suspects, if you think the economy is weakening, and that would be commercial real estate, leveraged lending. And then maybe certain sectors in non-profit, which we've heightened our monitoring in those areas, but we don't see any smoke at this point. So maybe with that, let me turn it to Don for additional color on.
Don McCree: Yes, I think you hit it. We've actually activated our downturn playbook, which involves a lot of incremental stressing, a lot of incremental portfolio management and a lot of incremental conversations with clients. I think there's a couple of pieces of good news just supporting the lack of deterioration in credit. One is -- we think management teams going through the pandemic, got incredibly focused on efficiency in their business and they cut costs and they automate it and they built liquidity and the repaired balance sheets and they hedged and they did a lot of things that were prudent from a risk standpoint. So there's a little bit of a buffer, we think, in the portfolio against what could be deterioration if we go into a deep recession. I'd say the thing we're most focused on is the real estate office portfolio given back to work. We've got fully leased office buildings and those leases are running for a couple of years in the future, but we've got lease rolls that we're focused on and whether they're going to renew or not. I think just personally, I guess I was in New York City yesterday, people are back in the office…
Bruce Van Saun : And the other thing is that the high percentage of our office property is A caliber…
Don McCree : Yes, yes. And then a lot of it's suburban. So it's in the right places. And a lot of it's in places which are in the Southern tier and things like that. So we don't have a lot of San Francisco, for example, where they're going to have -- there's going to be a lot of distress. So MSAs are important in the real estate business. And I think the leverage book is, that you always look at the leverage -- the sponsor leverage for our strategy there, which is high levels of diversification. Our average hold is kind of $10 million to $12 million. So we do a lot of leverage finance, but we distribute 95% to 97% of it. So -- and we're not really seeing any kind of severe stress in the leverage book. So we feel pretty good. And all the early stats, the crit-class ratios, the nonperforming loans, the watch assets, which we have very significant process around, all seem to be in pretty good shape right now, but we're not… The other thing I'll mention, and John touched on this, we are being incredibly disciplined on new originations. We're really not taking on any new clients right now. We're getting very focused on returns. We're actually commanding a higher level of pricing given the current market environment. So we're watching the front book very carefully also.
Bruce Van Saun : Yes. How about you, Brendan?
Brendan Coughlin : Yes. I'd say the health of the consumer is still very, very resilient. Having said that, -- we're doing a lot of the similar things that Don is mentioning, kind of putting in a proactive approach to a potential downturn. So making investments in collections be ready for an inevitable tick in the wrong direction. We're tightening some credit on the margins. We're being incredibly disciplined on where we're lending right now to make sure that the returns are right, and we got real customer relationships, and it's within the risk profile that is within our risk appetite. Having said all that, with what we're seeing kind of out the window today, the consumer is still 20% plus excess liquidity in deposits as a general statement, and charge-offs are still 50% to 60% of the rates that they were pre-COVID, and we're not seeing any meaningful signs of that reinflating. If you look at the overall U.S. the bottom decile or two of the country, you're starting to see that excess deposits burn off and they're living more paycheck to paycheck, which is where they were pre-COVID. We don't over-index on that segment. And so we index much higher. And so we're not seeing a lot of the pain that is potentially happening at the very bottom of the segment in the U.S. flowing through anything in our book. Look, we're seeing some very, very early signs that potentially were at the early days of a normalization. Credit card customers that pay in full each month. That was about 32% of our portfolio pre-COVID. It's now at 41%. It peaked at 42%. So it's down a tiny bit, but it's still significantly better than what was before COVID. So we're starting to see small signs of potentially customers getting to, but I wouldn't say it's accelerating at all. It's still very resilient and significantly healthier than where it was pre-COVID.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.
Ebrahim Poonawala : Just wanted to follow up one on credit. I think if I heard you correctly that your ACL assumes a 6% unemployment rate. Just I mean, I think CECL is still relatively new. I'm trying to understand, absent that unemployment rate expectations going materially higher. Just if you could give us the thought process around drivers of additional reserve build over the coming quarters? Is it the CRE market? Is it home prices? But what I'm trying to get to is unemployment at 3.5%, 6% seems a long ways away. If that doesn't go much higher, what else would drive those reserves materially higher relative to where we ended the quarter?
John Woods : Yes, I'll go ahead and start there. I mean I think that, first, I'd like to just make sure we're reminded. So we've got 141 basis points against the portfolio right now, when you pro forma adjust that for Investors and some other things, you get a day 1 of about 130. So we're 11 basis points over day 1. So that covers a lot. And so we're covering the environment that Bruce described earlier. I think you could -- and he also mentioned a few pockets of areas that we're watching very closely. So we're watching the CRE office space, and we're watching a few sectors on the C&I side. Just reminding that we're not seeing any -- when you look at where delinquencies are, we're not seeing any early signs of any deterioration here. But that could change, and that could change quickly. So we're keeping a close eye on it.  But -- and as things turn, we'll have those areas of concern that we were focused on in the pandemic, which -- most of which got cleaned out and has been improved over time, but those are -- that's the playbook we'll go back to. We'll go back to those areas of concern and take from there.
Bruce Van Saun : I would just add that I think we're feeling pretty good. If you look at a scenario that says we get to a moderate recession and it doesn't get any worse, then the need to actually keep building may lessen from what it was this quarter. I think there was a reassessment, but the Fed is going to have to stay at higher rates, which probably increases the probability of recession a little bit, and that was reflected in going up before basis points. So you'd have to see even greater conviction that we're likely to hit a recession or the Fed is going to go higher with rates, which is going to have more collateral damage for the need to build on the macro outlook. Of course, the other things that contribute to higher provision is loan growth. So if we have loan growth and then I think also as John indicated, if we have a kind of changing view on certain sector risks, we already have overlays, for example, for the things we mentioned. We have kind of reserve built for commercial real estate office. We think that's sufficient, but our view on that could change over time. So I think we're kind of sitting at a pretty good spot now. We'll have to wait and see what happens with the macro forecast in certain sectors and the amount of loan growth that comes through those things would determine whether we have to keep building the reserve and how much. I would say that I think that the concerns that we're going to be building the way we did during the pandemic and oh my gosh, these numbers can be kind of a runaway freight train. We don't see that at all at this point. So I think those fears are overblown. It's probably one of the reasons that's cast a pall over thanks to valuations. But at this point, we don't see that.
Ebrahim Poonawala : That's good color. And just one question, Bruce, on the New York strategy. So once you complete Investors integration first quarter next year, give us a sense of like should we expect like are you adding new bankers? What are the capabilities you're adding to the franchise, just given how huge that market can be in terms of just market share gains, not just for next year, but for the next few years, yes?
Bruce Van Saun : Sure. So I'll start, and then maybe I'll ask Don and Brendan to talk about their businesses. But I think that theory has been that we bring a thoughtful approach to how we bank these markets. We really understand neighborhoods. We understand individuals, and we really tailor advice to situations to where somebody is on their life journey kind of where they reside, et cetera.  And on the corporate side, we also want to be that thought leadership position where we're the trusted advisor to a company as its negotiating its many challenges in trying to achieve growth. And we've been able to stake out that ground successfully in the major cities that we compete in. We do it well in Boston. We do it well in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, some of our other big cities. And so notwithstanding the fact that New York is a relatively crowded and competitive marketplace. We think that our style can be successful in New York. It's going to take a little time. We've bought some good foundational assets. We need to bring our additional kind of culture and approach and bring our broader product set so we can do more for customers and give them more advice and better capabilities, better customer experience, but we think we'll be successful in that over time. So in effect, this is a bet on ourselves. And so far, everything is tracking exactly the way we had expected with little signs of green shoots that we're kind of on to something pretty good.  With that, let me maybe go to Brendan first and talk about the consumer and small business side and kind of where you're making investments and in a view of the future.
Brendan Coughlin : Yes. We're incredibly pleased with start in New York City post the HSBC acquisition. And as John mentioned, too, we've already started some integration with Investors on mortgage and wealth in New Jersey and some of the borrowers in New York. We're hiring. So we're hiring up investment, financial advisors, mortgage loan officers and business bankers. We're also restacking the retail organization and using talent across the board. And so far, it has really paid dividends. The New York market -- and from a branch network standpoint is the most productive market out of any of our markets so far. Early days, which is an incredibly good early sign. And we're getting a lot of customers coming back to us from some of the big banks, including HSBC customers that enjoyed -- that we didn't buy, but enjoyed the location of the people, and we're really starting to see some growth. Typically, when you do a branch deposit deal, you see some deposit runoff to the tune of 10% to 20% in the first year. We're actually seeing the opposite. The underlying retail deposit base is actually net growing in New York right away, we didn't have any attrition post legal day 1. So there's a long way for us to continue to build share and that's early signs, but we're very bullish on what we're seeing so far. And then the Investors franchise, they kind of lead business banking more than consumer and we're excited about that. We think the Investors' capabilities and their distribution can help us accelerate our business banking strategy overall across the franchise. And then when we put our consumer playbook on the investor franchise, we're seeing this big benefit already of HSBC, and they were principally a retail franchise. When we put that on the Investors franchise that didn't have a meaningful retail presence. The difference from what we bought and what we can build over time is even more substantial. So we're very excited about it. There's still a lot to do, but early signs are very positive.
Don McCree : I would point at three things. One is the ability, as you said, is to deliver a much broader product set into the existing Investors franchise. So greatly expanded treasury services capabilities, for example, the ability to hedge directly for clients, and that's well underway. And we pick up a lot of very good bankers from the investor side. So our workforce kind of quadruples overnight just with the acquisition. Second thing is we're going to benefit on the commercial side from all the branding that Brendan was doing. So the visibility in New York City of branches and advertising and the like is the name recognition is helpful. So we don't have to explain what Citizens is to potential new clients. And we are also hiring. We announced yesterday a new Market Head for New York City Metro, which came from JPMorgan. So we've got a new leader in place in New York, and we're off to the races.
Operator: Your next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Gerard Cassidy : First, kudos for a very good slide presentation, you guys gave quite a bit of detail. It's one of the best out there. So John, talking about your hedges that you put into place, Slide 23 gives us a good breakout of what you have in place. Can you share with us -- obviously, it's protecting should rates start to go down, I would assume in late '23 and into '24. What kind of rate environment would work against what you just put into place or what you've had in place and you put more into place this quarter? What kind of rate outlook would that -- this would not really work that well with.
John Woods : Yes. I mean, well, let me just start off with I think that the point of getting those hedges on in the third quarter was to allow ourselves to continue to participate in 2023 with rates rising. And so the intent of all of that was to look past this next year into '24 and '25 and say, if in fact, we end up with a lower regime in those years, let's try to find ourselves into a floor that would help maintain the level of ROTCEs that we're trying to achieve. And so we're stabilizing revenues and stabilizing our returns by doing this. Now of course, there's a trade-off. That trade-off is if rates instead of beginning to come down in '24 they were to remain high or go even higher, that would be an opportunity cost. But nevertheless, on an absolute basis, we've got very attractive returns being locked in through this strategy. And I think that's really what we're trying to achieve.
Bruce Van Saun : Gerard, it's tricky. You're trying to find a sweet spot and you're looking at the forward curve and talking to economists, looking at economic forecasts and leaving yourself enough upside participation for high rates, but then also recognizing that they're not going to stay up forever and trying to floor out your downside. And so the time will tell. Hindsight is always 2020. If you went too early or you missed the window, if you had held off another six months because you've gotten better levels. But right now, we feel -- we've done a pretty good job of, as you can see from the results today, we're still asset sensitive. We're still benefiting as rates go up. And now we can sleep at night that we're not going to see ROTCE slide down the pole if rates turn around and go back down.
Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Is it safe to assume all the counterparties or the major global investment banks in these hedges?
John Woods : Yes. Exactly…
Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And then just the second follow-up question. Obviously, you're not an advanced approach bank. And therefore, the AOCI is not an issue with your CET1 ratio, which is the binding constraint for most banks or all banks. When do you think people start to get a little concerned about the tangible common equity ratio, yours are still very healthy. But is there -- do you guys -- I know it's an accounting issue. We all get that. But do you think there will be a concern if to low and do you have any idea what that rate might be? And then second, John, when you accrete the AOCI back into capital as the bonds pay off, do you know about how much will start coming in starting maybe next year in terms of the AOCI coming back into capital?
Bruce Van Saun : Yes. Maybe I'll just start to say that we did put the TCE to TA ratio into our presentation deck today because we do think it's worth keeping an eye on that. And some folks in the peer group have either have bigger securities portfolio or didn't put as much in HTM and the TCE to TA ratio is sliding quite a bit. Ours is sliding a little bit, but still appears pretty healthy. You could argue that if that's not a regulatory ratio it's not really something to worry about significantly because it will turn around over time. It's just effectively you've got these securities that are going to be earning you less than if you were able to take the cash and reinvest in at today's levels. So anyway, I think we feel good, we're above 6% in historical times. It's kind of been a marker, and I think we can sustain it there. We have about 30% of the overall portfolio in held to maturity, and we'll have to see where rates go. But if they go up a little bit from here, we're going to continue to generate capital, we think we can keep it at pretty healthy levels. John, I'll turn it over for you for kind of the turnaround and the rest of the answer.
John Woods : Yes. Great. And just to supplement the earlier one, I mean we've got our health maturity is around 30% right now, it sort of balances that a little bit from -- to that point as well. As it relates to the -- how the AOCI will come back in, if rates kind of move around on us, just the way to think about it, at September 30 we have about $4.5 billion after tax sitting in that number. And that will come in over about five years. So that gives you an ability to work through that, hopefully, too.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Wilczynski: This is Brian Wilczynski on for Betsy. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the expectation to resume buybacks in 4Q and just some of the puts and takes there. You were just talking about capital a moment ago. Obviously, your reg capital position is quite strong today. But at the same time, the macro backdrop is still a bit challenging. So I was just wondering what makes you comfortable at resuming buybacks at this stage.
Bruce Van Saun : So we are kind of at the north end of our 9.5% to 10% range. And we indicated we would expect to land there at the end of the year. So I think if you look at our target range relative to peers, we've been a little on a conservative side, which I think, has served us well and particularly going into an environment with a significant amount of uncertainty, that's the position we want to be in. Having said that, you can see the level of profitability we have now is very significant. So we're generating a huge amount of tangible equity each quarter, this quarter, next quarter. And so we could certainly blow past 10% if we weren't back in the market buying our stock. So I think there's opportunity for us to even improve that ratio a little further and be in the market buying our stock. The wild card often is the amount of balance sheet growth and the amount of -- are there any acquisitions likely in the near term. And I think on that score, we've given you the guidance for what we see for loan growth. So that's factored in. And then I'd say on the acquisitions, we've really only done very small acquisitions so far this year. We've really been a 100% focus on making sure we're integrating the ones we did last year, we had a pretty better year last year with the New York Metro play and then JMP and DH Capital. And so we focused on integrating. We feel really good about where those are. And so nothing big likely before the end of the year, even just in terms of the fee-based deals that we do. So I think we have the wherewithal to go out and build the ratio a bit further plus get in the market and buy back some stock.
Operator: Your next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Kenneth Usdin : I know we're getting over an hour. So just a quick one, follow up on Gerard's question. So how through the hedging program do you feel like you are at this point that given what you show us on that grid Slide 23, have you kind of done what you need to do, if not, how much more about you think you need to still add to get that asset sensitivity to the position you really wanted to live in?
John Woods : Yes. I mean I think, this world, there are many things we consider when we work through this. We think about the evolution of the balance sheet where we think rates are going to go, et cetera. But if you look at 3.3%, most of that's on the short end, if you were to say, okay, we know that the Fed's not going to raise rates anymore and you wanted to take that down to neutral, that would mean about $10 billion or $15 billion of additional hedging that would be necessary. And so -- but we're going to be careful and methodical about that and update our balance sheet outlook, update our asset sensitivity, but there's still a significant amount of hedging left to do before we would say that we're done with this cycle.
Kenneth Usdin : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. So John, that point you made in the deck about 4Q '24 NIM floor of 3.25% and down 200 bps. If the Fed does hang high, do you have an idea of what that NIM looks like in a down 100 bps scenario?
John Woods : Yes. I mean, it's somewhere between the two, right? I mean I think it's somewhere between the two. I mean I'd say that, that would be a better outcome for us. And you could expect that, that will be somewhere between the 3.25% and 3.50% bookends that we gave.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.
John Pancari : On the capital markets side of the business, I know you indicated you expect a seasonal increase in the fourth quarter. Could you help us size that up, how do you think about the magnitude there based upon your pipeline?
Bruce Van Saun : John, we had a little trouble hearing you.
Don McCree : Yes, I think, I kind of got it, yes. So John, we've got pipelines bigger than we've ever had on our capital markets side. I think it's important to kind of realize that the place we play is middle market and capital markets. So the most troubled spots to generate revenue in capital markets is these very large M&A deals, which require very large financing. And those are what we are struggling with the market. So we were really pleased that we were able to hold cap markets kind of flat quarter-on-quarter, given all the volatility in the market. And we think most of the action is going to come in M&A. We've got a very big M&A pipeline, a lot of which does not require financing. And it looks like it's moving along quite nicely. So it's not going to double, but we think it could go up $10 million, $20 million in the fourth quarter. But we just have to see, as we go through the quarter, how much volatility and what the backdrop is. But we're assuming pretty big discounts to the pipeline in terms of what we're forecasting right now. So we're pretty comfortable that we're going to have a good quarter. And then we do think we'll get a -- we'll do a little better now that the currency and interest rate volatility has calmed down a little bit, that hurt us in the third quarter because people weren't really willing to step into the market and hedge. We think we'll do a little bit better on the market business as also in the fourth quarter.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And I would just add, so we don't get carried away with Don's sanguine outlook on commercial fees in Q4. When we look at our total fees at top of the house, we'll probably still see a little leakage on mortgage production. The good news here is that servicing is held up very strong, and so our diversification has paid and lend stability to mortgage, but there's probably a slight additional step to take in Q4. And then we did make some changes in our policies regarding overdrafts where we've done away with NSF fees. And so that would clip the service charges line a little bit. So you probably see some strength in commercial offset a bit with a little fall in the consumer side. But overall, we're guiding to the net of that should still be stable to up modestly. And we'll just have to see how much of the capital markets pipeline, as Don said, actually gets printed.
John Pancari : Okay. Hopefully, you can hear me a little bit better. One last question. Have you sized up the size of the shared national credit portfolio? And then also what percentage of that portfolio are you in the lead position.
Bruce Van Saun : Yes. I think the national credit portfolio is a pretty decent size as we've moved up market. But I'd point out a couple of things there is the kind of when you're in shared national credits in general, those are bigger companies that have multi-bank facilities and they tend to be better credits. The second thing is that we continue to migrate towards trying to aim for the left lead position in those shared national credits and/or be one of the book runners or admin agents, so become a meaningful bank to those overall customers. And so that's just been part of our strategy and we're making good traction on that strategy. I think a lot of times investors will think that the shared national credits is a particular point of risk. Our view is that actually that's just part of the strategy, and those are actually good credits. And if you're get to be in the driver's seat of leading the deals, then that's the place you want to be.
Don McCree: I think that's right. And it's all about return against asset -- against deployment. So underlying the BSO strategy on the commercial side that we talked about in the quarters, we're exiting $1 billion to $2 billion a quarter of under returning assets. A lot of those are shared national credits, which just haven't panned out once we've been a relationship for a couple of years. So that portfolio churns quite aggressively also. And our ability to monetize through the product capabilities that we've built over the last five years is significantly different than it was five years ago, we just got many, many more opportunities to engage and become that lead bank with those clients.
Bruce Van Saun: I think that's the end of the queue on the question. So really appreciate everybody's interest and support. Have a great day.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-19 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alan, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.
Kristin Silberberg: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our second quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our second quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. There was a lot going on in Q2 with a focus on closing the Investors acquisition and commencing our New York City Metro integration efforts. In addition, the Fed's move to rein in inflation through higher short rates and quantitative tightening put a spotlight on a joint management of our capital, liquidity and funding position as well as our interest rate management. The good news is that we made strong progress on all fronts while posting very good financial results. Our underlying EPS for the quarter was $1.14, that's up 7% from the first quarter and ROTCE was 15.5%. Positive sequential operating leverage was 11.7% on an underlying basis, and that's 6.3%, excluding the impact of acquisitions, our PPNR growth was 45%. Driving these strong results was a significant sequential jump in net interest income of 31%. That's 9% ex-acquisitions as spot loan growth reached 19%, which is 4% ex-acquisitions, and our net interest margin jumped 29 basis points. We are seeing a strong pickup in line utilization in commercial which has afforded us the opportunity to be more selective in lower returning consumer portfolios like mortgage and auto. Our deposit performance was good as period-end deposits, ex-acquisitions, were up 1%. Our fees were relatively resilient, up 2% ex-acquisitions, given the diversity of our fee revenue streams. Higher volatility kept capital markets in check though it benefited FX and derivative product revenue, which hit an all-time high. Wealth continued to grow nicely in the quarter, while mortgage revenue was up slightly. We did our usual fine job on expenses and credit performance continues to be excellent. We continue to see favorable trends in key credit metrics on both the commercial and consumer side. At this point, we feel the second half should hold up well with only gradual normalization in loss rates given the solid positioning of our customers today. We currently expect our solid momentum to continue into the second half of 2022. We will continue to benefit from rate rises. Our fees should remain resilient, and we will benefit on expenses from our acquisition synergies and the TOP 7 program. We project positive operating leverage in Q3 and Q4 with ROTCE moving beyond our 14% to 16% target range.  The market seems concerned about the rising possibility of a recession in 2023 and the potential for much higher credit costs. At this point, we see slower economic growth as the base assumption for 2023 and if there is a recession, we believe it should be shallow and short-lived. We are being highly selective on new loan originations, and we've moved several portfolios to held for sale, largely from investors to optimize our balance sheet position.  We continue to believe our credit performance will be good on a relative basis, should a downturn come. It's an exciting time for Citizens. We have many promising initiatives in flight that we are managing well. We are focusing on areas where we can leverage our strengths and where we have a right to win. The current environment gives us a great opportunity to prove our mettle and deliver prudent, sustainable growth. We certainly feel up to the challenge.  With that, let me turn it over to John to cover the financials in more detail. John?
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with our headlines for the quarter, referencing slides four and five. We reported underlying net income of $595 million and EPS of $1.14. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 15.5%. Net interest income was up 31% linked quarter driven by a 29-basis point improvement in margin and strong loan growth, including the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions.  Period-end loans were up 19% linked quarter. Excluding loans added by the HSBC and ISCC transactions, loan growth was a strong 4% led by commercial growth of 6%. Average loans are up 19% linked quarter, excluding the acquisitions, average loans were up 3% with 5% growth in commercial. Underlying fees were up 5% linked quarter or 2% excluding HSBC and ISBC acquisition impacts, reflecting the diversity and resiliency of our fee businesses. Our client hedging business had another exceptional quarter, and we delivered record results in Wealth and Card. Mortgage fees were up slightly and capital market fees were down a bit, given continued market volatility. We remain disciplined on expenses which were up 1% linked quarter, excluding the HSBC and ISBC transactions.  Overall, we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of 11.7% linked quarter and that was 6.3%, excluding the HSBC and ISBC transactions. Our underlying efficiency ratio improved to 58%. We recorded an underlying provision for credit losses, excluding ISBC of $71 million, which reflects continued strong credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios.  The underlying credit provision for the quarter excludes $145 million for the double count of CECL provision expense tied to the ISBC transaction. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.37% down from 1.43% at the end of the first quarter. Our tangible book value per share was down 6% linked quarter, driven primarily by the impact of rising rates on securities and hedge valuations that impact AOCI.  We continue to have a very strong capital position with CET1 at 9.6%, and we have increased our common dividend by 8% to $0.42 a share. On Slide 5, we have provided the HSBC and ISBC contributions to our second quarter results as well as the notable items for the quarter. Also, Slide 21 in the appendix provides a summary of the purchase accounting impacts associated with the ISBC transaction. Next, I'll provide some key takeaways for our second quarter results. On Slide 6, net interest income was up 31%, given higher net interest margin and 17% growth in interest-earning assets, including the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions. The net interest margin is 3.04%, up 29 basis points, which as you can see on the NIM walk in the bottom left-hand side of the slide shows the benefit of higher rates with a 24 basis point increase related to asset yields reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet and improved securities reinvestment rates. There is an 11 basis point benefit from the HSBC and ISBC transactions, largely given the repositioning of the ISBC securities portfolio and the benefit of adding their loans. With rising rates, funding costs reduced the margin 8 basis points, reflecting well-controlled deposit costs. Earning asset yields are up 38 basis points linked quarter, strongly outpacing our interest-bearing deposit costs, which are up only 8 basis points. Moving to Slide 7. Given the Fed's recent rate hikes and the current market expectation for the Fed funds rate to end the year in the 350 to 375 basis points range, we are confident that we will continue to realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out. Our asset sensitivity has driven a significant improvement in NII in the first half of this year, and those benefits will continue to accumulate in the second half of 2022 and compound into 2023. Since the path of the rate cycle is uncertain, on the top left side of this page, we've provided an estimate of our NII sensitivity to further changes in rates, either up or down from the June 24 forward curve. Our overall asset sensitivity stands at about 2.5% at the end of the second quarter. This is down from 7% for the first quarter, reflecting the incorporation of ISBC's NII base and liability-sensitive profile as well as hedging actions taken to stabilize the margin and protect against downside interest rate risks. Our improved NII outlook as well as changes in the balance sheet also contributed to the reduction in asset sensitivity. Essentially, a 25 basis point instantaneous change in the forward curve is worth about $10 million to $15 million a quarter with that balance between the long and short parts of the curve. We began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity profile, deposit costs as low as they have ever been, and our overall funding profile greatly improved, including significant improvements to our deposit mix and capabilities. We will continue to optimize our deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits. So far this cycle, with Fed funds increasing 150 basis points since the fourth quarter of 2021, we are quite pleased with how our deposit franchise is performing with a cumulative beta of about 6%. On a sequential basis for the second quarter, our beta was 11%. This puts us on track for a 35% cumulative beta through the end of this rate cycle if the forward curve plays out as expected. Moving on to Slide 8. We posted solid results, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our fee businesses. Capital Markets delivered solid results despite continued market volatility impacting the bond and equity markets. We saw M&A advisory and equity underwriting fees picking up a bit, but these were more than offset by modestly lower loan syndication revenue. We continue to see good strength in our pipelines and capital markets fees could rebound nicely in the second half of the year if markets settle down, and there is more certainty regarding the path of the economy. We once again delivered a record performance in our client hedging business, up $9 million linked quarter, driven primarily by FX as we help clients manage their currency exposures as the dollar strengthened during the quarter. Our interest rate and commodities businesses also performed very well, but were down modestly from record levels in the first quarter. Mortgage fees were up modestly linked quarter given improved servicing income as higher mortgage rates resulted in slower amortization of the MSR. Production fees remained under pressure given lower industry origination volumes with rising rates and seasonal impacts. Strong competition continues to pressure margins. However, there are clear signs that the industry is beginning to reduce capacity, which should benefit margins as we head into the second half of the year. We delivered record wealth fees, up 8% linked quarter as rising market interest rates supported customer flows into annuity products. Card fees were also a record given seasonally higher transaction volumes. On slide nine, expenses were well controlled, up 1% linked quarter, excluding HSBC and ISBC. Our TOP 7 efficiency program is continuing to make good progress, on track to deliver $100 million of pretax run rate benefits by the end of the year. Period end loans on slide 10 were up 19% linked quarter, primarily driven by the impact of the ISBC transaction, which closed at the beginning of the quarter. Excluding the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions, loan growth was 4% with strong commercial loan growth again this quarter, up 6%, led by C&I as we emphasize strong relationships to optimize risk-adjusted returns. Retail loans were up 1% as we continue to be more selective in consumer lending. Average loans were up 19% linked quarter or 3% excluding the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions with 5% growth in commercial led by C&I and 1% growth in retail. In commercial, we continue to see strength in corporate banking originations across every region. Line utilization continued to rebound with an increase of about 300 basis points to 39% on a spot basis, primarily driven by corporate banking with the largest quarterly increase in utilization we have seen since early in the pandemic. Our clients are continuing to use their lines to build inventories to get ahead of supply chain issues and rising input prices and some are also looking to pro rata bank financing as an alternative to the volatile bond markets. Comparing with the ISBC acquisition, we identified certain non-strategic loan portfolio totaling $2.1 billion, which we are in the process of being marketed for sale. These loans were classified as held for sale at quarter end. This will free up capital and enable our relationship bankers to focus on more desirable commercial relationship business in New York Metro. On slide 11, our period-end deposits were up 13% linked quarter as we added $19.8 billion of deposits from the ISBC transaction. Excluding ISBC and HSBC, period-end deposits were up slightly, while average deposits were down slightly, reflecting seasonal runoff on a decline in commercial surge deposits. Moving on to slide 12. We saw excellent credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were at 13 basis points, down six basis points linked quarter. Non-performing loans fell six basis points to 54 basis points of total loans linked quarter, driven by improvements in C&I, residential real estate, and home equity. Other credit metrics continued to look excellent across the retail and commercial portfolios and criticized loans as a percentage of the commercial portfolio are stable after incorporating ISBC, but down on a standalone basis. On Slide 13, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We continue to see excellent credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios. We added to the reserve this quarter to take into account strong commercial loan growth as well as the addition of ISBC. While we aren't seeing any signs of early stress in the portfolio at this point, our allowance takes into account the expectation of a more challenging macroeconomic outlook, given the Fed's rate actions to combat inflation. Our overall coverage ratio was 1.37%, which is a modest decline from the first quarter, reflecting the strong performance of our retail portfolio and the addition of the ISBC's CRE portfolio, which includes a sizable multi-family component with lower reserve requirements than our legacy portfolios. If you recall, when we adopted CECL at the beginning of 2020, our coverage ratio was 1.47%. To put our current coverage ratio in context, we estimate our pro forma coverage ratio would be slightly lower than the 1.37% level today if we applied our current portfolio mix, incorporating ISBC to our day one CECL approach. Importantly, our coverage of non-accrual loans strengthened 256%, up from 238% in the first quarter. We feel good about the improvements to the loan portfolio we've made over the past few years and the overall positioning of our credit risk. Moving to Slide 14. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remained strong at 9.6%. Following the release of the Fed's DFAST stress results last month, our Board increased our common share repurchase authorization to $1 billion. And today, we announced an 8% increase in our common dividend to $0.42 a share. Our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed, and you can expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage the company. Shifting gears a bit. On Slide 15, you'll see some examples of the progress we made against the key strategic initiatives and other work we are doing across the bank to better serve our customers and make Citizens a great place to work. As you know, we closed the acquisition of ISBC at the beginning of April, and we are very focused on a successful integration. I am proud of the work our teams have done related to the acquisition. We onboarded more than 1,600 new colleagues through our HR systems on day one, and in the second quarter, we began originating mortgages on our systems. We have a number of conversions planned over the remainder of the year, and we are on track to finish in the first quarter of 2023. We have included a high-level integration time line in the appendix on Slide 22. Importantly, we are on target to achieve $130 million in run rate net expense synergies by the end of 2023, of which approximately 70% will be achieved by year-end 2022. The total represents about 30% of ISBC's 2021 expense base. Also, ISBC integration costs to be incurred through 2023 are now expected to come in below the estimated level of deal that you announced. We recently released our fifth annual corporate responsibility report, which highlights our progress on ESG initiatives. The report highlights a number of significant milestones related to our sustainability efforts, including our progress towards targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We also announced that we've joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials, which will accelerate our efforts to measure and disclose finance emissions. Later this year, we'll release our first TCFD climate report, which will describe our climate strategy in more detail. The report also describes our commitment to the communities we serve, and there are a few recent examples here on the slide with some of the community partnerships we are engaged with in Boston and most recently in Chinatown and Queens, New York.  On the consumer side, we are excited about continuing our expansion in Florida with the opening of our latest Wealth Center in Naples. We recently released a mobile app version of Citizens Access, which we think will be very popular with our customers. And we are very proud that our Citizens Pay point-of-sale offering was awarded Best Innovation by the Banking Tech Awards. Lastly, our relentless focus on customer service, driving results as our ATM channel moved up eight places in the J.D. Power rankings.  On the commercial side, we continue to perform well in the league tables, consistently ranking in the top 10 as a middle market and sponsor book runner. The diversification in our business model is delivering results with record revenue in our client FX hedging business. We also closed the DH Capital acquisition this quarter, strengthening our capabilities in the Internet infrastructure, software and next-generation IT services and communications sectors.  On the right side of the page, we've included some digital metrics. Mobile active users are up over 20% year-over-year. Digital deposits and Zelle transactions are up over 30%, and we are seeing great success with the customer uptake of automated client service through virtual chat sessions. We are very excited with how our digital first approach is increasing engagement with our customers and how this is all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction.  Moving to Slide 16. I'll walk through the outlook for the third quarter. Since we closed ISBC at the beginning of the second quarter, our third quarter outlook includes all our recent acquisitions. We expect NII to be up 5.5% to 7%, driven by the benefit of higher rates and solid loan growth. We are very focused on optimizing capital deployment.  In consumer, we will reduce originations in mortgage, auto and education refi, while seeking to grow in home equity, in school education and Citizens Pay and Card. In commercial, we expect to see further increases in-line utilization, but we'll be mindful of balancing growth and returns given current macro uncertainty. These are expected to be broadly stable though upside exists, if capital markets stabilize.  Noninterest expense is expected to be up approximately 1%. We expect to continue strong sequential positive operating leverage in the third quarter and ROTCE above our medium target range of 14% to 16%. Net charge-offs are expected to be approximately 20 basis points. We expect our CET1 ratio to land around the midpoint of our operating range at 9.75%. And our tax rate should come in a bit lower at approximately 22%.  With respect to full year results, we expect PPNR to be in-line with our April guidance. From a revenue standpoint, we are seeing higher NII given net interest margin, reaching approximately 3.25% in the fourth quarter, driven by higher rates and loan growth within our 20% to 22% guidance range. This will be offset by lower key revenue largely in capital markets and mortgage. Expenses will be well controlled, which will result in full year operating leverage of at least 400 basis points and a fourth quarter efficiency ratio of sub-55%. We also expect the net charge-off ratio to come in lower than we guided in April, given continued favorable trends.  To sum up on Slide 17. This was a very solid quarter and we are optimistic about the outlook for the rest of 2022 and beyond. We are off to a running start in New York with the close of our two acquisitions there, and we expect significant benefits in our net interest income from the higher rate environment and strong and commercial loan growth. The strength and diversity of our fee business is driving solid results and our capital markets business, in particular is well positioned for when markets stabilize given strong pipelines. We will continue to focus on executing against our strategic priorities and building a top-performing bank that delivers for all our stakeholders. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.  Your first question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Go ahead please.
John Pancari: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi, there.
John Woods: Good morning.
John Pancari: Just on the loan front, I guess it's also a credit question. I know you indicated that you're being more selective in select areas of consumer lending. Can you maybe give some color there in terms of what areas are you becoming more selective, what you're seeing that's making you become more selective, or is it just actually the broader backdrop? And what that could mean for growth in the consumer portfolios? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. Well, let me start, and then I'll go to Brendan and then John, I'm sure might want to chime in. But I think we have the potential to continue to grow in consumer maybe at a faster pace than would be ideal in the current environment. So we're seeing a lot of growth right now on the commercial side line utilization picking up. And I think in light of the environment that we're seeing out there and transitioning in the investors' balance sheet, just making sure we're focusing on allocation of capital to the highest and best uses and not putting a strain on deposit growth as we're going through this higher rate environment is the game plan at this point. So when we look into the consumer world, clearly, mortgages and auto are areas where we've seen a lot of growth over the past couple of years. We're going to basically put mortgage more on a stable path and start to reduce our originations in auto. Those are really return costs. It's a return on capital cost where we think we have opportunities to grow in areas that deliver better returns would be things like HELOC, like the in-school student and then also card and Citizens Pay. So I think overall, we'll still see some net modest growth, but we're going to take some pluses and some minuses here and really be focused on capital allocation. So with that, Brendan, do you want to add to that?
Brendan Coughlin: Yeah. I guess just strategically, what I'd add is I think this is a natural pivot point for the journey of our strategy. We're at the early stages of our IPO, everything was accretive for the most part. And so we've really scaled up our business. And I believe we have one of the most well run and diversified consumer lending franchises amongst our peer set for sure. And if we enter this next phase of our journey, capital allocation is king, and we're making some strategic pivots. I'd also say, this is not necessarily brand-new news. If you recall, prior to COVID, we had already started signaling we were going to start to put auto, as an example, on a path to reduce and get back into tier levels for concentration. And through COVID, we found some great vintages of returns and market disruption. So, the benefit of the diversity of our business model allowed us to flex up through COVID and now we're sort of returning to our original glide path down of auto, given that -- the auto business is naturally in sort of steady state, a lower return and less relationship focused. And then to Bruce's point on mortgage, we've been outgrowing the Citizens balance sheet on mortgage growth for quite some time. And so we would like for that to grow no faster than the rate of the bank, just given where we're at right now on interest rates and a long duration nature of that business. And so really making sure we're protecting our balance sheet for long duration for real relationship focused lending and customers is key. The other place we're curtailing a bit is some fintech partnerships that we've had over the years that served us well and added operating leverage allowed us to invest back in the bank, but being much more relationship focused and our capital allocation is king. But we're very excited, as Bruce pointed, about a couple our places of our franchise. HELOC being one, where we believe we're the number one originator in the US for HELOC origination. Credit quality is extremely good as super prime as it gets, 780 FICO, six year LTVs and we're poised to capitalize on that. And the in-school student product, as Bruce pointed out, is coming back strong as the effects of COVID wear off a little bit on student enrollment and then Citizens Pay, we do have aspirations for medium-term growth in that product. So, I think we're well-positioned. We can flex up. We're not taking down muscle mass, just making some capital allocation decisions as we optimize the balance sheet.
Bruce Van Saun: I think we said a lot, John, anything to add Okay. I think we're good.
John Pancari: All right. Thank you for that. And then just separately on credit again. Just I know you had indicated in your outlook that you do expect some economic slowing as you look into the rest of this year into 2023, but also that your reserve does consider a degree of that. How do you think about what you could potentially see to begin to build the reserve more meaningfully here? And if that does take hold, where do you think that reserve could traject over time? What do you think is a fair level given your economic outlook?
Bruce Van Saun: I'll kick off and hand it quickly to John. But one of the things we pointed out was that we're about where the day one reserve would have been had we incorporated Investors into those numbers. So, this 1.37 ratio. It's down from 1.47. But if you look at the shift in some of the asset composition, we're about at day one. And we have incorporated a Moody's scenario that does have a GDP slowdown and higher recession risk into that scenario. So, I would say, absent a meaningful change in outlook that we could probably hang around this neighborhood for a while. So, anyway, that would be my top of the house view. But John, for more detail, please?
John Woods: Yes, sure. I mean I think that's right. I mean I think our base scenario this quarter really relies predominantly on a mild recession, which would last into sort of into next year. So, I think we're covering that part of it. We even layered in certain aspects of the portfolio a more severe recession. That's also built into where we are. And to Bruce's point, the mix shift in our portfolio has been extremely positive over the last couple of years. So, when you fast forward from the first quarter of 2020, the beginning of 2020 to the -- here in the second quarter of 2022, our mix profile is just much better. And so you can almost think about the fact that we're sort of back to the beginning where we have some uncertainty and some negative scenarios priced in. And without a significant deterioration in the macro as Bruce indicated, we're lucky to be in this range as you get into the end of the year.
Bruce Van Saun: And I think it makes sense. If you just step back and think about the consumers in really good shape, still has a lot of liquidity. Companies have refashioned their business models coming out of COVID. They're all in pretty good shape and contending with inflation and supply chain and trying to maintain their margins. So, historically, if you have a good jump-off point, you go through a shallow recession, bank charge-off rates don't go up all that much. So I think you'd have to see a meaningful change in outlook for us to come off that view.
John Pancari: Got it. All right. Thanks, Bruce. Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question will come from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Go ahead please.
Scott Siefers: Good morning guys. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just some additional thoughts on how you see deposit cost pressures play out. I think we can get a pretty good sense from Slide 7, how you see the full year sort of trajecting and was glad to see you reiterate the 35% through the cycle beta expectation. But as we look through the remainder of the year, where specifically do you see the pressures that get you to the 25% to 30% by year-end. And then maybe if you can flesh out your thinking on deposit cost dynamics once the Fed stops raising rates?
John Woods: Yes, I'll take that. I mean, I think the best way to describe that. I mean, we articulated that our cumulative beta 6% through the second quarter, better than we expected. So we're feeling good about where we're starting off this rate cycle. Our outlook indicates a deposit beta getting into the 25% to 30% range by the end of the year, which implies the sequential betas in the second half in quarters being around mid-30s. So that's how that math would play out. So that's how that trajectory would work. The drivers of that are predominantly on the commercial side of the business, but as expected, consumer and retail deposits are incredibly well performing and well behaved in terms of deposit betas, and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year. We have a little bit of room on the balance sheet for Citizens Access. And all of that has been incorporated into our outlook for the 25% to 30% by the end of the year and for the approximate 35% through the whole cycle. Deposit betas will continue to rise as you get into 2023, and that's the difference between the approximate 35 and the 25 to 30 that we're talking about. And they tend to continue to rise when the Fed stops, assuming that the Fed doesn't start easing immediately thereafter, right? So the last cycle, we had the Fed end of the cycle over the next quarter, we were easing. And so that sort of clipped off the lag effect that you would typically see in deposits. But if the Fed stops and stands at then you would see deposit costs continue to rise for another quarter or two after the last Fed hike. But I should hasten to add that that there's the loan beta side of this equation. And the loan beta side of it is loan betas basically are rising, and they will continue to rise into the Fed tightening cycle and even after the Fed stops and our, in particular, all the tailwind from some of the term fixed lending that often really gain steam when you get to the end of the Fed tightening cycle, that's really what continues to drive net interest margin rising which we would say, would continue to rise throughout '23 even as the Fed continues to rise, given the fact that loan betas would exceed deposit betas.
Scott Siefers: Okay. Perfect. That's great color. And I guess along those lines of, sort of more all-encompassing rate sensitivity. So, I guess you're a little less asset sensitive now with ISBC in there. I think a couple of moving parts with the hedging. How would you say your overall rate sensitivity changes from here or is this sort of, kind of a good steady state for where we're at now?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Let me jump in. It's Bruce, and I'll give it back to John. But I think what we've tried to do, Scott, is find that sweet spot where we still have asset sensitivity sufficient to participate, if the Fed has to keep going beyond what's expected. But also, we like this level of NIM and this level of NII. And so, if in fact, a recession is in the offing and then rates turned down, we've locked in a fair amount of that NII for a good period of time. So just trying to get that balance right where we take away the downside and allow ourselves to continue to participate in the upside is, where we try to land it over the quarter. John?
John Woods: Yes, I agree with that. And the â I guess the point is that, without management actions as you think about how the balance sheet unfolds from here. A big decline in the quarter really was just pulling in ISBC, just the base NII alone, reduces your assets â you just have a bigger base on that â from that percentage to be calculated. But so that was the source of the decline primarily and our management's actions. So, if you don't -- if you take away management's actions looking forward, actually, our asset sensitivity would tend to begin to rise again.  As mentioned earlier, the rotation out of consumer lending into a lot of the consumer commercial lending. And even within consumer lending, the fact that HELOC is a big driver, which is a floating rate product. You really are reestablishing asset sensitivity as things â as the balance sheet unfolds in the coming quarters, all of that is absent management's actions, right? And so, that's really going to tell the tale about where we land things.  If we get towards the end of the year, it -- and if rates are inflation still remains stubbornly high, that will tell us where we take the balance sheet under that scenario. If it feels like June was peak inflation, as you get to the end of the year, you would see us wanting to lock in a little bit more. So, we'll just see how it plays out. But naturally underpinning the balance sheet is some upward lift on asset sensitivity.
Scott Siefers: All right. Perfect. Kristin, John, thank you guys very much.
John Woods: Sure.
Operator: Your next question will come from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Go ahead.
Peter Winter: Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on Scott's question regarding the deposits. But can you just talk about how you're thinking about deposit growth in the second half of this year versus the second quarter?
John Woods: Yes. I think the -- you've got a big driver being commercial, right? And there's two drivers there. One is, the fact that there was some surge in the commercial business that has been running off. And frankly, most of that's been run off by the end of June. It's down to a relatively smaller level now and that was a driver -- also a driver is the natural seasonality of our deposit flows, which tends to have 2Q as one of the lower points during the year.  So, when you think about through the rest of the year, they'll be the broad continuing to execute against all the investments we've made over multiple years in driving consumer deposits and also the natural uplift and frankly, driving commercial as well. But the natural uplift at the second half tends to deliver in the commercial side of the business from a seasonality standpoint and lower drag from surge runoff. So that's how we see the second half playing out.
Peter Winter: And how much is in...?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, just to make that clear. So the net would be -- we'd be expecting to resume growth in the second half. And I think that would be led by commercial growth, but consumer also would expect to see some growth as well.
Peter Winter: And you gave some color on the moving parts on loans in the third quarter going to be led by commercial. But I'm just wondering if you could just be a little bit more specific on the type of growth rates you're expecting on commercial versus consumer and maybe line utilization in the third quarter?
John Woods: Yeah. Well, I mean I think the -- in the second quarter, just talking about the jump off here, maybe helpful because in the second quarter, we had -- on the commercial side of the house, we had 5% average growth. But on a spot basis, we had 6% growth. So you can see that what that implies is that you're likely to see commercial be a big driver in the second quarter. So you're -- you see.
Bruce Van Saun: In the third quarter.
John Woods: Yeah. I'm sorry, in the third quarter. Sorry, yeah, you see commercial being a big driver into the third quarter. I think you're going to see puts and takes in consumer where you see home equity and some of the other categories that we like to see drive things in card and a little bit of mortgage driving it maybe being offset by auto and student a little bit. So that's how I would articulate it. Utilization continues to increase, but it's been about 50-50 utilization and other commercial growth. And so I suspect that, that will be the color into 3Q as well, utilization driving about half of it and the other half coming from outside of utilization. But again, I'd say 3Q driven primarily by commercial loans, maybe a similar amount of the loan growth percentage that you saw in 2Q.
Bruce Van Saun: And one thing about commercial, and maybe I could ask Don to comment on this is that when you kind of look at how companies are able to access new financing, right now, the public markets are pretty still in the water. So you've seen kind of more opportunities for the institutional market as well. So the bank syndicated lending market has seen an uptick, which I think is likely to continue as we look out into the second half. So Don, maybe you want to give some color on that.
Don McCree: Yeah. I think that's right. And just to put a point on what John said, we've got utilization up by about another 200 basis points across the C&I books and the Global Markets books in the third quarter. So that gives us a couple of billion dollars in potential outstandings. To Bruce's point, we're really starting to see the acceleration of a trend of companies that might want to refinance in the bond market coming to the bank market instead because the access on bank balance sheets is so much more attractive. And we're also seeing some transitory financing for M&A transactions and for maybe some buyouts coming more onto the bank balance sheets as opposed to some of the non-bank lenders. So I don't know what the exact mix will be, but there's a lot of things that are beginning to materialize. And it's not going to all go up because of that. We're going to take some other portfolios down and slow down some other things, similar to what Brendan said, what we've been doing for two or three years now just to change the mix of what's on the books. So, get a little more selective in terms of both returns of the capital we're deploying, but also being very careful of credit risk and the like, just in case we go into a little bit deeper slide. So, we're just being protective of the risk front also.
John Woods: Yes. And one other thing, maybe just to close out there a little bit is to broaden it out to the second half. I think we mentioned -- in fact, there's a lot of moving parts here. And so we tried to really make it clear that our April guide had a 20% to 22% range of loan growth associated with it for the year and where basically -- all of these moving parts are going to fall into that range of the 20% to 22% loan growth increase in 2022. And hopefully, that's helpful. And how it shakes out between 3Q and 4Q, there's a lot going on there, but we're expecting to deliver as we indicated we would in our last guide.
Peter Winter: Got it. Thanks for all the color.
Operator: Your next question will be from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go ahead.
Gerard Cassidy: Good morning Bruce, good morning John.
Bruce Van Saun: Good morning.
John Woods: Hey Gerard.
Gerard Cassidy: Bruce, you guys have done a good job on credit, and you've identified the outlook as being healthy, strong possibly at the end of the year, but a little more cautious as we go into next year, which is completely understandable. Can you share with us what you guys are thinking about not so much the traditional credit areas like consumer lending, home equity, or student loans, but more from a institutional market if the Fed pursues this quantitative tightening, which they claim they will $95 billion a month, what kind of disruption are you guys kind of looking at possibly that could happen separate from the traditional unemployment rates going up and all that stuff, I think most of us can understand that. But the new part is this quantitative tightening that we really have inexperience. How are you guys kind of thinking about that going forward?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, we're a bit in uncharted waters because we haven't seen quantitative easing to the extent we have and now the amount of tightening that the planning is going to be interesting to watch. I mean if I step back and think about where did a lot of that additional liquidity end up, I think the biggest banks took on a lot of it, the custody banks took on a lot of it. And I think when we view our space, the super-regional space, maybe we had some benefit from it, but a lot of it was just working on our playbook to deliver better for customers and establish whole relationships where we can capture the deposit opportunities that we were probably sub-optimized on both on the consumer side and the commercial side. So, I think the tightening process, you probably see it most impact the folks where the liquidity ended up, which would, in my view, be the bigger banks and the custody banks. In a bank like us, we still have a number of initiatives where I think we're not fully optimized in terms of the deposits per our relationship base, and we're going to continue to go try to gain market share and grab that.
Gerard Cassidy: Very good. And can you think about it also from the loan side? Do you think that the QT could have some type of impact. Obviously, it's going to take liquidity out of the market, but I don't know how you guys think about it in terms of maybe some of the syndicated business that you've been doing quite successfully in the past.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I guess I'm not -- I don't necessarily think that will be a huge driver in the loan volumes. I think the level of GDP growth and that spurs activity in the animal spirits and people wanting to put money to work. I think that's a bigger driver. But maybe on that, I'll defer over to Don. If, Don, you have any thoughts?
Don McCree: Yes, I'm not -- Gerard. I'm not too worried about the loan syndication piece. And again, volumes are much lower than they were, and I think they'll -- it will be where the action is, but the mega deals seem to be struggling a little bit. So if you think about the environment we're, the biggest challenge we have on transactional execution is larger transaction and then clearing through the marketplace. And so I think you'll see a little bit of a dearth there. That's not really the business we're in. So I don't think it will affect our business. And then the other thing is you think about what's the price action that goes on in the securities market as the Fed is a seller versus a buyer. And I think one of the things that I'm looking at is the maturity ladder for corporate bonds and particularly high-yield bonds is relatively light for the next couple of years because everybody took advantage of the low interest rate environment of a couple -- over the last couple of years in refinance and push those maturities out. So I think we have some time for the market to adjust in particularly the public market to adjust to QT trend that we're going to see.
Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up question. You guys put aside $2.1 billion, I think, of loans from Investors holding it for sale. Can you kind of give us a description of what types of loans? And you also indicated that your criticized loans on a standalone basis went down, which is good, of course. But they were stable when you included the investors criticized loans. Are any of the criticized loans for investors in the $2.1 billion held for sale?
John Woods : Yes. The biggest driver of that book is an equipment finance book, which is about half of it. And there are some non-accruals that -- and non-pass assets that did go into that portfolio. But more importantly, we think our underlying fundamentals with respect to the criticized being stable was a very good outcome. There are -- you've got some criticized coming out of ISBC with not a lot of loss content, and that's just a mechanism of migrating from the state chartered approach to how you manage that kind of stuff to an OCC-managed approach. So that was the impact there, but lost content quite low. And on an ACL basis, pound per pound, the needs from an ACL perspective are actually lower in the ISBC side of things, given that profile that came over. So we're feeling pretty good about that.
Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you fellas. Thank you.
John Woods : Sure.
Operator: Your next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Go ahead.
Erika Najarian: Hi. Good morning. Just taking a step back, you guys have done a great job giving us exclusive detail in terms of what you're expecting underneath that NII outlook, I'm just wondering if we could talk about it more strategically, given how much the bank has changed since the last interest cycle. So Bruce, in the last interest rate cycle, you took advantage of putting forth great offers through Citizens Access. And I'm wondering, as you think about the composition of your balance sheet now, especially after investors, how should investors think about this go-forward Citizens deposit-gathering strategy? How aggressive are you going to be in terms of competing in rate? And is there room to lower some rates in the acquired portfolio from investors on the deposit side that would allow you to be maybe slightly more aggressive on the rate side on the Citizens Access front?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Let me start, and then I'll pass the baton here to maybe Brendan and John. But I'd say, we feel really good about the progress we've made in just reformulating the deposit base, both in consumer and in commercial. So, in consumer taking a much more relationship orientation and not having that kind of thrift like lead with rate orientation that we kind of inherited when we got here.  And so, you can just see the results of that in terms of the noninterest-bearing growth, the affluent household growth, the stickiness of the deposits and the size per household going up. So, all those trends are terrific and I think they continue. So that's a cornerstone of the deposit strategy going forward.  I think we have been pretty astute in setting up Citizens Access and giving ourselves a kind of narrow swim lane to go after interest-sensitive deposits and compete for those. I don't think that, that's ever going to really become outsized relative to the overall mix. I think it's good to have and it's -- when we need incremental deposits, we can play with the rate, we can bring them in, but it serves its purpose.  Ultimately, if we get the national bank to where we want to get it, maybe some of those deposits will be a little rate sensitive as we try to get full wallet relationships with some of the national customer base. And then on commercial, again, I think we weren't as aggressive in seeking the operating accounts as we've been over the last few years and certainly seen a lot of growth there.  And then we didn't have the full range of capabilities things like escrow services and other services that different segments of the customer base need, we weren't competitive. They weren't built out and so, we've now built those out. And so, I think our whole speed and deposit growth going forward can continue to be reasonably strong. And hopefully, we'd like to get it growing faster than kind of the peers, which would give us a lot of flexibility in terms of the amount of loan growth that we can find while maintaining an LDR in kind of the mid to upper 80s. So that's a little bit top of the house thought process around that. But Brendan, maybe you could add something on the consumer side.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes. I mean, on the consumer side, I'd say the last up cycle for rates was a bit of perfect storm for us for higher betas. We had a business model, as Bruce pointed out, it was more thrift-oriented, had higher promotional balances. We're growing loans materially faster than peers. So, we had to fund up the loan growth with â on a base that was a little bit less healthy than peers.  And then we did â we hadn't fully built out all of our capabilities in the bank. So, as I stare at consumer right now, I look at all of those dynamics, the underpinning health of the portfolio has remixed materially to low-cost deposits and that's based on just increased primacy and engagement with customers thatâs long-term value creation, and that continues to improve quarter-over-quarter, quarter-over-quarter. That's allowed us to bring our elastic deposits down.  So last up cycle, we had something like $17 billion to $18 billion in promotionally priced elastic deposits, that's now in the mid-single digits in the core bank, putting aside Citizens Access. So the portfolio is mixed from the mid-40s percentages on low cost to -- into the 60s. That's a big buffer for better beta performance. We still believe the consumer segment will have a 25% to 30% net improvement rate cycle of rate cycle in betas. The other things we've done is we've built a lot of tools and capabilities. So Citizens Access is now something we're very good at. But that's not it. We've built a dramatically different product composition in the core bank. We've built highly sophisticated analytic capabilities with better targeting. So we do think we can go and very targeted raise deposits in the core bank, but with a much more precision than we did in the past, which will really mute the beta impact in consumer and allow us where we need to get deposit growth. We can contain it in Citizens Access. Last point I would make is inside the Citizens Access, we are starting to see some green shoots of deeper relationships beginning to form. So it's not just this contained deposit raising mechanism on the side. And that's going to benefit both betas but also cost. And so we're doing some tests to drive Citizens Access deposit raising across our national mortgage customers and our national student loan customers. Early results have been quite positive as we started to raise rates, and that's going to make it much more affordable for us to drive those deposits on the expense side, not just the beta side. So a lot of improvements in the health of the franchise. I would suggest the consumer bank is in a dramatically different position right now than we were five, seven years ago.
Bruce Van Saun: Great answer, Brendan. Don, do you want to add anything?
Don McCree: Yeah, I'd say similar to Brendan, I mean we basically did not have a liquidity and deposit group seven years ago when we started our journey here and our payments business was fundamentally subscale and subpar. So we're getting a good lift on the payment sales in the core operating business, as you said, Bruce, which is bringing some deposits with it. And our -- just our analytics and our capabilities, not to mention the product suite that we've begun to develop is just in a completely different place. So it's a much stronger relationship pull with the client base. As the client base grows, there's more opportunity to bring in deposits. So we feel very confident in terms of the deposit franchise at the moment.
John Woods: Yeah. You're getting the whole team here, Erika, but that's a good question, obviously. But just to your other point on investors, I'd say that given our history, I think we're particularly well placed to embark upon that migration of that deposit base as well. And we'll be getting that process. We closed this quarter, and we've already begun to run our playbook through this rising rate cycle where we're lagging rate on that platform, which otherwise might not have been lagged and et cetera, et cetera. And so we're making the investments necessary. So we're optimistic that we'll begin to see some benefits coming out of that, which was also part of your question.
Erika Najarian: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: We'll next go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead.
Ken Usdin: Hey, thanks guys. Good morning. Just if I can back check on a couple of things. When you refer to the April full year guidance, I think the output was plus or minus $3.4 billion-ish for the year. Is that still the zone that we're talking about as you reiterate it this quarter with a different mix?
John Woods: Well, I mean, I think the -- what we're reiterating is that PPNR implied by that guide. And so yeah, I mean, I think -- and you see -- and we talked about the puts and takes on that, doing -- seeing NII coming in a little better and with some offsets and fees and expenses well controlled and well-disciplined on that and credit looking very positive and better than we expected as well.
Ken Usdin: Okay. Second question, can you give us, John, ISBC is in the full quarter? Any update on the magnitude and expected timing and run rating of the original $130 million of cost saves you expected?
John Woods: Yes, I'd say the best way to think about that is by the end of the year, you'll see a run rate of about 70% of that $130 million and then the full amount of the $130 million coming in next year.
Ken Usdin: Okay. So, would you know what quarter do you expect that to be kind of fully captured?
John Woods: Well, next year -- we haven't talked to it. I mean, the big driver of it is getting the closedown in the first quarter. So, it will -- substantially all of that will be done by mid-year and there'll be some trickling in benefits in the second half, but most of that will be getting there by the middle part of 2023.
Ken Usdin: Got it. And last quick one. There was an increase in short-term borrowed funds in FHLBs and I'm just wondering you had the ones that were at ISBC and you had previously talked about getting rid of those through merger accounting. So, I'm just wondering, did that chunk that came over from ISBC get taken out, or is this -- are we now seeing the adds and are there extra adds on top of it? Kind of if you could just talk through those two buckets, the short-term borrowed funds and the FHLBs relative to what might have come from ISBC or what's just new adds because of your funding mix? Thanks.
John Woods: Yes. We had a carryover of about $5 billion from ISBC. And then the rest of the balance sheet flows on our end in terms of loan growth and securities growth drove the rest of the changes in the quarter.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And I would say on that, that ultimately, some of that's timing, Ken, is that the FHLB borrowings from investors will roll off, and we have cash coming in from some of the portfolios that we placed for sale. So, we would expect this is kind of a high watermark on the FHLB, all things equal and that we would bring that down by year-end.
Ken Usdin: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Go ahead.
Vivek Juneja: Thank you. A couple of questions. You mentioned regarding the PPNR guide well-controlled expenses. Your expenses this quarter, range you gave for last quarter, including HSBC-ISBC. When you mentioned well controlled expenses for full year 2022, can you give a little more color on what -- a little higher than where you were previously expecting? Lower? Unchanged? Any color on that?
John Woods: Yes. I think we're seeing some positive benefits coming out of expenses. And so when we say well-controlled, I think we have some optimism that, that's going to be no greater than and possibly a little less than we expected.
Vivek Juneja: Okay. Even though second quarter was at the high end, are you seeing some other additional costs?
Bruce Van Saun: That's true. If we said up 1% to 2%, given higher revenue-based compensation expense was the guide and they came in up 1%. So, I'm not sure where that's at the high end of the range.
Vivek Juneja: Okay. Because I'm just looking at reported Bruce, and I see you were at 16% to 18%, it came in at 18% on reported.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I mean you have to look at underlying because that's really the integration costs that ticked that up. So, if you look at our underlying, we actually thought we did a really good job to keep them virtually flat. And then we would expect that strong performance to continue into Q3. And we called out, I think, maybe 4% for the whole year. It's roughly where we are, so.
John Woods : And just on the integration cost, in fact, we did see more integration costs this quarter, but that's not signaling higher integration costs. It's just the opposite. We're pulling some into this quarter. We're expecting integration costs overall to be lower than we announced atâ¦
Bruce Van Saun : That was just a pull forward the back in Q2.
Vivek Juneja : Okay. That's helpful. That's a completely different question. Early delinquencies, can you give us the numbers by loan category for second quarter 2022, meaning 30 to 89-day delinquencies?
Brendan Coughlin : Overall, in the consumer side, delinquencies have been flat to even some signals of being very modestly down. Actually, we're seeing in no portfolio that we're looking at, do we see any signs of reinflation both at the 30-day level all the way through 90 days. So with a 120-day cycle to get to a net charge-off, it would take a whole heck of a lot of what you would need to believe to see net charge-offs in the consumer segment go up materially between now and the end of the year. Obviously, the place we're watching on the net charge-off line is things like used car values and recoveries on the resi portfolio, but those have been very stable and very high and very positive. We don't expect that to move very much either. So just the message overall in the consumer segment side is everything remains in great shape and without really any signs of a tick up, and the fundamentals remain strong too. Consumers still have 25%, 30% more in liquidity and deposits than pre-COVID and customer pay rates on credit cards pay in full, still are in the low 40 percentile. That was in the low 30s before COVID. So to believe that you'd start to see delinquency ticking up, you'd first probably see deposits start to burn down and you start to see customers relevering. We're not seeing that. Now we're a little bit unique from some peers in that our customer base skews much more mass affluent and affluent. But even when the same segmentâ¦
Bruce Van Saun : Credit score was super prime and high prime.
Brendan Coughlin : We're super prime lender, where you see some market commentary on early signs of credit. It tends to be in the subprime space, and we don't have any of those businesses, but we don't see any signs of credit stress in any portfolio really across any of the segments that we're in.
Vivek Juneja : Okay. And not even in the other retail partnerships you've put on the point of sale, are you seeing any stretching by consumers there in terms of levering up more?
Brendan Coughlin : No, I would direct you to a month or two ago, John and I went to the Morgan Stanley conference, and we shared some credit stress portfolio-by-portfolio. The Citizens Pay portfolio is performing exceptionally well and is, in fact, multiples below our prime credit card portfolio. And so not only is it super prime, but it's performing four, five, six times better than even a credit card portfolio. So we feel very good about thatâ¦
Bruce Van Saun : And that's because we draw a tight credit box in terms of what we are willing to take on theâ¦
Brendan Coughlin : Exactly. And where you start to -- we've been very ambitious on our desire to grow that business. But we've been disciplined on credit, and we're not going to -- we're not going to be undisciplined on credit in that business to drive growth. And so where we've been slower to see growth manifest in Citizens Pay, it's because we're not willing to jeopardize our credit discipline, and I don't see equally any signs of stress whatsoever on the Citizens Pay portfolio remains in great shape.
Vivek Juneja : Great. Thank you.
Brendan Coughlin : Sure. Okay.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.
Bruce Van Saun : All right. Well, thanks again for dialing in today. We appreciate everyone's interest and support. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-19 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tony and I will be your operator today.  As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I will turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.
Kristin Silberberg: Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our first quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our first quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also referenced non-GAAP financial measures, so it’s important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to you, Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining our call today. There clearly have been changes in the external environment relative to what was expected coming into the year, along with significant volatility. We feel we have executed well in this environment and are positioned to perform well over the course of 2022. Among the highlights of the quarter, we had a successful conversion of the HSBC branch and online customers, which was then followed by closing the Investors acquisition on April 6. We continue to take actions to position our balance sheet well for rising rates and we have made further progress on our strategic initiatives, including our digital agenda and TOP 7 program. With respect to our financial results, we are off to a good start with underlying EPS of $1.07 and ROTCE of 13%. This is generally our softest quarter from a seasonal standpoint given fewer days in the quarter and the impact of payroll taxes on expenses. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially, given 3% average loan growth and higher NIM, which more than offset a sizable drag from lower PPP loan forgiveness revenue and day count. We saw lower revenue in capital markets and mortgage given the environment, though high volatility benefited our Global Markets hedging business. We maintained strong deal pipelines in capital markets and remain optimistic for a significant revenue pickup if markets stabilize. We managed expenses well in the quarter and turnover has normalized somewhat. Credit metrics are all excellent and so far both our consumer and corporate customers are navigating well through the current challenges. Our balance sheet remains in great shape with a CET1 ratio of 9.7%. We have the capacity to grow loans, pursue fee-based bolt-on acquisitions, raise our dividend in the second half of the year and buyback some stock. Our loan growth has picked up on the commercial side and we plan to throttle back our growth in mortgage and auto a little, which will maintain an attractive LDR. I’d like to shift gears to emphasize a few key points that are topical for investors at the moment. First, and to be clear, we will benefit nicely from the accelerated path to higher rates. Our funding base is vastly improved from where it was entering the last rate up-cycle. We have a 7% benefit from a 200 basis point gradual rise in rates, a 10 basis point cost of interest-bearing deposits and an 83% loan-to-deposit ratio. We project roughly $300 million in higher NII given the current curve, which annualizes to much more in 2023. This will more than offset roughly $100 million in lower fee income from the environment. John will take you through this in detail in his remarks. Second, while inflation pressures are real and the possibility of recession in 2023 has increased, we feel our credit risk position is in very good shape. We have maintained a super prime to high prime risk appetite in consumer and over time we have migrated our credit exposure in commercial to bigger companies who have better credit profiles. As a result, our overall credit profile has improved over time. Our real-life and CCAR stress test results demonstrate that our credit profile is slightly better than middle of the super regional pack and we have carefully assessed investors’ credit book and loss history and remain confident in their positioning, which we will further harmonize over time. Lastly, with respect to acquisitions, I would like to highlight that our focus in ‘22 is on integrating the acquisitions that we made last year and getting each of those off to a strong start, particularly our New York City Metro area initiative. We will still look for acquisitions in the wealth space, but we are highly disciplined acquirer and have not been able to get much done as a result. With respect to Florida, we now have 8 branches in the state and job one is bringing them to network performance levels. There does not appear to be much to do that’s attractive inorganically and the likely path is that we will open several more wealth centers in additional cities down the road. In short, you can count on us to maintain the strong financial discipline we have exhibited since the IPO. All-in-all, we feel very good about how we have started the year and how we are positioned to navigate the challenging environment. Given the significant move in rates and the closing of the two bank acquisitions, we have provided detailed guidance in our earnings presentation to assist analysts and investors in updating their models. We continue our journey to building a great bank that can do ever more for our stakeholders. And with that, I will turn it over to John.
John Woods: Great. Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. First, I will start with our headlines for the quarter. We have reported underlying net income of $476 million and EPS of $1.07. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 13%, which includes the impact of a modest credit provision benefit. Net interest income was up 2% linked quarter, driven by strong loan growth and a 9 basis point improvement in margin. Period-end loan growth was up a solid 2% linked quarter. Our retail loans are up about 3%, while commercial loans are up 2% or 3% ex-PPP impacts. Average loans are up 3% linked quarter paced by commercial, up 3% or 4% ex-PPP and retail up 3%. Fees were down 16% linked quarter, driven primarily by lower capital markets fees off a record prior quarter given market volatility, seasonal impacts and some pull-forward of transactions into the fourth quarter. On a positive note, we had our best quarter ever in interest rate and commodities revenues as we help clients manage through the volatile environment. We remain disciplined on expenses, which were up 3% sequentially, excluding acquisitions, reflecting seasonal payroll tax impacts. Year-over-year expenses were up a modest 2% excluding acquisitions. We recorded an underlying credit provision benefit of $21 million, which reflects strong credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios. The near-term macroeconomic outlook remains positive though we are monitoring whether Fed actions to slow inflation can do so while engineering a soft landing for the economy. The underlying credit benefit for the quarter excludes $24 million for the double count of Day 1 CECL provision expense tied to the HSBC transaction. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.43%, down slightly from 1.51% at the end of 2021 and the 1.47% Day 1 CECL level. Our tangible book value per share was down 10.5% linked quarter, driven primarily by the impact of rising rates of securities and hedge valuations that impact AOCI. We continue to have a very strong capital position with CET1 at 9.7% after a 20 basis point impact from the HSBC transaction. Next, I will provide some key takeaways for the first quarter while referring to the presentation slides. Net interest income on Slide 6 was up 2%, given strong loan growth and the benefit of higher rates more than offsetting the approximately $41 million combined impact from lower day count and the reduced benefit from PPP forgiveness. The net interest margin was 2.75%, up 9 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher rates with front book yields rising, which more than offset reduced PPP benefit. Margin is also benefiting from lower cash balances as we continue to redeploy some of our excess liquidity into loan growth. Of note, PPP spot loans were down to roughly $400 million at quarter end and forgiveness benefit headwinds are substantially behind us. We made continued progress lowering our interest-bearing deposit costs, which are now 10 basis points, an all-time low, down 3 basis points linked quarter. Moving to Slide 7, given the Fed’s recent rate hike and the expectation for Fed funds rate to end the year in the 225 to 250 basis points range, we thought it would be helpful to discuss why we are confident that we will realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out. We entered this rate cycle with a much higher level of asset sensitivity at 10% before the first rate hike in March. This is already starting to benefit NII in the first quarter and is driving the significant improvement in our full year outlook and those benefits will continue to accumulate into 2023. Importantly, our expected asset sensitivity reflects how we have completely transformed our funding base since the IPO. We are beginning the current up-cycle with a very strong liquidity profile. Our LDR is much lower. Our deposit costs are as low as they have ever been and our overall funding profile was greatly improved. Our period end demand deposits are now 32% of the book compared with 27% at the beginning of the last rate cycle. And within our interest-bearing deposits, our consumer CDs are now less than 3% of total deposits compared with about 10% at the start of the last cycle. We are also starting this cycle with a much lower level of floating wholesale funding. This improved deposit profile reflects the significant improvements we have made to our deposit franchise since the IPO with improved and expanded retail and commercial deposit offerings. We have also enhanced data analytics that allow us to attract and retain more stable deposits. With a better starting position and the improvements in our deposit mix and capabilities, we expect our interest-bearing beta to be about 35% over this freight cycle, which is meaningfully lower than the last cycle. Our overall asset sensitivity stands at 7% at the end of the first quarter. This is down modestly from 10% at the end of 4Q, with the decrease primarily driven by the denominator impact of our higher NII outlook given the benefits from the April 6 forward curve and the evolution in the balance sheet. Pro forma from the Investors acquisition, asset sensitivity is slightly over 6%. Since the path of the rate cycle is uncertain, on the bottom left side of this page, we have given you an estimate of our sensitivity to further changes in rates either up or down from the forward curve. Essentially, a 25 basis point instantaneous change in the forward curve is worth about $20 million to $25 million a quarter, with most of that coming from our exposure to the short end of the curve. This includes the pro forma impact of Investors. Moving on to Slide 8, we delivered good fee results this quarter despite headwinds for capital markets, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our businesses and we drove solid performance across other key categories. Capital markets delivered solid results despite the market volatility, seasonal impacts and some pull forward into the full fourth quarter of 2021. Given the strength of our pipelines, capital markets fees could rebound nicely as markets settle down and there is more certainty regarding the path of the economy. Demonstrating the diversity of our business, we delivered our best quarterly results ever in global markets, a 46% linked quarter as we worked with clients to manage their foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity exposures. Mortgage fees were down 9% linked quarter against a backdrop of lower industry origination volumes, given rising rates and seasonal impacts. Strong competition and excess industry capacity continue to pressure margins. Mortgage servicing income improved as higher mortgage rates resulted in slower amortization of the MSR. Card fees and service charges and fees were slightly lower linked quarter given seasonality. Debit transactions and credit card spend continued to exceed pre-pandemic levels and wealth fees also remain strong. On Slide 9, expenses were well controlled, up 3% linked quarter and just 2% year-on-year, excluding acquisitions. Our TOP 7 efficiency program is well underway, targeting $100 million of pre-tax run-rate benefits by the end of the year. Period-end loans on Slide 10 were up 2% linked quarter. We were pleased to see strong commercial loan growth again this quarter, up 2% or 3% ex-PPP. Average loans were up 3% linked quarter. Driving this was average commercial loan growth of 3% or 4% ex-PPP impacts, led by C&I with growth across almost every region, including our expansion markets. Average retail growth was also 3%. Line utilization began to rebound a bit with an increase of about 150 basis points to a little over 36% on a spot basis, primarily driven by corporate banking led by manufacturing and trade as companies look to build inventories to get ahead of supply chain issues and rising input prices and facilitate some M&A activity. On Slide 11, our period end deposits were up 3% linked quarter as we added $6.3 billion of lower cost deposits with the HSBC transaction. Excluding HSBC, period end and average deposits were down slightly, given seasonal impacts as well as continued normalization from elevated liquidity levels. Moving on to credit on Slide 12, we saw an excellent credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were up slightly at 19 basis points for the first quarter, with good performance across the portfolio. Non-performing loans increased by $87 million linked quarter, primarily driven by residential real estate secured loans exiting forbearance. Other credit metrics continue to look excellent across the retail and commercial portfolios and criticized loans were lower. While we are mindful of inflationary pressures and the higher possibility of recession, we feel good about the improvements in the portfolio we have made over the last few years and the overall positioning of our credit risk. In the appendix on Slide 21, you will see that the risk profile of our commercial portfolio has significantly improved given changes through the pandemic, including prudent lending and a focus on growing the bigger mid-corporate credit portfolio, which is higher rated as well as reductions in stressed sectors such as retail malls, education and casual dining. On the retail side, we continue to focus on the super prime and prime segments. Our risk profile has improved given our disciplined risk appetite and changes in our portfolio mix, including the runoff of our personal and secured product. Of note, the Investors portfolios have performed well in prior cycles and we feel good about them. Moving to Slide 13, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remained strong at 9.7% at the end of the first quarter after closing the HSBC transaction, which had a 20 basis point impact. We also wanted to mention that we have widened our target CET1 operating range to 9.5% to 10% from 9.75% to 10%, reflective of the continued progress we have made in improving profitability, revenue diversity and overall risk management. Our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed as you can expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage the company. Shifting gears a bit, on Slide 14, you will see some examples of the progress we have made against the key strategic initiatives and other work we are doing across the bank to better serve our customers and make Citizens a great place to work. As you know, we closed the acquisition of Investors at the beginning of April, further expanding the foothold we established in the New York City Metro area through the HSBC branch transaction and significantly advancing our growth plans. In the consumer business, we were excited to complete the upgrade of Citizens Access to a fully cloud-enabled core platform, which enhances the capabilities of our national digital bank and is the first step toward our multiyear objective of convergence with our core banking platforms. We also recently announced Citizens ever value checking, a new overdraft free checking account designed to meet bank on national account standards and increased banking access for underserved communities. On the commercial side, we continue to perform well in the league tables, consistently ranking in the TOP 10 as a middle-market and sponsor book runner. On the right side of the page, we have included some digital metrics. We are very excited with how our digital first approach is increasing engagement with our customers and how this is all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction. Given the significant change in the rate environment and the closing of our two bank acquisitions, we provided a comprehensive update to our 2022 guidance on Slide 15. The good news here is that our guide is up for our standalone business. Rates are helping NII more than offsetting the fact that we are down a little on fees. So, PPNR is higher and there is no change in our positive view on credit and we remain confident in the outlook for the bank deals. I will focus my comments on the full year outlook, including both HSBC and investors, but we have also added the standalone outlook without the bank deals to help isolate performance. We have also included a comparison to our original guide from January to help highlight what is driving the overall improvement in the full year outlook. The rate scenario used in our outlook is based on the forward curve as of April 6, which implies a Fed Fund’s target of 225 to 250 basis points by the end of the year. On the long end, this rate curve implies the 10-year treasury to be about 270 basis points at the end of the year. It is also useful to keep in mind that the cumulative benefit from rates would also represent meaningful full year effect upside to NII in 2023. For 2022, we expect NII to be up 27% to 30% driven primarily by the improved rate environment and solid average loan growth of 20% to 22%. On a standalone basis, NII is about $290 million to $330 million better than our prior guidance given the higher rates. Average interest-earning assets are expected to be up 14% to 16%. Fee income is expected to be up 3% to 7%. On a standalone basis, fee revenue will be about $100 million lower than the January guide as the environment will impact mortgage revenue as well as capital markets somewhat. Non-interest expense is expected to be up 16% to 18% given the full year effect of HSBC and Investors as well as our commercial fee-based acquisitions. Credit is expected to remain excellent with net charge-offs broadly stable to down slightly for the year and we expect to end the year with a CET1 ratio of about 9.75%, which incorporates an anticipated increase in our dividends in the second half of the year. Our capital projections include the impact of our expected notable items for the year, including the integration expenses for the acquisitions and our TOP 7 costs. You can see those in the appendix on Slide 20. Importantly, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage of approximately 2% on an underlying basis for the year, excluding the acquisitions. And if you set aside the impact of PPP, that would be over 4% operating leverage. Including acquisitions, we expect operating leverage of over 4% and over 7%, excluding PPP. Overall, we expect our full year ROTCE to land solidly within our 14% to 16% medium-term target range. Moving to Slide 15, I will walk through the outlook for the second quarter. On a standalone basis, we expect NII to be up 6% to 8%, driven by the benefit of higher rates and solid loan growth. With the bank acquisitions, we expect NII to be up 27% to 29%. On a standalone basis, average loans are expected to be up 1% to 2%, led by commercial, with interest-earning assets up slightly. Fees are expected to be up 3% to 5% on a standalone basis, reflecting some improvement in capital markets and seasonal benefits. Including the acquisitions, fees are expected to be up 7% to 9%. Non-interest expense on a standalone basis is expected to be up 1% to 2% given higher revenue-based compensation. Including the acquisitions, expenses are expected to be up 12% to 13%. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable, and we expect our CET1 ratio to land at around 9.75%. To sum up with Slide 17 and 18, we started ‘22 with a solid quarter. We have a winning strategy and are well positioned to succeed given the strength and diversity of our businesses. We are very optimistic about the outlook for the rest of 2022 and beyond. We expect to materially benefit from a higher rate environment and strong loan growth. Our capital markets business is well-positioned as markets stabilize and we are very excited about the opportunity to grow our business in the New York Metro region as we integrate and build on HSBC and Investors. We will continue to focus on execution and building a top performing bank that delivers for all our stakeholders. With that, I will hand it back over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Operator, let’s open it up for some Q&A.
Operator: Thank you.  Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Scott Siefers: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping maybe you could spend just a moment discussing sort of the magnitude of recovery you are assuming in the capital markets environment in the forward guide. It looks like you assume some recovery in the second quarter, but of course, moderated the full year target a bit. Just curious for some thoughts or color on how you see things trajecting from here?
John Woods: Yes. I will go ahead and start off on that. I mean I think you had number of impacts there that we are building into the guide. I’d say that we mentioned our $100 million guide over guide, which is driven primarily by mortgage. But there is some capital markets implications there as well given the fact that 1Q, we had some pull forward into the fourth quarter. If you look back at the fourth quarter, we had a record quarter, but our pipelines look excellent. And so there could be a little bit of time to build that back into delivering in the last three quarters of the year. But as markets stabilize, we really think that the momentum there is strong. And so maybe Don can cover.
Don McCree: Yes, I think it’s a tale of a couple of different cities. So, one thing we are seeing is quite a bit of strength in the loan market, the syndicated loan market. So, while the bond market is particularly high yield and the equity markets have been pretty much close for the last few months, we are seeing some rotation into the syndicated loan markets as the liquidity there kind of rebuild and you have seen quite a dramatic rally in the loan markets over the last couple of days actually. And that’s been quite supportive. So, I think the second quarter will be really a story about syndicated lending. And then if we get a reduction in volatility, we think we are going to begin to see the bond markets reopen a little bit and the equity markets reopen. I will say what John said, which is our pitch activity, our pipelines and our mandates are extremely strong. And so, it’s really a matter of waiting for the constructive in the markets to return and then we will begin to bring deals. And we saw three or four deals start to emerge last week, which we were on and we feel pretty good about, particularly in the back half of the year.
Bruce Van Saun: The other thing you didn’t mention is the M&A pipeline, which I think still looks really, really good. And again there, if the market stabilized a little bit, I think we will start to pull those deals through and it’s typically seasonal that the fourth quarter is huge, which it was for us in 2021. And then the first quarter is usually softer seasonally, pipelines look good. And I think as the year goes, we should see a nice build in M&A revenue.
Don McCree: Yes. I will also just amplify that, Bruce, to say a lot of our capital markets and M&A activity surrounds private equity. So, private equity is still flushed with cash and they actually are looking at quite interesting valuations in the market right now. So, it’s a matter of matching sellers kind of desires and buyers desires and that will just take a little time to kind of work through the system.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, good.
Scott Siefers: Wonderful. That’s good color. Thank you. And then, John, was something you could talk just a bit about how your rate sensitivity changes as the cycle progresses meaning effectively, how do the first few rate hikes look in your mind versus the next several?
John Woods: So did you say asset sensitivity or was it just – I missed the...
Scott Siefers: In other words, how much more powerful are the first few rate hikes than the next two?
John Woods: Yes. I mean, I’d say that the – we mentioned our $20 million to $25 million per instantaneous 25 rate hike, and that’s really an average. So you get a little more on the front and maybe a little less as you get to the end of it. And that’s really driven by deposit betas, which are going to be extremely well controlled in the first 100. And then that starts to build into the second 100 and then beyond. So yes, I think you will see possibly a bit more on the front end. When we’re seeing those lag effect in deposit betas contribute a touch more and then it will be a little lower on the back end. I will mention is the other point that 20% to 25% is an average, but it’s also a first year average. And so there is actually more upside when you get into – even if it’s instantaneous, you still get a lag effect benefit from the asset side as well as assets reprice. So you might see, for example, in year 2, even for an instantaneous 25 basis point change, you would see upside from there in the 15% to 20% range on top of that as you get into rolling year 2.
Scott Siefers: Perfect. Alright, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.
Erika Najarian: Thank you so much for Slide 7. And I guess, John, maybe let me start my line of questioning here. So your current asset sensitivity from here is pro forma for Investors. I wanted to understand the comment that was made earlier about acceleration, right? So on one hand, we do expect deposit betas to accelerate as we are deeper into the rate cycle. But on the other hand, you have some drops on your portfolio today. Can you talk a bit about the interplay of both? And how should we think of this asset sensitivity as we move forward in the rate cycle? And does the swap portfolio give you a different trajectory for enhanced sensitivity later?
John Woods: Yes. Thanks, Erika. I think if you’re on Page 7, I mean, I think that the drivers there are that we’re entering this cycle were much better positioned than the last cycle. When you think about just the starting point with interest-bearing deposit costs being at 10 basis points, an all-time low for us, we started the last cycle at 34 basis points. And the balance sheet position, the mix on the deposit side is much better with 32% noninterest-bearing. So we feel – just we’re much better prepared to benefit from rising rates this time around. We still benefited from rising rates last time around, by the way, but we’re much better prepared to benefit from this side around – this time around on deposit betas, given all of the strength on the balance sheet. I’d say when you ask about balance sheet, I mean, I think – and swaps, you really have to think about in the context of the entire balance sheet. So we do have a significant amount of asset sensitivity left to play out. That will decline over time as NII keeps rising, as I mentioned in my remarks, the denominator effect as we update and increase our NII, that alone reduces the percentage of further benefit that could occur for future rate hikes, just dollar for dollar, it’s fine, but the percentages fall. But I do think that there is significant firepower left, both with respect to the balance sheet loan growth part of the story as well as much more hedging left to do before asset sensitivity gets anywhere near neutral. So that’s how I would describe it. I mean in terms of deposit betas, again, 2022, you’re going to see a lot of lag, a lot of lag in the first 100. It will start to catch up maybe in the second 100. And then if we really do get to 300 basis points in Fed funds, you’ll see some of that catch up in 2023. And then I’ll just close out with our conversation about NII being up $290 million to $330 million guide over guide is an important thing to focus on, and that’s on a gradual rate rising scenario. It may be – it could be – it’s much higher in a full year effect when you get to 2023 approaching maybe 2x that.
Bruce Van Saun: And I would just add, Erika, that we’ve been I think, very keen to leave the asset sensitivity high and not do significant additional swaps we’ve done a bit. But anyway, we’re still, I think, of the view that rates could go even higher here. So feel good about how we’re positioned right now.
Erika Najarian: Got it. And the second question is for you, Bruce. The stock is having a good start to the day, but the valuation on tangible book value is underneath your ROTCE landing point for the year, either on a standalone or a pro forma basis. I guess what do you think in your estimation that the market doesn’t understand about the improvement that the bank has made since the IPO? And wondering, I think part of that is the asset sensitivity and deposits. Wondering if you could answer that question as the way – however way you want to, but also could you give us a sense of how much checking accounts you have, for example, on the consumer side versus previous? And maybe remind us why you have to keep what seems like a 50 to 100 basis point higher capital level than a lot of your regional peers?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. There is a lot in that. I’ll try to unpack that, Erika. But I think partly the – our objective here is to continue to perform well through cycles. And so we’re a relatively new company with a relatively fresh management team. And so I think when the market goes into a risk thought posture, some assumptions how are they going to do, we’re not as – we don’t have the historical track record of some of our peers, I think. I think we’ve done a good job of dispelling some of those worry beads when we went through the pandemic, and our credit performance was very good. I think there was some concern for law that we’ve grown the balance sheet fairly quickly to get releveraged after the IPO and was that going to end in tiers. And we’ve said all along and we’ve been very disciplined in terms of where we were lending money and how we were allocating capital, and I think that’s borne fruit. I think now with an up cycle, at the beginning of the year when the environment looked like rates were going to go up gradually to use a Goldilocks example, that was the page was just right scenario. And so our stock performed quite well out of the chute. I think once it became clear that the Fed was behind the curve and was going to start to raise rates much more aggressively, I think then you kind of tipped into it, well, maybe the is too hot. And will our deposit betas go up too fast and curtail some of the benefit from higher rates. And I think, again, with all the work we’ve done and analysis we’ve provided, we’re quite confident that the liability side of this bank is much, much better than it’s ever been. We’ve done a lot of hard work on that. And so we still think whether the path is fast or whether it’s more gradual, we’re going to benefit significantly in terms of interest rates. I’d say also on fees, there is probably a concern that we’ve built up some areas that maybe are more volatile in capital markets and mortgage is kind of a big fee elements for us. Having said that, I think you’ve seen that there is good diversity in our fees. And so in a pandemic period, when capital markets were a bit softer, mortgage revenues were really, really strong, given lower rates, and we see – we can see that flip around. But I think the fact that we’ve assembled an excellent commercial bank with very strong capabilities and have targeted focus on private capital and serving private capital and helping the industries that really are the engine of the economy, technology, health care with our JMP acquisition, I think we’re very confident that we can grow revenue sustainably in capital markets and they’ll move around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. But I think the trend line is upwards and to the right. And again, on the mortgage business, I think we’ve built that out to have a nice diversity of revenues across wholesale channels in our retail channel. I think we can combat some of the lower production volumes by building market share. So we plan to hire more this year. So I think all of these aspects are take time for the market to come around and fully appreciate, and we will just keep doing what we’re doing and putting up good results and executing well. And then I think, ultimately, the stock will take care of itself. With respect to the non-interest-bearing liabilities, I mean, the DDAs as a percentage of the total deposit base is up to about 32%. I think when I walked in the door at the time of the IPO that was probably in the low 20s. So that’s been a dramatic improvement, focusing on total value proposition to certain target customer segments on the consumer side and then also on the commercial side actually just building out our capabilities and investing in our core platform and cash management offering. And so it’s just been a gradual improvement over time as we enhanced our abilities and our targeting and we’ve had nice growth as a result. So I think I’ll stop there. Does anybody want to add to that, Brendan, do you want to talk about consumer deposits and Don on the commercial?
Brendan Coughlin: I’m happy to give – Erika, you had asked about sort of the counts of checking account customers. Just kind of a couple of quick points, when you look at total relationships in the consumer bank, when we went public, we had about 2.9 million to 3 million customers. We now have over 7 million customers in total. Now some of those are loan customers. So when you unpack that to core deposit customers, that number is sort of we went from 2.9 million to 3.5 million customers. So that’s good growth, but that’s really not where the action is in the story versus sort of heading down this path really under the covers on that growth, which we’ve been in sort of top quartile growth of our peers has been a quality transformation. So there is been a dramatic overhaul in how many customers view us as their primary bank. And more than 100% of the growth in the household base has come from mass affluent and affluent customers. So when you combine the higher quality customer with deeper relationships, that’s what’s driving a lot of the improvement in DDA and non-interest-bearing deposits, which is very sustainable. That’s kind of ground game a lot of work over multiple quarters over a lot of years to get that to scale. And look, we still have some running room. I think there is still oxygen left in tank for us to continue to improve the quality of the customer base. We’ve made a lot of progress in catching up to peers, but we still have momentum. It does not seem to be slowing. I think you should expect more and more of that putting aside what happens with the excess stimulus deposits under the coverage, the quality story is still continuing and continuing at scale. The other point I’d make mention obviously you think about betas for this up cycle last time because of the low DDA balances that we had in consumer, we had about $10 billion in CDs. Now we start that period with only $3 billion. And so – when we look a lot more like a bigger sized bank in terms of deposit composition than we do smaller-sized bank where we’re not as rate sensitive in how we’re driving deposits because of that quality transformation that you see in the customer base.
Don McCree: Yes. And I’ll just emphasize, Bruce, what you said in terms of – we’ve gone through a complete reconstruction of our treasury service business. So it was frankly a basket case 6 years ago. And now I would put it up against any other company’s treasury service business, and that’s driving an above trend growth rate, 7% to 10% in terms of year-on-year growth and also driving a skew towards non-interest-bearing deposits. And we didn’t even have a deposit team 6 years ago. And now we have a built-out team, which has got fantastic analytics and bringing new offerings like green deposits in the ESG agenda and also building a liquidity portal. So, it’s a totally different place and we’re seeing the results in terms of deposit levels, and we’re seeing the skew towards non-interest-bearing also.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. So we’re giving you a long-winded answer, Erika, but I wanted to just come back to the last thing you touched on which was ROTCE and also our capital targets. So I think we’re pleased that we can say that we will be solidly in the range for our medium-term targets this year, the 14% to 16%. And you can see that where we were in the first quarter, that should ramp, and so we could be even stronger, I think, as we exit the year. So feel very good about that. We did move the targets from 9.75 to 10 to 9.5 to 10. So we moved them modestly. I’m still a big believer in being somewhat conservative on the capital, particularly as, as I said, we’re a relatively new company. And so I think all our stakeholders from maybe being slightly higher than our peers. But if you look at it over time, we’ve been converging to peers. And honestly, when you look at the CCAR results and our risk profile, there is no reason that longer term we will need to have that premium.
Erika Najarian: Thank you for the complete answer.
Bruce Van Saun: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Autonomous. Your line is now open.
Brian Foran: Hey, good morning. Maybe to follow-up on deposits, you have been very clear and convincing on the improvement in the book. So that’s appreciated and great information. As you think also about the ability to grow deposits over the next 2 years, I wonder – and there is a lot of moving parts. There is no one answer. But if you could just give your thoughts on the ability to grow deposits overall and maybe I’ll touch on consumer versus commercial and how that might behave as rates go up?
John Woods: Yes. Great question, Brian. I appreciate it. I think that if you basically look at excellent opportunities for our deposits over time as our product lineup on both consumer and commercial have improved. And I think if you separate the expectation for – as rates rise, there is some impact on how those deposits play out. There is also the surge deposits that came in, in the pandemic that all appear to be a lot stickier than maybe a lot of us thought when they first showed up. I do think more broadly when you think about the macro, deposits have grown consistently over the last several decades under a number of different macroeconomic scenarios even through quantitative tightening and the like, the banking industry deposit growth seems to continue to chug along. So we’re optimistic that the industry as a whole and we, in particular, given our significantly expanded product capabilities, we will be able to continue to drive really strong deposit growth on both consumer and commercial side. So maybe I’ll just turn it over to Brendan and then maybe Don.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes. Look, I think we’ve demonstrated in a variety of cycles, the ability to deposits at scale. The question is always at what cost? And I think we’re in a dramatically different position in up cycle than we were certainly in the last up cycle, we continue to make improvements sort of on the consumer side, starting with just the breadth of the levers that we’ve built, whether it’s the Citizens Access platform nationally to raise deposits away from our core book the new markets that we’re entering, where we’ve got a solid and stable deposit base, but we think there is a lot of up running room. And in fact, we’re starting to see signs already. We’ve got $100 million in inflow of balanced sales already in the New York market from great execution and solid sales. So we’re optimistic continuing to go forward, that can continue. And as we bring convert the customer base from investors closely they want into the platform, we think that same opportunity will exist in New Jersey. And then our analytics have improved materially over the last couple of years, which allows us to be even more targeted. And when you marry that with what I said a minute ago around just the quality and engagement of our customer base, the confidence of being able to grow deposits with highly engaged customers at more market rates than needing to reach for promo rates. So I feel really good that we will be able to grow at the pace we need with a much more moderate cost.
Don McCree: Yes. I’ll just – I think I said a lot of it in the last comment around treasury services and the growth of that business. But also remember, we’re expanding aggressively in terms of our client base. So we’re in expansion markets. We’re adding a lot of clients and with that comes the opportunity to gather deposits at reasonable costs. So we feel pretty good about it. But I’ll go back to what Brendan said also, it’s really a matter of the day-to-day balancing of volume versus cost and managing that against the asset side of the balance sheet and where we can redeploy capital. So it’s something that we manage carefully, but I feel confident that we’re going to continue to expand the deposit base.
Brian Foran: I appreciate all that. I will say I’m a Citizens Access customer. I am not loving the renewed beta assumptions you’re making, but I guess I’ll have to live with it.
Brendan Coughlin: Well, you can count on us continuing to be disciplined yet competitive.
Brian Foran: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Betsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Good morning.
Betsy Graseck: Two questions. One was just on the most recent conversation that we had on deposit growth. I was intrigued by that. Relative to Bruce, your comment about flowing resi and auto lending growth to, I don’t know, if this is the right word, but keep the LDR, protect the LDR at around the 83% level. So I guess I just wanted to understand if that comment about LDR was more about the deposit growth rate that you were talking to just now? Or was that because of the just opportunities in resi and auto that you’re not seeing as much as maybe you have had over the past few quarters?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I’d say it’s kind of a factor of a number of considerations. One is that we’re already seeing very strong loan demand on the commercial side. We’re seeing line utilization tick up. So there can be somewhat of a rotation over into more growth on commercial. Therefore, when we look at consumer and in the higher rate environment, some of the margins on the lending in areas like auto and mortgage aren’t what they used to be. And so we can still get to the loan growth assumptions that we had coming into the year with that rotation up to more commercial and throttling back a little bit on the consumer side. And we could keep the pedal to the floor and keep pushing on bringing in those consumer assets, but we think we don’t need to do that at this point. We’ve got NIM going up. The rate hikes is providing a big lift. And if the marginal return on that incremental lending in the consumer side for mortgage and auto isn’t hitting our hurdles, and we have no problem backing off that. The net result of that is that, that benefits the LDR versus keeping the pedal to the floor. So we think that’s a trade-off we’re taking.
Betsy Graseck: Okay. And then just your – I guess the underlying question is how high are you willing for LDR to go? And then I also had just a quick question just on yields in general. This past quarter, you had some nice uplift in resi and the securities book, other retail loans. And I’m just wondering was that a function of swap activity that drove up those yields 2Q or was there – it didn’t look like the balances would have driven that 2Q. So just wondering how the deals went there? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Let me start off and then maybe John and Brendan can add on the yield question. But we’ve been – historically, since the IPO, we’ve had a relatively higher LDR that we worked hard to bring down from the high 90s down into the mid-90s. And then with this big influx of liquidity into the market, we’ve been able to bring the LDR back down to 80-ish and it’s inching up a little bit here with all the loan growth that we’re experiencing. I think we should still be able to manage that in the ‘80s, and I can’t really call exactly where that’s likely to be partly depends on the amount of loan growth that we see. But I think just the way we, over time, brought it from high 90s down into mid-90s and I think we can take another step function here with all the liquidity that we have in the house and continue to manage that in a reasonably conservative position with lots of liquidity. So that would be my answer there. John, maybe you want to pick up the yields?
John Woods: Yes, I’ll start off on securities and maybe Brendan can take mortgage. But I can tell you, overall, that it’s not swap activity that’s having an impact on either of those. And as it relates to securities, just to give you a sense, there is two dynamics going on there. One is the front book where current yields on the stuff coming into the portfolio are north of 3%. So we’re in the 300 to 330 basis point range, that’s a driver in 1Q. It wasn’t at that level during 1Q, but it was well over 2%. It was probably 230 to 250 during the first quarter, and that was compared to maybe 175 in 4Q. So that’s the dynamic you’re seeing 1.75 in 4Q, 2.30-ish in 1Q and announced over 3%. So that will continue into the second quarter. The other dynamic is the back book premium amortization tends – declines when rates rise. So you’re seeing the tailwind from that into the securities book. And so that’s the driver there. And maybe Brendan can talk about mortgages.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes. There is a handful of things on the consumer side. So on other retail, there is a good percentage of that book that’s variable linked to the market with our merchant partners and such. And you’re going to see that kind of ramp up as the market changes. On the resi side, we’re obviously a very big lender in HELOC, which is essentially all variable. And we’ve had four sequential quarters in a row and net balance sheet growth and I believe we’re the number one originator in all of the United States and HELOC. So really striking well the iron is hot and taking advantage of that business. So you’re seeing that flow through in the resi book with the yield improvements there as the rates kind of March north. On the mortgage side, there is a couple of things. One is front book pricing. We’ve been disciplined on front book pricing to the point of being a lot on the market at times as the market lags capacity, but we’re going to make sure we’re using our balance sheet for deep relationships and try to push our rates up as fast as we can with the market. The other just technical dynamic that you’re seeing, if you’re looking at linked quarter on mortgages in Q4, we did have a one-time reserve adjustment to the yields in Q4 that is non-recurring and didn’t happen in Q1. So if you look back a couple of quarters, you’ll see a little bit of noise on what you saw in Q4, but that’s kind of gone. That’s sort of washed out, so we should start to see the mortgage book begin to climb with the percentage of that book that is in variable rate and continued expected discipline on front book pricing.
Betsy Graseck: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matt O’Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Matt O’Connor: Good morning. I was hoping you guys could remind us with investors, is there any portion of the loan book or securities book that you’re looking to kind of deemphasize or runoff?
John Woods: I’ll just start off there. I mean I think that the securities book and investors looks as a profile that we would migrate and frankly, have already been migrating to our profile, which is mostly clean duration plus mortgage-backed securities, agency-type paper. So we’ve been in the process of migrating the securities book on that front. In general, we like the loan book that comes over from investors has performed well from a credit perspective. They have a nice core portfolio over there. Maybe Don can talk about anything else that might be migrated at the margin.
Don McCree: Yes. There are certain elements of the book that might be a little bit different as we move forward, but it’s not going to be quick and aggressive. We are going to do it – we are going to migrate it over time. But a lot of the business that they do is very diversifying for us. They are in different elements of the CRE business than we are. So, it looks quite different. And then a lot of the C&I business is smaller company business banking, and we are looking to grow that segment as we move forward. So, you will see some adjustment at the margin, but no aggressive asset sales, I think out blocks.
John Woods: Other than – I will say, Matt, on my side, we are doing roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion of DSO adjustments on the Citizens side, and you will see us do some of that as we move around low-yielding assets that we might be acquiring, but we don’t have full plans on that yet.
Don McCree: Yes, balance sheet, optimization and…
Matt O’Connor: And then I guess, obviously, there are some opportunities as well to essentially cross-sell. But as we think about layering in investors to the kind of medium-term, do you think it will have any net impact as we think about your loan growth, either a little bit less than standalone or a little bit more or roughly the same?
John Woods: Well, I mean I would look at it as what Don and Brendan has been able to accomplish when we go into expansion markets, right, in particular, Don’s business and commercial when we entered the Southeast is a good playbook for how we have been able to grow those expansion markets a little faster for a period of time until it converges over time. So, I think you would expect that once we get the engine running with respect to all of the integration and conversion, and we have been able to make our investments that we plan to make in New York Metro. I would suspect for a number of years, you could see the growth rates once that all settles out and baseline, you can see those growth rates actually being higher than Citizens standalone for a number of years until it balances out in terms of the expected market share that we plan to take in that metro.
Don McCree: Yes. John, I will also add that they have a very limited product set on the C&I side. So, bringing in the variety of products that we can offer and capabilities that we can offer, we think there is an opportunity to go after larger companies and also serve their clients in a much more substantial way.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes. The same comments on the consumer side, our product set is significantly more diversified than both HSBC and investors, which is great. And we didn’t build those revenue synergies into the deal model. So, we are seeing early signs of significant sales opportunity in New York. We are delivering on that. We are starting marketing middle of the year. We are going to convert early on mortgage and wealth for investors inside of 2022, and then the rest of the platform will convert in 2023. So, it will take some time, but we see an outsized opportunity for sustainable revenue growth over time.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Let me just chime in here as well, is that we think these deals are going to be a big success, and it’s really not just the expense synergies, which we are going to go get. But if it’s a big success, it means that we were successful in cross-selling more to the customers who haven’t had the benefit of our broader products and services and then just gain market share. And I think we have some very clear ideas about how to go after that, both on the commercial side and the consumer side. And really none of that is – has been put into our forward forecast at this point. So, goal would be like within 3 years to 5 years, if New York starts to take on a look and feel of what we built in Boston and what we built in Philadelphia, is going to be a home run for us.
Matt O’Connor: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Ken Usdin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question about reserving and provisions. So, just looking back at where you are 130 – 143 ACL is pre- ISPC and then just with all the CECL stuff going on, just wanted to kind of understand where do you think that the reserve lands vis-à-vis a blended day one? And what does that mean for further release or provision growth relative to your expectations that you laid out for charge-offs? Thanks.
John Woods: Yes, that’s a good question. I mean I think the first thing I would say, when you were saying blended, if you were speaking about investors on a blended basis, I think that their profile is actually quite good. And when you look back in different cycles, their loss rates actually are lower than not only ours, but the regional bank peer set. So – and given the collateralization, etcetera, and a number of other things that help that profile. So, pound-for-pound, they come on with a slightly lower ACL and CECL hit to what CFG standalone is not by a lot, and they are smaller, so it won’t have a huge impact, but they come in a little lower than and call it, the 143 that where we are. So, from that perspective, it gives you a sense for how that might cause us to tick down on a blended basis. CECL day one was 147, we are at 143. We have cleaned out a lot of the portfolios of concern that might have existed back at the end of ‘19 when CECL was adopted, and there has been significant as we mentioned earlier, and we have in the slide deck in the appendix, significant improvements in both commercial and kind of retail businesses since then. So, you could see some opportunity all else equal for back book needs as long as the macro holds for those needs to tick down. I think all of the variability will be on loan growth. And so we are just going to provide for our loan growth and all-in probably be a little lower than we are here, but not by a lot.
Bruce Van Saun: The other wildcard, obviously, Ken, is what is the kind of long-term or the medium-term macro forecast look like and can the Fed engineer a soft landing. Is there a higher possibility of recession, which could change that dynamic somewhat. But I think, certainly, right now, with respect to 2022, we feel really good about how we are positioned from a credit standpoint. I would – if you ask me to make a call, I would say it’s unlikely we will have a recession in ‘22. So, at least the clean credit metrics should continue for a while. Whether we can still show net benefits on the provision line, I think those days are probably numbered. But in any case, I think there is still going to be good numbers. And as John said, the ACL may tick down a little more from here, but kind of starting to feel like we are not going to go a huge amount lower.
Ken Usdin: Yes. And Bruce, as a follow-up to that, it was nice to see the commercial line utilization up 150 basis points you talked about. You are reiterating your full year loan growth guidance. Just wondering if you can give us some on-the-ground color about business activity, supply chain constraints? Just in terms of – and also the trade-off possibly between loans going on the balance sheet versus out the door in capital markets. And just kind of a feel for just how the commercial side of the economy is feeling and how that influences your views on commercial growth? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Let me just say a word and then Don really has the best color. But clearly, it’s nice to see the line utilization pick up. Some of it is a little defensive in nature. So, people have been worried about their supply chain and inventory levels. And so when they can get a hold of the materials that they need to go out and buy it. So, I would say inventory build in light of supply chain issues probably has been the biggest driver and a little of that also is inflation, which is causing those materials to cost more. So, that would be, I would say, number one. There is still – people doing deals, doing smaller deals and playing offense in terms of growth. There is a little bit of that kicking in as well. I think what continues to give us confidence is the thing that Don mentioned earlier that there is private capital has amassed tons of firepower to put to work in the markets and is looking to get deals done. And so there is still deal-related activity that should continue to fuel some loan growth. But with that, let me turn it over to Don.
Don McCree: Yes. So, I think you covered most of it. And back to the second half of the question, a lot of the capital markets activity we do is in the leverage buyout area and things like that. So, that’s an origination for distribution business, which it should be. We don’t want a lot of that on our balance sheet, and we continue to maintain average holds of about $12 million in our sponsor business. So, very diversified, very careful from a risk profile. I will say that the utilization trend that we are seeing is actually even a little bit higher as we sit here in mid-April. So, that trend really is driven by cost of goods. So, there is an inflation aspect and some of the stockpiling. But the broader question is we are hearing generally positive things from our customers. Credit quality, as we said, feels pretty good. There is a little bit of pressure on margins as companies have varying degrees of an ability to pass on cost increases where they ire seeing them. But remember that these companies have been through hell over the last 2 years with the pandemic, and they have cut their costs. They have restructured their businesses and they are entering whatever we are entering, whether it would be a slowdown or something that’s just slower growth in a much better position from a management standpoint than they were just 2 years ago. So, that gives us a lot of confidence. And certain clients are being opportunistic where they are seeing, as Bruce said, where they are seeing competitors that are slightly weakened, we are seeing a little bit of M&A activity in the middle market channels that are companies are buying each other right now.
Bruce Van Saun: The one last thing you might also add Don is on subscription line financing some of the securitization…
Don McCree: Yes. So, we are seeing significant volume in our subscription line financing for private equity and significant volume in our asset-backed securities businesses in the warehouses. So, those markets are very strong and we continue to see growth in the loan books on both of those activities.
Ken Usdin: Great. Thanks for all the color.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.
John Pancari: Good morning. I appreciate the color you gave there in terms of the commercial drivers and the trend behind the demand. Are you able to perhaps help unpack the high-single digit loan growth expectation ex the deal and ex-PPP for 2022 in terms of how you think about C&I growth and perhaps growth in your CRE portfolio as well? Thanks.
Don McCree: Yes. So, why don’t I start with that. So, we are down to basically almost nothing on the C&I side on PPP. So, that’s in the rearview mirror. So, that’s not in any of our loan growth projections. So, the loan growth that we have referenced is really CFG loan growth. We have assumed a little bit of growth on the investors bank side, but not a lot for the rest of ‘22. So, all the comments we are making are CFG specific. I would say subscription lines are growing the fastest. C&I is growing the second fastest and CRE, we are seeing very, very modest growth. And we are basically on our pre business really still focused on purpose-built office, industrial and life science and a little bit of multifamily, but not a lot. We are really off risk on hospitality and retail. So, not a lot of CRE business there. The issue that we are fighting and continue to fight although it’s getting a little bit better is our originations are really strong, and we are seeing lots of activity both coming into the book and also in the pipeline, but pay-downs have been quite high. And this was the first quarter where we saw pay-downs begin to decline. Maybe that’s a little bit of the volatility in the capital markets, maybe that’s a little bit of the loan market aggressiveness right now, but we are seeing a little bit of a benefit from lower pay-downs, which were running very, very high last year for almost the whole year and really eating up a lot of the origination activity that we are receiving.
John Pancari: Okay. Great. That’s helpful. And then separately, on the credit side, I just have a question there. In terms of the increase in the NPAs and the increase in the 90-day delinquencies, I know you indicated that’s mainly mortgage coming off forbearance. Just want to give you – if you could give us a little color in terms of your confidence there in terms of the resolution of those items? And then separately, in minds of faster-than-expected credit normalization on the consumer side, perhaps in your merchant partnerships or anything? Thanks.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes, it’s Brendan. I can take that. On the mortgage side, this is fully expected. These are sort of an administrative move of customers that have been in forbearance for quite some time. We have done extensive analytics on how much loss exposure we have to folks that are coming off of forbearance on to a full repayment schedule and its de minimis. Especially on the mortgage side, we have got very significant coverage on our loan to value. And so we feel really confident in that. Just broadly on the consumer book, we haven’t seen much of any early signs that we are starting to see a tick up in return to normal. We are expecting one, but the delinquency levels generally remain in very strong spot and significantly depressed. Some of the newer portfolios that we have talked a lot about over the years on these calls and others around student loans and merchant point-of-sale maintain incredible strength and have not shown any signs of uptick in early delinquencies whatsoever. So, we feel really confident around the outlook, the state of credit and consumers that the lowest levels it’s ever been, and we continue to sort of beat to the positive almost every month on what we are seeing on NTO. So, I feel really good. And I think – and when you look at the other side of the ledger for the average consumer, they are still showing a lot of excess liquidity, the money in consumer checking accounts is still at all-time highs, really hasn’t moved down. While we are seeing a lot of velocity in customers using credit cards and spending and paying for things, it’s not adding to outstanding. So, in order to believe that you will start to see a meaningful correction on the credit line, I think you would have to see some deflation on the excess cash built up in the consumers’ wallet and start to see a rebound in receivables building up in the credit card. So, we haven’t seen that. So, all the early indicators just aren’t moving yet. Of course, we do expect it will, but just right now, it’s not. So, we will take it.
Bruce Van Saun: I would just add to that, John, is all the early warning signs are flash and green, which is great. So, on the consumer side, delinquency roll rates, some of the things Brendan quoted, all appear really, really good. Similarly, on the commercial side, the crit/class ratio continues to go down and the heightened. There is very few credits that are in heightened monitoring. So, that also bodes well for the future. You can – at these very low levels for things like charge-offs and NPAs you can see kind of one item can kind of move that number around a little bit. But overall, we feel really, really positive about the outlook for credit for certainly the balance of this year.
John Pancari: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.
Peter Winter: Thanks. I was just curious, are there any plans to manage the available for sale securities portfolio just given the rising rates or any plans to move any of it into like held to maturity or hedge some of this?
John Woods: Yes, it’s a good question. I mean I think we are in about a little bit less than 10%, call it, high-single digits with HCM, if you – in the first quarter. I think you will see that, that number will rise in the second quarter based upon a number of things that we are doing. We are putting a lot of securities to work just in CFG standalone, just given the environment, now that there is a highly attractive place to grow the securities book at north of 300% yields, just on standalone. And then we are, of course – we have closed on the acquisition of investors and there is about $4 billion of securities there that we are rotating out of the profile that they had into the profile that looks like the kind of securities that we own. So, there is lots of opportunities to address that, and you are likely to see the HCM percentage rise in the second quarter.
Peter Winter: Okay. Thanks. And then just secondly, just on the HSBC acquisition, I think at the time of the announcement in May, there was about $9 billion in deposits and you closed it with $6.3 billion in deposits. Do you think at these levels, deposits hold steady, you can grow them? Just – if you could just talk about that change in the outlook.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes. Pre legal day one, the rundown in deposits is principally driven by their online business and a segment of international customers that we are rotating into banks that have more global capabilities. And so the good news on that is that we didn’t pay premium of any kind for those customers that we weren’t really going to get at our core. We had modeled in essentially twice the level of deposit attrition post legal day one than you would normally expect in a deal like that, given the profile of the customers that were banking at HSBC. The good news is since legal day one, it looks like a lot of that attrition had accelerated pre-legal day one, and we have seen the portfolio at a broadly stable level with good sales, very strong sales and normal expected is in outflows on the back book. And so we do expect that to be stable now and start to get into growth mode as we ramp up our marketing activities, which would obviously be a bit of a benefit on the deal model side offsetting some of the shortfall in deposits we got on legal day one. So, we feel really, really good on the early signs that we are seeing here we are six weeks or seven weeks in.
John Woods: Just to add, we had the transition pre legal day one that we didn’t have to pay for it, and it produces the trend with the attrition happening post legal day one. I just want to add that plan.
Peter Winter: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.
Gerard Cassidy: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Good morning.
Gerard Cassidy: Bruce, you said in your opening comments that obviously, the focus this year is to integrate the acquisitions you did in the Metro New York marketplace, but in the wealth space, if something was priced right that would be something you would consider. Thinking about the Florida franchise as you build that out, if a depository came up at attractive pricing and, again, I know you have played is full with what you are doing in New York, is that something that you could consider, or you really know, we just we are going to wait until we get these things fully integrated before we consider a deposit deal?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I don’t see us looking at a depository there anytime soon. I think we have got enough on our plate that getting off to this really great start and launching New York Metro is job one. We do have a strategy in Florida that I think is interesting. So, we had a couple of de novo wealth centers, one in Palm Beach and one in Naples that we focused on launching and starting to get those to the right customer levels and the right staffing so that we can really make some traction in those markets. And then we had five or six come over from HSBC, very attractive locations and branches with good staffing in the Miami area. And so again, that’s job one is to try to really make that work, what we have and really drive up the performance of those sites and keep getting smart in the market and keep talking to people, keep trying to figure out kind of where with the next city where we think we could come in and make an entrance and gain some share. So, that’s to me, the focus, and we will keep trying to get smart on the market, but let’s suggest what we have and make that productive. The other point I would make with respect to Florida and elsewhere where we are kind of outside of our core footprint is we are investing heavily in the digital bank. And very recently, we have migrated to a new cloud-based core platform, which is really exciting for us, it’s going to unlock the ability for us to really broaden our offerings and integrate those offerings on the digital platform. And so that’s kind of also twinned with some light branches in markets like Florida, can we really start to bang the opportunity through our digital platforms. And then over time, we will figure out what physical presence do we need to complement those digital offerings. So, it’s pretty exciting. We have a similar opportunity in the Greater Washington area, where we picked up, I think it’s nine or ten branches from HSBC. So, we can try to attack that market through digital and decide is nine or ten the right number, are they in the right locations, do we need to alter that and then using test and learning from Florida and from DC. Are there some other attractive cities where we might want to go next and really put effort into growing digital presence combined with some thin branch presence.
Gerard Cassidy: Very good Bruce, and to pivot the next question is on deposits. How do you guys weigh and you talked about how certificates of deposits have come down dramatically. You have got a very strong DDA balance core now much higher than when you went public, of course. But with rates moving up so quickly now in the 10 year is almost at 3% today, when does long-term funding with low-cost CDs make sense? And then Don, when do your customers start asking for higher compensating balances as rates move up? Have you guys seen more discussions there as well on the compensating balances on the commercial side?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I will go ahead and start a couple of thoughts there. I mean I think that as you heard from Brendan earlier, and you saw on our Slide 7, our CD portfolio is much smaller than it was before. And what that – at the start, and I think what the point there is that CDs could be part of the story. And we would do it in a way that’s connected to a deep customer relationship rather than sort of a pseudo wholesale funding approach, which is I think how things got played out early in the last cycle for us, whereas this cycle is all going to be about customer relationships. I think the other thing to keep in mind is that over the last cycle, we expect CD betas to be lower during the cycle and part due to how quickly you think the cycle is going to go. The last cycle took a longer time, 2 years to 3 years. And so you kept getting that ratcheted up cost of CDs every time they came to maturity. So, I do think CDs can be part of the story given deep customer relationships and a shorter cycle, CDs can absolutely be something a tool that will utilize coming off a lower base. So, that’s the first point. And the second point is that on the commercial side, you will have balanced migration, that’s natural as compensating balances that don’t need to be quite as high to get as earnings credit rates actually rise over time. So yes, there will be some of that migration that’s built into the deposit betas that we articulated earlier and built into our deposit costs overall. And so – but it’s the same point there that given the number of ways that we can interact with our customers on the commercial side, we are deepening our relationships there and expect that those migrations will be well controlled and as expected.
Don McCree: Yes. I think that’s exactly right. And we have actually gone out over the last month or so with a full or information package with all of our bankers to discuss deposit and pricing levels as part of the overall relationship, with all of our relationship managers. So, we are well on top of it. We have had some people pull deposits, but we haven’t had a problem backfilling and bringing in other deposits to basically cover any outflows.
Gerard Cassidy: Great. Thank you for the color.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Alright. I think that’s it for the questions in the queue. And let me just close by thanking everybody again for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and your support. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-19 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alan, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.
Kristin Silberberg: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking are also here and will discuss some of the exciting strategic initiatives that we have underway. We will be referencing our fourth quarter and full year earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we'll be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements which is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to you Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining our call. We are pleased with the financial performance we delivered for the fourth quarter and the full year. And we feel well-positioned to continue our momentum through 2022. The investments that we've made to transform and reposition Citizens since our IPO are really bearing fruit. Our customer centric approach, backed by a full range of product offerings and strong digital data and technology capabilities has allowed us to gain market share, deepen relationships with customers, and develop sustainable growth opportunities. We've navigated the pandemic environment well, shifting to offense over the course of 2021 to accelerate our strategy, including five acquisitions as we strive to build a unique and special top performing bank.  I'll comment briefly on a few of the financial headlines and let John take you through the details. For the quarter, our underlying earnings per share was $1.26 and our return on tangible common equity was 14.6%. Sequential operating leverage was 1.5%, that's 1.8% ex acquisitions and sequential growth in PPNR was a strong 6%. Leading our performance was an unbelievably strong quarter in our capital markets business, led by M&A and loan syndications. We built a great business through hiring top talent in combination with several acquisitions, and our approach to market is really clicking. For the quarter, we were number one in the league table for middle market sponsor transactions and number four for overall middle market. We only had JMP results for six weeks of the quarter, but we're very excited about how they'll augment what we've already assembled. Our highlights for the quarter include strong sequential loan growth of 4% on a spot basis, 5% ex PPP, while average growth was 2% and that's 3% ex PPP. Commercial growth and a pickup in line utilization were bright spots, and we enter 2022 with a good jump off point. We did a nice job on expenses pulling across our top efficiency saves to help offset higher incentive comp tied to revenues. And credit remains pristine as good as it gets. Our capital position remains strong with CET1 ratio of 9.9% giving us a great deal of capital management flexibility in 2022. We have the capital and liquidity to fund the attractive loan growth we expect to see in 2022̣, while looking for selective acquisitions and ensuring strong returns of capital to shareholders. With respect to our guidance for 2022, we assume solid economic growth of around 4%, several fed rate hikes and improvement in loan demands. Our top six and top seven programs should allow us to keep expense growth ex acquisitions below 3% and we're targeting 2% positive operating leverage, including the bank yield scheduled to close soon, and almost 5% ex PPP impact. Credit is expected to continue to be highly favorable, and I'd expect our return on tangible common equity to move over 14% in the second half of the year, potentially reaching 15% in Q4. So, all in all, a very strong year of execution and delivery for all stakeholders by Citizens in 2021, and we feel we are well-positioned to do well in 2022 and continue our journey towards becoming a top performing bank. I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering a great effort in 2021. We know we can count on you again in the new year. So, with that, I'll turn it over to John.
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with the headlines for the quarter. We reported underlying net income of $569 million and EPS of $1.26. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 14.6%, which included the impact of a credit provision benefit. Revenue of $1.7 billion was up 4% linked quarter, given strong growth in fee income. Average loans were up a solid 3% in the quarter, before the impact of PPP forgiveness, led by retail which is up by 4% and 3% growth in commercial. Overall spot loan growth of 5% for the quarter excluding PPP, provides good underlying momentum for loan growth this year. Linked quarter fee growth was 16% or 10% before acquisitions, including outstanding results in capital markets, driven by record M&A fees and loan syndications as we've executed well and gained market share. And excluding the impact of the two commercial fee-based acquisitions we close in the second half, we delivered underlying positive sequential operating leverage of approximately 2% this quarter with well controlled expenses. We recorded a credit provision benefit of $25 million, which reflects strong credit performance and the improving economy. Our year end ACL ratio stands at 1.51%, above our day one CECL level of 1.47%. We continue to have a very strong capital position with CET1 at 9.9% after returning $360 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Next, I'll provide some key takeaways for the fourth quarter, while referring to the presentation slides. Net interest income on Slide 6 was down 2%, given lower net interest margin, partially offset by strong loan growth. The net interest margin was 2.66%, down 6 basis points reflecting a reduced benefit from PPP forgiveness, and lower earning asset yields given changes in loan mix and spread compression, partially offset by the impact of lower cash balances as we redeploy some of our excess liquidity into loan growth. We also made continued progress lowering our interest-bearing deposit costs, which were down 1 basis point to 13 basis points. On the bottom left side of the page, you can see we remain highly asset sensitive at the end of the quarter with an overall sensitivity of 10.1% to a gradual 200 basis point rise in rates. At the end of the year, about 60% of our sensitivity is geared towards the short end. So, we are well-positioned to benefit when the Fed begin to tighten. Referring to Slide 7, we delivered terrific fee results this quarter, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our businesses with outstanding results in capital markets. reflecting our long-term investments in the business and solid performance across other fee categories. We set a new record for quarterly capital markets with exceptional strength in M&A advisory and loan syndication fees, amid a backdrop of good market activity. We continue to gain market share and have nice momentum as we enter 2022. We also delivered our best quarterly results of the year in FX and IRP, which are up 21% linked quarter, given an increase in currency transactions driven by robust M&A activity and an increase in client hedging given the outlook for rate rises. Mortgage fees declined in the quarter against the backdrop of strong competition in excess industry capacity. We saw ongoing pressure on gain on sale margins, particularly in third-party channels and seasonally lower production volume. Mortgage servicing income improved as our third-party servicing book grew 3% linked quarter to $90 billion. Card fees were stable as debit transactions and credit card spend continue to exceed pre-pandemic levels, while fees also remain strong. Service charges and fees were modestly lower reflecting the impact of Citizens peace of mind, our new customer friendly deposit account feature. We are seeing these changes drive clear benefits from customer experience as customer satisfaction is up and call center volume is down since we implemented the changes. On Slide 8, expenses were well controlled. Excluding the impact of the fee-based acquisitions that closed in the second half of the year, non-interest expense was stable, and we drove linked quarter operating leverage of about 2%. These results reflect higher incentive compensation types of strong capital markets revenue and strategic investments, which was balanced by strong expense discipline and the benefit of top efficiency initiatives. Period-end loans on Slide 9 were up 4% linked quarter or 5% excluding PPP. We were pleased to see strong commercial loan growth of more than 6% excluding PPP. Retail loans are also growing up 4%. Average loans were up 2% and up more than 3% excluding PPP. Retail strength was driven by mortgage and auto. Commercial originations were very strong, exceeding pre-pandemic levels led by corporate banking, subscription line financing, supporting deal related activity and asset backed lending. After line utilizations levels ticked up last quarter, we saw a larger increase of about 270 basis points to 35% on the spot basis this quarter, primarily driven by deal related financing activity. We continue to expect a gradual recovery and utilization over the coming quarters as some of the issues holding back investments such as supply chain challenges and labor shortages resolve. In addition, our period-end commitments are up a very strong 8% which will benefit us as investment continues to pick up. On Slide 10, deposit flows continue to be robust, especially in low-cost categories, and our liquidity ratios remain strong. Average deposits were up 1% linked quarter and 5% year-over-year with strong growth in demand deposits, which now make up 32% of total deposits, up from 30% last year. Interest bearing deposits were broadly stable as the continued runoff of higher cost of term deposits was offset by growth in demand deposits and lower cost categories. We continue to make good progress on deposit repricing with interest bearing deposit costs down 1 basis point to 13 basis points during the quarter. Given the changing tone of the Fed and the potential that they may begin to tighten earlier -- early this year, we thought it would be helpful to make a few points about how we see our deposit costs behaving in the next rate cycle. First, we've made significant improvements to our deposit related capabilities since the IPO. Our enhanced data analytics capabilities allow us to optimize the deposit base by attracting more stable deposits with targeted offers and by employing more dynamic pricing. We also have the added lever of Citizens Access, which was proven to be a very efficient deposit channel. And we have strengthened our commercial offerings and invested in enhanced tools to drive higher operating deposits. Secondly, our mix of lower cost deposits is much better with demand deposits now 32% of the book, compared to 27% at the beginning of the last rate cycle. And consumer CDs, which were at 14% of total deposits at the end of the last cycle are now down to 3%, which is below peer levels. Also note that the HSBC branch acquisition will add almost $8 billion or 5% to our core deposits when we close this quarter. Lastly, we have vastly improved our overall liquidity profile with a lower LDR and much lower deposit costs than when we entered the last rate cycle. When you add that all up, we are confident that our deposit base will be meaningful low -- meaningfully lower than the prior cycle. Moving on to credit on Slide 11. We saw excellent credit results again this quarter. Net charge-offs were broadly stable at 14 basis points for the fourth quarter with good performance across the portfolio. Nonperforming loans decreased 6% linked quarter with continued improvement in commercial. Other credit metrics continue to improve as criticized loans were lower and internal ratings upgrades exceeded downgrades. Moving to Slide 12. We maintained an excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remain strong at 9.9% at the end of the fourth quarter, after returning $360 million in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and closing the JMP acquisition. On the bottom right of the page, we expect a 22 basis point impact to CET1 from the pending HSBC acquisitions, and the ISPC transaction will be effectively neutral given the stock to be issued in the deal. Shifting gears towards business strategy a bit, we thought it would be useful to have Brendan and Don discuss some of the exciting strategic initiatives that we have underway and how we are poised for strong and sustainable growth. Brendan, over to you.
Brendan Coughlin: Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. On Slide 13, you can see we've dramatically transformed the Consumer Bank since the IPO and have a strong foundation to propel us into the future. Let me share a few highlights. We're acquiring customers at a pace that far exceeds the pace of household formation in the U.S., nearly doubling our customer base from approximately 3 million at the time of our IPO to 6.4 million today. Further, our mobile engagement is up 15% year-over-year closing gaps to peers and allow us to thin our physical network by another 8% this year, about 20% since our IPO. This enables us to reinvest in growth strategies. We built one of the most diversified consumer lending businesses in the U.S., giving us a number of additional levers for revenue growth and customer deepening that many of our peer banks lack. We've transformed our deposit book, repositioning our deposit mix quite significantly with strong DDA growth, which has really driven down our cost of funds by about 75% compared with the time of our IPO. Finally, while we have more work to do, our wealth business has been repositioned for growth, and our AUM is more than 3x the size at the time of the IPO. So, 5 years ago, we were very much a traditional regional only bank. We have strong momentum in the business, have broadly caught up with peers and in a number of places have built best in market capabilities that have lived to differentiated growth rates. Moving on to Slide 14 and looking forward, we prioritized several strategic initiatives that should help us deliver above trend revenue growth, adding about $1 billion by the year five. First, we expect to leverage our acquisitions in New York Metro markets to grow share and deepen relationships. We will pick up almost 1 million new customers who have been underserved given that their current banks don't have the breadth of product capabilities that we have. There is strong upside if we can replicate in New York, what we had done in our core markets like Philadelphia and Boston. The second area is wealth, where we have a great opportunity as well. We've recently attracted a new and strong leadership team with a long track record of industry success, our regional footprint, and our bank customer base is highly attractive and provide significant opportunity for sustained growth. Third, our Citizens Pay offering is unique amongst all the industry players in the fast growing buy now pay later space. We were early movers in the space starting with the Apple partnership in 2015. We built a very strong position now with 44 partners. We've added industry verticals and have remained focused on getting marquee partners providing good momentum, and with a strong pipeline for 2022. Lastly, our national push will be led by our digital capabilities and that includes our efforts to build on the Citizens Access launch in 2018, and the integration of our full range of products and services on a modern cloud-based platform. We'll continue to add products to the platform in '22 and we'll aim to drive improved customer deepening. We will also leverage the strategy to accelerate our technology transformation of our core bank, as we ultimately aim to converge the operating platforms into one national digital first structure. Now let me pass it over to Don.
Don McCree: Okay. Good stuff, Brendan. Let me shift to our commercial priorities which were on Slide 15. We've added some great talent to the commercial bank on both the coverage side as well as the product side, and we're able to do more for our customers over their life cycle than ever before. We've been near the top of the middle market league tables helping corporate clients and private equity sponsors access capital to private and public debt and equity markets. And we've integrated our cash management and global market solutions well with our coverage teams. On the coverage side, we're expanding geographically and moving upmarket into the mid corporate space where it's critical to deliver deep industry expertise. Our JMP acquisition, which closed late last year, gives us a much broader and deeper corporate finance coverage in technology, health care and financial services. Plus, we gain an equities business that is very well run, focused and highly regarded and we're already seeing great cross-sell dividends off of it. As non-bank lenders continue to take lending market share from banks and private equity ownership of companies continue to increase, we’ve broadened our capabilities to better compete successfully in the new landscape. We will increase -- we increasingly generate more fee revenue across our customer base given these expanded capabilities. It's also worth noting that Willamette, the transaction we closed mid last year dramatically expands our valuation services business with a very prestigious outfit. This capability is highly synergistic with our M&A and broader capital markets effort and has annuity like qualities. So, you can see the success we've had in building and scaling up our businesses to deliver more than just traditional banking products to our clients. We are highly confident that this list will continue to drive sustainable and growing revenue streams. Over to you, John.
John Woods: Thanks, Don. On Slide 16, you'll see some examples of the tremendous progress we've made against the key strategic initiatives that Brendan and Don mentioned, and other what we're doing across the Bank to better serve our customers and make Citizens a great place to work. We are very excited to see how our digital first approach is increasing engagement with our customers, and how this is all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction. Moving to Slide 17, I'll touch on our TOP programs. Even as we intended to offense with our strategic initiatives and acquisitions, it is important to remember that a key to Citizens success since our IPO has been our continuous efforts to realize efficiencies and reinvest these savings back into our businesses so we can serve customers better. We've effectively wrapped up our TOP six programs after achieving our targeted pre-tax run rate benefits of approximately $425million at the end of 2021. Now we have launched TOP 7 with a goal of an exit run rate of about $100 million of pre-tax benefits by the end of 2022. We are really doubling back to mine areas where we have already been successful. For example, continuing our multiyear journey of digital transformation across consumer and commercial, looking at further organizational streamlining, accelerating and building on our next gen tech initiatives and doing more in the cloud. We're going to focus on maturing our agile operating model and take another look at our vendor spend as well. Based on the work we've done so far, we feel confident that we can deliver on this new program. Moving to Slide 18, we made a lot of progress on the ESG front last year, and we will continue to make meaningful progress in 2022. A few highlights for the launch of a new green deposits program to allow corporate clients to direct their cash reserves towards companies and projects that are expected to create a positive environmental impact. We adopted targets to meaningfully reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. We have a strong commitment to social equity, and our colleagues continue a tradition of being highly focused on volunteering in our communities. To serve our clients better, we introduced new deposit account features that help customers avoid unexpected overdraft fees, and we immediately saw changes that indicate a meaningful improvement in customer experience. This should help attract and keep more customers with the bank. And now for some high-level commentary on the outlook for full year 2022 on Slide 19. First, let me be clear that this is a standalone outlook that includes JMP and Willamette, which closed late last year, but does not include any benefit from our pending acquisitions of HSBC and Investors. The bottom left corner of the page includes information that should help if you're trying to also layer in the expected contribution from these acquisitions in 2022. For 2022, we expect NII to be up 3% to 5%, driven primarily by mid-single-digit average loan growth. Excluding PPP, we expect NII to grow high single digits driven by high single-digit average loan growth. Average interest earning assets are expected to be up slightly as excess liquidity is deployed into loan growth. The rate scenario used in our outlook is based on the forward curve as of January 5, and includes three implied Fed rate hikes of 25 basis points each in April, July and December. On the long end, we are planning for the 10-year treasury to be about 1.9% by the end of the year. The rate curve benefit on net interest margin will allow us to be to more than offset the 2022 impacts from lower PPP forgiveness and swap revenue, while presenting meaningful upside to NIM in 2023 and beyond. Fee income is expected to be up 4% to 7% given continued strength in capital markets and wealth following record performances in 2021. Non-interest expense is expected to be up 5% to 6% given the full year effect of our commercial fee-based acquisitions, or up less than 3% excluding the impact of these acquisitions. We have included an expense walk on Slide 24, that lays out the drivers. Credit is expected to remain excellent with net charge-offs broadly stable to down slightly and provision expense is less than net charge-offs. And we plan to continue operating with a CET1 ratio within our target range of 9.75% to 10%, which incorporates an anticipated increase in our dividends in the second half of the year. On the lower left of the slide, you'll see our expectations for the pro forma impact of HSBC and Investors with EPS accretion of about 5% based on consensus at the time of announcing and approximately $475 million in additional PPNR to our 2022 results. Importantly, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage of approximately 2% on an underlying basis point -- basis for the year, including HSBC and Investors. And if you set aside the impact of PPP, that would be a very strong 5% operating leverage. Moving to Slide 20, I'll cover the outlook for the first quarter. We expect NII to be down about 1% despite solid loan growth, given a $20 million smaller contribution from PPP, and an $18 million impact from lower data, including the impact of HSBC, NII will be broadly stable for the quarter. Average loans are expected to be up 2% to 3% with interest bearing assets broadly stable. Fees are expected to be down 8% to 12%, reflecting seasonally lower capital markets fees than the record we delivered last quarter, as well as see other seasonal impacts. Non-interest expense is expected to be up approximately 6% given seasonal compensation impacts and the full quarter impact of the JMP acquisition. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable with provision less than net-charge offs. And we expect our CET1 ratio to land at around 9.75%, including an impact of about 22 basis points from the HSBC transaction, which we expect to close in the quarter. To sum up with Slide 21, we feel that we finished 2021 with a great quarter and entered 2022 with strong momentum. We have a winning strategy. We are building capabilities organic -- organically and through acquisitions that deliver value to our customers and growth for our shareholders. Our strong leadership team will continue to focus on execution and building a top-performing bank. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Operator, let's open it up for some Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun.  Your first question will come from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open now.
Peter Winter: Good morning. I had a question. One thing I hear, I get from investors is the potential for deal risk noise just between the HSBC and Investors Bancorp, and then also the investors loan mix being heavy in commercial real estate. So, the question is, is there a need to remix the loan portfolio at investors and lead to some near-term revenue headwinds and just potential volatility closing both deals in the first half of the year?
Bruce Van Saun: Let me start and John, you can jump in. So, it's Bruce. Peter, I think we're working really well and hard to make sure that these deals come off very smoothly. Customers have a good experience and we can introduce our approach to banking right off the bat and take advantage of, I think, some really great synergy opportunities. So, we've set up a separate integration office. We've had outside help -- helping us through and put dedicated teams to make sure that we get off to a good start. So, I don't really see any disruption from smoothness of operations. I think that'll come off very, very well. We're monitoring the performance of both businesses, and they seem to be performing to our expectations. So that's also a good fact. We will end up taking on more commercial real estate exposure when Investors closes. However, most of that is in multifamily, and the kind of risk of that portfolio is relatively modest in terms on the spectrum of commercial real estate risks. So, I think we'll look to grow our other loan categories faster over time, which will bring kind of that exposure back into more alignment of where a targeted balance sheet would be. But we don't think there'll be any need to do any dramatic surgery or anything that would disrupt the momentum that we have in loan growth. So, I'll stop there and, John, if you want to add anything to that?
John Woods: Yes, I think that's well said. I would just add that as it relates to the operational side of things, we've got a number of mock conversions and dress rehearsals that have gone extremely well. The last one is, I think, next weekend. So, we're right on schedule for HSBC, for that closing conversion in middle of February. So that's really sort of well-handled and we're deep into the planning on Investors as well, planning for legal day one planning for customer day one planning for conversion and those plans are also well insight and appear well able to be executed. On the balance sheet aspects that Bruce mentioned, and just reemphasizing our front book originations will look different than the backlog. The backlog has the multifamily loan portfolios as Bruce indicated, but that front book is going to have a lot more C&I and a lot more consumer lending going forward than Investors has had in the past. So, with that, I'll go ahead and leave it there.
Peter Winter: Thanks. Very helpful. And then if I could just ask, John, I'm wondering, could you quantify the impact to net interest income for every 25 basis point rate hike and what you're assuming for the deposit betas?
John Woods: Yes, I'm going to talk about that. I mean, I think we are highly asset sensitive. And that's built into the guide for NII for 2022. Based on the Gen 5 curve. And as you know, since then, the curve has increased a fair bit as of -- as just looking at it were things ended up yesterday. So, there's more upside in 2022, if the rate environment continues to unfold as we're seeing it in the last several days. But as it relates to the actual sensitivity, the way that shakes out is that on the show, we're mostly sensitive to the short end and that'll drive about $20 million if there's a -- if there's an extra 25 basis points. On top of the forward curves as of January 5, we'll generate another $20 million per quarter on that -- on the short end, and we'll get another 10 to 15 per quarter on the long end versus the January 5 forward curve for an overall $30 million to $35 million per quarter of additional benefit, if you have 25 basis points …
Bruce Van Saun: It’s a parallel shift.
John Woods: … that require -- yes, on a parallel shift up from the Gen 5 curve. As it relates to deposit betas. I mean, this is a very exciting story. I mean, we've completely transformed the deposit franchise since the IPO. And I would say that, as I mentioned in my remarks, I think that our deposit betas are going to be meaningfully lower in this next cycle. And, of course, we just start off the cycle, it's all -- there's a lag. And we've got that lag built in, but we also have some betas built in. But I would say that the 2022 betas at the beginning of this cycle are going to be much lower than the betas that we experienced at the beginning of the rate rise cycle last time around, given all the investments we made and product capability in pricing, and an approach and with the added level of Citizens Access. So, we're really excited about being able to demonstrate the strength of the deposit franchise in this cycle going forward.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Just to quantify that a little bit, if you look at the last move up 2% on Fed funds and then you compare to if that happened today, we'd probably be a third less in terms of our deposit betas than we were last time around.
John Woods: Exactly.
Peter Winter: Okay. Thanks very much.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay.
Operator: Your next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead, please.
Ken Usdin: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thank you for the detail on the merger updates and the timelines. I'm just wondering, can you just give us a sense of what point do you expect to get both converted? And do you have an understanding of when you think you'll get to kind of full run rate cost saves from the combination of HSBC and ISBC?
John Woods: Yes, I'll go ahead and start. As it relates to -- we're targeting towards the end of '23 when we'll have substantially all the synergies done. And as I mentioned, we're going to close our convert HSBC here in February. The expectation is our target is to close Investors in early first quarter, early April. And I would say the way to think about conversion is that that's not going to be a big bang approach. We're going to see that conversions happen throughout on a staged and phased basis throughout 2022, assuming we close in early April, you will see a couple of platforms closed throughout 2022 and into the end of 2022. And there could be some stragglers into the early part of 2023. But again, it's not going to be a big bang. We're going to move certain platforms over as they become ready to go. And I think for - as an example, mortgage and wealth are two platforms that will go early and the overall core what happened later. So maybe I'll just -- maybe turn it over to others if they want to add any color to that.
Bruce Van Saun: I think that's right, John.
Ken Usdin: Okay, great. And my second question is just, I know you've said very clearly that you wouldn't expect to update capital targets in such until you reach your medium-term goals. I'm just wondering, so should we think -- how should we be thinking about share repurchase in terms of getting through closings and any anticipations you have about anticipating this year's CCAR process with you getting back into -- in '22?
John Woods: I will just start off. And as you may know, I mean, we've talked about the C4, our capital priorities start off with a dividend and supporting organic growth and fee-based bolt-ons. And so, we want to put capital to work in that manner. And to the extent that that those opportunities, we leave some capital around, then we engage in buybacks, which we did this quarter, or this past quarter, 4Q, as we articulated in our remarks. So, I mean, I think we're coming into CCAR season, and we tend to, on an annual basis, take another look at capital targets, and what the trajectory of capital return will be. We also have the deals that are pending. So, I think you'll get -- we can be a little bit more sort of give another update on that as you get into the first quarter call.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And, Ken, just from a technical standpoint, we had an authorization to buy back 750 million of our stock. And we've used about 300 of that to date that we have 450 left for this year, which should give us plenty of running room. When we get through CCAR, you might see us do an adjustment to that. But anyway, that's a little bit of the framework that we're operating under.
Ken Usdin: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.
Bruce Van Saun: Yep.
Operator: Your next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
John Pancari: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Good morning, Pan.
John Pancari: Just on the loan trends, clearly, the commercial trends came in very solid and better than expected. Just want to see if you can give us a little bit more granularity on where you're really seeing that strength and the drivers. I know you mentioned deal financing or you're seeing CapEx plans start to drive some drawdowns there? And then separately, just in terms of the end of period loan balances, looks like there are a few billion above the average balances. And so therefore the end of period balance is a good leading indicator into outlook as we modeled this out.
John Woods: Maybe I will just start off and Don can weigh in here. I mean, I think as we mentioned, corporate banking and subscription line finance and asset backed lending all contributed, and it has been an excellent quarter and there is momentum with spot balances higher than average. So that's right, John. I would say when you split it out, we are seeing -- last quarter we saw it tick up in utilization from our sort of bread-and-butter corporate banking clients. This quarter, we saw another tick up. In that sense, a lot of the increase was driven by deal financing, but we are seeing some underlying tick up maybe 50 basis points last quarter, another 50 or so this quarter. Maybe I'll just turn it over to Don to add any additional color.
Don McCree: I think that's right. I think the big macro is our origination volumes are just huge, record quarter on quarter on quarter. And they've been offset by payoffs as people go into the capital markets or and in particular real estate, a lot of properties are trading. So, we're being taken out of loans due to underlying property sales. But we're really encouraged by what we're seeing on the origination side. The subscription line business that we have is really going quite well. It's growing quite quickly. Some of the deal financing that happened in the fourth quarter will be refinanced out in the capital markets probably which is good for us because we will participate in that. But we think the trend continues. The other thing that we are seeing is a lot of activity in our real estate business on the origination side. We're seeing quite a bit of warehousing, quite a bit of industrial, quite a bit of life sciences and then increasingly build a suit office, believe it or not. So, investment grade corporates building new office space to occupy post pandemic. In terms of working capital and CapEx and things like that, it's really hard to kind of discern how quickly that's going to happen. You've got the new supply chain challenges, you've got some of the labor challenges, you get some of the international countries shutting down. So, it's kind of fits and starts, but we think it's -- it feels pretty good to us overall.
John Pancari: Okay, great. Thanks. And then, Bruce, just a question from higher level. I know you certainly been acquisitive here in adding to your business, both on the banking side as well as cap market. Could you just talk about from a banking perspective the need for scale, the whole debate that do you need scale to be able to compete effectively? and more specifically, do you think ultimately you need a national franchise? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Sure. So, I like our size, John. So, I think we have enough scale that we can compete against all comers. We have to be extremely disciplined. We have to prioritize well, we have to leverage the external parties, our principal core application vendors, we have a lot of partnerships with Fintechs. But we do a really good job there and we're moving the company to be a digital first bank and I like the progress there. So, one of the advantages you have if you're not super big, not in the mega bank weight classes, that you can be more nimble, and you can move faster and you can stay focused on the things that really matter. So, scale does help to some degree. So doing this New York Metro play and picking up another $30 billion of assets, I think is a positive, but we don't feel compelled to have to run out and do more deals to stay competitive. Was there a second part of your question, John?
John Pancari: Well, do you believe you need a national presence, including some brick and motor?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, right. Yes, so there I think we have a pretty unique opportunity because we have a deposit franchise, its national with Citizens Access. We do have consumer lending activities that are national. And we've basically gone to market in a -- in kind of a product siloed fashion without a fully comprehensive platform that allows us to deliver a full range of products and services to customers. So that's been really our focus, and we put it under the umbrella of national expansion. We think there's a really good opportunity to migrate to a cloud-based digital platform that delivers great customer experience, and then leverage that to target specific, very highly specific customer segments where we think we have a right to win. And when we look at what we do really well in our regional core footprint, that's mass affluent customers, particularly young professionals. We have a great offering there. It starts with our student loan refinance product, and we dropped a bunch of things in around that. So, we think we can target that segment around the country, once we pull this all together, and make some real headway. What goes with that is, right now we're largely all digital with that national play. We will pick up some branches in the Washington DC area when HSBC closes and some in South Florida. That'll give us an opportunity to go digital first into those markets combined with a light physical presence, and do some tests and learning because there may be other attractive cities around the country where we have a concentration of customers or calling base, so we have more brand visibility where we might decide to open some branches and then see how that could augment our push to really attract those customers and gain primacy with those customers. So, a lot of play out on this, but it's very exciting. I don't know, Brendan, if you want to add anything to that.
Brendan Coughlin: Well said. I guess I just -- the color as that ties into scale for me is while we don't feel like we are required to get scale, I think the digital first world is providing an opportunity to scale distinctively with revenue. In my opening remarks as part of our call script you see us going from 3 million customers to 6 million customers since our IPO, I would argue that in a pre-digital world that was not possible without M&A activity and we've got a demonstrated track record of scaling our consumer business organically. And so that's what you should think about as we bring together all our product capabilities nationally is how do we get scale and provide distinctive revenue opportunity without necessarily needing to do a big M&A acquisition. We have confidence we can do that. Obviously, we're supplementing that with HSBC and Investors. But really, we think we can get great customer growth and deepening organically. The good question is, do you need physical presence over time and what does that physical presence look like? And can you run it with a thin network to Bruce's point around piloting in Washington DC and Florida and then potentially other markets over time. But all paths lead to the next 18 months or so, we're really building on our exceptional mobile first digital platform nationally, and then we can start to think through our distribution opportunities over time.
John Pancari: Okay. Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question.
Operator: Your next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go ahead, please.
Gerard Cassidy: Good morning, John. Good morning, Bruce.
John Woods: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi, Gerard.
Gerard Cassidy: Bruce, I share your bullishness on the outlook for the industry and new folks as well. And you presented it very well today. But at the same time, we're always looking over our shoulder. So, when you guys sit around the conference room table to talk about the outlook, what are some of the risks that you have identified that maybe could kind of delay or interrupt this bullish outlook?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. To me, Gerard, it's usually around the macro would be the principal risks. So as the macro goes, it certainly has a big impact on bank results. It looks like the kind of Omicron wave is not as lethal as feared, and it has an interrupted business and commerce and people's behavior as much as it could have as much as prior waves did. So, I put that as a tick in the plus column, although you never know what could happen later on over the course of the year. I do think the Fed has a fine balancing act to achieve here and bringing inflation under control. Inflation is really something to be feared, and the Fed is going to aggressively combat that. And hopefully, they apply the medicine in a good pace with good kind of forewarning in the market adjusts to that. It doesn't kind of snuff out the signs of a good recovery, we think that GDP could grow at 4%. But what could happen if the market doesn't respond well to those rate increases, or if the equity market falls a bit because of that. So that's another thing. I think the fiscal situation seems stable at this point. It's going to be hard, I think, to pass more legislative initiatives that increase fiscal spend. And I think the spend that we have built up from prior rounds of fiscal stimulus is sufficient to carry us through. So anyway, those are some of the things that we've watched. I still feel that the fundamental underpinning is very good and the credit outlook is very good. So, I think there's a strong probability that this turns out to be a good year, but there's always that tail risks that stuff could happen. And that's the thing that we watched carefully.
Gerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you for those insights. And just to follow-up, John, on the guidance, the non-interest income, I think you highlighted that you expect the mortgage fees in 2022 to be weaker than 2021, correct me if I'm wrong there, but more than offset by the strength in capital markets. What's your outlook because the capital markets number, as you guys pointed out was extraordinary in the quarter. I assume you're not expecting that to be a run rate, but can you give us some color on what you're looking for in that capital markets mind in 2022 versus 2021 and also the mortgage banking fees?
John Woods: Yes, I'll start off and turn it over to Don and Brendan, if they want to add any further color. But I mean, I think if we had an extraordinary quarter in the fourth quarter, taking share and kind of climbing the lead tables, this was a result of multiyear kind of meticulous investments organically with some fee-based bolt-ons that are coming together. And frankly, haven't really fully achieved its potential in some respects in terms of synergies from the deals that we've done, et cetera, that are that are going to contribute in 2022. So, I'd say that that momentum in the backdrop is still strong. Bruce mentioned that the macro was one of the areas as long as that keeps going. We do see some very solid momentum in the cap market business, M&A and loan syndications, where the leads in 4Q and the pipelines look very good into early '22 in terms of what we can see there. I'll make a comment on mortgage and then maybe just see if Don and Brendan want to add. But I mean, on mortgage, I would say the way to think about that is, yes, it'll be down. But I still think that given the investments we've made and the share that we've been able to take will be above pre-pandemic levels. So, the 2019 base year, I think 2022, you can think of that as being a year where we will solidify, normalize a bit in terms of volumes and say that maybe the markets down 30%, but our volumes will be down less than that. Margins are still a bit under pressure, in particular in the third-party space in production. But that is meaningfully offset by what's going on in the servicing side of the business where you see continued increase in UPBs for us. And as the rate rise is starting to take off here a little bit, you see lower amortization. So, you put all that together and you're going to have continued contributions for mortgage that will be greater than pre-pandemic. So maybe I'll just turn it to Don if he has anything else to add ...
Don McCree: Yes. So, my perspective is assuming the market stay strong and we expect them to stay strong, so I think of that relatively low interest rates, lots of liquidity in a reasonable economy. That's a great backup for continued deals. We saw a lot of things try to run to the finish line in the fourth quarter due to potential changes in tax laws. But I have to say our pipelines are as high as they've ever been as we roll into the -- in the first quarter, and we expect those to continue to build. The other thing I just give you perspective on is, is we've got a diversification of revenue streams now in our capital markets business. And that is furthered by JMP, which moves us into the equity business as some industry -- interesting industry verticals. And then we have DH Capital, which should close sometime in the first quarter, maybe early second quarter, which will give us incremental opportunities. And that's only just beginning to be realized. And the thing that's really driving the fee lines is we're playing multiple roles on every -- a lot of transactions now. So not only are we advising, but we're also financing and we're capturing the wealth business and there's a lot of very good cross-sell and a lot of value add for our clients. So, it feels very strong. I think we’ve got an increasingly strong reputation with the private equity community, particularly in the middle market space as we show them these interesting opportunities and we execute well for them. So, it feels very good. What the exact number is going to be, it’s very hard to tell. But sitting here in the second week of January, I'm pretty optimistic about what the year is going to look like.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes, and on mortgage, I would just add that, obviously filling up at a high level, as you all know, mortgage is a natural hedge against the interest rate environment for us and while in many ways this cycle is a lot like other cycles, the differences that was exacerbated significantly. So, you’ve got a much bigger path just given how quickly they came at us in COVID and you had a steeper decline. Having said that, John’s point, we feel much better positioned than pre-COVID levels in 2019. I think you’ll see in our results in 2022 despite us projecting the NBA and projecting the market down 30%, we should outpace our performance in '19, and that’s with the backdrop of margins at historically low levels. So, I think the question for us is how much better will we be over time than our 2019 pre-COVID run rates, and a lot of that will have to do with how quickly margins re-normalizes, capacity leads the system. We are starting to see that now as rates pick up. Lenders are starting to shed capacity. We have not yet seen margin stabilize or certainly turnaround, but we expect that to happen at some point, question, because that happened in the first half of this year, second half of this year, we will see. But we feel very good that the underlying strength of the business is significantly better than 2019.
Bruce Van Saun: Let me just close and give everybody a shot here for your comment, for your question, Gerard. But if you just think about the long-term, amplifying Don's comments about where we are positioned in the commercial bank and capital markets, in particular, feel really, really good about what we've built out and the secular transfers, private equity pools of capital, they're increasing their ownership of U.S., companies and we're very well-positioned to cover those companies and provide services to them, and with the big middle market and mid corporate space that we have, we have an opportunity to connect the intermediation of capital from private equity to corporate America. And that’s a trend that I think is going to stay in place for a long time and we’re extremely well-positioned to capture that and drive revenue growth. So, we like what we put together and I think we're still scratching the surface of the potential of really gaining the synergies that come from what we’ve assembled. And then to follow-up on Brendan's point, it was always important for us to really get a profitable and highly respected and good mortgage business in place, because if we want to be in our consumer bank, a trusted advisor on somebody’s life journey, the mortgage is incredibly important product to individuals and so we’ve now accomplish that. So, feel good about what we've done in the capital market space and what we’ve done in the mortgage space. It’s been a combination of organic investments as well as inorganic acquisitions. The one place that we are still kind of short of the mark that we haven’t moved, so to speak to the other side of the river and get where we want to get to is in wealth, and it's not for lack of trying. So, we’ve made significant organic investments there. We've had one successful acquisition with Clarfeld Advisors, which has gone very, very well and we are still in the hunt to see if we can put more together there to get us where we need to get to.
Gerard Cassidy: Great. I appreciate all the insights. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Go ahead please.
Terry McEvoy: Good morning. A question for John. Could you just update us on the size of Citizens Access? And maybe how do you best use that product in a rising interest rate environment? And then the HSBC online platform, will the conversion there occur on the same pace and same timeline as via the bank itself?
John Woods: Yes. So, with respect to the first question on Citizens Access, yes, we are in that kind of $4.5 billion, $5 billion range. Most of that is -- we've had some run-off in terms of the CD book …
Bruce Van Saun: Intentional.
John Woods: Yes, intentionally, yes, I mean, so when we went out with that, that was a balanced approach in terms of savings in CD offer and that was extremely successful in the third quarter of '18, and has really served us well and we are building on that, that platform. We've launched a national storefront on the back of that platform, where we've added the ability to start bundling mortgage and education loans in that storefront when you log on to Citizens Access. And so over time that will be -- again, a big driver of how we are distinctive with our deposit offerings and being able to broaden out the product set. And then the second half of the question was on HSBC …
Bruce Van Saun: Coming across and timing.
John Woods: Yes. And so that timing is mid-February. We feel really good about that. I think the -- that’s almost $8 billion of deposits in middle of February, and so that’s going to add a lot of cash to where we are at the end of the first quarter, and that’s really, should be thought as well in the context of the Investors acquisition where we looked at those deals as one sort of entry into the New York Metro, not just strategically, but also financially because when you put those two things together, that’s around an 80% or so LDR combined profile. So those deposits are there to be thought out in the context of the overall investors in HSBC acquisition.
Bruce Van Saun: Brendan, maybe you could just try to carve out the online aspect of HSBC, because that was another thing that really was intriguing when we had the opportunity to buy that business.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes, absolutely. It does help us further accelerate our national scale with our online deposit platform. And to the question, the timing on the online integration will be the same exact timing is core branch network acquisition in mid that all happen again. There's a few small differences with the HSBC online platform from our Citizens Access. One is that the interest rates are actually a lot lower, they're at 15 basis points versus our Citizens Access is at 40 basis points. And one of the reasons why they are a little bit lower is that a handful of those customers had some minor connectivity to their physical channels and so we are maintaining that and making sure the customers have access to our new distribution footprint where they happen to be in our franchise. So, you can start to see the physical and digital worlds coming together in this strategy, but we view this as a significant accelerant to our national expansion plans and provides a great pool of customers for us to ultimately deepen with as we -- to John’s point, we've expanded the storefront with mortgage and student loan refinancing as I mentioned in my opening remarks. We are going to add more products over the course of 2022. So, this is fertile ground for revenue growth that we did not put into our deal model.
Terry McEvoy: Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. Can you just remind us the impact on service charges and fees in 2022 expected from the rollout of the Peace of Mind product, the Citizens Peace of Mind?
Brendan Coughlin: Yes, I can take that. So, the way to really think about this is opportunity cost of not re-inflating and so the Piece of Mind program that really is 24-hour grace is a third or fourth move we've made in addition to a handful of other moves, including student account that is completely protected from overdraft. We've got $5 overdraft past. We've got a once-a-year automatic forgiveness for customers in certain products, and now we've introduced Peace of Mind, which is essentially a 24-hour grace period and a great customer experience for all of our customers to empower them to avoid unnecessary fees. And we think the payback on this is quite strong, will be about year three where we breakeven and turn the corner for the revenue benefits to offset the fee shortfall that we’re giving up. But really we expect the overdraft line to be flattish going forward it. It would have cost -- we would have been able to get on top of, call it $8 million to $10 million a quarter at a normalized market where stimulus benefits burn down. But we think it’s the right thing to do the …
Bruce Van Saun: Amount of $40 million opportunity.
Brendan Coughlin: It’s about $40 million opportunity cost annually. But that more than offsets over time with revenue benefits. And to John’s comment, we've already seen a significant early indicators of positivity coming from our customer base. Call center and complaint volumes were down about 40% in this category and our NPS score, particularly with under 40 age customers has really started to increase right away and we just rolled this out in October. So, we’re very, very pleased about it, about the early behavioral impacts from our customer base.
Terry McEvoy: Thanks. Thanks, everyone.
Brendan Coughlin: Sure.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. It looks like that’s the end of the queue here for Q&A. I know it’s a busy day with other banks reporting. But once again, I want to thank everybody for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and your support. Have a great day and everybody stay well. Thank you.
Operator: And that will conclude your teleconference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event Teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alan, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.
Kristin Silberberg: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of third quarter results, referencing our presentation, which you can find on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we'll be happy to take questions. Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking; and Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking, are also here to provide additional color. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements which is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliation in the appendix. And with that, I will hand over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We had a successful and busy third quarter, featuring continued strong execution of our strategic initiatives, good financial performance with positive operating leverage and 7% sequential PPNR growth and the announcement of three acquisitions. By playing offense, and we feel that we are taking the steps to position us for solid growth in franchise value, in earnings and in returns. Our financial performance in Q3 reflects strong revenue growth of 3% sequentially as both net interest income and fees grew nicely. NII benefited from a pickup in soft loan growth with retail up 3% and commercial up 1%, excluding PPP impact from loan forgiveness. The gradual improvement in loan volumes we have expected is materializing though held back a modest amount in Q3 by impacts from the Delta variant on the recovery as well as by supply chain issues and labor shortages. These impacts should continue to abate going forward, and we expect even faster loan growth in Q4. Interestingly, the amount of PPP forgiveness is roughly equivalent in the first and second halves of 2021, though Q3 saw a meaningful pull forward, which benefits Q3 at the expense of Q4. Nonetheless, the faster loan growth we expect in Q4 should largely offset the lower PPP impact on Q4 net interest income. Strong sequential fee growth once again demonstrated the diversity of our business model. Mortgage had a bounce-back quarter, which helped offset some seasonality in capital market fees, while Wealth hit a new record and consumer fees continued their recovery towards pre-pandemic levels. We expect this diversification to play out again in Q4 with Capital Markets poised for a strong quarter, given exceptional pipelines and Mortgage set for a seasonally softer quarter. We kept expenses under control given our efficiency initiatives, which led to positive sequential operating leverage of around 2.5%. And credit continues to be in great shape, with NCOs of 14 basis points in the quarter, well below our guidance range for the quarter of 20 to 25 basis points. These strong results across expenses and credit should continue into Q4. The strategic initiatives we're focused on across consumer and commercial continue to go well, and there's more on that in the presentation. We feel we are focused on prioritizing the areas where we can differentiate ourselves and where we have a right to win. The acquisitions we've announced year-to-date are all attractive from a strategic and financial standpoint, and present only modest execution risk. The investors in HSBC transactions give us a top 10 deposit market share in New York City Metro and over 1 million new customers who collectively we feel we can do more for. We also gained a big augmentation to our digital bank customer base from HSBC's online bank, and we gained a thin branch network in Washington, D.C. and Miami. Our integration efforts so far are progressing nicely. Our JMP acquisition is also strategically compelling. Upon closing the deal in mid-Q4, we'll have a much broader and deeper corporate finance coverage in technology, healthcare and financial services, plus we gain an equities business that is very well run, focused and highly regarded. As nonbank lenders continue to take lending market share from banks and private equity ownership of companies continues to increase, it's important that we broaden our capabilities to be able to compete successfully in this new landscape. We will increasingly generate more fee revenue across our customer base, given these expanded capabilities. Also worth noting is that the Willamette transaction dramatically expands our valuation services business with a prestigious outfit. This capability is highly synergistic with our M&A and broader capital markets effort. So to sum up, we're taking serious strides forward as an organization in 2021 and we feel very good about our positioning and our future outlook. With that, I'll turn it over to John.
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with the headlines for the quarter. We reported underlying net income of $546 million and EPS of $1.22. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 14.2%, which includes the impact of a modest credit provision benefit. Revenue of $1.7 billion was up 3% linked quarter, given growth in both fee income and net interest income. Period-end loans were up 1% in the quarter with strong originations in retail and commercial. Loans were up 2%, excluding PPP forgiveness, giving us good momentum heading into the fourth quarter. Key highlights include strong results in Capital Markets, notwithstanding seasonality, another strong quarter for Wealth and a rebound in Mortgage fees, and we delivered positive sequential operating leverage of over 2% this quarter with well-controlled expenses. We recorded a credit provision benefit of $33 million, which reflects strong credit performance with lower charge-offs. Our ACL ratio is now at 1.65% excluding PPP loans. We are in a very strong capital position with CET1 at 10.3% after returning $167 million to shareholders and dividends during the quarter. And finally, we continue to grow our tangible book value per share which was $34.44 at quarter end, up 7% compared with a year ago. Next, I'll provide some key takeaways for the third quarter while referring to the presentation slides. Net interest income on Slide 6 was up 2% linked quarter given interest-earning asset growth, stable net interest margin and higher day count. The net interest margin was 2.72%, flat sequentially as the benefit of accelerated PPP forgiveness and improved funding costs were offset by the impact of higher cash balances as well as lower earning asset yields given low rates. One highlight is our continued progress on lowering interest-bearing deposit costs, which were down 2 basis points to 14 basis points. Our asset sensitivity decreased to about 9.8% from 10.7% at the end of the second quarter. The decrease primarily reflects loan and deposit exchanges and the addition of $2.5 billion in received fixed spots in the quarter. We saw good entry points for the swaps given some steepening in the yield curve. So far in the fourth quarter, we have added another $1.25 billion. The hedging actions we've executed to-date in 2021 are one of the levers we are pulling to address headwinds from swap runoff and other impacts of the low rate environment. We expect to continue adding to receive fixed swap portfolio and further moderate our asset sensitivity as the curve steepens while maintaining meaningful upside benefit to higher short-term rates. Referring to Slide 7. We delivered solid fee results this quarter, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our fee income with strong results in Capital Markets and Wealth. Mortgage fees rebounded in the quarter, up $23 million as production fees benefited from lower agency fees, and we saw improvement in MSR hedge results. Diving further into this performance, production revenue was up $12 million linked quarter, benefiting from a modest improvement in gain on sale margins across channels, given improved agency pricing and favorable execution. This was partially offset by a decline in adjusted lock volume, down sequentially about 10%, which is broadly in line with industry level trends. As expected, we continue to see a shift towards purchase originations, which increased from about 48% of the total in second quarter to about 54% in the third quarter. The contribution from servicing operations decreased $4 million linked quarter, reflecting higher MSR amortization. Our third-party servicing book grew to $87 billion, up 3% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year. Lastly, our MSR hedging results improved $15 million linked quarter given an unusually large negative result in Q2. Capital Markets were down a bit from record levels, reflecting seasonality, particularly in syndication fees. However, M&A advisory fees were higher and our pipeline heading into the fourth quarter is exceptionally strong. Wealth fees were up slightly, continuing to build on record levels, reflecting an increase in assets under management from net inflows. Moving on to other positive fee contributors. We saw improvements in service charges and fees and card fees, which benefited from the strengthening economy as debit transactions and credit card spend, continue to exceed pre-pandemic levels. On Slide 8, expenses were well controlled, up 1% linked quarter as good expense discipline and the benefit of efficiency initiatives largely offset higher operational and travel costs. Period-end loans on Slide 9 were up 1% linked quarter or 2% excluding PPP. Retail loans are growing, up 3% and commercial loans were up 1%, excluding PPP in a tough operating environment. Average loans were down 1%, but still up 1%, excluding PPP. Diving into drivers a bit more. The diversity of our retail lending business produced another quarter of record origination though we continue to see high payouts. Strength was noteworthy in mortgage, auto and education. Commercial has seen strong underlying activity with spot loans up 1% in the quarter, excluding PPP. We had a very robust origination quarter led by commercial real estate, asset-backed lending and subscription line financing supporting deal-related activity. This was largely offset by continued elevated payoff activity, which in part reflects favorable conditions for commercial companies to access the debt capital markets. Line utilization levels were up around 50 basis points still near historic lows. We foresee a gradual recovery in coming quarters as some of the issues holding back investments such as supply chain challenges and labor shortages resolve themselves. In addition, our period-end commitments are up around 2%, which will benefit us down the road once investment picks up. Overall soft loan growth of 2% for the quarter ex-PPP provides good underlying momentum for loan growth in the fourth quarter. On Slide 10, deposit flows continue to be robust, especially in low-cost categories, and our liquidity ratios remain strong. Average deposits were up 1% linked quarter and 7% year-over-year with strong demand in demand deposits, which now make up 32% of total deposits. Interest-bearing deposits were broadly stable as the decline in term deposits was offset by growth in demand deposits and low-cost categories. We continue to make good progress on deposit re-pricing, with total deposit costs down 2 basis points to 9 basis points. Interest-bearing deposit costs were down 2 basis points to 14 basis points during the quarter with opportunity to reduce further. Moving on to credit on Slide 11 and 12, we saw excellent credit results this quarter. Net charge-offs dropped from 25 basis points to 14 basis points for the third quarter, driven by improvements across the portfolio. Nonaccrual loans decreased 4% linked quarter. Given the improving outlook and strong performance of the portfolio, our reserves decreased, ending the quarter at 1.65% ex-PPP, compared with 1.75% at the end of the second quarter. Moving to Slide 13, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remained stable at 10.3% at the end of the third quarter after returning $167 million in capital to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This is at the top of our listed capital priorities on the slide. We paused our stock repurchase program pending the investor shareholder vote scheduled for November 19. After the vote, we have the opportunity to resume repurchases with $655 million of capacity remaining under our current Board authorization. The estimated CET1 impacts of our pending acquisitions are on the slide, along with the targeted closing cap. Before I move on to our 4Q outlook, let me highlight some exciting things that are happening across the Company on Slide 14. Our TOP 6 program is in its final stages. Everything is on track, and we will achieve our targeted results. We are preparing for the launch of a TOP 7 program with more details to follow later this year. These TOP programs have been critical in the funding of our strategic initiatives and in driving positive operating leverage, which are key to achieving our medium-term financial targets. On the ESG front, I'm very excited to say that we've launched a new green deposits program to allow corporate clients to direct their cash reserves towards companies and projects that are expected to generate a positive and material impact by improving energy efficiency, promoting sustainability and reducing greenhouse gases. An area of high focus for us has been moving more rapidly to digital channels, which we accelerated given the behavioral changes we've seen coming out of the pandemic. You can see some of the year-over-year sales on Slide 15. Digital book sales, for example, are up 24%. Mobile active users are up 20%, and the number of Zelle transactions are up 34%. We continue to enhance our digital capabilities. And by the end of this year, consumers will be able to perform about 3/4 of all transactions directly through the mobile app. And by the end of 2022, this will include nearly all transactions. This provides us with strong leverage to continue repositioning our branches towards an advice-based model. Moving to Slide 16. As part of our ongoing efforts to help customers better navigate their financial lives, we recently announced several initiatives designed to make banking more transparent and accessible, including a new way to avoid overdraft fees and a commitment to helping ensure that underserved communities have access to banking services. We introduced Citizens Peace of Mind, a new deposit feature providing customers with the ability to avoid the unnecessary overdraft fees. This feature will come with new capabilities to monitor and alert customers to overdraft withdrawals and a rate period to fund their account. The financial impact of our overdraft policy seems will be to forgo the return to historical over-drafting levels. You can expect 2022 service charges and fees to stabilize around 2021 year-to-date annualized levels. The benefits of these trend changes are shown on the right side of Slide 16. We expect higher satisfaction, lower attrition and lower operational costs to offset the foregone overdraft revenues over time. Lastly, we also announced a new commitment to serving under bank communities, including the introduction of a new checking account with no overdraft fees and features that will meet the bank on national account standards. These are designed to ensure that everyone has access to a transparent, easy-to-use, and affordable transactional account. And now for some high-level commentary on the outlook on Slide 17. We expect NII to be broadly stable to down slightly, giving a lower benefit from PPP forgiveness due to the pull forward into the third quarter. NII is expected to be up around 2% in the fourth quarter ex-PPP impacts. Most importantly, we are well positioned to see overall loan growth accelerate in the fourth quarter with average loans up 1.5% to 2% or 2.5% to 3% ex-PPP and soft loan growth up around 3% or around 4% ex-PPP. We expect continued strength in retail across mortgage, education and auto. And in commercial, we expect to see growth led by subscription line financing, supporting deal-related activity and asset-backed lending. This loan growth positions us well for 2022 and helps offset the impact from PPP runoff. Fee income is expected to be broadly stable as a seasonal decline in mortgage as well as some expected pressure on margins given excess industry capacity is expected to be offset by some real strength in Capital Markets given exceptional pipelines. Noninterest expense is expected to be broadly stable in the fourth quarter, benefiting from our efficiency initiatives. And we expect net charge-offs will be broadly stable with the provision expense lower than net charge-offs. I should add that this guidance excludes the impact of the JMP acquisition, which we are targeting to close in the middle of the fourth quarter. To wrap up on Slide 18, this is a strong quarter for Citizens with good momentum heading into the end of the year. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: All right. Thank you, John. Alan, let's open it up to Q&A, please.
Operator:  We'll go to our first question that will be from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Scott Siefers: Let's see. John, maybe I was hoping you could provide a little more color on what's going on with the swap book that you've been adding to. I was hoping specifically you could sort of talk about the balance between adding new swaps and maintaining your asset sensitivity, in particular. I guess what is your preferred sensitivity to higher rates? In other words, is there something that specifically that we're targeting? Or how should we be thinking about that?
John Woods: Yes. Just kind of big picture here. I mean I think that we've, as I've mentioned, seen some good opportunities to start in this new sort of steepening cycle to start layering in swaps broadly. As I may have mentioned, our asset sensitivity is down to about 9.8% or so at the end of the third quarter. As we migrate across the entire tightening cycle that may come, we expect to try to migrate down to something that will be low single digits. And in order to get there, that would require not only the hedging that we've done to date, which would be about $12 billion in the third -- sorry, in 2021 through October, but would require in all likelihood, another $20 billion or so to get us to a low single-digit asset sensitivity when we get near the top of the tightening cycle. The other thing I'll also offer up is that the acquisitions of ISBC and HSBC will also add as sensitivity and that will require another $1.5 billion to $2 billion to offset. So big picture, our philosophy is to maintain good upside to short-term rates, which we have and the majority of our exposure is to short-term rates. And as we continue to see attractive opportunities, to monetize that asset sensitivity as the yield curve steepens, we'll continue to dollar cost average into that over time.
Scott Siefers: Okay. Perfect. I appreciate that. And then switching gears just a little, I was hoping you could talk about any differences in deposit growth trends that you're seeing between your retail and your commercial customers?
John Woods: Yes. I mean I think we're seeing good uptake and maybe we'll go ahead and let Don and Brendan highlight. But in the third quarter, we had growth both in average and spot of 1%. And I think that was driven primarily by commercial in the quarter, but we're seeing strong deposit flows on both sides. We're still seeing positive growth on both consumer and commercial, and maybe I'll just offer it up to Don and Brendan to see if they want to add anything.
Don McCree: I think that's right on the commercial side, we're still seeing a lot of deposit flow, notwithstanding the fact that we're trying to push pricing down. So we still have a little bit of surge deposits, but probably $1 billion or $2 billion, we see running off as we go into next year. So we think deposits continue to be strong well into '22.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes, similar trends on the consumer side. The noninterest-bearing deposits have been very sticky despite consumer activity and spending picking up the deposits have been hanging around. And so they're still a bit elevated with the surge deposits, the second and third round stimulus generally were not spent. They were more saved or used to pay down debt, and we're seeing that with the balances hanging around the customers' pockets. On the interest-bearing side, we're seeing a rundown of CDs and it's generally replaced with low-cost deposits with basic savings and some low interest-bearing products like CDs. So that's allowing the cost of funds to continue to gear down, consumer cost of funds all in sub 6 basis points now. So we're kind of at basement levels and still seeing the deposits very, very sticky.
John Woods: And one thing to hasten to add with the search deposits that we suspect most of that stays around and deposits stay relatively stable over time, given organic growth offsets any potential marginal runoff of some of the COVID-related deposits. So, that's a good sign.
Bruce Van Saun: The one last point to add, it's Bruce, would be the demand deposits now are about 32% of total deposits. So, that's been an effort where we've really focused on trying to raise that as a percentage of our total funding base. And we've had some good success on the consumer side in mass affluent and growing the commercial side. And so, we feel really good about where that sits.
Operator: We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please.
Matt O'Connor: I was wondering if you could talk a bit about loan pricing trends. And I guess, especially in commercial, where one of your peers yesterday talked about kind of continued pressure there as new loans have come on versus kind of what's rolling off on re-pricing?
Don McCree: Yes. Why don't I take that, Matt, it's Don. We're -- it's holding up pretty well. It depends on the type of transaction, but we're seeing a little bit of deterioration, but not material. So you see it in our NIM, our NIM is holding up nicely. We're trying to stay disciplined. So where we see things -- we haven't changed our approach one bit. So we look at overall return on relationships of which loan spread is a piece of it. So we'll compromise a little bit on loan spread if we see other fee business attached to that loan. But if we don't see the fee business, we're not going to chase yield just to book a loan.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes, similar discipline in consumer. I'd say there's some asset classes still are mildly elevated on what we would tend to see in this rate cycle like auto or the spreads are a little bit expanded. We've got front book, back book challenges given the state of the yield curve that our back book, the runoff is at a higher yield than what we're putting on. But front book returns are still very, very strong. I'd say there's one or two spots where we're seeing some intensity and competition on returns, particularly where there's fintechs involved, whether it's in point of sale or student lending in particular. But we're keeping our discipline and making sure we're priced to adequate returns to support driving up our ROTCE. And we feel good about able to get growth and make that balance, as you can see in our numbers.
Matt O'Connor: And I guess, taken together, like as you think about growing loans, it sounds like you're confident that the volume is enough to offset any margin or pricing pressure going forward?
Brendan Coughlin: Yes. On the consumer side, I do, I see us continuing to be able to sort of moderately accelerate our pace of loan growth. And keep in mind that our growth levels now when you think about the last question around elevated deposits in an environment where customers are also flushed with cash. So as that starts to draw down, we expect loan growth to pick up even more as consumers need more leverage where right now, they're sitting on a lot of cash. So we feel really good about the medium term for loan growth prospects.
Don McCree: And then why don't I add to that on the commercial side, as John mentioned, the highlight numbers are strong, but we're seeing our pipelines on the loan side, not only on the capital markets but on the loan side, up 10%, 15% quarter-on-quarter and then another 10%, 15% as we go into the into the fourth quarter. We've got -- we're adding new clients that had a very good pace as we benefit from our expansion markets in particular, and we're growing our commitment book faster than our loan book. So, as utilization begins to pick up, it will be picking up off a larger commitment book. So that all feels reasonably good as we sit here today.
Operator: We'll move next to the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go ahead please.
Gerard Cassidy: John, can we come back to the swap portfolio. Can you share with us what interest rate environment you will benefit the most from with the book that you've put on, meaning, rising short-term rates by 100 basis points or long-term rates going up by 50 basis points. Can you kind of work through that? And then second, as part of that question, if you didn't put the swap book on, what would have the asset sensitivity been of your balance sheet today?
John Woods: Yes. I mean I'll just hit that with a high level. We're more exposed to the short end the curve than the long end. So pretty -- the asset, it's about 60-40 short to long and rising, frankly as we migrate through the cycle. So, the environment that will work well for us is when the Fed lift-off begins. That's an environment that will really drive net interest margins and NII upward given the un-hedged portion of our C&I book and other floating rate exposures that we have. So that still remains our most favorable sort of environment that would work well for us. And did you just give you a sense for how the math plays out on that, a 25 basis point rise on the short end drives about $80 million or so of NII for us. So that helps you kind of quantify what were -- where the benefit comes from. In terms of asset sensitivity, we would be in the low to mid-teens without continuing to hedge. And it's not really where our risk appetite is. There's rates can go up, and we hope they do continue to go up, but they can go down as well. And so there's a risk profile there that, over time, we're not only attempting to kind of preserve our asset sensitivity, but we're also cognizant of that there is downside exposure that we're taking off the table when we dollar cost average and with the swap out.
Gerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up, John, you gave us some good data on Slide 15 on your digital metrics. I was curious, when you look at your mobile active users, what percentage of the households are mobile active users? And then second, when you look at your digital book sales, great growth year-over-year, what percentage of your sales are now coming through that digital channel?
Brendan Coughlin: Yes. Great question. It's Brendan. We look at a lot of different metrics on digital. I'd say, when we have the customers' primary relationship, the digital active users are incredibly high. It's over 80% of our customer base is digitally engaged. So, we feel good about that foundation. Our efforts now are moving from just general active to full-service transactional banking done in a much more everyday way on mobile. So we've got a lot of efforts underway across the Company, which are driving these metrics up, including in the branches and the call center efforts communicate and nudge our customers to get more engaged with digital. It's hugely retentive for us with our customers, but also, as you know, if we can get them really engaged, we can pivot the branches more to advice and there's a cost dynamic here at play that we can then go back and reinvest in the top of the funnel for customer acquisition growth. So, we feel really good about the trends in mobile and I see a lot of upside here looking forward.
Bruce Van Saun: Percentage of digital sales.
Brendan Coughlin: Sorry, percentage of digital sales. Yes, it's rapidly growing, and it's a very different category by category. Some of our lending businesses are principally digital first, and you'll see in things like student a 75% to 80% rate of digital, whereas something like DDA and deposits, it's more in the 25% to 30% range, but growing two years ago, it was in the 15% range. So, we're seeing active upticks. The branch channel for basic deposit products is still the largest source of customer acquisition, but there's some value coming into play.
Operator: For our next question, we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead please.
Ken Usdin: John, on the other side of the rate sensitivity, you had previously talked about wanting to keep the securities book around mid-teens of earning assets, and I see that you've added some securities at period end versus average. Given what we're seeing in the environment, what's your appetite for continuing to move some of that excess cash into the book? And any changed thoughts vis-à-vis what you've already talked about on swaps in terms of what you want to do and where you want the securities book to go?
John Woods: Yes. Yes, I appreciate the question. I think that you may see the securities book rise, but as it relates to a percentage of total interest-earning assets, we're still in that mode of around mid-teens or thereabouts. It could tick up a little bit, but there's not really any plans for a large change in the percentage of securities to interest-earning assets. And I think the reason for that is twofold. One is that given our loan growth opportunities, really, that's our preference is that we would prefer to deploy our excess liquidity into our loan opportunities, which from a -- when you look at our consumer lending, which is the diversity of that and seeing commercial starting to really lift off a bit, that's where we want to put that cash. And so that's what the plan would be in the near term for that to head in that direction. I think the other aspect of it is that we just have a view that the rate risk hedging, with the securities books can also double duty on. We think it's a bit more efficient to do that off balance sheet with swaps. And so that's still the plan is to dollar cost average over time in that space.
Ken Usdin: Got it. And John, on NII, in the slide deck, you talked about PPP being a 7 basis point increase sequentially. Can you just level set us on how much PPP was in the NII? And just what you expect to trail that out as the program runs down?
John Woods: Yes. I mean, big picture you've got -- I mean, I think the way I would talk about that is that all throughout the year, we've had a sense that PPP was going to be about the same first half and second half, and that's playing out. But there has been a $15 million increase in the third quarter versus the second quarter in PPP contribution to NII. That $15 million really is coming from the fourth quarter. So really, that's really the -- how it's all going to play out is that $15 million increase in PPP from 2Q to 3Q and then because of the pull forward from 4Q, a $30 million decrease from 3Q to 4Q on PPP. But I would hasten to add that ex-PPP in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we're seeing NII growth ex-PPP, and that's really good to see. And I think we mentioned that we're up about 2% in terms of 4Q NII ex-PPP. So a lot of that PPP downdraft is getting offset given the fact that our guide is really stable to down only slightly.
Bruce Van Saun: I would just add -- Ken, I would just add that this has been an issue of great interest for analysts and investors like what's been the impact of PPP. We always view it as something that was transitory that eventually these were nice earning asset for us for 2021, but they would very quickly start to reduce, and then they would fall off and not have much of an impact on '22. So the real was can we develop enough loan growth to basically substitute core consumer loans, in particular, for the PPP loans that are running off. And we think with the soft loan growth we had in Q3 and what we're expecting in Q4, mission accomplished that we'll be in good position to offset any future impacts as it relates to the first half and all of '22.
Ken Usdin: Absolutely. And just one quick one in. How much, John and Bruce is still running off from the other retail, because that -- I know you have the Citizens Pay presumably growing in there, but what's weighing against that?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. What's weighing against that is the personal unsecured portfolio that we've ran up about two years ago and then decided it's best when the COVID era hit to run that back down and stop new originations. So that's been a little bit of a deadweight in the unsecured area which masks a little bit the nice growth we've had in Citizens Pay and some of the rebounding that we're seeing in card. Brendan, you may have the exact numbers. So what's left of that at this point.
Brendan Coughlin: Yes. It's about a little shy of $900 million left on the personal loan book, and it's about $150 million-ish of a drag quarter-on-quarter to loan growth is one of the other book fits and rundown mode for us is marine RV as well that's all over years Longer duration that have been built in our run rate. The biggest drag is really the personal book. So $900 million or so.
Operator: We will go next to John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Go ahead please.
John Pancari: Also on the loan front, I know on the line utilization, you indicated the 50 bps increase in the gradual recovery expected. Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit more on the areas of expected strength as you see that rebound in line utilization taking hold? I know you mentioned the subscription finance, M&A and ABL, is that the areas where you continue to expect that momentum to build? Or do you expect that to broaden, and if you could comment on what areas?
John Woods: Yes. I'll make a few comments, and Don will elaborate on that. I mean I think the areas that we're seeing looking forward into commercial is, we've seen strength in asset-backed securitizations that will -- we see that continuing. Subscription line finance, as I mentioned in my remarks, in part due to M&A activity is an area of continued growth. CRE is a place where we're seeing some good uptake maybe in the office space with and in the industrial space as well. So that's starting to contribute now as well. And then to your point about C&I utilization, I mean, I think two points related to it, so we're seeing commitments rising. And even if utilization doesn't really lift off, that still provides some loan growth even if utilization levels are up just a very tiny bit if overall commitments are up, and the next still creates a positive contribution. And there's a handful of sectors that are driving that. You've got construction, energy, manufacturing or a couple of the areas. And it is somewhat broad-based. It's a small increase, but somewhat broad-based number of sectors where we're seeing small increases in utilization and maybe just turn it over to Don for any...
Don McCree: I think you kind of covered. I think the good news, John, is that we are seeing in our core middle market and C&I book, the beginnings of a little bit of daylight in terms of utilization. As John said in the opening remarks, clearly, the supply chain and the labor issue is restraining the performance of some companies. So, they're going to -- they would be performing better than they even are now if didn't have some of their supply chain problems. But we -- in the last couple of months, we're beginning to see some core C&I utilization. The financial capital markets oriented, which is where subscription lines and ABS and the stuff sits up have been really strong all year, and we expect them to continue to be strong as we get into the fourth quarter into next year. So kind of a combination of would see...
Bruce Van Saun: Probably also -- you hit on the point, the middle market is where you're seeing that take-up on line utilization for bigger companies...
John Woods: Companies that don't have access to capital markets. So the challenge that we've had on loan growth is predominantly pay downs because people are going to the capital market given the strength of the capital markets. So the middle market cash are beginning to see some light at the end of the table. And part of it is just CEO confidence, frankly. They really, really, really squeezed down on their companies. And as they begin to see COVID really begin to wane, they're beginning to grow their companies a little bit quicker at the margin.
John Pancari: Yes. Good. Got it. Okay. And then separately, on the capital markets business, I know you mentioned a few times, a very, very solid deal pipeline there. Can you maybe talk to us about how you're thinking about that that line when you look at 2022 as you're budgeting? And then also, can you remind us how much we should assume that falls to the bottom line in that business, particularly as the top line momentum really builds?
Don McCree: I think we continue to get more and more optimistic about '22. I was sitting here maybe midyear saying, wow, '21 is really a banner year. There's a lot of this that may be keying off potential tax changes, both on the M&A side and on the capital markets side. But our pipelines continue to build, and we think it's going to be very strong as we go into next year. I think my general view is you've got an environment where you're going to have a relatively strong economy, you're going to have relatively low interest rates, and you're going to have very high liquidity, and that's a very, very strong backdrop for '22. One of the things that we've got our eye on, we just don't know yet is how much is going to get pulled into '21. So we're going to have to be rebuilding pipelines maybe in the first quarter to get going. So you may see a fourth quarter, first quarter kind of upswing, but we'll have to wait until the balance of the year to see that. And I don't really -- I'd say -- I don't know what the marginal contribution is. It's actually lower than the lending business because the comp payouts are higher, but I don't have that number at the tip of my fingers. And remember, we pay a lot of different people. We pay bankers. We pay corporate finance people. We pay M&A people. We pay capital markets people, so it all blends together. And the way I look at it is our overall efficiency ratio is actually pretty good, and we're...
Bruce Van Saun: 40%.
Don McCree: Yes. So with a 40% efficiency ratio, it washes out to the bottom line.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And I would just add, too, that we see these secular trends. We see private equity pools of capital growing and looking to put money to work an opportunity to gain some very attractive leverage levels and financing costs are low. So those trends will continue. And one of the reasons why we're hell-bent on assembling broader capabilities, including what we've done with some of the M&A boutique acquisitions in JMP, we want to be an intermediary in those flows of putting money to work. And if our middle market companies want to sell themselves, we can take them to market and get a good price. So, we've got the customer base. We increasingly have the product capabilities. And so that's reason for optimism in on of itself. I think we'll continue to gain a lot of synergies as we look out into '22.
Don McCree: Yes. And the only thing I'd add to that, Bruce, is with JMP coming on board, it's the last piece of the puzzle, really. So not only do we have full service capabilities to help our clients do whatever they need to do. We've got a nice diversity in terms of product sets. So, it will let us kind of benefit and benefit when markets are good and the equities or the debt markets and vice versa.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes.
Operator:  We'll go next to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim, we seem to have lost your line, if you took yourself out of your queue. There we go, one moment. Your line is open. Go ahead please.
Ebrahim Poonawala: Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, I think as we look through the deal closings, one, I guess, we're still on track for 1Q closing for HSBC assets, any risk of a delay there? And remind us, as you close those transactions. Are there any aspects of those balance sheets where we could see any runoff that may impact results as we look pro forma for the deal?
John Woods: I'll go ahead and start. Ebrahim, it's John. So, the expectation the expectation for HSBC is to close mid first quarter, and that's very much on track. We're deep into the sort of preparations for that. It's both a close and a conversion on a...
Bruce Van Saun: And you have the regulatory approval
John Woods: And we have the -- exactly. We have regulatory approvals in hand on that transaction. So that one is looking just exactly as we expected. And I think the other larger transaction, which was -- when you look at the overall one big strategic allocation of capital, but ISBC is a separate legal entity that we've got the shareholder vote scheduled for November 19, and the regulatory approvals are pending on that. The expectation and target for that is that we receive those approvals in sometime in early '22, and we have an opportunity to close that in 2Q. But nevertheless, that's pending, and we'll keep monitoring it. As it relates to runoff, we're not expecting to have runoff. But I think the way we've described it is that we would continue those businesses, but the front book sort of activities would have a different profile than the back book, in particular, with investors because of all the capabilities that we're bringing to the table. And so, we're not expecting to have us have any meaningful runoff, but we are expecting the loan book to have a different profile, a year or two down the line, given more C&I and more consumer lending that we'll be able to generate off that platform as you look ahead.
Bruce Van Saun: I would just add a couple of points there, John. First off, on HSBC, the price is tied to what comes over. So if there is any runoff, we would have a shock absorber there in terms of what the ultimate premium is that we pay. And secondly, just when it comes to JMP, we're working very diligently to try to get that closed mid-fourth quarter here. So we should have four to six weeks, say, in the results here in Q4, which would be accretive, of course.
Ebrahim Poonawala: That's helpful. And just one separate question. You all spend a lot of time on the payments with Citizen Pay, what you're doing in buy now pay later. When you think about Zelle and you put a stat about 34% growth in Zelle, is there more that you think? And I understand you don't call the shots in Zelle, do you think Zelle should be doing more in terms of enabling banks such as yourself to compete with some of the tech players in the business in terms of in-store payments, et cetera?
Brendan Coughlin: Yes, it's Brendan. Look, I think Zelle, the rails that have been built for Zelle are adequate. And I think the industry including Citizens needs to kind of take control of the UI layer that sits above the rails and innovate on our own around the customer experience, whether it's pure payments, that's facilitated with Zelle or whether it's purchasing something direct with the merchant, which would be more a Citizens Pay platform. So, we're making big investments in both of those environments so you can see a world where those capabilities converge a little bit. And it's a similar experience, whether you're buying something from a merchant or whether you're sending money to a friend, I think that's possible. But I think the rails are adequate. I don't necessarily think Zelle in particular, needs do anything dramatic to innovate. I think it's more around what we can do in the UI layer to make things easier for customers to increase engagement as you can see our numbers, that's happening. And we continue to want to scale that up further and get more customers deeper engaged.
Bruce Van Saun: It's just focusing on the use cases and where we can differentiate ourselves. And so we've got essential effort enterprise payments capability that's really coordinating between commercial and consumer to drive our decision-making there and make sure that we're investing in things that will really drive future growth.
Operator: And for our next question, we will go to the line of Vivek Juneja. Go ahead please.
Vivek Juneja: Just a clarification. The PPP since you've not given numbers and maybe that might make it easier and -- but if I look at the 7 basis points, that seems to equate to about $30 million in terms of the change from 2Q to 3Q. I heard you mentioned 15. So I'm trying to understand what am I missing there when we do that? I mean as I said, is it easier to just give the numbers what it was 2Q and 3Q?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, we did give the numbers that it is a 15 delta. And the reason that it shows a 7 basis points on that is there's a numerator effect and the denominator effect, Vivek. So you have loans running off, which affects the denominator. So it really doubles the impact. You probably have about 3 basis points from the NII pickup and then you get three to four for having the loan balances run down and be forgiven.
Vivek Juneja: Got it. That's helpful, Bruce. In the roll-on roll-off on the securities yields, are you -- how is that going? Can you give us some color where that stands and how much further?
John Woods: Yes, sure. I mean, so we've had several quarters. It's gone back for a while now with securities yields falling. And I think the dynamic there has been not only the pure front book, back book, which has been negative by about 40 basis points or so. But also you've got a premium amortization, which has been a drag. And I think our outlook, however, for is that to stabilize and frankly, start to turn around in the fourth quarter. I think in large degree, we will see the front -- the pure front book, back book start to narrow, call it, it'll fall to something in the neighborhood of 30 basis points. But at the same time, we're also seeing as rates rise, premium amortization will also slow and that will provide some the -- a net positive to securities yields in 4Q.
Bruce Van Saun: So yes, it's really -- we're at about an inflection point there, Vivek. So with that steeper curve, as John indicated, front book, back book when you factor in reduced amortization, we're now going to see that turn to be a tailwind from being a headwind for the first three quarters of the year.
Vivek Juneja: Okay. If I may, one more. The other retail, you've been talking about Citizens Pay, you've signed up a lot of partners, hard to see, although because it's overcast by the runoff portfolio. What are you seeing in those loans in terms of growth the Citizens Pay related? Is there some numbers that you can give us because obviously, the combined number doesn't look so great, but I recognize it's muddied?
Brendan Coughlin: Yes. The growth in Citizens stay has been pretty substantial. So all things kind of buy now pay later is up around 40% year-over-year with balances, and we continue to see that accelerate. We've had a lot of activity in the back half of this year on bringing on new clients, and it takes a while for these things to ramp. They've got -- we pilot them, they come online, we work with merchants to bring them to life to market them to their customers. So it's a bit of a ramp-up period. And so, all the leading activities that need to happen to continue to have confidence that this can scale through 2022 and beyond are there. So, we feel pretty good that it's headed in the right direction. We're building a lot of new technical capabilities that's broadening out our value proposition within Citizens Pay as well. So, underlying very, very good, healthy growth.
Bruce Van Saun: It sounds like Kristin, that we could probably shed some light and be a little more transparent in that whole unsecured area for future presentation at a conference or in our general releases. Thanks for the question. Yes.
Operator:  There are no further questions in queue. With that, I'll turn it over back to Mr. Bruce Van Saun. Please go ahead.
Bruce Van Saun: All right. Thank you very much. So thanks, folks, for dialing in today. We always appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day. Everybody, stay well. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alan and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.
Kristin Silberberg: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of second quarter results referencing our presentation which you can find on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we'll be happy to take questions. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking are also here to provide additional color.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks Kristin. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We continue to execute well through the second quarter, driving forward on key initiatives in both consumer and commercial, accelerating our digital transformation, making steady progress on TOP 6 and announcing the acquisition of HSBC's East Coast branches and online bank. The diversity and resilience of our business model was evident as record revenue and capital markets and wealth partially offset the sizable drop in mortgage. Our credit results continue to be excellent given further improvement in the economy. The headline numbers for the quarter with EPS of $1.46 and ROTCE of 17.7% were flattered by a sizable reserve release. Importantly, we feel PPNR has now bottomed and growth should resume in the second half. We achieved 1% average loan growth in the quarter, a little less than projected as pay downs on PPP loans and across the back book and commercial offset generally good levels of originations. We did a nice job on expenses, protecting the areas aligned with our growth initiatives, while delivering on our expense efficiencies associated with TOP. Looking out to the second half, we believe we will see a pickup in loan growth, particularly on the consumer side and student point of sale finance and auto. In commercial, we should start to see gradual growth in line utilization off of low levels along with the pickup in deal related financings. Mortgage revenues should rebound modestly, given hedge losses in Q2 and generally strong production, while capital markets pipelines remain healthy. We expect to return to positive operating leverage in both Q3 and Q4. Credit should continue to be excellent. We are now calling for further improvement in charge-offs to 20 basis points to 25 basis points in the third quarter and 25 basis points to 35 basis points for the full year. We continue to feel good about our progress and our ability to come out of the pandemic period with increasing differentiation and growth in franchise value versus our peers over time.
John Woods: Thanks Bruce and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. We reported underlying net income of $656 million and EPS of $1.46. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 17.7%, which includes the impact of the sizable credit provision benefit. Revenue of $1.6 billion was down slightly linked quarter on lower mortgage fee income with net interest income up slightly given interest earning asset growth. Average loans were up 1% in the quarter on the strength of retail originations hitting an all-time high giving us good momentum heading into the second half of the year. Key highlights include record results in capital markets and wealth. Mortgage fees were lower as margins continue to tighten, although origination volumes remain quite strong and we continue to control expenses down 2% quarter-over-quarter. We recorded a credit provision benefit of $213 million, which reflects sustained macroeconomic improvement and strong credit performance with lower charge-offs. Our ACL ratio is now at 1.75% excluding PPP loans. And finally, we are in a very strong capital position with CET1 at 10.3% after returning $168 million to shareholders in dividends during the quarter. We also continue to grow our tangible book value per share, which was $33.95 at quarter end, up 6% compared with a year ago. Next, I'll refer to a few slides and give you some key takeaways for the second quarter, I'll then outline our outlook for the third quarter. Net interest income on slide six was up 1% linked quarter, given interest earning asset growth and higher day count. Average loans were up 1% and net interest margin was down slightly. The net interest margin reflects lower earning asset yields reflecting the low rate environment. Spread pressures and elevated lending competition although improved funding mix and better deposit pricing are helping to mitigate these factors. Interest-bearing deposit costs improved four basis points to 16 basis points from continued discipline on deposit pricing. Our asset sensitivity increased to about 10.7% from 8.5% at the end of the first quarter. The increase primarily reflects the ongoing stability in deposit levels and the improvement in funding mix given the increase in low cost deposits. Referring to slide seven, we delivered solid fee results again this quarter with record results in capital markets and wealth, reflecting the ongoing investments in our capabilities and the benefit of acquisitions.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. . Our first question will come from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.
Ken Zerbe: All right, great. Thank you. Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Morning.
Ken Zerbe: I saw a few references to TOP 7, so -- in your press release. I was actually hoping you could talk a little bit more about what we might expect from the new TOP 7 program and also how it might differ from TOP 6? Thank you.
John Woods: Sure, Ken, it's John here. Yes, I mean I think as you've seen over the years we've been, just been part of our culture to really dig in on this kind of mindset of continuous improvement. And last year TOP 6 was somewhat unique and it's transformational sort of two-year profile. We are very pleased with how that played out, delivering on the expectations of $400 million to $425 million in run rate saves. So, we're excited about that. And there is a lot of traditional kind of top contributors in TOP 6 and there was a transformational aspect to us. So, that made it a little bit unique. I think TOP 7 may bring us back to some of that foundational sort of continuous approach to driving efficiencies and a couple of areas that we're looking at sort of looking at around to some of the areas that we were able to sort of drive in TOP 6 such as agile delivery and simplifying how we were operating. Next-gen tech has another, call it next wave of rationalizing applications associated with it. So, I think you could see sort of a 2.0 in revisiting some of the transformational areas of TOP 6. But then just continuing on our bread and butter to try to simplify how we operate in fundamentals around how we manage the place and I'd suggest that maybe there is some more room to go on optimizing branch density. But really just getting back to what we do, which is driving continuous improvement year-over-year.
Operator: Pardon me. The next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Matt O'Connor: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Good morning.
Matt O'Connor: Bruce, I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on your M&A strategy, obviously you just announced HSBC branch deal and have done some fee deals. But there were, I guess some interviews and quotes from you few weeks back about being more open to bank deals I think. So, maybe just update us on your thinking there. Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Sure. So, Matt, I think we've been very clear all along that we had some great strategic initiatives that should lead to very good organic growth for Citizens and that's kind of top of the heap in terms of priorities. We've focused next on fee based bolt-on acquisitions. And with some success, I think, you're seeing the results in our commercial business now that we've kind of incorporated M&A capabilities into our offerings to our customer base and the mortgage acquisition clearly was thoughtful and well timed and then the wealth, Clarfeld acquisition has been a home run in terms of opening up cross-sell particularly to our commercial business owner. So, we are pursuing more of those. And so, I feel good that there'll be some announcements over the course of the second half of the year in that regard. So stay tuned there. With respect to full bank acquisitions, I think the first step here was this HSBC transaction, which I think strategically makes good sense for us and also financially is very attractive and compelling. And so one of the things that we like about that is it fills in some geographical holes that we have, particularly the New York metro area and pushes us down a little bit mid-Atlantic South toward Washington and then gets us a beachhead in South Florida. So, those are all things that I think fit well with our distribution strategy. And if we could find potentially other bank transactions that fit that bill that potentially could strengthen the footprint and help our distribution strategy and we can get it at the right price and it's the right culture and meets the strategy et cetera with compelling financial economics, we'd be open to that. I don't think it's something that again is a driving desire here, I think will be a bit opportunistic if we can find a good deal, we would certainly consider it.
Operator: We'll go next to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead please.
Ken Usdin: Thanks. Good morning guys. Wanted to ask on the outlook a couple of things about the NII side. John, last quarter you had mentioned that you had expected flat earning assets and we continue to see the strong deposit growth come through. And I'm just wondering, again, you're calling for flat earnings assets, but it looks like the deposit growth remains pretty strong for the industry and for you guys. So just wondering what are you seeing there and expecting in terms of overall deposit growth and why that would only result in flattish earning assets.
John Woods: Yes, I mean, I think that we've been for some time now thinking that with economic activity you start to see potentially some of those deposits to flatten out. They've just been continuing to grow and we've seen strong flows. I'd say what's been nice about that is that, that's been coming in the categories we want them to show up and meeting demand deposits have been really strong underpinning all of that. So, that's been quite good. I think the -- and what that's resulted in is continuing to allow us to run our deposit playbook and you're seeing our interest bearing deposit costs decline and headed toward really low teens or even better by the end of the year. So that's been great. I do think that, as you see economic recovery in the second half of the year, we would suspect that some of that growth will begin to moderate and possibly even some of it begin to run off, but we have -- most of that surge deposits that we saw in 2020 and early 2021, we think is going to stick around. So, as much as two-thirds or more, and then that's great fuel and great support for what we're -- what we expect to see later in the year with this -- which is loan growth and as you get into 2022, lots of momentum. So, those are some of the thoughts I have on the deposit side.
Bruce Van Saun: I would just add to that, Ken that spot numbers are quite optimistic. So, I think we had a record level of originations for loans in the consumer side in the second quarter. We had a very strong level of that in commercial which goes back to pre-pandemic level of originations. We're still seeing relatively high pay downs which mutes that a little bit, but I think when we look out into Q3 in particular, we have a bunch of seasonal strength in businesses like student and point of sale combined with I think those pay downs should start to moderate a little bit. So, we're quite optimistic that we'll see very, very strong spot loan growth that should kick in Q3 and extend into Q4. The average is based on timing of when this all happens may not fully reflect that in Q3, but I would stay focused on the spot number.
Operator: Your next question will come from David George with Baird. Go ahead please.
David George: Hi, thanks. Good morning. A question on PPP, could you disclose the dollar amount of PPP loans in the quarter and then I've got a follow-up on the outlook?
John Woods: Yes, I mean, if -- basically, at the end of the quarter, the average balances during 2Q was about $4.5 billion.
David George: $4.5 billion. Okay, great. Appreciate that. And then with respect to the Q3 outlook particularly specifically on fees, it looks like you're expecting a fairly nice jump in fee activity, and I trust, part of that's going to come from mortgage. John, I thought I think you said $14 million relative to Q2. That is about $85 million number with MSR-related, and then there was a $10 million agency fee impact. Was there anything else that impacted that number? I'm just trying to get a sense as to how much of a balance, you're expecting over the next quarter or two.
John Woods: Yes, I mean, I think, yes, that's right. As I mentioned in my remarks, it's about $24 million of unique items that feel unique to 2Q. And so that's something that will set us up nicely for 3Q, starting with that without expecting those things to recur. We do think that in the third quarter volumes will help -- will hold up and we may have some modest decline in gain on -- on gain on sale margins, but given what's going on with those sort of non-recurring items from 2Q as well as, still a strong volume quarter that we do think that mortgage rebounds into the third quarter.
Operator: Your next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
John Pancari: Good morning. Just on the loan front, I know you mentioned that you're seeing some loan competition around loan pricing. So, I just wanted to, if you can elaborate on that and what areas are you seeing it. And if you could maybe give us some color in terms of your new production loan yields in the various areas that would be helpful. Then I have a follow-up on capital. Thanks.
Don McCree: Yes. Hey, John, it's Don McCree. We definitely are seeing price competition in terms competition across the board. So, part of the reason that our loan growth is a little bit more tepid than it might be is, we're trying to stay pretty disciplined on price and terms. So, down maybe 10 basis points or something is what I'm saying generally in terms of our price -- our spreads across the board. I think, just elaborating on what John and Bruce has said on loan growth, we're out with our clients in person that which is actually quite gratifying. And the thing that's kind of restricting utilization is all the supply chain back-ups and some of the labor. And as those begin to clear, particularly labor, we think clears up toward the September time frame and the supply chain begins to normalize toward the fourth quarter-ish. We would expect more normal working capital build the resume. So, that's what gives me a lot of confidence. And then as John said, we've got about our entire downdraft and spot loan growth in the quarter was PPP prepayments and that's going to begin to moderate. So, there is some headwinds that we've been selling into which should clear themselves out and get some good momentum as we move into the back-end, but we're going to stay disciplined on terms of price and credit.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Brendan?
Brendan Coughlin: Yes, similar on consumer I'd say, ex-PPP, spot balances were up just shy of 3%. So, pretty decent growth overall despite as Bruce pointed out some rundown in the back book. We're seeing really good strength and record originations, really the highest level of originations, we've had since we're a public company here in Q2. So, the momentum, should continue in the second half of the year. And then as both Bruce and John pointed out, adding in iUp, the Apple iPhone upgrade program, which is typically a late summer, early fall event. And then the seasonality of InSchool lending should really give us another round of growth heading into the second half of the year. But pricing has been really competitive in a couple of fronts, particularly on student loan refinancing as rates have ticked up and now are starting to peel back a little bit. That's been a particular place of intensity. I'd say on assets like auto, pricing intensity has picked up a little bit, spreads still remain pretty high. So, we're looking at that business still as a double-digit ROE business right now with originations which is elevated from normalized levels in auto given the short duration. So, we're able to hit record originations in auto as an example with still somewhat elevated yields, which has been really, really good. So, I'm optimistic -- that was actually the last point home equity, which is probably a little bit unique from what you're hearing against peers. We've been really, really strong on originations for home equity. In fact, we are seeing some benchmarking that puts us in probably the top two or three lenders across the U.S. although only operating in 11 states right now for home equity lending. This quarter, the spot balance has actually grew, and from a quarterly basis, that's the first time since the financial crisis, we've seen net loan growth in home equity and our credit card book is also bottom. So, some of these de-levering trends with all the stimulus out there in the market with consumers, I think in our line of credit products have hit the bottom. We're starting to see signs that those returning. So, hopefully a tailwind as we would think about H2.
Bruce Van Saun: Great. John, do you want to finish up with anything or?
John Woods: Yes, I mean, I think...
John Pancari: Yes. Sorry, go ahead John.
Bruce Van Saun: I meant, John Woods. Sorry.
John Woods: Lot of Johns, it's such a unique name. Yes, I mean, I think you were also -- you were just kind of our asset value yield. And you know in the second quarter, we were able to see origination yields up in the retail side of things due to a number of -- due to the diversity of the portfolio. And we suspect that may -- that's something that we may see continue into the third quarter with origination yields rising, and that tends to temper the front book, back book dynamic that I think maybe you were trying to get after.
John Pancari: No, that's helpful. Thanks so much for all that. And then on capital, I know you saw some good strengthening in the CET1, the 10.3%, I guess Bruce, if you could just maybe talk about how you think about that target of 9.75% to 10%. I mean we're starting to see some of your peers nudge down their targets, their internal targets a bit. Wanted to get your thoughts on that. Is there room to potentially adopt the lower level there on the CET1 internal target? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Sure. But we're comfortable with that 9.75% to 10%. As you know, over time we brought that down, it was 10% in the quarter, then it was 10% to 10% in a quarter, then it was 10% and it's 9.75% to 10%. So, I think as we've matured as a company, as we've demonstrated good risk discipline in how we've grown the loan book and you can see we've come through the pandemic with a low level of credit losses. I think some of that 'new guy' little bit of conservatism we had coming off the IPO, we're starting to shed that and move back closer to where pure targets are. So, for now we're above the 9.75% to 10%. So, I don't see any real burning desire to change it. But over time, certainly the pack moves down a little bit. We have plenty of room versus our SCB target. And certainly I think the risk profile would permit that.
Operator: Your next question will come from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.
Peter Winter: Good morning. It doesn't -- I just want to ask about the swaps hedging. It doesn't look like you added any swaps this quarter. And I'm just wondering what the plan is going forward. I do know rates are obviously lower. I'm just wondering what level rates need to get to before you think maybe adding some more swaps.
John Woods: Yes, we actually did have some swaps this quarter.
Peter Winter: You did?
John Woods: Yes, I mean, we added maybe, call it $1 billion or so. And we added $1 billion or so later in the quarter and actually $1 billion right at the beginning of the quarter. So, really right around $2 billion. You add that to the $6 billion, we executed late in the first quarter. And we've got around $8 billion that we've added as part of our sort of early stage kind of dollar-cost averaging into where the rate environment. And when you look at the overall averages, we did that, call it mid to high 70s on average, which is mid to high 70 basis points -- 75 basis points to 80 basis points on that overall portfolio and you know in the five years sort of well below that today. So -- and the last couple of billion which I think was over 90 basis points. So, I think that we've been able to start to look opportunistically at ways to really sort of monetize some of that asset sensitivity over time. And we're still over 10%, actually close to 11% asset sensitivity. So, there's lots of opportunity to continue to add to the swap portfolio as and when the rate environment continues to improve. And our year-over-year headwinds from swap has declined significantly and markedly as a result of all these actions. So I think we're -- I think we're in pretty good shape in terms of the swap portfolio.
Operator:  We'll go to line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go ahead please.
Gerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning Bruce. Good morning John.
Bruce Van Saun: Good morning.
John Woods: Good morning.
Gerard Cassidy: I got two questions. First for you, John, can you give us some color, I noticed in your outlook, you indicated that you guys think that the 10-year or the expectation for the 10-year will be 1.35%. Currently today, as you know, it's well below that, if it comes in at 1.15% for the quarter, what would that do to the net interest margin assumptions that you have in net interest income. And then second for you, Bruce, the president, now obviously came out with the executive order on M&A to scrutinize deals more closely. Does that raise the risk of your HSBC deal at all? Thank you.
John Woods: Yes, I'll go ahead and knock off the first part of that, Gerard. The -- in terms of, so we've gotten through a few weeks of the quarter breaks were a little higher. We do have an expectation of an average 1.35% for the quarter. If it were to drop off, call it into that range, maybe we would see, call it $5 million-ish or so of impact to NII. Maybe a basis point or two on NIM, but I would hasten to add that there are offsets, some puts and takes when you're operating in an environment like that. More broadly, you could find better opportunities in terms of offsetting that on the deposit side. You could also see as we've demonstrated back in the crisis and in the pandemic, the resilience of the franchise broadly even beyond that, net interest income and what the downside rate protection that the mortgage company actually provides which is extremely powerful. So, I think that maybe there is a modest impact from the first order effect. If the 10 year stays down there, but I think we have, we have mitigants in terms of on the deposit side, and then more broadly in the fee area.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, part two of that, Gerard, I don't see the executive order impacting the HSBC transaction. So, it's -- that's a relatively modest in size transaction, that straightforward and in any case the EO out for comment. It's going to take quite a while to settle that one down and more broadly I think bank mergers are probably among the most heavily scrutinized as it is. So, whether there is a meaningful impact down the track on that remains to be seen, but certainly as it relates to the HSBC transaction, I don't see any impact at all.
Operator: Your next question will be from David Konrad with KBW. Go ahead.
David Konrad: Yes, good morning. It sounds like definitely very positive on loan growth trends, maybe more spot and then average to because of timing, but just curious I think historically, you've talked about a mid-single-digit to high single-digit full year spot loan growth. I just wondered if you're still comfortable with that?
John Woods: Yes, I mean I think that's right. I mean, when you look at, look at where we're coming out in the second quarter in terms of spot, you see that momentum that's being generated and that's continuing into the third quarter with the 2% to 3% guide that we highlighted. I think you absolutely could get to that. And the expectation is to get to that mid-single-digit range.
Bruce Van Saun: And I think I'd hasten to add, when you look at it excluding PPP, that's an important metric to look at when you're considering the underlying fundamental flows that we're seeing both in commercial and consumer. And--
Brendan Coughlin: That was 1.8% in Q2, which annualizes to over 7% and then the 2% to 3%, we're calling out for the third quarter. Yes, we can do the math on that.
Bruce Van Saun: That includes -- that's -- so it will add 1% or more to that ex-PPP in 3Q. And so, I think you're--
Brendan Coughlin: So, one of the aspects, I think that's unique to us is just the number of sales we set out to catch the wind there is some wind. So, we have a very broad lending portfolio on the consumer side and we play in some very attractive verticals on the commercial side. So, broadly feel good that we can certainly get to nominal GDP growth on a recurring basis.
Operator: And at this time we have no further questions in queue. You may proceed.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, great. Thanks again for dialing in today. We always appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day and everybody stay well. Thanks again.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen that will conclude your conference call for today. Thanks for your participation and for using AT&T Event Teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-01 10:01:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp's First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. We'll begin this morning's call with the company's standard forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp, Inc. may make some forward-looking statements with respect to its financial position, results of operations and business. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Investors Bancorp's control, are difficult to predict and which can cause actual results to materially differ from those expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. In last night's press release, the company included its safe harbor disclosure and refers you to that statement. That document is incorporated into this presentation. For a more complete discussion of the certain risks and uncertainties affecting Investors Bancorp, please see the sections entitled Risk Factors, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations set forth in Investors Bancorp's filings under the SEC. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Cummings, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Investors Bancorp. Please go ahead.
Kevin Cummings: Okay. Thank you, Betsy. Good morning, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp First Quarter Earnings Call for 2021. Last night, the company reported in its press release, net income of $72.3 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. This compares to $75.1 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 30 last year and $39.5 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The fourth quarter of last year, we recorded some noncore transactions that impacted results and improved earnings to $84 million or $0.35 per share. The difference in core operating results of approximately $9 million for the fourth quarter were due to a $6.9 million reduction in prepayment fees, which are included in interest income. This decrease in fees caused a reduction in our net interest margin of eight basis points. Excluding these penalties or these penalty fees, our core margin increased by two basis points. The quarter was also impacted by a reduction in gain on sale of loans in mortgage banking activities of $1.7 million and a more favorable tax rate due to R&D credits recognized in the fourth quarter. These decreases in revenues were offset by cost control by reduced core operating expenses of $2.7 million in the first quarter. All things considered, it was a solid quarter for the bank and a good start to 2021. This time last year, there were major concerns about liquidity, capital and where the credit cycle was going to go. And I'm happy to report that the company declared its cash dividend of $0.14 per share to be paid in May, and this reflects a $0.02 increase from the dividend paid at the height of the pandemic last May of 2020. These results reflect our third straight quarter of double-digit return on tangible equity, and our return on average assets has averaged over 1.07% over that 3-quarter period. When I look back to where we were a year ago, it is remarkable what we have accomplished through this pandemic. A year ago, we were in the midst of the PPP process. Customers and our employees were in fear of touching doorknobs or speaking with each other. There was uncertainty and no one felt comfortable with the normal routines of everyday life. Through grit and determination, we were able to take care of our customers, keep all our retail branches open, and most importantly, protect our employees. Today, we are a stronger bank. Our capital ratios are up approximately 30 basis points. Our credit culture is stronger than ever. And our outlook for 2021 is bright. We are anxious to get all our corporate employees back to the office and look forward to being that bank that serves our customers and communities in both good times and times of crisis. On the credit front, our nonaccrual loans are down $23.8 million or 22% for the fourth quarter and $48.7 million or 37% from September 30 of last year. This reduction in nonaccrual loans was completed with no cumulative net charge-offs as our net charge-offs in the last six months were negative and resulted in net recoveries of $5.7 million for the last two quarters. Our loan loss coverage ratio to nonaccrual loans is 341% this quarter versus 248% last year at March 31. In the commercial portfolio, our total nonaccrual loans of $37.6 million, consisting of 53 loans for an average loan of approximately $709,000, which is down from $79.8 million at September 30 of last year. Our three largest nonaccrual loans at March 31 are: a multifamily loan for $4.6 million, a CRE loan for $3.1 million and a business loan for $2.6 million. The remaining 50 loans in the nonaccrual group reflect an average exposure of $550,000 and is similar to the exposure in our mortgage and consumer portfolio, which has an average loan, nonaccrual, of $191,000. We have a war room mentality with respect to credit but still believe we have a lot of work to do to get through this operating environment and the post effects of the pandemic. Almost every week since June, we have met to discuss our loan exposures and trends in deferred loans due to this pandemic. At March 31, our total deferrals were down to $582 million and include approximately $500 million in loans that are currently paying us interest and are keeping their taxes current. We have made a concerted effort to reach out to our customers during this time to work with them through the crisis. And in a period of uncertainty, we see these times as an opportunity to help our customers and build long-term relationships. With respect to principal and interest deferrals, we have approximately $83 million, of which $23 million in the entertainment category commenced payments as of April 1. The remaining $60 million is made up of 20 loans. And the two largest loans are both multifamily loans for $37 million and $10 million. So of the remaining $50 million -- $60 million, the remaining $60 million, $37 million and $10 million are in two loans. We have recently visited those two properties earlier this month. And the Washington loan -- one loan is in Washington, D.C. with an average loan per unit of approximately $70,000. The complex was recording stronger cash collections in March that we collected at pro forma cash flow of a 1.2% debt service. It is a well-maintained property and should retain its value, and we expect it to be back to full payment at the end of the deferral period. The other loan is in Brooklyn, which we visited earlier this month, and is a 20-unit relatively new building that is fully occupied and is recovering its cash flows after concessions to new apartment dwellers and should not be a problem due to the strong sponsorship, the quality of the building and its amenities. The remaining exposure in this principal and interest deferral is $13 million, which is made up of 18 loans for an average loan of approximately $722,000. So at the end of the day, we feel we have a great handle on the exposure of this $60 million of principal and interest deferral. There's a lot of discussion of what's going on in Manhattan. And in that deferral portfolio, our Manhattan exposure is mainly in the hotel sector for $196 million of the total $367 million that we have in the Manhattan area. All of the loans in the hotel sector and in Manhattan are paying interest and are showing improving trends. The hotels are seeing increased tourist activity but little business travel. These properties are family businesses for multi-generations and have strong sponsorship. The remaining exposure in Manhattan is in multifamily and CRE for $88 million and $38 million, respectively, and have good sponsorship and improving operations and do not show any major issues at this time. As I mentioned earlier, our credit and first-line teams have been meeting on a weekly basis to discuss the progress of the deferral portfolio and other trends in the total commercial portfolio. Last week, we met for several hours to discuss our office portfolio, where we reviewed the top 25 loans for approximately $620 million. All of these loans are current as to interest and principal and there was nothing discussed that would set off alarm bells at this time. We will continue to monitor this and other portfolios at the highest level of management to make sure we stay ahead of the leasing activities in both retail and office and the impact of changes in business practices and workplace activities. Today, we feel we are doing everything possible to manage this credit risk with strong reserves, low delinquency trends and a strong credit and monitoring team in place to manage us through this pandemic. With respect to loan growth, our commercial loans grew 1.3% in the quarter compared to a reduction in loans of 1.4% in the 2020 first quarter. The first quarter is usually a slower quarter for us, and we are optimistic of the activity we are seeing in the marketplace. Our lending teams are engaged and are making calls in the market. They're out in the market, out of the office. We have a strong commercial pipeline, which totals over $3.3 billion and compares to $1.5 billion last year this time and $2.2 billion at year-end. We believe we can grow our loans at a 7% to 8%, maybe 9% pace for 2021. On the deposit front, deposits were down $534 million, which related to planned runoff of higher-costing brokered deposits of $534 million and government deposits of $327 million as our cost of deposits went down 19 basis points for the quarter. Our consumer and business deposits were up $328 million with our noninterest deposits increasing $174 million or 4.8% for the quarter. Noninterest deposits now comprise 20% of deposits, which is a first for the company. We are seeing great activity from the investments we have made in 2019 and 2020 with our business lenders and business development teams generating core deposits and relationships and business loans. We are moving forward with our Berkshire acquisition, which will bring approximately $300 million in loans and $600 million in deposits. We recently agreed to a marketing partnership with the Trenton Thunder, a local Minor League Baseball team in Trenton in the Berkshire market and have been active in coordinating activities with the retail and business teams in that market. It is a great opportunity for us. And we will expand our brand with two additional branches in Bucks County in Pennsylvania. Going into the year 2021, we have strong momentum and continue to see great opportunities in the marketplace as larger banks are not showing the love or paying attention to the middle market during this pandemic. It takes a bank that sees the long view, whose management teams are local and has access to decision-makers and will be there for their customers and their prospects during these difficult times. We are that community bank, and we are looking forward to a record year in 2021. Now I'd like to turn the meeting over to Sean Burke, our Chief Financial Officer, who will give us some commentary on the operating results for the quarter. Sean?
Sean Burke: Thank you, Kevin. What a difference a year makes. Year-over-year net income and earnings per share were up over 80% with net income for the first quarter totaling $72.3 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Our net interest margin dropped eight basis points quarter-over-quarter to 2.9% with prepayment fees driving the decline. Our core net interest margin, however, expanded two basis points quarter-over-quarter as we continue to benefit from declining deposit costs. On an encouraging note, we have seen prepayment fees rebound and totaled $4.5 million in the month of April alone and expect our second quarter margin to rebound accordingly. Total noninterest income totaled $20 million, a decrease of $2.7 million on a core basis quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year, however, noninterest income increased $5.3 million or 36%, driven by mortgage banking, swap fees and wealth advisory fees. Total noninterest expenses totaled $104 million for the first quarter, a decrease of $38.5 million quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was driven by $23 million of costs from the early extinguishment of debt and $12 million of branch closure costs in the fourth quarter. Excluding these items, noninterest expenses were down $4 million compared to the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by incentive compensation. Provision for credit losses was a negative $3 million for the first quarter compared to a negative $2.7 million release for the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by an improving economic forecast and net loan recoveries in the quarter of $2 million. Our total loan balances were flat quarter-over-quarter, while C&I loans grew $66.5 million or 2% quarter-over-quarter. Total deposits were down $534 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by the intentional runoff of brokered deposits; while noninterest-bearing deposits were up $174 million or 5% quarter-over-quarter. Our percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposits improved to 20% at March 31 compared to 13% a year ago. Asset quality, liquidity and capital continued to remain in a solid position at quarter end. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.4% of total loans at March 31 compared to 0.51% at December 31 while our allowance for loan losses to loans remained unchanged at 1.44%. Our common equity Tier one ratio was 13% at quarter end. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Kevin for concluding remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Okay. Before I open up to questions, I just want to -- just give a sort of like the longer view. The last 12 months have been an unbelievable year of social unrest and economic turmoil. And when I look back on the last year, I see the bank's leadership team that has grown in confidence and competence as they've executed through this storm as we continue to provide a platform for our employees for personal growth and successful business careers. There is great optimism in the bank and in the communities that we serve. We continue to serve our customers, employees and our communities in partnership with our foundation. It is part of our brand to be the different community bank that makes a difference. This is not a new trend to our bank, it is part of our DNA. And with all the discussions of corporate social responsibility, we are and have been on the front lines in supporting and serving the underserved. Let your sermons be said without words, and our actions speak volumes of who we are and what we have accomplished. Our foundation and bank have donated over $70 million since 2005. And our return to shareholders has been almost 280% since that time. This compares very favorably to local community thrifts here in New Jersey, up 42%; and New Jersey commercial banks, up 58%. And if you compare our return to the national banks during this period, the four largest national banks, we surpassed them 2.5 times with that 280% return for investors versus 78% for the large national banks. We have always taken the long-term view, something that our society or government sometimes has difficulty doing. In the words of my predecessor, Bob Cashill, we understand that we can do good and do well. We recently added two new directors to our corporate Board, and I'd like to welcome Kim Wales and John Harmon to our Board. They both bring a broad range of experience to our team, and we are happy to have them. Their diverse background and experience will make us stronger. With respect to DE&I, we recently held a town hall meeting with Dom and I taking questions on how we can create greater opportunities for our customers, employees, our vendors and the communities that we serve. And we are constantly looking forward to better communications and listening better. God gave you two ears and one mouth for a reason. And I'm happy to report that our workforce is 56% women and 41% diverse and our offices are 42% women and 28% diverse. And at the most senior level, the EVP level, it's 24% women and 60% diverse. The journey is the destination, and we are on a journey of continuous improvement, getting better every day. I don't want to be better than Dom, but I want to be better than I was yesterday and getting better and being a servant leader who serves. And our leadership teams continues to be selfless in their service to others. We have accomplished a lot in the past 15 months. We've accomplished a lot in the last 15 years. But we are stronger today and certainly more hopeful. And as I said last year this time, when I was one of five employees at the bank, let's be faithful and not fearful. The future looks bright. There was certainly great hope and optimism in the President's speech last night, and I look forward to a record and great year in 2021. I'd like to now turn it over to questions and open the lines up to hear from you. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities.
Jared Shaw: Good morning, guys. Maybe starting off on the funding side, with the runoff of that higher cost funding, your loan-to-deposit ratio is still pretty high. Are you seeing good trends sort of in the DDA growth that should be sustainable and that we should see maybe a faster pace of deposit growth from here? Or how should we be thinking about funding and deposit growth in light of loan growth expectations?
Domenick Cama: I think that we'll continue to see an increase in our funding on the deposit side. Noninterest-bearing has been a nice surprise for us. This quarter, I think Sean mentioned that we were about $180 million in noninterest-bearing growth. Total deposit growth though was about $350 million in the branches. So I think when you compare that to $1.2 billion in growth in 2020, I think we're on pace to match what we did in 2020.
Jared Shaw: Okay. And then when you look at the loan growth outlook, what category should we see that in? What's your appetite, I guess, for taking on additional New York City CRE at this point? Has pricing improved at all? Or has it gotten tighter, I guess? What does the growth mix outlook look like?
Domenick Cama: Yes. The way the pipeline is broken out, I mean, the CRE pipeline is about $2.4 billion and the C&I pipeline is just about $900 million. That equates to the $3.3 billion Kevin referred to earlier. We have seen some Manhattan business pick up, especially on the CRE side and on the multifamily side. Things are getting better. They're not where they were pre COVID, but they are getting better. And to the extent that we need some additional risk mitigants in the CRE space, we're doing that. We're doing that in the form of PGs. We're doing that in the form of asking customers to put six months of payments in escrow with us. And yes, so we're pretty comfortable. Fortunately, we do a lot of business in New Jersey also, so New Jersey is contributing nicely to the pipeline. But we're not running away from Manhattan at this point, we're simply being more cautious as we make those loans. When you look at a loan that comes in from Manhattan, the first question you ask is, "How were you impacted during the COVID crisis?" And then you work from there.
Jared Shaw: And then just finally for me, we're seeing some deal activity in your markets over the last few weeks. How do you think that impacts your ability, I guess, to potentially hire some people or target some customers that maybe you weren't able to get before? And then what's your outlook in terms of a participant in the M&A environment at this point?
Domenick Cama: Yes. I think, Jared, from the perspective of competitive forces, I think you're exactly right. I mean, while a number of these institutions are doing their deals and trying to integrate their respective financial institutions, I think there'll be an opportunity for us to bring over additional lending teams or to capture some additional business in our market. I mean we're starting to see a little bit of that already, quite honestly. As far as the deal activity, I mean, clearly, I see, and I think we agree as a management team, that there is a compelling reason to do deals like that in terms of just being bigger, having more funds to contribute to technology investments and just being more diversified. So as far as the institutions that I know personally, those in our area, I congratulate them on the deals. I thought they were good deals for both institutions, and I wish them well.
Kevin Cummings: Yes. Jared, I think the strategic opportunities will always be evaluated here, we've always said that. The core pillars of organic growth, M&A, both as either a buyer or a strategic partnership, dividends and stock buybacks. And certainly, those things are the pillars of our strategy moving forward. There is a lot of chatter, we're talking to a lot of people, a lot of opportunities out there, and I think it's an exciting time. But either way, the long-term view is we're in a very good position. And either way, there are great opportunities ahead of us.
Jared Shaw: Thank you, I appreciate it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon with Piper Sandler.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Hey guys, good morning. Kevin, I love the uplifting comments.
Kevin Cummings: Okay, Mark.
Mark Fitzgibbon: First, I wondered if you could give us any update on the timing of the expected closing on the Berkshire Hills branches, when that might be?
Domenick Cama: We'll probably get that closed before June 30, Mark.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then secondly, on the expense front, you guys did a nice job managing cost this quarter. I wondered if you could, Sean, maybe share with us your outlook for expenses for the next quarter or two.
Sean Burke: I think we should be in a very good spot, Mark, there. We've provided a guide, I believe it was around $425 million, and we're doing a bit better than that. So next quarter, I expect it to be in a similar spot. The Berkshire transaction, when it closes, will add some additional cost when that comes in. But as Domenick mentioned, probably not until sometime in the second quarter. So just looking forward to second quarter, expense is probably in a very similar spot that they are in today.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then last, given the increased digitization of the business, are you guys thinking more about being proactive with branch consolidations in the rest of your network?
Domenick Cama: Yes, we are, Mark. I think we mentioned in earlier releases, we planned on closing 10 branches. We closed those branches earlier this month, as a matter of fact, I think, on April 9. And so I think that we need to continue to evaluate those opportunities. We continue to develop online products, which that technology and that progress has been moving along nicely. And I think that will be a catalyst for us to continue to trim the branch network around the region.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Steven Duong from RBC Capital Markets.
Steven Duong: Hey, good morning guys. Sean, I just want to make sure I heard it right. The prepay income through April so far, was that $4.5 million?
Sean Burke: That's correct. $4.5 million in the month of April.
Steven Duong: Okay. So you're on pace to be above the fourth quarter level then?
Sean Burke: Yes. I wouldn't go that far, Steven. I think the fourth quarter was elevated as far as our guidance for NIM that we gave for the full year, the 3% area. We were modeling in less than where we were in the fourth quarter, candidly. Our budget was $4 million to $5 million of prepayment fees per quarter built into our budget and built into our guidance. But we are seeing a nice rebound there. We do expect the margin to pop back up, maybe eight to 10 basis points in the second quarter.
Kevin Cummings: Usually, it's seasonal in the fourth quarter because of tax reasons, 1031 exchange, whatever it might be, =usually prepayments are highest in the fourth quarter.
Steven Duong: Right. Right. That makes sense. So I guess maybe we just drill down on just the loan yields. If we were to strip out just the prepaid income, I don't know if my calculation is right, but I'm getting your core loan yield down around 13 basis points. Does that sounds right? So I'm just wondering if you maybe just explain what the dynamics were with the core loan yield ex the prepay income.
Domenick Cama: Steven, I think the best way to try to answer that question is just to go through kind of the average coupons that we're seeing based on the categories, four major categories. When we look at resi loans these days, resi loans are coming on the balance sheet at just probably around 3%, I'd put them right there. Multifamily is coming on somewhere between 3 1/8%, 3.125% and 3.20%. CRE is coming on at about 3 1/4% to 3 3/8%. And then C&I, as you know, has become more competitive, especially here in this market, and those yields are coming in somewhere between 3 3/8% and 3 3/4%. So obviously, the interest rate environment has benefited us on the liability side, but clearly, it's having an impact on the asset side, too. So I hope that answers your question.
Sean Burke: And Steven, it's Sean. Your math is approximately correct. And just to add on, where we probably saw the most compression is in our residential portfolio. The current market rates are around the 3% area. Our portfolio is yielding, the residential side was yielding higher than that. And so it's kind of coming back down to the norm. So that's probably the spot where we're seeing the most compression.
Steven Duong: Got it. So I guess, if rates are static, I guess, would you think that we'd just be around this level on the core loan yields?
Sean Burke: Yes. I think that's fair. We took more compression this quarter. And I think moving forward, as we look through the year, we're not expecting to see that much compression on the loan yield side, some but not to the degree that we saw in the first quarter.
Steven Duong: Got it. Okay. And then just last one for me. Just on your borrowings, I know that you're planning to prepay $250 million concurrent with the Berkshire deal this quarter. But you still have, as of right now, about $3.6 billion of borrowings. What are your thoughts about doing more prepayments, given that they're right now over 200 basis points?
Domenick Cama: Yes. Steven, we obviously, we're looking at that. As you point out, we have the $3.5 billion or so at over 2%. So there's an opportunity to pick up some NIM thereby, frankly, burning capital by paying the prepayment fees. We'll look at that. We've been talking about doing a larger trade than the one that we projected for the Berkshire transaction. And so just given the Berkshire transaction, we may supersize, if you will, the prepayments using the Berkshire transaction as a catalyst for doing that.
Steven Duong: Got it, appreciate that. Thank you guys.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]The next question comes from Michael Perito with KBW.
Michael Perito: Hey guys, I appreciate taking your time. I was wondering if, first, you can just expand a little bit more on the residential mortgage gain on sale pipeline, sorry, if I missed it. And is it fair to think that that number could bounce back a little in the second quarter before normalizing presumably over the back half of the year?
Domenick Cama: Are you talking about the income that we generate, the mortgage banking income?
Michael Perito: Yes, the mortgage gain on sale, correct.
Domenick Cama: Yes. Mike, we see activity has slowed on the mortgage banking front, and we think that that number will trend down for the next quarter. As a matter of fact, when we did our budgets, we actually projected that, that number would come down in 2021. So I think the answer is yes, that number will continue to trend down as we head through the rest of the year.
Sean Burke: Mike, it's Sean. I just wanted to add though that, as Domenick mentioned, we are expecting that to trend down. But we are expecting swap fee income to offset some of that decline as we go throughout the year. So that's how we see fee income unfolding, where we're going to lose a little on the mortgage banking side, but we're going to pick up and gain an offset with swap income as we go throughout the year.
Michael Perito: Got it. Thanks for that, and then just lastly, the loan growth, 7% to 9%, pretty strong. How do we balance kind of the provision expense here between the improving economic conditions, but clearly the accelerating loan growth? Do you guys have any kind of initial thoughts on that?
Sean Burke: I think our models were showing, obviously, this quarter, improved economic conditions. We think that can continue to improve if we stay on the current trajectory that we're on. I think the New York City area has been a little slower to improve from a modeling perspective and a forecasting perspective than some other parts of the country. But we do believe it's trending in the right direction. And if we keep on the current path, that will mean maybe when we get toward the back half of the year, there could be more release coming in the provision line item.
Kevin Cummings: I hate to say it, but hopefully, we'll have some loan growth that will offset that release. So we're looking for loan growth, okay?
Michael Perito: Yes. No. I think that would probably be a scenario everyone would be very happy with. Thank you guys for taking my question, I appreciate it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Laurie Hunsicker with Compass Point.
Laurie Hunsicker: Yes, hi, good morning, can you hear me now?
Domenick Cama: We can.
Kevin Cummings: Hi, Laurie.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. Great. Sorry, don't know what I did. Of your $582 million in deferrals, how much of that is New York City?
Kevin Cummings: $341 million, I believe.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. Great. And then will you just remind us, of that, how much is multifamily in New York and how much is office in New York?
Kevin Cummings: One second.
Domenick Cama: Laurie, are you talking about New York City specifically, right, Manhattan, the Manhattan borough?
Laurie Hunsicker: Yes, exactly, New York City-specific. And maybe along those lines, too, just of your $1.2 billion in office, how much of that plays into New York City as well? And if you don't have these, I can follow up with you offline.
Kevin Cummings: Yes. We will follow up with the office. In Manhattan, $88 million is multifamily, CRE is $38 million, lodging is $195 million, C&I loans is 0.
Laurie Hunsicker: C&I is 0. Okay. Great. And the buybacks, love seeing them. Obviously, they were a little slower this quarter. Any comments around that?
Domenick Cama: I think, Laurie, obviously, we saw our stock price accelerate pretty quickly. So it gave us a reason to pause on our buybacks there and just trying to understand how tangible book value would compare to where we're trading on a book value basis. So we'll continue to evaluate that. The stock got up there around $15. So as I said, it just gave us reason to pause and just monitor how stable that would be going forward.
Laurie Hunsicker: Got it. Okay. And then just last question, going back to what Jared asked, too, can you help us think a little bit about M&A? Obviously, it's been a year since we saw you close your last deal. Can you help us think about, as you look forward, whether it's a strategic partnership or you're a buyer or you're on the other side of it, how you think about asset size targets? What makes sense? What's ideal? How big would you go? How do you think about an MOE? How do all those things play into the very exciting M&A landscape we're seeing at the moment? Thanks.
Kevin Cummings: Laurie, I would say yes. Certainly, we're open to any strategic discussions from an MOE. I mean, Berkshire is a $600 million deposit branch acquisition. So if it fits in with the strategy, if you look at the last two transactions, Berkshire is on one side of our franchise, Gold Coast was on the east side of our franchise. And I think we closed the Berkshire deal on April 3, a year ago. In the height of the pandemic, we had get to out there and change all the signage. We were worrying about the police shutting us down from being outside during that period of time. And both those transactions are very promising to us. They're a little on the small size, takes a lot of energy. I think that $7 billion to $15 billion area would be a great lock-on-type transaction to do. But we're open, and we'll do whatever is necessary to enhance the shareholder value of the company. There are a lot of discussions going on, and we are certainly looking at a lot of opportunities in the marketplace.
Laurie Hunsicker: Right. Thanks for taking my questions.
Kevin Cummings: Laurie, just on the numbers, I had said them earlier. The total exposure in Manhattan is $367 million, of which the hotel sector is $196 million; multifamily and CRE are $88 million and $38 million, respectively. And as I mentioned earlier, pretty good sponsorship and improving operations. And they're all paying us interest, too. I want to emphasize that. There's no principal and interest deferral, they're all paying us interest.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay, thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matthew Breese with Stephens.
Matthew Breese: Good morning.
Kevin Cummings: Hey, Matthew.
Domenick Cama: Good morning, Matthew.
Matthew Breese: I know we hit on a lot of the moving pieces, but maybe more directly talking about the core NIM, so ex prepayment penalty income, how do you think the year kind of unfolds for that metric and the cadence of expansion from here?
Domenick Cama: Matt, I think that we'll continue to see benefits from falling rates, especially in our deposit portfolio. Like for example, we still have some room to go in our government banking portfolio. We're working on that. We still have a number of CD buckets in that are maturing through the year and we'll see some benefit from that. So I think the core NIM will continue to expand. I know there was a lot of focus on the overall NIM and prepayment fees. But we just look at that as being seasonal. But I think you're right, focusing on the core NIM is reflective of the changes that we're making in our balance sheet, where resi and multi are falling and C&I and CRE are going up and noninterest-bearing deposits have hit 20%. So I think we'll continue to see benefit in the core NIM.
Matthew Breese: Got it. Okay. The other question I had was there's two pieces of legislation. In the State of New York, they're talking about this eviction without good cause. That's in committee. It seems like it would impact market rate apartments, and then it seems that President Biden is talking about the 1031 exchange. How do you kind of view these pieces of legislation impacting commercial real estate and multifamily? And how would you kind of assess the loan growth impact potential and credit quality impact potential?
Kevin Cummings: Matt, I think you have to look at it in light of the whole Democratic agenda, capital gains tax, things like that, it's not going to be good for business. So it's certainly not good for economic development, for productivity. It seems like everything is going to be free. And so I certainly don't think it's good for investment in the country. I have a tendency to listen to Fox Business a little too much. And I certainly think that it's certainly going to have a negative impact on business and business investment going forward. But I think getting it through and putting it in operation, you don't want to bite the hand that feeds you, and commercial real estate, especially in the multifamily sector, is a very strong sector and pays a lot of taxes. And they shouldn't bite the hand that feeds them as far as generating tax revenues in the city and the state.
Matthew Breese: Got it, that's all I have. I appreciate you taking my questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Well, thank you for your participation today. I look forward to seeing you all at our shareholders' meeting in May. It will be a virtual meeting again. And I think 2021 is going to be a very strong year for the company, we've had three quarters of double-digit return on equity. And it's probably a record for the company in the last nine months, and I think it will continue throughout 2021. So thank you for your participation today. Have a great day, and enjoy your spring. Be well.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-19 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to JMP Group's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Andrew Palmer, the company's Head of Investor Relations.
Andrew Palmer: Good morning. On the line with me today are Joe Jolson, JMP Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Jackson, the company's Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Lehmann, CEO of JMP Securities. Before we begin, please note that some of this morning's comments may contain forward-looking statements about future events that are out of JMP's control. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied. For a discussion of the uncertainties that could affect the company's future performance, please review the risk factors detailed in our most recent 10-K. With that, I'll turn things over to JMP's Chairman and CEO, Joe Jolson.
Joe Jolson: Thanks, Andrew. This is our first earnings call in 1.5 years. We paused these calls mid-2019 as we started thinking through some strategic changes for the company. Much of that work is now behind us, and we felt it was time to discuss the results of our efforts. One of the key changes since our last conference call was the elevation of Mark Lehmann to the role of CEO of JMP Securities. That occurred this past summer, when we also named Tom Wright Chief Operating Officer of JMP Securities and made Jon Dever and Gavin Slader, co-heads of our Investment Banking Group and members of our Executive Committee. In addition, we have simplified our balance sheet, shedding noncore businesses such as Harvest Capital Credit Corp., resulting in a simpler story to tell and a simpler company to run once that deal closes in the second quarter. We'll continue to look to monetize our corporate investments and work aggressively to pay down long-term debt after just redeeming $10 million of our senior notes 2 weeks ago, leaving us with roughly $71 million of long-term debt outstanding. In 2020, the wind was at our back. It was an unprecedented and challenging year in many respects. But amazingly, we ended the year with record results. Net revenues for the fourth quarter were $53.6 million, up 125% from the $23.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, net revenues were $115.5 million versus $100 million for 2019. Operating earnings per share were $0.42 for the fourth quarter, by far, a record, and $0.63 for the year, also a record for the firm. I'll ask Mark to add some thoughts about JMP Securities before I finish up. Mark?
Mark Lehmann: Thanks, Joe. JMP Securities is one of the few remaining independent equity capital markets platforms of meaningful scale in the United States. That said, we are firm believers in the full-service model, which pairs capital markets expertise with our strategic advisory capabilities. We've completed -- I'm sorry, competed successfully to establish JMP as a more recognizable brand in the middle market and a more sought-after strategic advisory partner to growth companies.  In 2020, we had our best year ever. Total revenues of nearly $119 million and a record operating profit of $0.68 per share. Investment banking revenues hit record levels for December, for the fourth quarter and for the entire year, finishing 2020 at $100 million, up 53% from 2019. 60% of that amount came from public equity and debt capital raising and 40% from strategic advisory and private placements. Capital markets revenues, which combined fees from equity and debt origination with net brokerage revenues were up 32% year-over-year to $79 million for 2020.  Our net brokerage revenues were also up 10% last year to $19 million. We were a lead or co-manager on 1/3 of all U.S. tech IPOs priced last year, compared to just 10% in 2014 and 8% in 2007, the peak years of the 2 prior market cycles. We are gaining market share. At the same time, some of the senior M&A professionals we've hired recently proved to be our biggest producers in 2020, contributing to record advisory fee of $40.5 million. Those fees accounted for over 1/3 of JMP Securities' revenues last year compared to just 14% in 2015.  We will look to add other M&A professionals to further expand this footprint. Our pipeline in advisory is as strong as ever and growing, and we anticipate a year ahead that could possibly outpace the one that we just had in 2020. We completed a total of 126 investment banking transactions in 2020, with 45% of the fees from health care, 35% from tech and 20% from financial services and real estate. Already, in 2021, JMP Securities has underwritten 15 equity offerings, including 5 IPOs.  In all, we completed 22 investment banking transactions year-to-date. Last year, we invested in 3 growth initiatives that should have lasting impacts for our firm. First, we added two senior research analysts and one senior investment banking to our already highly regarded life sciences practice, which should further enhance our competitive footprint in 2021 and beyond.  Second, we focused on being more active on the front end of SPACs, which we think will enhance our strategic advisory and private placement business going forward. Lastly, we've laid the foundation to enter the cannabis space, initially within our financial services and real estate verticals, but allowing for expansion into technology and health care as 2021 progresses. And now back to you, Joe.
Joe Jolson: Thanks, Mark. In the past few years, we have proactively sold or spun out all asset management strategies that did not present synergies with JMP Securities' industry coverage. As a result, we have completely exited the hedge fund business and narrowed our focus to venture and private capital strategies that leverage the domain expertise that exists across our firm. We also took steps last year to reduce our structural costs, which allowed for highly positive operating margin leverage in the fourth quarter. Our objective is to sustain a top-tier return on equity at our operating platforms through varying market cycles. With our company more streamlined than ever before, its future value will hinge on the continued success of our investment banking platform, in addition to a conservatively stated and growing book value per share. We are optimistic about JMP's prospects for 2021, but we'll leave it to the market itself to judge. With that, operator, we'd be happy to try to answer any questions. Thank you.
Operator:
Mark Lehmann: Joe, I'll start first of all by thanking everybody at JMP and most importantly, to the almost 200 people who through 2020 and all the personal and professional challenges that COVID has had us all face, the hard work and dedication and loyalty were extraordinary. And most importantly, the health and safety of our employees is paramount. And I just want to thank everybody for that support for 2020, and I'll leave it to Joe for some concluding comments.
Joe Jolson: Well, I was -- that's very well said, Mark. I'd reiterate that. And we're -- everyone's really busy here. We're working hard, fully at capacity, and we look forward to reporting our results to everybody in late April, so in a couple of months. Thank you very much. Have a great day.
Mark Lehmann: Thanks all.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-01 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] We'll begin this morning's call with the company's standard forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp, Inc. may make some forward-looking statements with respect to its financial position, results of operations and business. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Investors Bancorp's control, are difficult to predict and which can cause actual results to materially differ from those expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. In last night's press release, the company included it's Safe Harbor disclosure and refers you to that statement. That document is incorporated into this presentation. For a more complete discussion of the certain risks and uncertainties affecting Investors Bancorp, please see the sections entitled Risk Factors, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations set forth in Investor Bancorp's filings with the SEC. And now I'd like to turn -- please note, this event is being recorded. And now I would like to turn the conference over to Kevin Cummings, Chairman and CEO of Investors Bancorp. Please go ahead.
Kevin Cummings: Thank you, Andrea, and good morning. Welcome to the Investors Bancorp's third quarter earnings call. Last night, the company reported in its press release net income of $64.3 million or $0.25 per diluted share for three months ended June 30, 2020 September 30, 2020]. This compares to $42.6 million or $0.18 per share for the three months ended June 30 and $52 million or $0.20 per share for the three month period ended June 30, 2019. These results represent a 51% increase in earnings from the second quarter and a 24% increase over the third quarter of 2019. On an EPS basis, the increase in earnings represent 50% increase over the linked quarter and a 35% increase over the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, net income totaled $146.4 million or $0.62 per diluted share compared to $146.8 million or $0.55 per share for the nine months ended June 30 -- I mean September 30, 2019. During the second quarter, the company completed its acquisition of Gold Coast, which added approximately $535 million in total assets, $443 million in loans and $490 million in deposits. It added seven branches to the New York market and nearly doubled our deposits in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. We continue to integrate these branches into our systems, and opportunities for market expansion is strong. Last Saturday, I was invited to a breakfast meeting in Southampton out on the island with prominent businessmen, and the feedback was positive regarding the transition of customers from Gold Coast to Investors. We continue to leverage our brand in this market because we think it is very attractive due to its demographics, concentration of small and midsized businesses and density of high net worth individuals. With respect to our brand, I am happy to report that Investors Bank was selected by Newsweek, a national magazine, as the best bank in the state of New Jersey -- the best big bank in the state of New Jersey. Newsweek used a broad criteria to measure banks throughout the country and identified a bank in each state. They looked for banks with a broad local footprint, and they indicated that customers do not want to have to go too far out of their way when they need to -- a branch or an ATM. They evaluated banks that offer a winning combination of low fees, competitive interest rates and a broad array of services, including a variety of loans and a high-performing mobile app. We are very proud of this recognition by a third party, and it highlights our commitment to expanding our digital platform. During the quarter, we expanded and enhanced our online account opening platform, first to bank customers and then next to small business customers and then to new customers. This account opening platform is fully integrated with our Salesforce management tool, which facilitates the follow-up with customers. The expansion enhancement of the online account opening platform is an enterprise-wide effort and the foundation of an omni-wide experience that will be expanded, which will lead to significant gains in branch efficiency and improvements in the customer experience by digitizing many manual processes in the branches. We are very happy to receive the recognition from Newsweek, but we will continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our digital platform. During the third quarter, the company recorded a provision for loan losses of $8.3 million versus $33.3 million in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to a credit of $2.5 million in the third quarter of '19. This provision is a direct result of the current and forecasted economic conditions that include the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the new accounting requirements. Net charge-offs for the quarter ended September 30 were just $667,000 versus $4.1 million in the second quarter and $1.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. Pre-provision net revenue was $97.5 million for the three months ended September 30 versus $92.1 million for the three months ended June 30, an increase of $5.4 million or 6%. And this -- and we also had an increase of $29.8 million at September 30, '20 or 47% compared to the three months ended last year. That's a 47.7% increase over the same period last year. The bank has spent considerable efforts in evaluating its credit position and has focused its efforts on the commercial portfolio. As disclosed in our second quarter 10-Q, the company reported approximately $2.2 billion in commercial loan deferrals, comprised of $447 million in C&I loans, $903 million in multifamily, $830 billion in commercial real estate loans and -- $830 million in commercial real estate loans and $15 million in construction loans, and that's one construction loan. This second quarter number is down from a total of $3.6 billion earlier in the year. The bank's lending teams continue to be very aggressive, reaching out to customers during this time of great stress and uncertainty. And like the PPP loan program, we look at this deferral process to help our borrowers and customers during a difficult time. We are actively reaching out to them to assist them during this economic distress initiated by local government shutdowns. We continue to spend our time actively communicating with these customers to assess their needs during this pandemic. Every Wednesday, we spend time on Zoom calls in a war room-type setting, discussing credits well into the evening hours. After extensive communication with our borrowers and follow up on our lending teams, we have reduced the exposure to deferrals significantly. At October 20, total request for deferrals totaled $593 million in the commercial loan book. This is comprised of $282 million in C&I loans, $188 million in multifamily loans and $108 million in commercial real estate loans and a $15 million construction loan. Yesterday, we updated our review of $175 million of loans scheduled to commence payment on November 1, and we anticipate approximately $125 million will return to payment status. $37 million were granted an additional deferral, and approximately $13 million will need additional information before a final decision is made. We have another $70 million scheduled to return to payment status on December 1. And if we anticipate the same results as November, we would expect approximately another $50 million reduction in deferral balances. It should be noted that we are in constant communication with our borrowers during this process, and there may be other additional deferrals as market conditions are fluid. And a lot depends on what the government does in our local markets and the progress made to our journey back to a more normal lifestyle. In addition, we have $200 million in deferred loans scheduled to return to payment as of January 1, and we anticipate going into 2021 with a significantly less exposure. If you take a snapshot at our exposure today, 61% or $362 million of the $593 million in deferrals is concentrated in six relationships: a $46 million multifamily relationship of eight loans, which is expected to return to payment next week; three hotel relationships totaling $268 million; one multifamily loan for $25 million in Queens scheduled to return to payment in December; and an entertainment venue in New Jersey for $23 million scheduled to return to payment in January. The three hotels are family generational seasoned operators who are known to the bank and are good customers in the bank who have earned our support through this crisis. This industry and the restaurant industry are facing very difficult times, but thanks to the cooperation of the regulators, the Fed and the accounting profession, we are able to help these customers through an unprecedented situation. The remaining $230 million in loan deferrals at this time on October 20 is comprised of 113 loans with an average loan of $2 million, and it should be noted that 59 of these loans are less than $1 million in balances outstanding. The weighted average LTV of our entire multifamily portfolio is approximately 53%, with 14% of the portfolio in lower-risk co-op loans. The LTV on the $188 million in deferred multifamily loans is approximately 59% pre-pandemic. We have only $19 million in deferred retail shopping loans, which have an LTV of $54 million, of which one of the larger loans in that group for $7 million is returning to payment next week. Overall, we are pleased where we are with respect to assisting our customers through this pandemic today. There is much uncertainty in forecasting future events, and forecasting these results and events are almost impossible, but we will continue to work with our customers to help them through this crisis. Our approach has been and is to be proactive in addressing these issues as there will be difficult conversations. We believe we have taken a conservative approach to our provisions to date as compared to other banks with similar portfolios in the New York/New Jersey markets and are well positioned to weather this storm. Our allowance for loan losses, the coverage ratio to loans increased to 1.37% from 1.28% at June 30. Tomorrow, we anticipate the closing of a loan sale for $18 million, which will reduce our NPLs to $114 million versus $126.8 million at June 30. We anticipate recording a $1.9 million recovery as a result of this disposition of the loan. With respect to delinquencies, $8.8 million of the $13.6 million in commercial 30-day delinquent loans are current as of today. In the 60-day bucket, total commercial delinquent loans are $30.6 million, of which one relationship which amounts to $25 million in the CRE portfolio has been approved for extension and will be current once the legal work is completed. Non-accrual loans were $61.8 million or 39 basis points after giving effect to the sale previously mentioned and are well collateralized and have limited exposure. And at this stage, the average loan is approximately $1 million. Based on our current delinquencies and the significant progress in reducing our deferred loan balances, in addition to the increase in our loan loss reserves in the past three quarters, we believe we are well positioned to get through this pandemic. With respect to the balance sheet, loans decreased $365 million during the quarter, which was attributable mainly to a reduction in mortgage loans of $295 million and $122 million in multifamily loans. We have slowed the pace of this decline in loans and anticipate some growth in the fourth quarter as we have a robust pipeline and are working diligently to have a strong fourth quarter. As we continue to feel more comfortable to our exposures due to the pandemic's economic impact, we will seize growth opportunities. And as it continues to stabilize, we will look for opportunities to grow our loans across all portfolios as opposed to our strategy in 2019 and the beginning of this year, where we are more focused on the business segment -- more focused on the business lending segment. This is not a major strategy shift but one that we consider very opportunistic. It was a good quarter for deposits as non-interest bearing deposits increased over $300 million or 10% for the quarter. Total deposits decreased $594 million or 7% as we begin the process to reduce our cash position, which negatively impacts our margin. Our loan-to-deposit ratio remained stable at 110% for the quarter. Cost of deposits declined nine basis points in the quarter. And there are still opportunities to decrease funding costs in this year as we run off our excess cash and we execute on a sales leaseback transaction, which will generate approximately $9 million in a gain, which will be invested in the early retirement of higher-cost wholesale liabilities, which result -- hopefully will result in an expansion of our margin in the fourth quarter. With respect to capital, the company announced a dividend of $0.12 per share and has increased its capital ratios across the board given the impact of the PPP loans, increased earnings and a reduction in assets. We believe we have sufficient capital, strong liquidity and a robust credit culture to maintain that dividend and to handle the uncertainty and economic storm that may be on the horizon. And actually, at this time, we look forward to increasing that dividend by $0.01 in January, as we have done over the past several years. With respect to buybacks, we currently have 14.6 million shares approved to be purchased, having purchased over $1.5 billion since our second step. We are prudent in our management of our capital and are excited about the opportunity to resume our buybacks. We are evaluating the uncertainty of the election and the ongoing disruption of the pandemic. We have and continue to discuss this opportunity with our Board and our regulators and believe we are in a strong position to commence buybacks when things settle down post-election in the fourth quarter. If we look at past calamities like Hurricane Sandy and the 2008 Great Recession, we have managed this turmoil and have been very opportunistic. I believe with this management team and with the investments that we have made in our enterprise and credit risk management, technology and product and development, we are better prepared today to serve our customers and our communities, which will result in stronger returns to our shareholders. Now, I'd like to turn the discussion over to Sean Burke, our CFO, for more commentary on the quarter and our results of operation.
Sean Burke: Thank you, Kevin. Net income was $64.3 million or $0.27 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of $21.7 million or 51% quarter-over-quarter and 24% year-over-year. Net interest margin increased six basis points to 2.79% in the third quarter, with declining cash balances and deposit costs driving the improvement. We expect cash balances and interest cost to further decline in the fourth quarter. Total non-interest income rebounded nicely from the second quarter and totaled $19.9 million, an increase of $9.8 million quarter-over-quarter. Strong swap income, mortgage banking activity and wealth and investment product revenues all contributed to the quarter-over-quarter increase. Expenses totaled $104.1 million in Q3, an increase of $4 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was largely the result of increased incentive compensation and medical expenses. Included in expenses were approximately $1 million of costs related to the early extinguishment of borrowings in the quarter. Despite the uptick in expenses, our efficiency ratio improved slightly to 51.6% from 52.1% in Q2. Provision for credit losses was $8.3 million for the third quarter compared to $33.3 million for the second quarter. The decrease was driven by improving current and forecasted economic conditions. Third quarter loan originations were strong but not enough to offset the paydowns and payoffs. As a result, total loan balances decreased $364 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by residential and multifamily loan categories. The impact to interest income from declining loan balances was minimized as we're able to allow high-cost funding to run off in Q3. While total deposits were down $384 million quarter-over-quarter, non-interest bearing deposits were up $305 million or 10% quarter-over-quarter. Our percentage of non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits improved to 18% at September 30, 2020, compared to 14% a year ago. Asset quality, liquidity and capital continue to remain in a strong position. Non-accrual loans represented 0.63% of total loans at September 30, 2020, compared to 0.59% at June 30, while our allowance for loan -- for credit losses to loans stood at 1.44% at September 30. Our common equity Tier one ratio was 13%. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 110% compared to 122% at year-end 2019. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Kevin for concluding remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Good. Thanks, Sean. Our message is to be faithful and not fearful. We need to be a source of hope and optimism in our communities. All our branches are open at full service on regular hours, except for the recently mandated hotspots in Brooklyn. We are taking all precautions to protect our customers and employees. We have close to 75% of our corporate employees back to the office, and it is very good for me to see them healthy and strong, willing to return and lead our communities back to some form of normalcy. I visited a branch in Southampton, a former Gold Coast branch, on Saturday and listened to their challenges during this pandemic and their transition to our bank. Our retail teams are engaged and excited to be working and, more importantly, helping their customers and our communities through this pandemic. The past eight months have not been easy, but we have faced the challenge and continue to get stronger and more adaptable as we navigate the changes from these unprecedented events. If we can get some stabilization in the macroeconomic climate, some cooperation in Trenton, Albany and Washington, including another stimulus bill, which will then impact our economic models, we expect that we can finish the year with a great fourth quarter. We've been aggressive in calling on our loan customers and have a war room-type attitude toward monitoring our credit exposures with great teamwork and cooperation from our line of loan officers and our credit risk teams. This crisis is great different from 2008 as the banking industry is stronger with better capital to sustain this economic downturn. Investors Bank is also stronger and better prepared for these events, and I'm much more optimistic than I was in April or July when there was a lot more uncertainty. Our medical professionals and health workers have been outstanding and have learned a lot about the treatment of this virus, and we are in a better position to monitor and treat this terrible pandemic. We hit a goal of 10% return on tangible equity for the quarter. Our earnings per share increased 35% to last year after taking additional provisions in the quarter with less net charge-offs. Our balance sheet and capital are strong, and we are well positioned to grow as the economy improves. Now, I'd like to turn this call over to questions. Andrea?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mark Fitzgibbon of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Good morning. Kevin, just to follow up on the buyback comments that you made. With the TCE ratio pushing 10% and the stock trading sort of 75% of tangible book value, I guess I'm curious why would -- you still have the buyback in place, why would you be executing on that right now even before the elections?
Kevin Cummings: Mark, I think it's our way of being prudent. There's such uncertainty in the market. We're continuing to evaluate it, and I think we're just waiting after the dust settles after the election and have some continued discussion with the other constituents that are involved mainly our regulators. We did the big repurchase at the end of last year, and we want to manage it in a -- similar to what we've done since the first step through the second step in a prudent manner. So it's a wait-and-see attitude, see what happens to the markets afterwards. And our plan is to continue to buy back sometime in the very, very near future.
Domenick Cama: And Mark, it's Domenick, and if I could just add another comment to that. Obviously, we recognize that the buying back of the stock is a good investment for us, and it's something that we want to do. We have already had some preliminary discussions with our regulators and with our Board. And it's -- I remember someone saying to me once, it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. And so I think as Kevin said in his prepared remarks, things look good that we will resume buying back the stock sometime in the fourth quarter. But we would like to touch -- would like to do a little more analysis on it and have more discussions with the constituents that Kevin mentioned.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then secondly, it looks like you still have about $4 billion of borrowings at an average rate of 2.22%. I guess I'm curious how much of those will roll off over the next few quarters. And should we expect more prepayments like you did this quarter?
Domenick Cama: Yes, Mark. Actually, we don't have any more borrowings coming due this quarter, but we do have about $1 billion of brokered CDs and retail CDs maturing over the quarter at an average cost of about 150 basis points. So, that's going to give us some momentum for NIM for the end of the fourth quarter. We are also looking at -- I think Kevin mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks that we did sign a contract to do a sale leaseback in which we're expecting a gain of somewhere between $7 million and $9 million. And our thinking is that we'll take that money, that gain, and use it to offset prepaid fees on borrowings that are averaging a cost of about 2%. So still -- and so we'll get some more momentum from that. But, in terms of this quarter, the big gain will be in the form of brokered CDs. There are no borrowings left to pay off this quarter.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then, Sean, I apologize. I missed your comments on your expense outlook for 4Q.
Sean Burke: Well, you missed it because I didn't provide one.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Well, let me rephrase. Can you provide one?
Sean Burke: We believe expenses will be similar to Q3.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then lastly, I wondered if you're seeing much of a difference in credit performance from your multifamily and commercial real estate loans in New York versus New Jersey.
Domenick Cama: Mark, on collection rates, I think we continue to see collection rates at about 85% for multi and about 50% to 60% on CRE. But I did want to put out one piece of information that wasn't in the deck that we put out. And specifically about Manhattan, we looked at the deferrals in Manhattan by category. And the LTVs of our multifamily loans in Manhattan is approximately 54%, and these are deferred balances in Manhattan. The lodging category, which is obviously the biggest category that we have of deferments, $244 million sit in Manhattan. And the weighted average LTV of those properties is approximately 49%. So, those are the two big categories in Manhattan, and I know there's been a lot of discussion around the industry about the knock on Manhattan and what's going on there. But, we feel very good about the LTV situation and the fact that the customers we're dealing with have a significant amount of equity in their properties in Manhattan, and we deem it a very low probability that they're going to walk away from these properties.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jared Shaw of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Jared Shaw: Good morning, guys. Just circling back on the margin, you talked about the runoff in the resi book and some opportunities for growth elsewhere. Should we expect or can we expect to see maybe an improvement in loan yields quarter-over-quarter on the core book based on that change in mix? Or should we expect sort of loan yields stay roughly where they are?
Domenick Cama: Yes. I think you actually may see a reduction in loan yields, Jared, because -- I mean if you just look at what the average loan yield was in our residential book, quarter-over-quarter was approximately the same. But if you go back a year in our residential book, we're down almost 40 basis points. So that resi book, we're continuing to put loans on. We're just not putting on as many as we were in prior years. On the multifamily side, we have now moved our pipeline up significantly. On the CRE front, our pipeline is about $1.7 billion. And the weighted average cost of the CRE pipeline is about 3.90%. So that will bring down the yield on the CRE book. C&I is about $800 million, and that's a little bit more difficult to project. But the combination of multifamily loans and residential loans continuing to come on the balance sheet will, I think, have the effect of lowering our average yield on loans.
Sean Burke: If I may, Jared, it's Sean. I just wanted to add a comment, though, the trend that really benefiting margin in the third quarter, which are declining cash balances with very low average yields and deposit costs continuing to come down, we expect that will continue in Q4. And despite maybe some headwind on the loan side, we do expect improvement in margin in Q4, a similar ilk to that we experienced in the third quarter.
Jared Shaw: Great. That's great color. And then just circling back again on the credit and the trends you're talking about on those deferred loans, which is great. Are those values at origination? And I guess what are you seeing in terms of valuation impact from COVID? Obviously, you're not doing full reappraisals. But, are you seeing valuations really get hit because of this? And if you did mark those to market, what would you guess they look like?
Domenick Cama: Yes. I mean we haven't seen any significant decline in valuations. I mean we look specifically at cap rates, and cap rates continue to be in that 4.5% to 5.5% range. So, no significant decline there. On some of the C&I properties, it's a little bit more difficult to do because, obviously, operating income has been impacted. And, trying to put a valuation on a hotel, for example, its operating business, is difficult right now. So specifically, though, in the commercial real estate and multifamily sector, while we have seen a tick up in cap rates, it has not been significant. It's not actually what I expected it to be. It just -- it stayed pretty stable.
Kevin Cummings: Jared, I don't think we see like a panic in the market. People aren't knocking on our doors giving back the keys. I think there's still confidence in the market. We don't see a panic out there dealing with the hotel operators, like they are generational owners. One in particular has put up a six months of payments in escrow on a large exposure, multi-properties -- multi-numbered properties. And, I think we're working with borrowers. It's a small group. Like I said, 61%, $360-plus million is in six relationships, and we know these customers very well. And I think it's -- we feel much more confident than we were sitting here six months ago.
Jared Shaw: Okay, great. And then just finally for me, as we look at the allowance level, if we make the assumption that the macro model doesn't change, the macroeconomic model doesn't change, is this a good high watermark for the allowance? And as you start dealing with some of those remainder loans that either on deferral or don't return to payment and if there's a charge-off needed there, should we just expect that provision -- or allowance as adequate? And you can see maybe a future decline as those loans are resolved?
Sean Burke: I think it's a big if, but we understand if forecasted conditions improve or remain similar, then, yes, I would agree with your statement, Jared. But, also keep in mind that loan volume and loan production and loan balances also impact that. So, we've seen declining loan balances. And if that -- if the tide were to turn there and we would see more production, it could lead to increased provision as it relates to loan volume.
Jared Shaw: Thanks a lot.
Kevin Cummings: Jared, that reminds me of a question I used to get when I was with Peat Marwick in 1991, '92 when the audit committee just asked me if the allowance is adequate. And I said, yes, today, it is, but God only knows in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Duong of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Steven Duong: Good morning, guys. Just on the Manhattan, the CRE exposure. I just want to confirm if I heard that right, that it's primarily just the multifamily and the lodging that you guys spoke about?
Domenick Cama: Yes. Well, I think we put a deck out last night or this morning. But if you look at Manhattan, Manhattan has total deferments of $313 million. And the composition of that is $243 million in lodging, $58 million in multifamily and then $10 million CRE and $1 million in C&I.
Steven Duong: All right. Perfect. Now, that -- the deck was really, really helpful. And then just on the buyback, the remaining capacity that you have, that's about roughly $150 million, $120 million. So that's a little more than 50% of a year's earnings. Assuming you go through that in the next few quarters, I guess looking beyond that, would you be open to starting another buyback program next year?
Domenick Cama: Of course, we always look at the buyback as an effective way to manage our capital. And obviously, if it makes sense to buy back the stock and we've run out of authorization, of course, we would go back to the Board and ask them to reauthorize an additional allotment.
Steven Duong: Great. And just along those lines, is there a target capital level that you would like to be above?
Domenick Cama: Yes. I mean, again, you're asking me that question in the middle of a pandemic. If you had asked me, say, two years ago, I might have said 8.5%. And these days, it's more like 9.5%. So, it just depends on where we are at a particular point in the cycle. But it's difficult to say that in all situations, this is where I would be very happy.
Steven Duong: Understood. And then you made a comment about the pipeline in fourth quarter looking good. Are there any particular segments that you're more optimistic about in the fourth quarter?
A – Domenick Cama: Yes. Health care is having a good quarter. The C&I book, we think we're going to close about $500 million in the fourth quarter. That's -- I spoke to our Chief Lending Officer this morning about that. And multifamily has opened up a little bit. We have approximately $250 million of new C&I loans in the pipeline. And, I should mention that despite the continued reduction in multifamily loans that has occurred quarter-over-quarter, this month, we have finally stopped that bleeding. So, we're actually flat for the month.
Steven Duong: That's great news. And then just last question for me. Your non-interest bearing deposits grew pretty well this quarter. Can you just give us some color like what drove the growth?
Domenick Cama: Yes. Steve, we -- obviously, we had some PPP money in there that continue to come in. We had -- also, we put out a team of bankers, business bankers that we talked about last year. And those folks have started to reap some benefit. We're doing more C&I lending. We are doing more treasury management. And those two factors are having the effect of bringing more non-interest bearing deposits in. So it's been our strategy to continue to transition the bank from a traditional thrift to a commercial bank, and I think we're finally starting to see some benefit from those strategic decisions.
Steven Duong: Good to hear. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Breese of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.
Matthew Breese: Hi, good morning. I appreciate the color on the near-term margin. Just considering the average balance sheet and the opportunity to continue to reprice the CDs, there's obviously room on the borrowings front. And then average new loan yields don't sound terribly off from where they are now. As we look into next year and you deploy the cash, where could we see the margin expand to? Where do you see that plateau mark?
Sean Burke: So, we are going to reap the benefits of continued repricing of both borrowings and deposits, and so there is a tailwind there. And we believe that the benefit -- there's still a lot of benefit there, not only in Q4, but looking out into 2021, Matt. So, I think where you'd start to maybe peter out running out of that tailwind, probably the second half of 2021 is where you could see some trail off there. But we could have 20 more basis points to go here. I mean, ideally, we would like to see something in the 3% range. That may be a little bit of a stretch, but I think that's a stretched goal for us. And, not saying that we're going to get there, but that's a target that we have in mind.
Domenick Cama: And Matt, if I could just add to Sean's comment, so you -- obviously, you get the benefit that he described on the deposit side. But our continued remixing of the asset side of the balance sheet is going to continue to provide benefit to us. We're seeing yields on C&I loans of 50 basis points to 5/8, above where multifamily and CRE are coming in. So, as we continue to focus on the C&I front, that will help to add to NIM also.
Matthew Breese: Excellent. I appreciate that. You mentioned several points of the pipeline that sound relatively strong. Looking into the fourth quarter and beginning of 2021, how do you feel about net loan growth prospects? Can we expand gross loans from here?
Domenick Cama: Well, I think that net loan growth will be better as we head into '21. I think that, as I said earlier on the multifamily front, I think that we've stopped that bleeding. We are looking at ways to stop the bleeding on the residential side. We're dropping there probably $60 million to $70 million a month despite the activity that we have in that portfolio. And we're looking at -- now I should add the comment that it was a strategic decision to start to slow down residential balances on our balance sheet. However, when the pandemic came along, that presented an opportunity for us with wider spreads. Having said all of that, I think, Matt, it would depend on resi. If I can get resi to stabilize, we should see growth in 2021. We're going through the budget process right now. And while I'm not trying to give guidance at all here, we are projecting growth in 2021. And that budget hasn't been approved yet, but we are looking at ways to continue to grow the loans in 2021. Because, again, as Sean described earlier, the steam is going to run out just based on the -- getting rid of the cash balances, and we need to start to generate growth to continue to add to NIM.
Matthew Breese: Understood. Okay, last one for me. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you're getting 50% to 60% rent collection on the commercial real estate asset class. What are the components within that? What is it for office versus retail and hotels? You mentioned -- also mentioned 85% rent collection in multifamily. What is that in New York versus New Jersey?
Domenick Cama: Matt, I don't have that breakdown. I would say that New Jersey is probably doing a little bit better than New York in all of the categories, but I don't have a specific -- I don't have the numbers to support your question. So -- but if you'd like, I can look up that information, and we can send that out to you.
Matthew Breese: Sure. Would appreciate it. That's all I had. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurie Hunsicker of Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Laurie Hunsicker: Yes, thank you. Good morning. These slides are great, and I'm probably missing it, so I just need your help finding it. So the -- of the $7.256 billion of multifamily, it looks like $3.049 billion is in New York City. But what I can't find, unless I'm not reading it properly, is the $188 million that you have in multifamily deferrals. What -- how much of that is actually in New York City?
Domenick Cama: Debt of $58 million is in Manhattan.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay, okay. Yes, I'm sorry. You gave that number earlier, and I just -- I couldn't find where it was. Okay. And so the $46 million of multifamily loans that you mentioned that are returning to payment status next week, is that coming out of the New York bucket? Or is that New Jersey bucket?
Domenick Cama: It's coming out of the New York bucket, mainly out of Manhattan, like in Bronx and other boroughs.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay, that's great. And then just a quick accounting question for you, Sean. The $1.9 million recovery that you're going to book on the non-performing loan disposition tomorrow, is that hitting your top line, your net interest income? Or is that going into non-interest income?
Sean Burke: No, that will be in provision through the allowance of your recovery.
Kevin Cummings: The allowance.
Laurie Hunsicker: Recovery in the allowance. Okay. Perfect. That's all I have. Appreciate the detail.
Operator: Our next question comes from Collyn Gilbert of KBW. Please go ahead.
Collyn Gilbert: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just one final question for me. Dom, you kind of touched on it, but just wanted to get your thoughts on the mortgage banking outlook. Dom, you kind of indicated your appetite for, perhaps, portfolio-ing more resi production. But just broadly, how we should be thinking about that. Because obviously, that was a huge, huge number this quarter.
Domenick Cama: Yes. I mean it's been a great business. I mean some of the spreads that we've seen on mortgage banking have been pretty remarkable. I mean this morning, just going through our rate meeting, selling loans to Fannie Mae at two 3/4%, we're reaping a price of 102. So to the extent that we can continue to generate business loans for sale to Fannie, we're going to continue to do that. And actually, one of the questions we had this morning was should we lower the rate and take less price from Fannie, and the consensus was that we want to maintain the quality of the underwriting process and the closing process. And we felt that we could be adding too much pressure to the group. So it's a long-winded answer, Collyn, but I think you're going to continue to see more non-interest income as we go through next quarter and the early part of 2021 because that business is really hitting on all cylinders.
Collyn Gilbert: Okay, that's helpful. And then just the corresponding expense to that. I know you had indicated that this quarter's expenses were up because of incentive comp. Is there a big number there, a big delta in there for what the mortgage commissions would be as well?
Sean Burke: It's not a huge delta, but it is part of it. So the compensation -- a bigger piece of it, quite honestly, is the retail incentives. And we've had very good low-cost deposits and non-interest bearing deposit growth that we've incentivized our people to do and generate. And so that, in large part, is driving higher incentive comp.
Kevin Cummings: Collyn, the commission on the sale of mortgage loans is netted in the gain on sale.
Collyn Gilbert: Okay. Just want to make that. Okay, got it. Okay, thank you very much. That's all I had.
Kevin Cummings: Thank you, Collyn.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Thanks, Andrea. First of all, I'd like to thank you all for participation today. Our country is a great country. It's a strong country, but it's not perfect. We have created a country of great opportunities. But like Investors Bank, we need to continue to get stronger, improve and listen to all our constituents. Not going to be easy in 2021, regardless of Tuesday's results. We at Investors are well positioned to move forward into next year with great hope and optimism. We will create great opportunities for all our customers, employees and the communities that we serve. I want you all to please stay healthy and follow the CDC guidelines. Listen to that Jesuit educated Dr. Fauci. Wear a mask and stay away from crowds.
Domenick Cama: And wash your hands.
Kevin Cummings: Yes, wash your hands. Let's pray for each other and inspire each other in our daily work and look for magical moments to help each other to be the best version of ourselves during this crisis as we make this journey together. And I said it earlier, in July, the journey is the destination. I want to again thank you for your participation today. And I look forward to the day we can get out on the road and be visiting with you all soon. Enjoy Halloween, as I know I will, as it is my first granddaughter's first birthday. Raptors won its first road game on the road last week, and college pro football continues. I think we have to be optimistic. Life is good, and we need to cherish the moments. It's another step back to normalcy, and let's continue to pray for a cure to this dreadful virus. Be strong, be safe, and God bless. Thanks for your time today, and have a great day. Appreciate it.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Investors Bancorp Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. We will begin this morning’s call with the company’s standard forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp, Inc. may make some forward-looking statements with respect to its financial position, results of operation and business. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Investors Bancorp’s control, are difficult to predict and which can cause actual results to result materially different from those expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. In last night’s press release, the company included its safe harbor disclosure and refers you to that statement. That document is incorporated into this presentation. For a more complete discussion of certain risks and uncertainties affecting Investors Bancorp, please see the section entitled Risk Factors, Management Discussions and Analyst of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in Investors Bancorp’s filings with the SEC. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Cummings, Chairman and CEO of Investors Bancorp. Please go ahead.
Kevin Cummings: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp’s second quarter earnings call. Last night, the company reported in its press release net income of $42.6 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the 3 months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to $39.5 million or $0.17 per share for the quarter ended March 31, and $46 million or $0.18 per share for the 3-month period ended June 30, 2019. For the 6 months ended June 30, net income totaled $82.1 million or $0.35 per diluted share compared to $94.8 million or $0.36 per share for the six months ended June 30, 2019. During the quarter, the company completed its acquisition of Gold Coast Bank, which had approximately $535 million in total assets, $443 million in loans and $490 million in deposits. It added 7 branches in the New York market, nearly doubled our deposits in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. These customers have attractive demographics and give us opportunity to leverage our business models to customers in that market. Getting this transaction completed during this pandemic is attributed to the grit and tenacity of the bank, as we closed the transaction, rebranded the branches and completed the data processing conversion during the weekend of April 3. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $12 million in goodwill and approximately $2.5 million in core deposit intangibles. During the second quarter, the company recorded a provision for loan losses of $33.3 million versus $31.3 million in the first quarter of 2020, and this compares to a credit of $3 million in the second quarter of 2019. This elevated provision is a direct result of the current and forecasted economic conditions that include the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-provision net revenue was $92.1 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $6.7 million or almost 8% compared to the 3 months ended March 31, 2020. And this is also an increase of $29.8 million or 48% compared to the three months ended June 30, 2019. The bank has spent considerable effort in evaluating its credit position and has focused its effort on the commercial portfolio. As disclosed in our March 31 Q, the company reported approximately $3.6 billion in commercial loan deferrals, comprised of $600 million in C&I loans, $1.4 billion in multifamily loans, and $1.6 billion in CRE. The bank’s lending teams were very aggressive reaching out to customers during a time of great stress and uncertainty. And like the PPP loan program, we looked at this deferral process to help our borrowers and customers. We were actively reaching out to them to assist them during this economic lockdown initiated by local governments. We have spent the last 10 weeks actively communicating with our customers to assess their needs during this pandemic. After extensive communications with our borrowers and follow-up on our lending teams, we have reduced the exposures to deferrals significantly. At July 24, total requests and that’s different than – total request for second deferrals totaled $480 million, and which was comprised of $218 million in C&I loans, $87 million in multifamily loans and $175 million in commercial real estate. We have performed detailed reviews on 79% of the original $3.6 billion in deferrals to date. We anticipate on completion of this entire review of deferred loans, a second deferral exposure for commercial loans of approximately $750 million or 5% of commercial loans. As mentioned earlier, of the $480 million in loans that have requested second deferrals, approximately $292 million is concentrated in the accommodations and food services sector. Of that amount, $230 million are hotel loans to 2 relationships who have strong liquidity and are proven generational operators. One relationship had deferred loans with an average LTV pre-COVID of 45% and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.85. And the other relationship is also for deferred loans, with an average LTV of 51% and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.42. Both these borrowers have good locations in desirable areas of Manhattan. In the retail sector, we have approximate exposure of $1.8 billion at June 30, 2020, that’s the entire commercial portfolio and an initial deferral amount of $880 million, which has been reduced to $380 million by borrowers making their July 1 payment. Based on discussions with borrowers, we expect further reduction upon completion of the initial 3-month deferral period of $258 million, which would result in second deferrals in the retail portfolio of approximately $130 million. In the office sector, our total loan exposure is $1.2 billion, with initial deferrals of $186 million. As of July 22, we have received the July 1 payment for loans totaling $35 million, which results in a current deferral balance of $151 million. Based upon follow-up with our borrowers, we anticipate further reduction of $115 million in the office deferral balances as a result of payments principally scheduled for August 1, which would result in a second deferral balance of approximately $36 million for this sector. In the multifamily sector, we have total exposure of $7.4 billion at June 30, with initial deferrals of $1.4 billion, which have been reduced to $900 million due to payments received in July. We expect those deferrals to be further reduced upon the completion of the initial 3-month deferral period by August and September payments to approximately $100 million. So in summary, today, we have approximately $1.4 billion of loan deferrals in the office, retail and multifamily sectors. We expect, based on current conditions of our borrowers, that those deferral balances will be reduced to $260 million at the end of their initial first 3-month deferral period, which is ending August 1, September 1, and to a limited extent, October 1. Overall, we’re very pleased where we are with respect to assisting our customers through this pandemic to date. There is much uncertainty and forecasting future events and results are sometimes very difficult, but we will continue to work with our customers to help them through this crisis. Our approach is to be proactive in addressing these issues as it will be in the future difficult conversations. We believe we have taken a conservative approach to our provisions as compared to banks with similar portfolios in the New York, New Jersey markets, and we are well positioned to weather this storm. With respect to charge-offs for the quarter, we had one significant charge-off on a multifamily loan for $3.5 million that was not pandemic-related. And have had the loan written down to 80% of current appraised value, which was received recently in May. With respect to delinquencies, $15.3 million of the $24 million in multifamily 30-day delinquent loans are current as of today. $6.5 million of the $10.6 million in CRE 30-day delinquencies are current as of today. And $5.9 million of the $7.5 million in C&I 30-day portfolio is current as of today. In the 60-day bucket, the only significant exposure is in the multifamily, which totals $19.1 million, of which $9.9 million is current today. $4.8 million has been approved for its first deferral and $4.4 million is a maturity where there is a contract for sale. In the 90-day bucket, the only significant increase was in the multifamily portfolio, where the reference loan with this quarter’s charge-off that now has a carrying value of $18 million was moved into the 90-day delinquent bucket during the quarter. In addition, there were 5 small additional credits with an average balance of $1.4 million, which moved into non-accrual status during the quarter. Based on our current delinquencies and the significant progress in reducing our deferred loan balances, in addition to the increase in our loan reserves in the past 2 quarters, we believe we are well positioned to get through this pandemic. With respect to the balance sheet, loans increased $75 million during the quarter, which was attributable to the Gold Coast acquisition and the origination of approximately $328 million in PPP loans. Without those transactions, loans would have declined by approximately $700 million. With the uncertainty that we are looking at – with the uncertainty that we were looking at in March and April, it was prudent to take our foot off the accelerator and build liquidity to manage the challenge of this economic environment. As we get a better handle on our exposures to the pandemic economic impact, we will assess our growth opportunities. As the economy continues to stabilize, we will look for opportunities to grow our loans across all portfolios as opposed to our strategy in 2019 and the beginning of 2020, where we were more focused on business lending side. This is not a major strategy shift, but one that will be opportunistic based on current interest rates. It was a strong quarter for deposits as noninterest-bearing deposits increased $618 million or 25% for the quarter, of which $93 million was attributable to Gold Coast. Total deposits increased $1.3 billion or 7%, which – of which $490 million was from the Gold Coast acquisition. Our loan-to-deposit ratio declined from 117% to 110% for the quarter. Cost of deposits declined 46 basis points in the quarter, and there are still opportunities to decrease funding costs in the second half of this year, as $2.5 billion in time deposits are scheduled to mature with an average cost of 1.57%. With respect to capital, the company announced a cash dividend of $0.12 per share and has maintained its capital ratios across the board given the impact of the PPP loans. We believe we have sufficient capital, strong liquidity and a robust credit culture to maintain that dividend and to handle the uncertainty and economic storm that may be on the horizon. If we look at past calamities like Hurricane Sandy and the 2008 Great Recession, we have managed the turmoil and have been opportunistic. I believe with this management team and with the investments that we have made in our enterprise and credit risk management teams, investments in technology and product development, today, we are better prepared to serve our customers, which will result, hopefully, in stronger returns to our shareholders. Now I’d like to turn the discussion over to Sean Burke, our CFO, for more commentary on our results of operations for the quarter.
Sean Burke: Thank you, Kevin. Net interest margin increased 2 basis points to 2.73% quarter-over-quarter despite an elevated average cash position in the second quarter. We continued to benefit from previous Fed rate cuts and saw our cost of interest-bearing deposits declined 46 basis points during the quarter. Total loan balances increased $76 million quarter-over-quarter, inclusive of $453 million of loans from the acquisition of Gold Coast and $329 million of PPP loans. Deposits increased $1.3 billion or 7% quarter-over-quarter, with noninterest-bearing deposits up $618 million or 26% quarter-over-quarter. Total noninterest income totaled $10.1 million for the quarter, a decline of $4.5 million quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was driven by a $2.6 million MSR write-down, a $1 million reduction in swap income and lower loan and deposit fees as a result of COVID fee relief policies. Excluding $3.3 million of Gold Coast-related costs, expenses totaled $96.7 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of $5.8 million or 6% compared to the 3 months ended March 31. Our reported efficiency ratio improved to 52% from 55% in Q1, reflecting a modest increase in revenue and a decrease in noninterest expense. Provision for credit losses was $33.3 million for the 3 months ended June 30 compared to $31 million for the 3 months ended March 31. Both periods were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our CECL economic forecast scenarios for the second quarter included a double dip recession scenario where GDP and unemployment further deteriorate in Q4, and unemployment remains in double-digit territory for most of 2022. Asset quality, liquidity and capital were in a strong position at quarter end as we continue through this environment. Non-accrual loans represented 0.59% of total loans at June 30 compared to 0.46% at March 31, while our allowance for credit losses to loans stood at 1.37% at June 30. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 13% at June 30, exceeding the well-capitalized level by approximately $1.2 billion. Liquidity improved quarter-over-quarter as our loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 110% at quarter end, down from 117% in Q1. Finally, I would like to note that additional information on loan deferrals can be found in an 8-K that we filed last night. Now I’d like to turn it back over to Kevin for concluding remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Okay. Thanks, Sean. Our message at the bank is to be faithful and not fearful. We need to be a source of hope and optimism in our communities. All our branches are open at full-service at regular hours. At the height of the pandemic, we had 48 employee cases. And thank goodness, thank god, today, we do not have any. We are taking all precautions to protect our customers and employees. We have close to 50% of our corporate employees back to the office, and it’s very good for me to see them healthy and strong, willing to return and lead our communities back to some form of normalcy. I visited a branch yesterday and listened to their challenges during the height of this pandemic here in New Jersey. Our retail teams are engaged and excited to be working and more importantly, helping their customers and communities through this pandemic. The past 4 months have not been easy, but we have faced the challenge and continue to get stronger and more adaptable as we navigate the changes from these unprecedented events. If we get some stabilization in the macroeconomic climate, which will then impact our economic models, we can have a much stronger second half of 2020. We’ve been aggressive in calling on our loan customers, and have a war room type attitude to monitoring our credit exposures with great teamwork from our front-line loan officers and our credit risk team. This crisis is different from 2008’s Great Recession as the banking industry is stronger with better capital to sustain the economic downturn. Investors Bank is also stronger and better prepared for these events. And I am much more optimistic than I was in April when there was so much uncertainty. Our medical professionals and healthcare workers have been outstanding. And I’ve learned a lot about the treatment of this virus. And we are in a better position to monitor and treat this terrible pandemic. Our earnings per share is flat to last year after taking $36 million in additional provisions in the quarter. Our balance sheet and capital are strong, and we are well positioned to grow as the economy improves. Now, I’d like to turn it over to questions.
Operator: We’ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Hey, guys, good morning.
Kevin Cummings: Good morning.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Kevin, I really – I like your optimism. It’s good to hear. First question I had, you all saw a pretty good drop in deferrals this quarter. I’m just curious, was that borrowers genuinely willing or ready to start making payments again or did it necessitate a fair bit of nudging on your behalf to get them to sort of start making payments again?
Domenick Cama: Hey, Mark. It’s Domenick.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Hey, Domenick.
Domenick Cama: I think – yeah, I know, I think for the most part the customers were willing to come off the deferrals. But we did put a policy in place in which we made it a little bit tougher to get a second deferral. We asked for income/expense, P&L statements. We’ve looked at their debt service coverage. In some cases, in exchange for getting the second deferral, we would ask them to put up a cash reserve or even put a guarantee on loans. And so, as I said, for the most part, customers were willing to come off. But clearly, our second deferral policy is to be a little tougher and to scrutinize the deferral request a little bit more than we did the first time.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then at that same vein, how are rent payments, particularly on multifamily properties is going recently?
Domenick Cama: Yes. Mark, I think we’ve been open with this information. I mean, what we’re noticing is not too dissimilar to what we see in the rest of the market. In the multifamily space, I would say that average collections of rents are north of 85%. On the commercial real estate side, I would say that, that number is about 50%. But again, on multifamily, it’s been stronger than commercial real estate.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then, Sean, I’m curious, can you give us a sense for the timing of the excess liquidity deployment? Because I know that obviously is weighing on the margin a bit.
Sean Burke: Yeah, Mark, by quarter end, by June 30, you could see that our cash position had come down nicely from the average balance that you saw during the quarter. So to a large degree, it has come off already. And we’re expecting to kind of have that number, average cash balance in the $500 million range come the end of next quarter. And then by the end of the following quarter, we think we’ll be back to a normalized level from a cash position perspective.
Mark Fitzgibbon: And then, as you think about the margin for the back half of the year, excluding the benefit from PPP that will come in at some point, the core margin up maybe 5, 7 basis points a quarter, is that a reasonable expectation?
Kevin Cummings: Mark, I don’t know if I would completely agree with that. But what I would comment is, we are expecting our margin to be stable with a bias to slightly up through year-end.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Jared Shaw of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Kevin Cummings: Hey, Jared, are you on mute?
Operator: Mr. Shaw, are you there? Are you on mute?
Kevin Cummings: We can’t hear you. Hey, Nick, maybe we can go to the next caller and come back.
Operator: The next question is from Laurie Hunsicker of Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Laurie Hunsicker: Yeah, hi. Thanks, good morning.
Kevin Cummings: Good morning.
Sean Burke: Good morning.
Laurie Hunsicker: Just around your comments regarding the core margin for the back half of the year, are you including any PPP forgiveness in that? And then can you remind us what the fees on the $329 million are expected to be?
Sean Burke: So the answer is yes. But, Laurie, we only have $329 million of PPP loans. So it really is not that impactful on our margin as a whole. And I think our expectation is, around 75% of that PPP balance, we are expecting that to cure within a year’s period, and then the remainder 25% is going to come in over a 5-year period. So that averages to about a couple of years, at least that’s our assumption that we’re using when we do modeling for margin purposes. But again, Laurie, even if you kind of stripped it out with or without, it probably is very negligible, 1 or 2 basis points impact on the margin.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. And so, the PPP fees for that book, they’re around $10 million or do you have a better number?
Sean Burke: That fees were approximately $8 million. So that is the potential. I’ll say if they’re all paid off next week, it’d be $8 million of their interest revenue.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. That’s helpful. Okay. And then, for the back half of the year, how should we be thinking about expenses? I mean, Gold is closed. Are you thinking about any branch rationalization or any color you can give us there? Thanks.
Domenick Cama: Laurie, it’s Domenick. Yeah, we are looking at branch rationalization. Obviously, consumers and business customers have taken better hold of online and mobile banking services. So that’s giving us an opportunity to look at our branches to see where we may have some overlap. So, yeah, there’s some branch rationalization that we’re examining for 2020.
Kevin Cummings: Laurie, if we – we made a comment, we had a discussion last week, if we don’t change the way we do business as a result of this pandemic, we’ve wasted a lot of time, effort and sweat, tears over this last 5 months. So I think there’s going to be significant changes on the horizon as we move forward and customer behaviors change as a result of this pandemic. Luckily, we’re in a position where we made significant investments in our technology and our products. And over the last in 2018 and 2019 with a new Chief Marketing Officer, and that’s paying off for us in spades as we work through this situation.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. Okay. And then on to loan modifications, and I really appreciate all your detail. If we were just more high-level thinking about the $2.7 billion that you have as far as active deferrals as of June 30, what is that number looking like as we get closer to August 1 or September 1?
Domenick Cama: I think, Laurie, the way to think about it is just at a very high level. And Kevin gave the number at about $750 million. So what we’re expecting is, when this is all said and done, that we’ll have about $750 million in deferrals that we’ll be working with.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. And that obviously included the big chunk of the $230 million or so of hotels?
Domenick Cama: Absolutely.
Kevin Cummings: Yes.
Domenick Cama: Absolutely.
Laurie Hunsicker: Yes. So netting that out, it’s a really small number. And then, if you can just help us think about, because you’ve got your hotels and your food service combined, do you have a dollar balance on hotels and a dollar balance on restaurants? Or if not, I can follow-up…
Domenick Cama: It’s overwhelmingly in favor of the hotels. I mean, I think it’s – we don’t have an exact dollar amount, Laurie, but it is predominantly hotel.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. Okay.
Kevin Cummings: We can get back to you on that number. I think it’s – like in my mind, it’s like less than $50 million restaurant exposure, it’s much less than that. So we will get back to you offline on that.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. And then just one last quick question. Your $1.2 billion of office, do you have an LTV on that? Or I can follow up with you on that as well.
Sean Burke: We don’t have it right here, Laurie, but we can get back to you with that information.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay, thanks. I’ll leave it there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Collyn Gilbert, KBW. Please go ahead.
Collyn Gilbert: If I could start with expenses, so relative to what we were expecting and even in the second quarter, you guys saw a material drop in expenses this quarter. And I appreciate, Sean, kind of your comments and you too, Dom. But if we just think about this quarter’s expenses, I mean, it kind of run rates to like $395 million or something below. I think, Sean, what you had given is a $435 million guide for the full year of 2020. Can you just talk about kind of the movement there on the expense side? And what will come back maybe in the back half of the year and how that compares to your original OpEx guidance?
Sean Burke: Yeah, look, on the OpEx guide, we were high as it turns out. And I think the largest driver of that is just this pandemic. We just don’t have the type of expenses that we would normally experience when people are traveling and loan officers are out generating loans. And so, I think we’re benefiting from the lack of expenses on that side. As we look through the back half of the year, we don’t have anything, Collyn, necessarily planned. It’s going to meaningfully increase expenses from the base that we’re at now. So I think it’s safe to say that the guide that we’re providing at $435 million, that we’re not going to be at that number. We’re going to be south of that. I was thinking about something in the $410 million range is probably more reasonable level right now. I’d probably have a little bit of buffer in that, too, Collyn, just for some of the unknown as we go through the back half of the year, but nothing planned on the docket that’s going to throw off expenses in the back-half of the year meaningfully.
Collyn Gilbert: Okay. Okay. That’s helpful. And then, just in terms of your – you mentioned kind of the liquidity or the cash usage through the end of the year, Sean. Can you guys just tie that to what you think loan growth will be? And then, within that in terms of like your current loan pipeline and then what you’re seeing in terms of new loan origination yields? And then I have a follow-up to that as well.
Domenick Cama: Collyn, it’s some – we’ve just recently opened up our lending to a greater degree. We came into 2020 with a strategic plan intended to reduce residential and multifamily. And certainly, that’s happened and our pipelines were reduced coming into the first quarter. Then the pandemic hit. And I would say that we were more cautious on lending and so did not see a lot of loans closed during the March, April and May timeframe. As credit spreads started to widen, we recognized that we could put on residential and multifamily at a decent spread and which would be – which would contribute to net interest margin. And so those pipelines now have started to build and right now, we’re looking at a pipeline of about $2.4 billion, if you include $400 million for residential loans. So C&I is about an $800 million pipeline. CRE is about $1.2 billion in pipeline. And I know that’s a long-winded answer to tell you that I’m not really sure where loan growth is going to be. I mean, if I took PPP and I took Gold Coast off the table for a moment, the loan actually declined about $700 million. So I’m hoping that we could get that back and keep the balance sheet stable and neutral for the rest of this year. So having said that, that would mean that I would stay at around the $27 billion mark, as we head into the end of the year.
Collyn Gilbert: Okay. Okay. That’s helpful. And then just – so on that – and Sean, your comment on the NIM. I guess, I would be thinking that maybe that NIM would expand a little bit more than what you guys are indicating. Can you just talk about – so you had mentioned the tranche of CDs that are maturing and coming down? But where your sort of new CD rates are or kind of the fits and starts as to what you’re assuming on the funding side? And the composition of deposits is a big one, too, right, in terms of your outlook for noninterest bearing?
Domenick Cama: Yeah. The – Hey, Collyn, it’s Domenick. The – on the cost of deposits coming in now, I mean, we have a product out there, a money market account that’s tied to our core checking account that requires activities and certain number of online deposits and things like that. And that cost is at 75 basis points right now. That’s what we’re advertising. We have a 13-month product out there at 85 basis points and a 7-month product out there at 60 basis points. And quite honestly, just been talking about it the last few days, we see those numbers as being towards the higher end of the market. So we see that coming down somewhat. But I wanted to go back to Kevin’s comment about the maturing CDs. I mean, it’s significant. It’s close to $1 billion, $900 million. If you look at it through the end of the year with the weighted average cost of, let’s call it, 1.60-ish. And so that should help NIM coming into the third and fourth quarter. As far as our projections in being light on where that is, I mean, clearly, there’s a lot dependent on where NIM is going to go. These cash balances have been a burden on us. To the extent that we continue to shrink, it could mitigate any potential benefit. But on the loan side, I mean, we’re seeing rates between resi and C&I going anywhere from 3 3/8% to 3 5/8%. So that’s – so if you think about the incremental cost of funds here being somewhere around, let’s call it, 40 to 60 basis points, we’re looking at spreads north of 300 basis points, which will be additive to NIM as we head and go into the third and fourth quarter, obviously, offset by any cash balances that we continue to maintain.
Collyn Gilbert: Okay. That’s great color. Thanks for that, Dom. And then just one last question on mortgage banking. It was up nicely this quarter. I guess, just seeing a lot of the activity in the market here. Do you have a sense as to where you think you can take that business line either through just near-term activity and then just structural sort of how you see that building out longer term?
Domenick Cama: The – Collyn, our mortgage banking business, I mean, we just had a meeting on this, this morning. I mean, right now, our pipeline is about $400 million, and about 50% of it is slated to be sold to the agencies. It’s amazing to me. We looked at the pricing this morning and 2 7/8% 30-year mortgages can be sold to Fannie at a price of north of 3 points, which when you compare that to where we’ve been historically, let’s say, over the last 18 months, I mean, that spread has – was about 1.5. So it’s gone from 1.5 to north of 3 over an 18-month period, and the coupons have come down to 2 7/8%. To answer your question in terms of where could this go for us, it’s hard to say. I mean, we’re just trying to – we’re not out there actively having a mortgage banking business. We’re just trying to manage our own customer base and generate some commissions for our loan officers. So it’s not the type of thing that we’re going to build up or make any significant investment in. We’re just kind of reaping the rewards of the current interest rate environment and the impact it’s having on mortgage banking.
Collyn Gilbert: Okay. That’s great. That’s super helpful. I will leave it there. Thanks everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Matthew Breese, Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.
Matthew Breese: I appreciate all the detail on the commercial book in terms of deferrals, very encouraging. Could you just talk about deferral trends or expectations for the residential portfolio? And are the cure rates as strong there?
Domenick Cama: So Matt, that’s a very good point. It’s something that we’ve looked at. Actually, it’s not as strong on the residential side as it has been on the commercial side. So on the residential side, we had approximately $600 million of loans that were deferred. And when we look at those that were coming due in July, that totaled approximately $352 million. Of the $352 million, 34% have cured, right. So that’s about $140 million. And 65% have asked for a second deferral. So you can see on the resi side, it’s not as strong as it has been on the commercial side.
Matthew Breese: Is the process for issuing additional consumer or residential deferrals as strenuous as it is for commercial customers?
Domenick Cama: It is not as strenuous. What’s happening there, Matt, is we are trying to follow the Fannie guidelines on that. And Fannie’s guidelines don’t push customers to provide the type or the level of detail that we can on the commercial side. So we’re a little hamstrung. Even though these loans are in our portfolio, and I guess, technically, we don’t have to abide by the Fannie guidelines. But I think not abiding by Fannie guidelines would probably hurt us just from a reputation perspective.
Matthew Breese: Understood. Okay. And then considering the overall deferral comments and trends, and certainly, there’s more positive body language and tone this quarter. Can you just talk about reserve adequacy and the outlook for the provision? And whether you think what we’ve seen these last 2 quarters is what you expect for the back half of the year? Should we expect a reduction in the level of provision?
Kevin Cummings: Well, Matt, some of my commentary on the macroeconomics. You deal with the model now. And it’s a little difficult to forecast that future based on the inputs that may be changing over the next couple of months. We got asked by our regulators in a meeting the other day, and it could be down to $15 million and up to $50 million in the course of that range. It’s a truck – you can drive truck to the range, and to give guidance on that, in things that really are not in our control based on the life of the loan and the new CECL mandates, it’s very, very difficult to forecast. But I think where we are, I think we feel very comfortable with our reserve today.
Matthew Breese: Okay. And then my last one is just bigger picture. The last few years, we’ve seen the bank really push towards C&I and more relationship-driven banking. But in times of stress, we’ve heard you talk about adding to the residential and multifamily portfolio. Has everything that’s happened given you any sort of – have you contemplated maybe a more balanced approach and going back to the multifamily resi business and a little less on C&I. Has that – any of that changed?
Domenick Cama: I don’t think so, Matt. I think we continue to – I think we run a well-diversified portfolio. I mean when you look at the ratios of multifamily loans, they’ve come down. I mean, we have – at $7.5 billion on multifamily, $5 billion on resi, $3.5 billion on C&I and about $5 billion on CRE. So that’s a pretty balanced book, I think. I mean, from the C&I perspective, we’re going to continue to try to grow that business. I mean because it’s not only the C&I loan that you put on your balance sheet. It’s also the deposit that comes with it, it’s the cash management fees that come with it. And quite frankly, when we compare our returns nationwide to banks in our peer group, and we see banks who are performing better than we are, again, pre-COVID, the one – the 2 pieces of data that are different in those banks versus our bank is that they have a greater percentage of their loan portfolio in C&I, and they have a greater percentage of their deposits in noninterest-bearing deposits. And so when I look at those 2 factors, they pretty clearly tell me that we can have a better return on equity and a better return on assets if we shift the strategy a little bit here, despite the fact that we’re here in the Northeast.
Matthew Breese: Yeah. Understood. That’s all I had. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Next question comes from Jared Shaw, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jared Shaw: Yes. I’ll try this again. Can you hear me?
Domenick Cama: Hey, Jared. There you are.
Kevin Cummings: There you are.
Jared Shaw: Thanks. So I guess I just wanted to circle back on the loan growth discussion with the headwind of looking at that core sort of number down $700 million this quarter in the pipeline you guys talked about. Are we thinking – how should we be thinking about the magnitude of loan growth from here? I mean, is it trying to recover that $700 million by the end of the year? Or is that too much, I guess, to think of over the next few quarters with the headwind on the smaller PPP balances?
Domenick Cama: Yeah. I think that’s a fair assessment of where we want to be. If we can recover that $700 million, I think we would all feel pretty good about it.
Jared Shaw: Okay. And then circling, I guess, back with that provision – with that growth is the backdrop for the provision. If we don’t see any change in the economic models, then – I mean, would that – I guess that would mathematically lead to a significantly lower provision in third and fourth quarter without economic deterioration, without outsized loan growth?
Domenick Cama: Jared, again, I’d just go back to Kevin’s response earlier. I mean, it’s just so difficult to try to determine even to sit here and presume that there’s a better economy and loan growth. It’s just so hard to say. I mean, the CECL process is completely driven by the use of models that are forecasting the economy. And for us to sit here, try to determine what our provision is, is difficult. And I know it’s difficult for you, because you need to run your models and try to come up with some forecast, but it’s just hard for us to say.
Jared Shaw: Got it. I guess with the model, are you using the Moody’s baseline? It seems like the way you were discussing it, maybe it seemed like there’s a little more of an adverse economic scenario than the straight-line baseline that you’re assuming?
Domenick Cama: Yeah. So we’re using a combination of the 3 of them, the 3 models, and we are assigning weights to the specific scenario. So we have weights assigned to the S3 version of Moody’s, S1 and what...
Kevin Cummings: And baseline.
Domenick Cama: And baseline.
Jared Shaw: Okay.
Kevin Cummings: Jared, we’re in a unique situation here, because we’re in a real world without the CARES Act and the change in treating non-paying customers. We would have significant TDRs, troubled debt restructurings, and non-accruals. And it’s amazing that the general market conditions in the stock market, things don’t really take that into account. It’s going to be something like I said earlier, it’s going to be some difficult discussions once this second deferral period ends up, and we might be dealing with, say, anywhere from $300 million to $400 million of loans that might not come off with that hotel group. So we’re already talking with them and working on plans post second deferral. And we’re hopefully going to be in a better position, because we’re proactively reaching out to the customers and tell them, it’s going to be a while before people go into New York City to go to a flight, it’d be a while before people are traveling the way we were pre-pandemic. So when you put all those things together, there’s still some uncertainty, but I think we’re making the best of a tough situation.
Jared Shaw: Yeah. That’s great color. I guess, actually, just one quick – on the $230 million of those 2 relationships you mentioned, how many properties are incorporated in those – in that balance?
Kevin Cummings: 8. Yeah, each have 4. Each have 4 locations in New York City.
Jared Shaw: Great. Thanks. I appreciate the color.
Operator: Next question comes from Steven Duong, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Steven Duong: Hi, good morning, guys.
Domenick Cama: Good morning.
Kevin Cummings: Hi, Steve.
Steven Duong: Hey. Just on your footprint, are there any pockets that’s showing more stress than your other areas?
Domenick Cama: Stress from what perspective?
Steven Duong: I guess – from – I guess, from a credit perspective, just more unusual as opposed to like what you’re seeing generally?
Domenick Cama: And from a geographic perspective?
Steven Duong: Yeah. Yeah.
Domenick Cama: I can’t say that there’s one particular area that has been impacted more than the other. It feels less geographic and more asset class. And I think you could see that, Steve, in our 8-K, right, where you see the deferrals really focused on office and shopping centers, retail CRE and then also the accommodation in hotels, motels. So I think it’s more by industry than it is by geography.
Steven Duong: Got it. And then just a last one for me. Your treasury management team, are you guys still looking – are they still out trying to win business? And just how are they doing? How successful has it been?
Domenick Cama: The treasury management team?
Steven Duong: Your products, you know...
Domenick Cama: Yeah. I mean, we’re not out there aggressively trying to win business. Obviously, we have a significant cash position right now. I think what they are trying to do is make sure that current customer base is taken care of, and it’s in line with the market and our own cost of funds is. But I wouldn’t say that we’re out there aggressively trying to bring deposits in at least on the wholesale side, which is where the treasury management team would be most involved.
Kevin Cummings: Well, anecdotally, Steve, I’ve been out on some calls, a college up in New England, up in Massachusetts, 2 very large not-for-profits, where we won, on one of those not-for-profits we had the business. And we’ve taken out one of the national banks, and the cash management procedures and the deposits are a big part of that product offering to that particular customer, and it’s a sizable loan line of credit of $8 million. And the other 2 situation, one’s a $32 million loan, and the other one is a $40 million loan. And it’s really, we won the business, but it’s a pricing issue on whether we can get to a reasonable return for us dealing with swaps and things like that. So I think the business we’re out there. Our guys – we recently hired 5 significant well-experienced loan officers. We’ve also continued to build out that business development team that we talked about on previous calls. Both these groups were so helpful in that PPP process, I mean. And we’ve gotten through that with a lot of more experienced bankers. And that’s why we’re encouraging people to get back. We have 50% of our staff back in the corporate offices. And getting back to normalcy is really what we’re striving to do to generate more core deposits. And that gets back to that strategy question before. Like I said, we don’t want to change our strategy but we’re certainly going to be optimistic and take advantage of situations where like multifamily and residential, good credit products are available to us at average yield. And we’re also looking at this opportunity to move out some of our funding for the use of cash flow swaps, and that’s been – we’ve been opportunistic using some of those tools to lock down some of our funding and become less liability-sensitive as we anticipate rates going up and not going down any further with the Fed position and our position to negative rates.
Steven Duong: Got it. I appreciate the color. Thank you, guys.
Kevin Cummings: Thank you.
Operator: Next question is a follow-up from Collyn Gilbert of KBW. Please go ahead.
Collyn Gilbert: Hi guys, just a really quick housekeeping question. Sean, on the merger charges, do you have where – how those broke out in the quarter within each segment?
Sean Burke: I can get you the breakout, Collyn. But it’s primarily 2 categories. One is data processing. So termination, there’s some cost on the Fiserv side, and then also professional fees, banker fee, legal fees. I actually think that’s the bulk, but I can get back to you, Collyn, on the breakout.
Collyn Gilbert: Okay. Okay. That’s great. All right, thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. Now, I’d like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Okay. Thanks, Nick. First of all, I’d like to thank you for your participation today. This may sound strange, but the past 5 months have been an adrenaline rush for me as our Executive Team, as it is – every day has been an adventure. The days are long, but the weeks fly by, and I’m very proud to be working with our leadership team at the bank and the great team of employees who have stepped up to help various not-for-profits, our customers and just generally people in need. As the famous quote states, adversity and crisis do not build character, they reveal it. And character is the first of our core values, 4Cs: Character, Commitment, Cooperation and Community. And these values and the core values of this country will carry us through this crisis. I know it may look dark with all the disagreements in the world and in Washington, but we need to be faithful and not fearful, hopeful and optimistic. We need to stay healthy and help each other through this time. I want you all to please stay healthy and follow CDC guidelines. So it’s good to say, wear a mask and stay away from crowds.
Sean Burke: And wash your hands.
Kevin Cummings: And wash your hands, right. Let’s pray for each other and inspire each other in our daily work and look for magical moments to help each other to be the very best version of ourselves during this crisis as we make this journey together. And always remember, the journey is the destination. Thanks, again, for your participation today. I look forward to the day that we can be out on the road visiting with some of you. Enjoy your summer. Enjoy the baseball season, the basketball and hockey seasons. They’re starting tonight and have started over the past week. It’s another step back to normalcy and let’s continue to pray for a cure to this dreadful virus. Be strong, be safe and God bless. Have a great day and thank you very much for your participation.
Operator: Conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp First Quarter Earnings Call. Today all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's event is being recorded. We will begin this morning's call with the company's standard forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp, Inc., may make some forward-looking statements with respect to its financial position, results of operations and business. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Investor Bancorp's control, are difficult to predict and which can cause actual results to materially differ from those expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. In last night's press release, the company included its Safe Harbor disclosure and refers you to that statement. This document is incorporated into this presentation. For a more complete discussion of the certain risks and uncertainties affecting Investors Bancorp, please see the section entitled Risk Factors, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations set forth in Investor Bancorp's filings with the SEC. Today, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Cummings, Chairman and CEO of Investors Bancorp.
Kevin Cummings: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp first quarter earnings conference call. Last night, the company reported in its press release net income of $39.5 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 versus $48.7 million or $0.19 per share for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and $48.2 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31 last year. But I must say that the historical results have less meaning in today's environment as we deal with the economic uncertainty and much more serious issues of health and safety as we manage through this unprecedented pandemic. Right now, our priority is protecting everyone's health and well-being: our employees, customers, vendors and the communities where we work. Our pandemic crisis management team meets daily and includes the entire executive management team, plus key members of credit, operational, compliance and cyber risk management, where we discuss issues and topics ranging from employee health issues and technology to capital and liquidity management. We are focused on operating with a strong liquidity position as we are maintaining an above-average cash balance at quarter end. We continue to maintain a robust capitalization by limiting balance sheet growth and foregoing share buy backs. Excess capital and liquidity plus a fortress balance sheet will serve us well through these uncertain times. Credit topics include asset quality, portfolio analysis and adherence to and revisions to credit policies to meet the current environment. It should be noted that our loan portfolio's past performance has been very strong, and we are well-positioned entering this cycle. Our net charge offs over the past three years have averaged just 4 basis points and 5 basis points over the last 5 years. Our loan portfolio has a lower risk profile compared to our peers as almost 60% of our loans are in the residential space in the multifamily and residential mortgages portfolio. Total net charge offs for the multifamily and mortgage loan portfolios for the 5 years ended 12/31/19, were less than $1 million in total and $22 million for the residential portfolio, respectively. In the first quarter of this year, net charge off totaled $615,000 for these two portfolios. Our average LTVs at year end were approximately 60% for the residential and multifamily portfolios and 55% for the CRE and consumer portfolios. Our weighted average debt service coverage ratio for the multi portfolio, excluding co-op loans, was 1.38x and 1.61x for the CRE portfolio. Our FICO scores for the residential and consumer loan portfolios was 749 and 731, respectively at year-end. Credit quality has been our focus and will continue to be our strength as we move through the crisis. We hope for the best but are prepared for the storm and have placed little reliance on any of the economic predictions that we hear in the news or from the co-experts. No one knows where this crisis will go and we will continue to be diligent in our management by being prudent in our judgments and adhering to our core values and serving our customers and communities as a good corporate citizen. All banking services remain available to our customers in the retail network as branches remain open with drive-thru and ATMs and by appointment in the branches. Our digital channels allow customers to transact remotely and our call center has been staffed up to ensure that we are able to assist our customers in a timely manner. Last week, our average wait time at the call center was two minutes and was as low as 25 seconds. And our call drop rate was as low as 2% over the past week with a daily average under 10%. We have waived the number of consumer fees for up to 90 days and that includes but are not limited to ATM monthly maintenance and overdraft fees. Additionally, we are allowing our customers to defer mortgage payments for up to 90 days due to the financial hardships caused by this crisis. We have deferred monthly mortgage payments for approximately 1,600 customers with a total balance of $648 million with an average balance of $400,000. On the commercial side, we've been proactive in reaching out to our customers to help them through this crisis. Our C&I portfolio has deferments on 299 loans for a total balance of $580 million or 19%. Total impact on cash flow was approximately $18 million over the 90-day period. For the multifamily portfolio, deferments totaled $1.2 billion on 227 loans for an average loan of $5.3 million and the CRE portfolio had deferments totaling $1.3 billion on 305 loans with an average balance of $4.3 million. The total payment deferments amounts were $12 million and $20 million for the multi and CRE portfolios over the 90-day deferment period. At year end, for the multifamily and CRE customers with deferments, the average debt service coverage was 1.69x and 1.47x respectively. For the CRE and multifamily, the average LTV on deferred loans was approximately 53% for both portfolios. We have been active working with the public, not-for-profit space and the private sectors to meet the needs of our customers and our community. Overall, banks through this crisis have played a significant role to act as a conduit between the government and our customers. In an unprecedented role, banks have stepped into provide the process and the manpower to disperse billions of relief to small businesses throughout New Jersey and throughout the country. Government could not get this done alone, but it is a public-private partnership to help businesses in need. And I certainly hope that this program, although not perfect, does not come back to haunt the industry when the time passes and people on the sidelines in Washington question the decisions made in the heat of this battle. Investors Bank, without an SBA platform was able to build a digital platform working with the fintech partners and it was and it certainly was not an easy process. It was a difficult time and probably not our finest hour, but the team worked diligently and was able to execute with the SBA, satisfying our entire pipeline with current SBA approvals of approximately $335 million for 1,850 customers. We were very prudent in our expectations here as we did not want to over promise or under deliver with our customers. Investors Bank and the industry as a whole has worked around the clock to assist the Treasury and the SBA in providing relief to small businesses throughout the country. It was our civic duty to get this done, and I'm very proud of our perseverance and grit and the personal sacrifices of our teams made to support our customers. It has not been easy, but like the fear experienced during the initial outbreak of this pandemic in the New York metropolitan area, we have overcome many obstacles in the workplace, including technology challenges, working from home and caring for the families of the employees and friends who were lost to this coronavirus. We are at the epicenter of this crisis and we have the team to manage through these many problems. From the very beginning, we stepped up our cleaning protocols in the branches and corporate locations as per the CDC guidelines. Since early March, all employees have been dispersed and are either working from home or in other ISBC locations, including key operating functions such as wires, treasury, call center and executive management with the majority of our back office employees working from home. Those employees who remain on-site are practicing social distancing with limited in-person meetings and travel. Health benefits have been expanded for our employees through the employee assistance program, the waiving of co-pays and all telemedicine visits. Through all this calamity, we were able to close our acquisition of Gold Coast Bank on April 3, adding seven branches to our Long Island franchise with $488 million in deposits and $453 million in loans. Our legal team did an outstanding job working with the bankers and Gold Coast CEO, John Tsunis and his management team to close this deal when others may have postponed or walked away from the transaction. I'd like to thank our GC, Brian Doran, Chief Technology Officer, Chris Blotto and Facilities Director, Joe Valente, by getting this deal closed, completing the systems conversion in the weekend and changing the interior and exterior signages to the Investors Bank brand all on a weekend through difficult circumstances to say the least. We wish to welcome the Gold Coast customers and employees to the Investors family. And as part of this transaction and in consultation with its Chairman, John Tsunis, we made $100,000 donation to the Stony Brook University Hospital to assist their workers as the hospital built 1,000-bed temporary mesh-like hospital on the football field of the university. We've been very busy supporting the healthcare workers and the not-for-profits in our community. Early on in March, we allocated to the retail branches and their staff $150,000 budget to invest in the community with meals for elderly customers who may be homebound, donation to food pantries, purchase of air purification machines for the New York Hospital, gift cards for medical workers and many other acts of kindness and hope in a time of uncertainty and despair. Our foundation has made disbursements of $820,000 to food banks, health providers, youth services, homeless shelters, housing and supporting the underserved in our communities. We have made grants for economic support of small businesses of $125,000. The bank and foundation have also added additional funding to local charities, foundations and the community of $190,000 to support local not-for-profits and retail and small businesses in need during this crisis. In this time of uncertainty, it is time for the private sector to support our communities and show the country the generosity of the banking industry as the heart of capitalism in our society. Coming into this pandemic, we think we have a strong balance sheet, excess liquidity and stellar credit quality and are well positioned to weather this storm. We have strong liquidity at our parent company. And at the Board meeting this week, a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share was approved, payable in May. Based on today's forecast, we believe we are well-positioned to maintain this dividend going forward. We had great momentum coming off a strong fourth quarter and executing the Blue Harbour transaction at year end. January and February were probably the best two months for their earnings in the history of the company as we earned before the March Fed cuts $38.6 million for the two months ended February 29. We are in another world, though today as we navigate this pandemic and look forward to getting back to some sense of normalcy. With respect to credit quality, our loan loss reserve increased to $243 million, which is 1.14% of total loans at March 31. Our provision was $31.2 million for the quarter, which includes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. I estimate that approximately $24 million to $26 million of this provision is related to this economic and health crisis. Our non-accrual loans totaled $98 million, down from last year at March 31 by 17%, but up slightly from year end by $3 million. The increase from year end is due to one business loan for $5 million, which matured in December 2019 and has not been renewed. At this time, we believe we are well collateralized and no loss is expected. Our allowance for loan losses coverage ratio to non-accrual loans is 248%, up from 200% at this time last year. During the quarter, we had one significant charge-off of $8 million on a loan in our leveraged lending portfolio, which was not meeting its cash flow projections and was in a sales process with an investment banker that failed due to the pandemic crisis. This portfolio totals $264 million with 23 borrowers at March 31, with one borrower over $20 million. Three loans are currently in the deferral process, with two making their first quarter interest payment and one making a partial interest payment. Our 30-day delinquencies were up in the multifamily portfolio by $12.3 million, and the three largest loans for approximately $45 million have made their March payments. In the CRE portfolio, the increase relates to one loan for $20 million to a significant investor that has over $20 million invested in a Manhattan property. We are monitoring all these loans closely considering the economic environment. Total deposits increased $324 million for the quarter as the cost of deposits decreased 20 basis points as we reacted quickly to the pandemic by increasing our liquidity, by increasing cash and due from banks by $500 million at quarter end. Capital liquidity and reserves are key factors as we navigate through this crisis. As rates have come down, we felt it prudent to invest in building our liquidity reserves at the expense of some earnings to be better prepared for the uncertain future. As I said earlier, we are preparing for the worst but hoping for the best. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sean, our CFO, who will give some additional color on our operating results for the quarter. Sean?
Sean Burke: Thank you, Kevin. Earnings before income taxes and provision for credit losses were $85.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, an increase of $3 million or 4% compared to the prior quarter and an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. While net loan balances decreased quarter-over-quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased $104.2 million or 3.5% quarter-over-quarter. Net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 2.71% quarter-over-quarter with majority of the increase occurring on a core basis. We continue to benefit from Fed rate cuts and saw our cost of interest bearing deposits declined 20 basis points to 1.39% from the fourth quarter. Total non-interest income totaled $14.7 million for the quarter, a decline of $5.8 million quarter-over-quarter. We recorded elevated swap and equipment finance fees in the fourth quarter and saw both return to more normalized levels in the first quarter. Expenses totaled $102.6 million for the three months ended March 31, a decrease of $4.3 million or 4% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2019. The efficiency ratio improved to 54.6% from 56.5% in Q4, reflecting a modest increase in revenue and a slight decrease in non-interest expense. We adopted CECL on January 1, 2020. Upon adoption, the company recorded an increase in allowance for credit losses of $11.7 million. Provision for credit losses was $31.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time we closed the books in early April, our forecast scenarios included a second quarter GDP decline of up to nearly 25% and unemployment up to 13% and a U-shape recovery. Given the uncertainty on how the pandemic will unfold generally makes projecting provision difficult. That being said, our provision in the second quarter will be driven in large part by the expected duration and severity of the pandemic. Asset quality, liquidity and capital were in a strong position at quarter end as we headed into this pandemic. Non-accrual loans represented 0.46% of total loans at March 31 compared to 0.44% at December 31, while our allowance for credit losses to loans stood at 1.22% at March 31. Our Common Equity Tier one ratio was 13.1% at quarter end, exceeding the well-capitalized level by approximately $1.3 billion. In addition, all of our regulatory ratios were meaningfully above well-capitalized levels at quarter end. Liquidity is robust and improved quarter-over-quarter. Our loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 117% at quarter end, down from 122% at year end and our access to borrowing facilities and other liquidity sources totaled over $9 billion at March 31. The unprecedented environment makes it difficult to provide formal guidance at this time. As such, we are withdrawing our previous provided earnings guidance. That said, at a high level, we expect our margin to continue to benefit from declining deposit costs in the near term and the loan growth will remain muted given the economic backdrop and our focus on profitability, but could change based on business conditions. Expenses generally are expected to be in line with previous guidance. Finally, we will be providing some additional details on deferrals and loan balances by industry type, referenced by Kevin today, in our 8-K that gets filed with our press release. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Kevin for concluding remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Okay, Sean. Thank you. Our message is to be faithful and not fearful. We need to be a source of hope and optimism in the community and continue to live by our core values by being a good corporate citizen and making a difference in a time of uncertainty. We are here for our customers. We are partnering with both the not-for-profit sector and the government sectors to help our communities. We have had our challenges, but as of today, we have executed on the task and the projects that this pandemic has created. Working from home, communications with both employees and customers, technology changes and enhancements, cybersecurity, the Gold Coast acquisition, commercial and mortgage loan deferrals, building a platform for the SBA program and leading our teams during a period of uncertainty and fear all have come with unique problems and adjustments. The bank has accomplished these things because of the hard work and leadership of our executives. At times, it may seem overwhelming, but we are getting it done. We will work continue to work together and encourage, now inspire our teams to reach into the depth of their souls to get through this crisis and clear those obstacles in front of us. We do not plan to survive, but we will strive through this crisis and rise to be the best that we can be. The bank will be a source of inspiration during these times because it is through inspiration and encouragement that brings great execution, success and peace in your life. Our communities and customers need us now more than ever. We will continue to step up and face these challenges. Our leaders continue to inspire each other to our greatest moments, knowing that we are giving our best and leaving all our energy on the field. It is a war out there and we will not be victims of this virus, but we will be victors. Now I'd like to turn the call over to some questions. Thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.
Mark Fitzgibbon: So I wondered, first, if it would be possible to give us a little bit of detail on the size of things like your hotel, restaurant and retail portfolios.
DomenickCama: Okay. Yes, Mark, I can help you there. Our accommodation and food business is about 2% of total loans, about $387 million. That's the largest concentration that we have there. Arts, entertainment and recreation about $66 million combined between C&I and CRE. And a real the big number, obviously, is in retail, given our commercial real estate portfolio. That's $1.885 billion, making up about 9% of the portfolio. So those are the biggest concentrations we have. As Sean said, we'll be filing along with the press release and our 8-K a more detailed description of these numbers.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then as you look at your portfolio in its entirety, I know everything is under pressure, but what is it that you're most concerned about? What which segments of the portfolio or borrower types that have you most concerned?
DomenickCama: I mean obviously in the C&I space, that obviously has a lot of concern. Less concern in the multifamily space, I mean, given the fact that that's an $8 billion portfolio and our resi portfolio is about $5 billion, a little less concern there. On the CRE space, obviously, with the shopping centers, that also poses some concern. We feel pretty good, though, that just given where we operate and given the strength of some of our borrowers and some of the loans and Kevin cited the LTVs and the debt service coverage ratios, although those debt service coverage ratios don't mean much right now, that when as we go and trend and go through this pandemic and as things start to transition back to more normal state. We feel that those portfolios, the CRE, multi-family and resi portfolios, will behave well. Again, there's some doubt on the C&I portfolio, but given some of our exposures there, we also we feel pretty good there. We happen to have Rich Spengler, who's our Chief Lending Officer, on the phone and he may be able to add a little bit more color. Rich?
RichSpengler: Yes, Dom. Look, I think you pretty much covered it. I think we're looking at predominantly our retail, the commercial real estate and depending upon the duration and when this actually comes back, it seems like that's where there's been the most noise as far as tenant sending in letters and refusing to pay and talking about what time they will actually start making payments again after the pandemic is lifted.
Mark Fitzgibbon: And then, I guess, I was curious on commercial line utilization rates. Have you seen much of an up tick there thus far?
Domenick Cama: Have not, actually. We were monitoring that very closely, as you may imagine. And we had a little up tick in it and then it flattened out. So the unused lines haven't been a concern to us.
Mark Fitzgibbon: And then, lastly, I heard what you said about provisioning guidance being really difficult given the uncertainties in the environment. Obviously, it's even harder from our perspective to model that out, but as you think about it, say, for the second quarter, would your presumption be that we'd probably see a provision that's somewhat less than what we saw in the first quarter?
Domenick Cama: Sean, why don't you take that?
Sean Burke: Yes, Mark. I know what you're hinting at, but it really is hard to predict. I mean things change daily. And I certainly understand where you're going there. And it certainly feels like things are getting better. But I think we'd be a little reluctant to really venture out saying that in absolute terms., so for now, the environment changes. I think it's safe to say if things improve and the economic environment improves, I think your statement will hold true. If things deteriorate in some way, then we could be looking at elevated provisions. So we'll go the way the economy goes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris O'Connell with KBW.
Chris O'Connell: Filling in for Collyn. I guess if we could start out with the NIM. You guys had great NIM movement this quarter and good movement on the interest-bearing deposits downward. CDs are still fairly high at 1.88% in terms of the cost. Could you maybe give a look into what CD rates are coming on today and also where borrowings could reprice, given that they're still fairly elevated as well at 2.09% cost?
Domenick Cama: Yes, Chris. On the CD pricing, we're seeing new CDs come on at a top rate of 1.05% in using a 13-month maturity and 1% in a 7-month maturity. So those are our highest rates these days. I mean we have some programs that require checking accounts that will allow you, if you bring $0.5 million into bringing 1.25. But let's call the highest rates of 1.05% in the CD space. So I mean, those CDs, that 1.88% is obviously elevated because of the fact that rates were so high going through most of 2019. And as rates come down, those CDs will start to reprice more quickly. I think more reflective of our cost of deposits is our government deposit portfolio, which is about $5 billion. So let's call it, $4.5 billion and tied directly to Fed funds. And we've seen those rates come down by about 100 basis points, most of which we'll recognize the benefit of in the second quarter because the first rate cut happened on March 3. We took that right away. And the second rate cut, which occurred on March 15, we decided to wait until April 1. So I think you'll start to see that CD bucket come down. You'll start to see it. You start to see that CD bucket come down, but more importantly, that government deposit bucket has already come down significantly.
ChrisO'Connell: Got it. And so as we look into the 2Q NIM, I mean, is it fair to say given that government deposit bucket combined with what presumably will be a decent drop in borrowings in CDs that we could see double-digit NIM increase next quarter?
Domenick Cama: I'll let Sean, why don't you handle that?
Sean Burke: I wouldn't go so far as to say double-digit, but certainly, we are expecting to see some NIM expansion next quarter driven by lower deposit costs, lower borrowing costs.
Chris O'Connell: Got it. And I know you guys are kind of backing away from numerical guidance. But as we look into the back half of the year, is it also fair to say that we should see kind of consistent NIM improvement, obviously, 2Q will be fairly material given the government deposit move. But let's say, rates hold in general and loan spreads hold where they are. Is that a fair statement to say for the back half of 2020?
Sean Burke: Yes. There's a lot of moving pieces there. But if we held everything else constant, that's going on, which is kind of a bold statement. But if everything else was constant and we saw borrowings costs are coming down and deposit costs continuing to come down in the lower environment. Yes, that should translate into improved NIM throughout the year. But things are moving around all over the place and it's really hard to predict. So that's why we're backing off a bit going too far out trying to make projections.
Chris O'Connell: Got it. And along the same line, I mean, obviously, liquidity cash built up a ton this quarter. I guess is there a plan or a tentative plan to for how long that might stay on the books?
Domenick Cama: Yes. I think, Chris, along those lines, we have a number of maturities happening in the second quarter and we'll lay some of that off there. We're going to hold on to the cash for a little while to see how our government deposit portfolio behaves during the second quarter. The government deposit bucket runs in cycles, and we just want to make sure that it continues to run in the similar cycle that it has in the past. So we're going to be cautious holding on to the balances, but we recognize that we have a lot of excess cash on the balance sheet and we'll be prudent about how we work it off during the second quarter.
Chris O'Connell: Got it. And then just one last one. On the buyback, I know it's kind of in limbo right now or suspended just given the current environment. What I guess, you guys are still kind of lying above, I guess, what your target TCE ratio longer term. When would you feel comfortable or what would drive you to get back involved with the share repurchases?
Domenick Cama: Chris, interesting. Sean and I did a conference early in March and it was up and this is before we knew the world was blowing up and a lot of questions about the repurchases. And I just want to remind you that we did a big repurchase in the fourth quarter of 2019 when we bought back over $300 million of Blue Harbour stock. And while the stock price came down and it seemed beneficial to start buying it back, we're dealing, as I said that day a number of times with a number of constituents, right? I mean we have our regulators to deal with. We have our concentration ratios to deal with. And when you buy back $300 million in of stock in one fell swoop, I think it's time to put it on pause and say, "Hey, let's see how this goes". As it turned out, it was a good move, not buying any stock back in the first quarter, as we felt it was prudent to shore up capital and make sure capital remained in a strong position. And so I'm going to say also, like Sean said to an earlier question, it's who knows what's going on out there. So I don't see buy backs happening in the foreseeable future, all things being equal as the environment exists today.
Kevin Cummings: Yes. I think our number 1 concern is to protect the dividend moving forward. And buy backs are going to take a backseat. We've always managed capital on a 4-pronged approach; M&A, organic growth, buybacks and dividends. And it's always been our prudent approach of balancing those things, using them when available. I know the stock price is down, but it's certainly not a time in the foreseeable future to jump into that part of the strategy to manage our capital.
Operator: The next question comes from Laurie Hunsicker with Compass Point. Please proceed.
Laurie Hunsicker: I wanted to go back to and I appreciate all the details that you've given, really, really helpful. I wanted to go back to the hotel and restaurant exposure of $387 million. How much of that is CRE versus C&I? And then what's the LTV on the CRE piece, if you have it?
Domenick Cama: On the C&I piece, it's about $280 million and the CRE piece about $109 million. I don't have the LTV, but I think they're pretty low.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. And then you have the breakout of...
Domenick Cama: Just one other point, Laurie, I just want to be clear on this. On the C&I front, the $280 million, recognize that those loans are secured by the properties in New York City. So while they're not technically classified and while they are under CRE, we made the loans based on the cash flow of the buildings, but the collateral is real estate. So we feel we're pretty well collateralized in those loans.
Laurie Hunsicker: Got it. And then do you have the breakout of what hotel versus restaurants?
Domenick Cama: I don't. We don't have that. The way we've broken this out is accommodation and food service together, but I'm going to say that the majority of it is in the hotel business.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Okay. And then same question on the arts and entertainment, the $66 million, is that primarily C&I or is there any CRE there?
Domenick Cama: That's primarily C&I. It's about -- it's $47 million on C&I and $19 million on CRE.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. Great. And then same question on, go ahead.
Domenick Cama: On the accommodation, our hotel and food service, $278 million is C&I, $109 million is CRE.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. That's great. And then same question on the retail exposure, the $1.9 billion. Is what percentage or what dollar amount is C&I versus CRE?
Domenick Cama: $90 million C&I.
Kevin Cummings: And $1.8 billion, $1.795 billion CRE.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. Great. And you don't happen to have the LTV on that, do you?
Kevin Cummings: Well, we gave the in my remarks, we gave the overall CRE on the deferments. And I believe it was about 55%. I'll check it, okay?
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. 55%. Okay, great. And then just on that $1.9 billion, is there any mall exposure in there?
Domenick Cama: Rich, do you have an answer to that?
Rich Spengler: It's predominantly retail shopping not interior malls, more just exterior community-type shopping centers.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. So sort of more retail service. Is that a fair statement?
Rich Spengler: Yes. Exterior anchored supermarkets, big boxes, not large interior malls.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay, great. And then, do you have and if you don't have this, I'll follow-up with you afterwards, but do you have any dollar amount on exposure in healthcare, education or transportation, any of those three categories?
Domenick Cama: We do. Laurie, we can answer the question now, but it will be included in the 8-K.
Laurie Hunsicker: It will. Okay. I'll wait for that. That's helpful.
Domenick Cama: Yes. The healthcare and social assistance is about $600 million, $650 million and education, about $80 million. And the LTV on CRE deferments is approximately 53%.
Laurie Hunsicker: 53%. Okay, great. And then I just wanted to go, Kevin, I'm so sorry, I think I must have missed part of this. When you were going through the lower-risk portfolios, the single-family, multifamily and home equity, the LTVs on those three buckets are what again?
Kevin Cummings: Okay. One second.
Laurie Hunsicker: And while you're looking that up, I go ahead.
Domenick Cama: $1.1 billion was, I think, also 53%.
Kevin Cummings: Yes.
Domenick Cama: It was approximately 60%, I believe. We didn't give it on the deferments. It's approximately our average LTVs at year end were approximately 60% for the residential and multifamily portfolios and overall 55% for the CRE and consumer portfolios.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay, great. And then just super quick question. Swap fee income I know was down this quarter. What do you have a dollar number on that?
Domenick Cama: On the swap fee income?
Sean Burke: Yes. Laurie, it's Sean. We're down -- I'm going to look it up, but I think it was down $2.9 million, Laurie, quarter-over-quarter. So the fourth quarter had some elevated swap-throughs this quarter a little bit lighter than what we normally expect. So a little bit on the light end, but the fourth quarter had some elevation in terms of what was in there.
Domenick Cama: $2.2 million.
Laurie Hunsicker: $2.2 million?
Domenick Cama: Difference, yes.
Sean Burke: Difference.
Laurie Hunsicker: Perfect. I'll leave it there. Thank you so much for all the details.
Domenick Cama: Laurie, I'm sorry, it's $2.8 million.
Operator: The next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities.
Jared Shaw: So there are not too many questions left, but on the could you give us a spot rate on deposits at 3/31?
Domenick Cama: What does that mean, Jared, spot rate?
Jared Shaw: Not the average rate for the quarter, just where cost of deposits were at March 31.
Sean Burke: Jared, I don't have the spot rate, but I can tell you the month of March. So at least for interest bearing deposits, the cost of interest bearing deposits for the month of March was 1.29%.
Jared Shaw: Okay, great. And then we get the impact from government funds that hit in April 1 and 2 that would help bring that down. Can you give a little update on the multifamily line? What you're seeing as loans come to the end of the fixed period, are you seeing sort of continuous renewals or renewals continuing to happen and what's the rate on those renewals now on the multifamily product?
Domenick Cama: Rich, why don't you handle that?
Rich Spengler: Yes. We're still seeing activity on people looking to refi when they're getting to the end of that fixed period. There's is a good chunk of the current pipeline that we are seeing. We've enhanced some underwriting relative to how we underwrite those deals at this time. But I would say that's probably the busiest part of the marketplace is the refi of loans that are maturing or loans that are rolling as well as anyone that was involved in 1031. Those are probably the two biggest drivers of that marketplace. And 5-year paper is probably somewhere right around that 4% or just below right now today.
Jared Shaw: Okay. And then are you taking on new customers in that line or are you just refing the existing relationships?
RichSpengler: I would say the bulk of the work is done with existing relationships, but we're still looking at new customers. The majority is all existing.
Jared Shaw: Okay. And then on the broader CRE portfolio, how is the paydown and payoff activity trending since sort of the back end of the quarter? And should we expect to see that slow down as we go in the second and third quarter?
Domenick Cama: Customers are still paying off their loans. We did see a couple of big payoffs, Jared, in the back end of the first quarter. I think it will slow down as we get through the second quarter just because there are not a lot of new deals happening. As Rich said, most of the deals that are happening are loans that are up to maturity or guys that need to put their money to work in a 1031 exchange. But we don't see a lot of activity in the purchase market. So we expect that, that will slow down, although, as I said, we did see some big payoffs toward the end of March.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Okay. Thanks, Chris. I'd like to thank you for your participation today. When I think about the past two months, I am grateful for the leadership team that I work with and all the employees at the bank. Through great hardship and personal sacrifice, they've done a great job. They continue to amaze me, and I'm humble to leave them with Dom and the executive team. As Churchill once said, "Fear is a reaction, and courage is a decision." Our message is to be faithful and not fearful. We need to be a source of hope and optimism in our communities and continue to live our core values by being a good corporate citizen and making a difference in a time of great stress and uncertainty. Please stay healthy out there. Be careful, and follow the CDC guidelines. Let's pray for each other and inspire each other that we can all be safe and the very best versions of ourselves during this crisis as we make the journey together. I want to thank you again for participating today, and please be careful, and I look forward to the day that we can be out on the road visiting with all of you soon. Have a great day, stay healthy and be strong. Talk to you soon. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. We will begin this morning’s call with the company’s standard forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp, Inc. may make some forward-looking statements with respect to its financial position, results of operations and business. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Investors Bancorp’s control, are difficult to predict and which can cause actual results to materially differ from those expressed or forecasted in these forward-looking statements. In last night’s press release, the company included its Safe Harbor disclosure and refers you to that statement. That document is incorporated into this presentation. For a more complete discussion of the certain risks and uncertainties affecting Investors Bancorp, please see the sections entitled Risk Factors, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Result of Operations set forth in Investors Bancorp’s filings with the SEC. Now I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Cummings, Chairman and CEO of Investors Bancorp. Please go ahead.
Kevin Cummings: Thanks, Sara, and good morning. Welcome to Investors Bancorp fourth quarter earnings conference call. Last night, the company reported in its press release net income of $48.7 million, or $0.19 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 versus $52 million, or $0.20 diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and $33.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share for three months ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net income totaled $195.5 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, compared to $202.6 million, or 72% – $0.72 per diluted share for the year ending December 31, 2018. Included in the fourth quarter is $7.8 million of additional tax expense, resulting from the revaluation of the company’s deferred tax assets related to the state of New Jersey’s clarification in December to existing tax law. In addition, there were minor adjustments to severance costs, which we took in the third quarter of an additional $245,000 in expense recorded this quarter. As a result of these items, core earnings for the fourth quarter were $56.8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share. As reported last quarter, core earnings for the quarter ended September 30 were $55.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, which reflected the impact of the Delaware litigation settlement and severance costs relating to the reorganization of responsibilities in our retail branch system. The company also announced yesterday a cash dividend of $0.12 per share, representing a 9% increase from the prior quarter and reflects an annual yield of 4.1% based on yesterday’s closing price. Since our second step in 2014, our quarterly dividend has increased from $0.04 in September of that year to $0.12 today. In addition, in December, the company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Blue Harbour Group and repurchased 27.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $12.29 for a total cost of $335 million. As part of this transaction, our Director, Peter Collins, stepped down as a Director effective with the completion of the transaction. We would like to thank Peter for his hard work and advice during his tenure with us. I would also like to mention the CEO of Blue Harbour, Cliff Robbins, who was also involved on many times and whose input and advice was always appreciated. We wish the two of them and Blue Harbour the best in their future investment activities. As reduction – as a result of a reduction in funding costs, our net interest margin improved for the quarter by 8 basis points from 2.53% to 2.61%. Our margin has improved 16 basis points from the second quarter, which is primarily due to reduction in interest expense. Out net interest revenue increased $2.8 million for the quarter, or 1.7%, and our non-interest revenue increased $5.7 million to a gain in equipment finance business, cash management and deposit fees and interest rate swaps recorded in the period. Overall, pre-tax income of $80.9 million is an 11% increase from the third quarter of 2019. On another note, our pre-tax pre-provision for loan losses income for the quarter was $82.4 million, which reflects the 17% increase from third quarter. Overall, it was a good finish to the year, where we executed on the things that we had to do with respect to operating expenses, investment in technologies such as Salesforce and nCino and improvement in our digital and treasury cash management products. Yesterday, in two separate meetings, I met with our new business development team, where we have hired 29 Business Development Officers to focus on driving low-cost deposits into the bank. During the quarter, deposits grew $188 million, of which $39 million was non-interest earnings. This team spent the day with other leaders from the retail, financial advisory and lending to coordinate our plans for 2020, but more importantly, to execute on those plans. There was good energy in the room. And the one topic I’d like to highlight was the discussion that we had in detail over our partnership with ODX, a small business loan origination fintech, where we are partnering with to originate small business loans to help generate business deposits. To date, we have originated a small number of loans during the testing phase, but have reduced the approval time to originate and book the loan from two hours to 40 minutes. So in theory, using an iPad, walking into our branch, you can get a small business loan on the books ready to be drawn on in 40 minutes. This tool will help our retail teams to focus on a small business segment and provide a key product that the business owners can use to meet their cash management needs. I also met yesterday with our financial advisory group, which had a very good year in 2019 and continues to work with our retail teams under the leadership of Rich Koll, who recently assumed responsibility for this group in 2019, our revenues increased from $7.4 million in 2019 and in 2018 to $8.3 million this year. With our commercial lendings doing a good job providing products, such as interest rate swaps and cash management services, our non-interest revenue increased to $20.5 million for the quarter ended December. The competition for deposits continues to be fierce in our markets, but we continue to evolve and improve our products and people to meet this challenge. At times, we are impatient with the results, but 2020 is a new decade and we are optimistic that we can drive deposits into the bank to fund our growth in business lending. During the quarter, our C&I loans increased $270 million, or 10% to $3 billion, and our CRE loans increased $59 million, or 1.2%. The CRE portfolio was impacted by a large payoff in the quarter of approximately $50 million, and this was a participation that totaled $120 million in total outstanding. The loan activity continues to follow our plan of allocating proceeds from the residential portfolio and the multi-family portfolio into higher-yielding assets in the CRE and commercial business originations. And this will reduce the pressure on our cost of funding with respect to deposits and borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Asset quality remained stable for the quarter. We saw an increase in the 30-day bucket in the multi-family loans to $45.6 million. All but one loan for $233,000 has made payments reducing its delinquency status of this date. There was one loan for $37 million that the borrower is looking to sell the property that we – that has been a habitual late payer, and we are monitoring this situation, but don’t expect any significant loss. Our reserve to total loans remained flat at 1.05%, which compares favorably to our peers when you take into account the $13.5 billion of our portfolio was 62% is in residential, multi-family and consumer loans, which historically have a lower credit loss history than other types of lending. During the quarter, we had charge-offs of $1.4 million versus charge-offs of $1.5 million in the third quarter. And our provision for the quarter was $1.5 million versus a provision credit of $2.5 million in the third quarter. This is the last quarter of FASB 5 for the calculation of the allowance for loan losses under generally accepted accounting principles. As we move into the implementation of CECL, effective January 1, we are confident and we are far along in our transition to this new accounting principle and we don’t expect a material adjustments at this time. With respect to our Gold Coast acquisition, we are waiting for regulatory approval and expect it to come any day. We spent a day last week with their retail and business teams, preparing the teams for client and customer transition. The acquisition, we’re looking forward to closing shortly and we will enhance our markets in Nassau and Suffolk County. Overall, the last-half of 2019 was a very busy and productive time here at Investors Bank. We have made significant progress in improving our products. We have made progress in expense control and continuing our investment in technology and our transition of our asset mix to a more profitable growth at the margin. We feel we’re well-positioned to have a great 2020. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Sean Burke, our CFO.
Sean Burke: Thank you, Kevin. Net interest margin was 2.61%, an increase of 8 basis points from the prior quarter on both a reported and a core basis. Interest-bearing deposit cost decreased 18 basis points from the prior quarter, which drove the net interest margin improvement. Non-interest income totaled $20.5 million for the quarter, an increase of $5.7 million from the prior quarter. Our customer swap program continues to exceed expectations and was a bright spot this year, generating approximately $7.5 million in fees. Non-interest expenses totaled $106.8 million for the quarter, a decrease of $1.9 million from the prior quarter. On a core basis, expenses were up slightly from the third quarter due to an overdraft loss and expenses related to our customer swap program. Our tax rate was elevated in the quarter to the tune of $7.8 million, due to a tax law clarification made by the State of New Jersey on how to treat investment company and REIT income on a combined basis. While the change will serve to lower our tax rate going forward, it caused the value of our deferred tax asset to decline in the fourth quarter. Finally, I’d like to share some high-level guidance for 2020, inclusive of our pending acquisition of Gold Coast Bank. We are targeting low single-digit loan growth, but expect the continued remixing of our portfolio out of single-family of residential and multi-family into higher-yielding commercial and industrial loans. Deposits are targeted to grow by low to mid single digits, with emphasis on non and low interest-bearing checking products. Net interest margin guidance is in the 2.65% area for the full-year 2020, assuming no rate cuts or hikes. Non-interest income is estimated in the $60 million range and expenses in the $435 million range. We expect our effective tax rates to be in the 27.5% area. Now I’d like to turn it back over to Kevin for concluding remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Thanks, Sean. Last year this time, we had just gone through nine rate hikes from the Fed. Although we are a little bit troubled by the recent rally and the 10-year bond and the inversion of the yield curve, we are in a much better spot today than a year ago. We are disciplined in our deposit pricing, we’re disciplined in our loan pricing, and we are focused on improving our fee income and business lending to diversify our revenue streams. We are working hard to drive profitable business into the bank at the margin. We are focused on improving our return on equity, the Blue Harbour transaction will certainly help us in that regard, and we look forward to 2020. The activities, among our retail lending and advisory groups, are strong. They live in our core values and we’re getting great cooperation and teamwork and this will pay dividends in the year to come. We have good momentum going into 2020. I want to thank all our teams for all their hard work and dedication to the success of this bank. We thank you, our shareholders for your support. And now, I’d like to open the call to questions. Thank you very much.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mark Fitzgibbon with Sandler O’Neill and Partners. Please go ahead.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Good afternoon. First question is related to capital. I wondered if you could share with us what your target capital ratio is now that it’s sort of getting down closer to a more leverage position? And also, whether it’s likely that we’ll see some additional buyback activity in 2020?
Sean Burke: We target a tangible common to tangible asset ratio in the 8.5% to 9% area, Mark. And we aren’t anticipating or budgeting any share repurchases in for this year, as the repurchase of Blue Harbour really accelerated our plans for 2020 on the repurchase front.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then you guys obviously had good commercial growth this quarter. Could you perhaps size for us the commercial loan pipeline today and what the average rate looks like?
Domenick Cama: Hey, Mark, good morning. It’s – the pipeline for C&I specifically is about $700 million. And on the CRE front, it’s about $600 million.
Mark Fitzgibbon: And what sort of rates, Dom, are those?
Domenick Cama: On the $700 million, we have a WACC of about $470 million. And on the CRE, it’s about $390.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then lastly, I wondered if you could sort of share with us any updated thoughts on the M&A environment. And I’m curious, you’re seeing more books or less books these days more activity out there on the horizon?
Domenick Cama: Yes. I mean, there’s certainly a pickup in activity, Mark. We are seeing a number of books. Of course, we, in an effort to, ensure that we are protecting tangible book and not introducing too much dilution into our stock price. And we are very careful about who we look at and what transactions we get involved in. Now, as you know, we trade at a level that’s below 1.20% of tangible book, so it really doesn’t give us a strong currency to use in this environment. But certainly, we’re always looking.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom [sic] [Collyn] Gilbert with KBW. Please go ahead.
Christopher O’Connell: Hi, this is Chris O’Connell filling in for Collyn. I just wanted to circle back real quick on Mark’s question regarding the buyback activity. I understand, you guys obviously did a big chunk here with the Blue Harbour transaction in the fourth quarter. But with TC above your target today and with the outlook for low single-digit loan growth. And admittedly, you guys mentioned, the – not a strong currency as some peers. I guess, what’s the thought process on not planning to utilize it at all during the next year?
Domenick Cama: I don’t – and just going back to some of the things Sean said, I mean, obviously, we accelerated the buybacks that we had planned for the year with the purchase of Blue Harbour shares. But there are a couple of things. Obviously, you have a cycle that is impending, so we want to be a little – we want to be judicious about the way we manage capital. I’ll never say never on the buybacks, obviously. We’ll always be there to support the stock in the event that there’s some significant price decline. But clearly, taking a $300 million of capital out of the balance sheet in one full swoop, it’s got to be a concern for anyone and as we manage the environment, we just want to make sure that we continue to remain well-capitalized and be able to absorb any potential impact from commercial real estate declines or economic declines in the market. But clearly, we want to continue to provide value to shareholders by efficiently managing capital.
Christopher O’Connell: Understood.
Kevin Cummings: Yes, Tom, we deal with a lot of constituents, regulators being one of them, too. And I think it was a big transaction and we’re digesting it and then moving forward, and we will continue to evaluate our actions, increasing dividends, stock buybacks, reasonable acquisitions and organic growth. Again, we still want to grow the bank, but we want to do it profitably. And we’re trying to do things prudently here using all the levers that are available to us, and we believe all four levers are available to us, but we’re not going to do anything, that doesn’t enhance shareholder value.
Christopher O’Connell: Got it. Thank you. And then just looking into deposit rates. Can you go through what some of your current offering rates are versus maybe what’s on the books and where you have the most room to drive improvement over the course of the year?
Domenick Cama: We’re offering a short-term CD product at 1.80%, I believe a seven-month CD. We do have an offering online also at either 1.75% or 1.80%. But the real benefits, I think, will come from our wholesale program. We have, in the first quarter, about $1 billion that is coming due and we expect to see a pickup of somewhere about on a conservative basis between 30 to 40 basis points. We also have about $350 million dollars in CDs that are coming due. And there, we expect a pick up of somewhere between 50 to 60 basis points. So, there’s clearly some room to improve funding costs, and that’ll translate to a better NIM for the first quarter of 2020. I don’t think we’ll have the pace at which the cost of funds got better between third and fourth quarter. But clearly, we still have some room to continue to improve NIM on funding costs. And then, obviously, offsetting that is, as Kevin mentioned, this latest routing and the 10-year treasury has really put a damper on loan rates. And so this inversion in the yield curve could offset some of that benefit.
Christopher O’Connell: Great. Thank you. And then just finishing up, if you could discuss maybe the dynamics between the multi-family book and what is sort of the yields that are coming off the balance sheet through the remixing? And to the extent that your refinancing or putting on some multi-family as well, what those rates are that you’re onboarding?
Domenick Cama: Yes. I mean, if I look at the month of December, we funded multi-family like around the 3.5 – in the 3.5 range. And if I look at what the average yield is on the multi-family book, it’s about 3.80%. So, there’s a little bit of a decline there. On the commercial real estate book, the average yield is about four or five, something like that, and it’s coming on at about 3.75%. So, a little bit of pressure there also. The bright spot really is C&I. We continue to get good C&I growth. What we funded in December came on and they have something to do with structure and the deals we did, but came on at about 4.75. And the average yield on the portfolio is about 4.50%. So we have a little bit of diversion there in terms of higher yields coming on in the C&I space versus what the average yield is in the portfolio.
Christopher O’Connell: Great. That’s all I had. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Duong with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Steven Duong: Hey, good morning, guys.
Kevin Cummings: Good morning.
Steven Duong: So just going back on the loan yields, they held up pretty well this quarter. I’m assuming it’s because of the C&I that you just mentioned in the remixing. And so is it safe to assume that that’s not going to continue for the remainder of the year?
Domenick Cama: No. We intend to continue to remix the balance sheet such that resi and multi-family portfolio should decline and well make up the difference with CRE and C&I. The multi-family book and the resi book are a little bit bigger. So some of the amortization that comes off that portfolio could outstrip the new production that we put on. But for the most part, we’re trying to, as I think Sean said earlier, keep the balance sheet flat to plus single-digit growth. Yes, but there should be continued remixing in the balance sheet.
Steven Duong: Yep, got it. And then I noticed your interest-bearing checking costs had a good drop this quarter. Could you just give some color on that?
Domenick Cama: Yes. We have a government portfolio here. We have about $4.5 billion in government deposits that have tied to Fed funds. So, the reduction in rates in the fourth quarter led to immediate declines in the cost of funds related to commercial to checking, with most of those accounts are in checking products.
Steven Duong: Got it. Okay. And then just to reiterate, you don’t – as of right now, you don’t expect a material impact from CECL on day one and I assume similarly on day two as well?
Domenick Cama: We don’t.
Steven Duong: Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thank you, guys.
Kevin Cummings: All right.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurie Hunsicker with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Laurie Havener Hunsicker: Yes. Hi, thanks. Good morning.
Kevin Cummings: Good morning.
Laurie Havener Hunsicker: Just going back to your muni deposits, $4.5 billion, do you have a cost on those for the quarter?
Sean Burke: About $1.5 billion.
Laurie Havener Hunsicker: $1.5 billion. Okay, that’s helpful. And then also, within the non-interest income line, do you have the actual dollar amount of what was swap income? And maybe if you have it versus last quarter as well?
Sean Burke: For the fourth quarter, Laurie, it was $3.8 million.
Laurie Havener Hunsicker: Okay. $3.8 million?
Sean Burke: $3.8 million and then the second quarter was $2.4 million.
Laurie Havener Hunsicker: $2.4 million ?
Kevin Cummings: Third quarter.
Sean Burke: Third quarter.
Kevin Cummings: Yes.
Sean Burke: Thank you, Kevin. Third quarter.
Laurie Havener Hunsicker: Right, third quarter. Yes.
Sean Burke: And for the year, we had $7.5 million.
Laurie Havener Hunsicker: Thank you. And then just going back to CECL, how should we be thinking about your day two, your ongoing loan loss provisioning?
Sean Burke: Well, I think the previous caller asked the question, Laurie. And I think, Domenick summarized it quite nicely. We’re really not expecting of meaningful change on day one or day two. We…
Laurie Havener Hunsicker: Okay.
Sean Burke: …we have looked at the Street consensus for the year on the provision front that’s out there, and that appears reasonable to us, Laurie.
Laurie Havener Hunsicker: Okay. I mean, the Street consensus is pretty wide on loan loss provisioning. I don’t know, if you could help us think about it a little bit further, as we look on a relative basis, obviously, your credit is very, very pristine, but there’s a big delta between, obviously, what you did this year?
Sean Burke: Yes. To be more specifically, Laurie – I mean, more specifically, Laurie, I was referring to the consensus mean or median estimate, which I believe is around $14 million for 2020, and I was referencing that, that appears reasonable for us.
Laurie Havener Hunsicker: Got it. Okay. That’s super helpful. And then I just also wanted to go back on buyback, and I love seeing, obviously, what you did in the fourth quarter. But can you just update us in terms of how much money is currently sitting at the holding company available for buybacks and dividends? And then just also what is your current authorization as it stands today?
Sean Burke: At the holding company-level, we target to hold cash anywhere from $150 million to $200 million, Laurie, and that’s where we are.
Laurie Havener Hunsicker: Okay.
Sean Burke: And that money up there is obviously for share repurchase, but also to fund our dividends as well.
Laurie Havener Hunsicker: Okay.
Sean Burke: In terms of share repurchase authorization, it’s about $15 million. $15 million is authorized and would be available for us to purchase.
Laurie Havener Hunsicker: Okay. And then great. Last question, Kevin is we’ve seen a lot MOEs in the last year, how do you approach that as you think about forward looking? How do you approach the idea of MOE? How do you think about that? Thanks.
Domenick Cama: Well, oh, how do we approach the idea of an MOE? Yes, I think, carefully, when you look at what color there’s been a around the other transactions that were done specifically, when reading about the CenterState, South State transaction, that deal was two years in the making. And it took an understanding of the cultures of the institution and the management teams and a lot of things had to fall in the right place – fall into the right place in order for that transaction to be successful. As we think about it, it’s certainly compelling theory for us also. We think, if anything to enhance shareholder value is a good thing. And obviously, looking at potential MOEs is a lot easier said than done, right? I mean, there are a lot of things that you have to take into consideration, but we – clearly, we have an open mind as to the benefits that those transactions have, even versus going out and buying another bank. And you can look at this stock price performance of the acquiring institution with – when they buy smaller banks. And it’s not good, these MOEs, the stock price reaction has been somewhat better. So, yes, we have an open mind and it’s something we would consider, but it’s easier said than done.
Kevin Cummings: Yes. Laurie, in a recent conversation with a banker, we looked at different things, different strategic options. And, of course, they’re in here all the time speaking with us. And you look at an MOE, different execution risk and things of that nature. You look at an acquisition of us buying a smaller bank upside. And then even staying alone and just driving the performance of the company through organic growth and managing the cost line and all those good things. And basically, you evaluate them and how do we enhance shareholder value. And the question I have what gets me to $15 a year over the next 24 months, 36 months and executing on those three options. And that’s the type of things we’re constantly looking at. And I think we’ll do what we feel is the safest way to get to that goal and of driving shareholder value.
Laurie Havener Hunsicker: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brody Preston with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.
Brody Preston: Good morning, everyone. How are you?
Kevin Cummings: Good morning, Brody.
Brody Preston: Just wanted to quickly touch based on the expenses. Sorry, if I missed it at all. But just wanted to see if there are any potential opportunities, excluding the Gold Coast cost savings to maybe extract some incremental operating leverage and take some costs out from here?
Sean Burke: We’re always evaluating opportunities to take out cost. I think, the guidance we gave for the year was – it’s important to note, if you take out the cost from Gold Coast that we’re relatively flat and we’re projecting relatively flat expense growth for us as a standalone organization year-over-year. And we’ll continue to look for opportunities, whether that’s the branch network, the efficiency of our processes that we have internally here. We’re also very focused as you can see in some of the results that we had on the fee income line. There are a lot of efforts that were involved or that went into that. And it wasn’t just one line item. I know the swap program was a big part of that. But we’re continuing to look for ways to enhance value both on the fee line and on the expense line item.
Brody Preston: Okay, great. And then on some of those fee income items, particularly on the equipment finance portion again there, do you expect that to be recurring or a portion of that to be recurring? Just trying to get a sense for fee income?
Sean Burke: It’s hard to predict that, because it is lumpy when it comes in. We did have a small gain last year, it was around $1 million, this year, it’s around $2.6 million. I would have a hard time budgeting that in, quite honestly. I do consider it operating earnings, but the timing of it is, it’s hard to predict.
Domenick Cama: It was a lumpy gain when I looked at the gains in the portfolio over the last six months. This one was clearly much bigger than the prior six-month period.
Brody Preston: Okay. And then early-stage bucket, the increase in multi-family, you noted that, I guess, maybe the borrower was a bit of a habitual late payer. Is there – there’s nothing else I guess within the portfolio that’s happened, and I guess is impacting the rest of the portfolio from a change in the rent regulations?
Kevin Cummings: No, I think we talked about that pretty – I didn’t want to rehash what we talked about in the third quarter. So if you look at the third quarter commentary, I think, we beat it up pretty good and we haven’t seen anything at this point in time. So I kind of didn’t want to repeat the information that was provided in the third quarter. In fact, I think, our exposure, we were talking about maybe, it was around $1 billion, it’s probably around $800 million to the stabilized apartments.
Brody Preston: Okay. It was $1 billion last quarter and now it’s $800 million?
Sean Burke: No, I think that was an estimate at that point in time and even with it. We continue to monitor it and watch it and – in further analysis. It’s slower than we had really disclosed earlier in the year.
Brody Preston: Okay. All right. And the last one for me, I guess, sort of stepping back a little bit, I think, last quarter, you had talked about getting to 10% RTC by the year-end 2021. Just sort of considering…
Sean Burke: Fourth quarter.
Brody Preston: …yes, fourth quarter. Just considering, the – I guess, maybe slightly higher capital than I had – than we had originally expected just with no buybacks budgeted for 2020. Can you sort of just help us…
Sean Burke: Slightly higher capital you said?
Brody Preston: Yes, without any buybacks?
Sean Burke: So we have the Blue Harbour transaction now.
Brody Preston: Yes. Yes, I mean, that was in our model and I’m saying stripping out sort of the buybacks that, maybe we had expected for 2020 capital be slightly higher. So just sort of thinking about some of the puts and takes in getting to that 10% RTC. Can you help us sort of think about what it takes to get to that level?
Sean Burke: Well, I think, first of all, when you put the Blue Harbour transaction in, I think, look, we can show ROE getting closer to 8.7%, 8.6%, 8.7%. But I think what would be the catalyst is the continued remixing of the loan portfolio and bringing in more high-yielding C&I loans. Any help from the Fed, I mean, we sat with the Treasurer – our Treasurer the other day, who talked about that there’s starting to be some noise about perhaps another Fed cut in the mid – middle of the year about 50% probability. So, continuing to manage the portfolio in a way that as, to use Kevin’s term, to do more profitable business, not growth for the sake of growth, we think, will help get us to that 10% level in the latter part of 2020 – 2021.
Brody Preston: All right, great. And then, if I could, just real quick. The margin guidance, is that on a headline basis, or is that core?
Sean Burke: That’s on a headline reported basis.
Brody Preston: Okay. Thank you very much, everyone. I appreciate it.
Sean Burke: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Timur Braziler: Hi, good morning. This is Timur Braziler filling in for Jared.
Kevin Cummings: Hi, Timur.
Timur Braziler: Hi, guys. Just want to ask the fee income question a different way. I guess, if you look at fourth quarter and you annualize that and then dropping that down to your $60 million full-year guidance, I guess, what’s the expectation of the line items that you’re expecting to see a reduction in 2020?
Sean Burke: Number one, the item on the equipment finance portfolio, that totaled $2.6 million No, I’m not necessarily budging that in when we provided the guidance. This – we’re not expecting that. Also, we had some gains on loan sales that could be repeated next year, but being cautious about projecting that to happen. So, it was really the combination of those couple of items there.
Kevin Cummings: To counter that though, we are seeing some strong change in the focus of our mortgage company, where the mix of Fannie Mae versus what we take into portfolio, we’ve been doing a better job in the second-half of the year, and hopefully that will continue in 2020. But that give and takes on both sides as we move forward, but we’re being conservative. We’re not counting our eggs before they hatch.
Sean Burke: The last point I would make in terms of the fee income is, we do have a couple of items that are in fee income now that are a little bit more difficult to predict quarter-to-quarter. So I have more comfort in the number that we provided for full-year of $60 million, and we could see some variation from quarter-to-quarter there, and you’re seeing some of that in the fourth quarter. So, we are self-admitting either to the fact that we are not going to have a $20 million fee income run rate every quarter going into 2020.
Timur Braziler: Okay, understood. But the momentum you’re – you’ve achieved in the back-end of the year for customer swaps that’s expected to continue and grow?
Sean Burke: Yes. But swaps also are a little lumpier in nature. And so we do expect overall income to grow from that program year-over-year. But even this year, we saw some lumpiness to when it comes in quarter-to-quarter.
Timur Braziler: Okay, that’s helpful.
Sean Burke: And it’s certainly a focus of our business lending teams. Now they’re becoming very proficient in cross-selling different products, both on the cash management side. It’s an emphasis of the company to drive non-interest income into the bank.
Timur Braziler: Okay, that’s helpful. And then just looking again at that $37 million credit that crept into the 30-day to 59-day bucket. How long has that borrower been trying to sell the property?
Kevin Cummings: I’m not sure, but it’s certainly come up probably in the last six weeks.
Timur Braziler: Okay.
Sean Burke: I believe the building is in the process of being sold right now and has a pretty substantial valuation relative to our loan amount.
Timur Braziler: Okay. And then just lastly, for me looking at the 10% return on tangible guide relative to the balance sheet remixing, is the implication that the balance sheet remixing should be largely complete by the end of 2021, or is that a longer-term…?
Sean Burke: It’s a longer-term. Yes, the balance sheet remixing is longer-term. We have $8 billion of multi-family assets on the balance sheet and $3 billion of C&I. So it’s a longer-term proposition.
Timur Braziler: Okay. So as that further continues the implication, would that mean…
Kevin Cummings: We continue to enhance return on equity and drive core deposits into the bank. The real goal is to be more relationship-focused. Multifamily is transactional. It served us well. It’s an excellent portfolio. It has served us very well in our transitions. When we started here, we didn’t have a commercial real estate group back in 2004, 2005. And that multi-family group and the team that has – and Joe Orefice and his team have done a great job in our transition. You can’t keep doing the same that you did to get you to where you are today and in the future. You have to continue to evolve and diversify the revenue streams and become less liability sensitive.
Timur Braziler: Great. Thanks, guys. Nice quarter.
Kevin Cummings: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Cummings for any closing remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Okay, thank you. And as we wrap up 2019, I’m – we’re very, very satisfied with the last two quarters. We have good momentum going into 2020. We expect 2020 to be a good year. We have a company with strong capital, a strong credit culture and an overall great culture of serving our customers. And more importantly, with all the discussion on with the Business Roundtable and stakeholders, we do an excellent job in our communities. We’re out there being leaders who serve and really making a difference in the communities that we serve and creating a great culture here. Our employees come to work every day with a passion for what they do. And I want to thank them for their efforts, and I thank all of you on this call for your time today. One thing I’d like to tell everyone to enjoy the Super Bowl, and I’ll give you my prediction, Kansas City by six points, go, Andy Reid. All right, everyone, have a good weekend. Enjoy the Super Bowl.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. We’ll begin this morning’s call with the company’s standard forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp, Inc. may make some forward-looking statements with respect to its financial position, results of operations and business. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Investors Bancorp’s control, are difficult to predict and which can cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. In last night’s press release, the company included its safe harbor disclosure and refers you to that statement. That document is incorporated into this presentation. For a more complete discussion of the certain risks and uncertainties affecting Investors Bancorp, please see the sections entitled Risk Factors, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Result of Operations set forth in Investors Bancorp’s filings with the SEC. Please note, this event is being recorded. And now I’d like to turn the call over to Kevin Cummings, Chairman and CEO of Investors Bancorp. Please go ahead.
Kevin Cummings: Thanks, Gary, and good morning and welcome to the Investors Bancorp third quarter earnings conference call. Last night, the company reported in its press release, net income of $52 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. This was versus $46.6 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and $54 million or $0.19 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2018. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, net income totaled $146.8 million or $0.55 per share compared to $169 million or $0.59 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. During the third quarter of 2019, we had $1.3 million of compensation expenses related to employee severance as we continue to redefine responsibilities in our branch system, and a $2 million charge related to the settlement of our shareholder litigation. Also included in that litigation settlement was a negative adjustment to our deferred tax assets for $1.3 million, which flowed through our tax provision for the quarter. As a result of these items, core earnings were $55.6 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Our net interest margin improved for the quarter by six basis points, from 2.47% to 2.53%, which reflects the impact of the July Fed cuts. During the quarter, we also closed down an interest rate swap put on the books of August of 2018 for $1 billion which gave us some insurance at that time for future anticipated interest rate increases. With the two rate cuts already in place and a third anticipated in the near future or in the fourth quarter, that decision will have a positive impact on our margin as we move into the fourth quarter of this year. Last year on this call for the third quarter, we indicated that our net interest margin forecast was a headwind. Today, with the September rate cut already in place and the potential for another this year, I would say that, that interest forecast currently is a tailwind for the bank. Either way, we will continue to leverage our capital and continue to diversify our loan portfolio. During the quarter, we grew C&I loans and construction loans $135 million while CRE and multifamily decreased approximately $287 million. With the yield curve flat to inverted during the period, we’ve decided to slow down our multifamily and CRE lending and focus on higher-yielding business lending. This lending drives a 50 basis points to 75 basis point improvement in yield and is more profitable at the margin. With all the noise related to New York multifamily regulation and the latter stages of the credit cycle, we believe that this is a good strategy to reduce our growth in CRE and multifamily, especially after the robust growth that we’ve experienced in the last five years. With respect to the recent changes in the New York City rental regulations, there appears to be a market reduction in market activity for New York multifamily relative to New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In our portfolio, refinances of non-New York properties have outpaced New York. It is likely that the benefits associated with the refinance in New York, especially our cash out, were greatly reduced by the market conditions relating to values and potential future revenues for New York multifamily. Also impacting this trend during the year was the decline in treasury rates during 2019, which allowed for the reset rates to be lower, which may have decreased the need to refinance. Despite this reduction in market activity though, there appears to be an active market for New York multifamily loans. The bank will continue to monitor the situation and we’ll see some reduction in portfolio balances mainly due to our higher loan pricing and more conservative loan underwriting limiting loan proceeds. As we look out over the next 12 months, there does not appear to be any significant changes to the either economic or regulatory in the forecast that could reverse this trend in the short term. It is likely that refinancing transaction volume for New York multifamily will remain lower than in the past and will have – and specially in the – lower in the past compared to the last five years. Our asset quality improved for the quarter with the payoffs in July of a $30 million multifamily relationship in the Pennsylvania market. Our reserve to total loans remain flat at 1.05%, which compares favorably to our peers especially when you take into account the $14 billion of our portfolio where 64% is in the multifamily or residential portfolios, which historically have a lower credit loss history and other types of lending. During the quarter, we had a net charge-offs of $1.5 million versus a recovery of $221,000 in the second quarter. These charge-offs are principally due to one loan with a charge-off of $1.3 million on a multifamily property in New York City and Brooklyn, which is going through a transition to a condominium. We took a conservative view on this property by basing the valuation on net operating income as a rental and discounting net value by 25%. We believe we are in good position at its current value of $15 million at September 30 of this year. With respect to the remaining nonaccruals and other delinquencies 60- to 90-day category in commercial lending, there are a number of small credits with no individual loan greater than $3.3 million. With a coverage ratio of nonaccrual loans at 248%, we believe we are well-positioned at this point in the economic cycle. On the deposit side, we continue to see fierce competition for deposits in the New York/New Jersey market. Our cost of deposit decreased one basis point to 1.77% for the quarter versus last quarter. But the trend is improving as the cost of deposits were 1.73% for the month of September. During the quarter, we reorganized our retail branch teams by eliminating the assistant branch manager position, thereby eliminating 140 positions. We moved some of these positions to administrative functions at three regional centers, approximately 33 employees, to Brooklyn and Iselin and Robbinsville operating centers. In addition, we are creating more opportunities for our assistant managers by moving 28 of them to branch manager positions and another 40 to universal bankers. This change – this net change in staff was a reduction of headcount of 40 people. We continue to expand our business banking initiative and now have teams of 27 bankers with three more to hire, one in New York and two in South Jersey. Our North Jersey team is fully staffed, and we are moving into the markets with great enthusiasm and speed. We have stronger momentum with our advisory boards and have increased outreach to centers of influence in both New York City and Long Island. Yesterday, I spent the day on Long Island with the Gold Coast team, attending their board meetings. The board, along with their advisory board, will make up our new Long Island advisory team and is a very strong group who are entrepreneurial and have a very robust knowledge of the Long Island market. We are very excited to be working with this group and look forward to our meet-and-greet event with their top customers scheduled for mid-November. We expect to close on this transaction early in the first quarter of next year. During the quarter, the retail team entered into agreement with OnDeck, a fintech company, as part of a small business digital lending platform which will expand our small business lending and improve the customer service for loans under $1 million. We have an agreement with reworks where our New York City relationship managers have access to core loan businesses in that space also. We continue to expand our sales activities with lawyers and CPAs in New York City and Long Island, and have a coordinated effort engaging with the communities to expand our overall brand – to expand our brand across new target customers in the Lakewood deal and Brooklyn corridor. Our teams are working hard, and our sales activities are up during the previous year. With the implementation of Salesforce CRM system, we are managing this process diligently and adding resources to improve results. This is a critical part of our plan, and we need to execute and invest in our technology and the sales training of our staff, while being diligent to control our expenses. With some help from the Fed, with respect to rates, and sound cost control, we believe we are in a much better position for 2020 than last quarter. And with that good news, I’d like to pass the call over to Sean Burke, who will give some further commentary on operating results.
Sean Burke: Thank you, Kevin. Net interest margin was 2.53%, an increase of six basis points from the prior quarter. Higher asset yields, higher prepayment fees and stable deposit costs drove the improvement. The provision for loan losses was negative $2.5 million for the quarter and provision was impacted by improved credit quality metrics, including the level of nonaccrual loans, coupled with the decline in our loan portfolio balances. Our allowance remains robust and our credit and allowance ratios remain amongst the strongest in our peer group. Our allowance to nonaccrual loans coverage ratio was 248%, and our allowance as a percent of loans was 1.05% at September 30. Noninterest income totaled $14.8 million for the quarter, an increase of $2.1 million from the prior quarter on a core basis. The increase was attributable primarily to the success of our customer swap program. Noninterest expenses totaled $108.7 million, included in the expense total for the quarter was $3.3 million of compensation expenses related to employee severance and our shareholder litigation settlement. In addition, professional fees were elevated by approximately $2 million due to enhancements made to our commercial treasury management and online banking products as well as cost to improve our risk management process efficiency. Absent these items, noninterest expenses were relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter. Our effective tax rate was 28.8%, fairly consistent with the prior quarter. Now I’d like to turn it back over to Kevin for any concluding remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Good. Thanks, Sean. I have been out on the road recently with shareholders and potential in California and Boston. It is clear to us that we need to continue our transition through a commercial bank and enhance our transition from a trip to a full service bank. We need to work smarter and more efficiently, and I emphasize more efficiently, to maintain our strong risk and credit culture while improving our operating matrices. There is a strong focus here at the bank on our culture and investors that is focused on driving shareholder value. We certainly are not satisfied with our results, but are dedicated to making the changes, and change is difficult sometimes, but necessary to improve our returns with the goal of a 10% return on equity by the end of 2021. We have a plan and we are a different bank that wants to make a difference with its employees, our customers and the communities that we serve. And if we continue to serve these groups, our shareholders and owners, you, will be rewarded. There is strong momentum going into the fourth quarter in 2020. It’s a different feel at the price, especially after being out of the BSA order, but we need to execute on our plans, execute on our strategy with both the retail and commercial customers. We feel pretty good about the quarter, and I think we are moving forward with tremendous opportunity in the marketplace for a bank our size. We thank you for your support. And now I’d like to turn the call over to for some questions. Thank you very much.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon with Sandler O’Neill + Partners. Please go ahead.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Hey guys, good morning.
Kevin Cummings: Good morning, Mark.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Sean, I’m wondering, with all the cost associated with those projects you did this quarter, treasury management, online banking and risk, will those costs all be out in the fourth quarter? And should we assume an operating expense run rate of around $120 million?
Sean Burke: We expect it to return to a more normalized level, Mark. So I would play guide around the $105 million area is more appropriate, plus or minus $1 million.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then secondly, I wondered if you could share with us the size of the C&I pipeline and maybe what the average rate on that is.
Domenick Cama: Yes. Mark. It’s Domenick. The C&I pipeline is about $900 million and has an average yield of about 480.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then are we likely to see more negative provisions in coming quarters? Or we’re getting to the end of that, would you say?
Sean Burke: It really does depend on asset quality and loan growth. And this quarter, we benefited from the fact that loan balances were down, as Kevin alluded to, the strategy about allowing lower-yielding multifamily, commercial real estate and residential loans running off and associated high cost funding that goes along with that. So as that trended down, so did our allowance.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay.
Sean Burke: And then Mark, I’d just like to add, like I mentioned, the pipeline, the 60 to 90 pipeline; it doesn't seem like any major loans around on the horizon in that time. Like I said, there's no loan margin in $3.3 million.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then if I'm reading the tea leaves properly, it looks like your margin's going to be up significantly in the fourth quarter. Can you help us get a sense of how much that is and how future rate cuts will impact the margin in 2020?
Sean Burke: Sure. There are some moving pieces there, but regardless of the Fed cuts in October, we expect margin will trend higher in the fourth quarter, Mark, driven by lower deposit costs and our emphasis on higher-yielding commercial loans. We forecast the margin to expand around five basis points in the fourth quarter.
Mark Fitzgibbon: And that’s exclusive of prepayment penalties?
Sean Burke: I think that’s regardless of what happens to prepayment penalties. It is a wild card, but the guidance that I gave, I think we're being relatively conservative when it comes to prepayment penalty.
Domenick Cama: Mark, just a point to add to what Sean's comments were. Approximately 25% of our deposits are tied to the Fed fund's index. So, the fourth quarter will result in a full quarter of benefit, if you will, for the two rate cuts that have occurred in July and in September.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Thank you.
Sean Burke: Mark, just a clarification point. I think you were asking our core margin. So the guidance I was giving is a core margin lift to primarily, as Domenick and Kevin described, improvements related to deposit costs or a trend downward in deposit costs and also our continued remix of the balance sheet to higher-yielding commercial loans.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Laurie Hunsicker with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Laurie Hunsicker: Yes. Hi, good morning. Really like to see your margin expansion. I was wondering if you could help us, do you have a margin for the month of September just so that we get a snapshot look at where you currently are?
Sean Burke: We do not, Laurie.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay.
Sean Burke: We don’t have that in front of us. And I think the point we were trying to make that Kevin was alluding to is that this quarter, we benefited more from prepayment fees. We saw deposit cost inflect. We're slightly down. And we expect to see deposit cost trend even lower going into the fourth quarter.
Laurie Hunsicker: Sure. And just to close the lid on what Mark was asking. So your core margin extra prepays was 245. So we should think about that in the 250 range with everything sort of adjusted for the fourth quarter. Is that correct?
Domenick Cama: it sounds about right, Laurie.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. And then can you just help us in terms of your deposit, because we've seen those come down nicely, particularly savings. What sort of cuts are you making in various categories? What's on the docket? How should we think about that?
Domenick Cama: Laurie, I think the primary cut were in our online accounts. We had approximately $350 million there at a rate of $250 million. Those are down to $190 million. We've lowered all of our CD rates. And as I said, we have – a significant portion of this deposit were tied to Fed funds, which is benefiting the cost of funds also.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay, great. And then can you just give us an update on your muni deposits, where those balances are and what that cost is running?
Domenick Cama: It’s about $4 billion and cost was running, as of September 30, at just under 2%.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay, Great. And then just a quick line item on the income statement. Sean, it looked like the BOLI income was a little outsized. So, is there something nonrecurring in that?
Sean Burke: A little bit, there was a small debt benefit that we picked up in the quarter of I think…
Laurie Hunsicker: Around, what, 300 or something?
Sean Burke: Maybe, 100,000 or 200,000, but it sounds about right.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay, great. And then just generally, Kevin, I wondered if you could comment on your view of M&A as we look forward in this post-CECL world, how you're approaching it and what your thoughts are, what changes. Thank you so much.
Kevin Cummings: We’re certainly focused on the Gold Coast transaction. We filed the S-4 this week. And I think we continue to look at situations, but we've continued to be mindful of where our stock is trading at and the opportunities that allows us to execute on it. I think there's a lot of discussion and activity in the marketplace. We have opportunities to look at a lot of things, but we're going to be very prudent in our approach and mindful of tangible book value dilution. I don't think anything has changed at the organization, but I think it's – we're pretty consistent on that message, and we'll continue to execute on the Gold Coast deal and – because of the opportunities that, that provides us.
Laurie Hunsicker: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: The next question comes from Steven Duong with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mr. Duong, your line is open or not hearing perhaps you muted on yours.
Steven Duong: So, I’m just jumping on a little late, I apologize if my questions have already been asked. But just leaving prepayment income aside, how should loan yield hold up in the fourth quarter under an October rate cut scenario?
Domenick Cama: They should hold up well, Steve. I'm looking at the average loan yield that – for C&I and CRE, and it's north of 4.25%. So, 4.25% is where we are on multifamily and CRE, and about 4.75% on multifamily – I'm sorry, on C&I.
Steven Duong: Great. Appreciate the color on that, just on your FHLB borrowings, do you have – what's sort of the re-pricing opportunity in 2020 and the cost that we're looking at?
Sean Burke: Steve, there is an opportunity for us to re-price those at lower levels. I'd say the bigger opportunity that I'd highlight remains with respect to our broker deposits and our CD book. There's significant savings there as those re-price. The average life of the brokered CD book and our retail CDs is inside of a year and probably closer to six months on average, and we're going to see a tremendous amount of re-pricing, on average, what we see re-pricing, is around that – currently around the 230 area, and we believe that it will re-price down to around the 180 area.
Steven Duong: That’s very nice to hear. Yes. So then basically, the borrowings would just be an additional potential tailwind on top of that. And then just moving on to your expenses. Are you guys pretty much done with the consulting type of professional fees? Or is there still more to come?
Sean Burke: Yes. The consulting fees are done for the year. We think we were pretty specific on what we use the money for, and we've – those expenses were one-time. We will see some additional expense reductions in the fourth quarter. And we had a change in employee account. We've reduced headcount. And that will happen – that will be reflected in the fourth quarter.
Steven Duong: Got it. And somewhere, your advertising promotional expense, is this essentially a good run rate to end the year?
Sean Burke: No. It’s elevated this quarter. So, Steve, we estimate that approximately $2 million of expense of advertising and professional fees will be taken out.
Steven Duong: Got it, got it. Yes, I apologize for that, I meant to say X those. And then just lastly, your share repurchase opportunity, have you guys sized up what you're looking at for 2020?
Sean Burke: Not absent the Gold Coast deal. So what I'd say is we're expecting the Gold Coast deal to close in the first quarter, and we have communicated our desire to repurchase the stock equal to the stock that we're issuing in connection with the transaction. So outside of that, what I would say is we do remain committed to buying back our stock especially at these levels, and we'll continue to buy back at these levels. And we'll have more to report in terms of guidance on the fourth quarter call.
Steven Duong: All right. I appreciate the color, guys. Thanks, again.
Operator: The next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Timur Braziler: This is actually Timur Braziler filling in for Jared. Appreciate all the color on New York multifamily. I'm just wondering, as we've been in this environment now for a couple of months, are the thoughts still that this is mainly going to be a volume-type impact? Or has there been any change in thoughts around the potential for credit risk?
Domenick Cama: Tim, I'm not sure of your question. Are you asking if we're going to continue to see our multifamily portfolio decline?
Timur Braziler: Just in the broader environment, is it still just a risk of volume going lower in this environment? Or has the environment shifted such that there's credit at risk as well?
Kevin Cummings: I think you're always going to be – this is Kevin, I think you're always going to be looking at the credit, and it's always going to be an issue. But there are other factors that impact that, is rising rates, the reset value. Right now, it's been benign, because treasury rates went down, people could reset and not have to go out and get an appraisal. So we really haven't seen – we haven't done – we've done very little refi in the New York market over the course of this past year. So because of the interest rates, they just reset and they don't go out and get an appraisal in that type of situation. If you look at where we are today, I think a big issue in the CRE space is property taxes. I mean, if that impacts your net cash flow, that certainly will be a credit event if property taxes go up. So with the facts and circumstances that we know today and the way things are – our borrowers are reacting to the change in regulation, it's to be seen. And we don't think there's a credit event on the horizon at this point in time. But if some other factors should change where all of a sudden, the resets make the NOIs more difficult or – and the cash flows change, that could have an impact, property taxes could have an impact. But the majority of our bias and our overall exposure to this is not that significant. Of the $8 billion that we have in New York City – in the – $8 billion in multifamily, we're looking at possibly $800,000 to $1 million in exposure in this space that our borrowers would be impacted.
Timur Braziler: Okay. That’s helpful.
Domenick Cama: What I would just add out to what Kevin pointed out on the credit front is that the shape of the yield curve also has something to do with it in the sense that in order to be in that market, you need to be somewhere between 3 and 3/8 and 3 1/2. That's what the latest color is showing. We're at 3 5/8, and so it's a deliberate attempt to reduce the asset, because of the spread implications, right. With the yield curve being inverted as it is, it's dilutive to NIM. So, we're being very careful about those types of assets coming on the balance sheet.
Timur Braziler: Okay. And as we think about that portfolio, is the third quarter level of decline a good run rate going forward? Or should we see balances accelerate and declining in future quarters?
Domenick Cama: Yes. I think that our objective is to keep the balance sheet steady. So, I'm not sure if it will continue to decline. I can tell you that we have lowered rates over the last few weeks. We've got the benefit of the lower cost on the liability side, so that's given us a little bit more opportunity to be more competitive in that market. But we're going to be very careful about the volume of loans in the multifamily book coming on because quite frankly, we want to increase the portion of C&I loans on the balance sheet just in our transition to a commercial bank.
Timur Braziler: All right. And then looking at the total loan book, is there expectation that other categories like C&I are going to be able to offset the declining multifamily portfolio?
Domenick Cama: To some degree, at this point, I would say that it's not a one-for-one request between multi and C&I, but we're going through a number of new hires, and we expect that we can build up to that level. Also, we have expanded some aspects of commercial real estate lending like non-multifamily assets and construction assets. So we think with those two categories and C&I, that we can pretty much fill the gap or fill up the negative of the multifamily amortization and payoffs.
Timur Braziler: Okay. And then just one last one from me, where do you see the capital ratio shaking out in the 10% return on equity guide for 2021?
Sean Burke: In terms of a tangible common ratio, we have talked about an 8.5% to 9% into a common equity ratio to tangible assets.
Timur Braziler: Okay. Thank you.
Sean Burke: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Okay. Well, I want to thank you for participating on the call today. Again, we feel it's been a strong quarter. We're at an inflection point with respect to our net interest margin. I guess that's one of the advantages of being an outlier, being a liability-sensitive organization. But we're still on that journey to continue to evolve into a full-service commercial bank. Our credit is strong. Our capital is strong. We've declared a dividend of $0.11, and we continue to make improvements in our infrastructure, our technology and our risk management. I want to thank you for participating on the call, and I look forward to seeing you out and about on the road. Thank you very much.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-26 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. We'll begin this morning's call with the company's standard forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp, Inc. may make some forward-looking statements with respect to its financial position, results of operations and business. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Investors Bancorp's control, are difficult to predict and which can cause actual results to materially differ from those expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. In last night's press release, the company included its safe harbor disclosure and refers you to that statement. That document is incorporated into this presentation. For a more complete discussion of the certain risks and uncertainties affecting Investors Bancorp, please see the sections entitled Risk Factors, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Result of Operations set forth in Investors Bancorp's filings with the SEC. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Cummings, Chairman and CEO of Investors Bancorp.
Kevin Cummings: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning. Welcome to the Investors Bancorp Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. The company issued 2 press releases last night at the close of business, one being the normal quarterly earnings for the second quarter and the other being the announcement of the signing of a merger agreement to acquire Gold Coast Bancorp in a stock and cash deal valued at $63.6 million. Gold Coast, with approximately $563 million in assets, is a Long Island-based institution with 6 branches in Nassau and Suffolk counties and one in Brooklyn. This transaction is a 50-50 stock-cash deal, and we anticipate buying the stock back post transaction closing. The transaction has minimal dilution to tangible book value and has an earn-back of approximately 3 years on the crossover method and 4 years on the static method.  We like the franchise as it roughly doubles our presence in the suburban Long Island market. It is our first transaction post second step and post BSA, and the math works well for us as it is a good use of capital with an estimated IRR of 17%. It creates a stronger presence in Long Island, where we recently expanded our Melville lending team, and we believe we can leverage our balance sheet and expand opportunities to the Gold Coast customer base. It is good message to our employees and customers that Investors is on the move again, and the math works well for our shareholders as it is a low-risk in-market transaction with significant upside potential in a market with strong demographics. The company also reported last night its earnings release, net income of $46.6 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2019, versus $0.18 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31 of this year and $0.20 per diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2018. For the six months ended June 30 this year, net income totaled $94.8 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared to $115 million or $0.40 per diluted share last year. In June of this year, as previously reported in our 10-K, we early adopted a new accounting pronouncement, which allowed us to reclassify certain securities in the held-to-maturity portfolio to available-for-sale. These securities of approximately $400 million were then sold at an after-tax loss of $4.1 million or $0.01 per share. The proceeds of the sale were reinvested in other debt securities yielding approximately 79 basis points higher than the securities sold. Simultaneously, the bank modified $350 million of FHLB borrowings, which resulted in an interest expense savings of approximately 45 basis points net of modification cost. We expect this transaction will yield a tangible book value earn-back of approximately one year. In a difficult interest rate environment, we continue to pull levers to improve our operating results. Over the last 18 months, we have closed 10 branches and will continue to evaluate our operating core structure. During the quarter, we managed our capital base with buybacks of approximately 3.8 million shares for $44 million at an average cost of $11.49 per share. In addition, at our Board meeting this week, our Board approved our quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share. Loans grew $253 million for the quarter with business lending growing $154 million. We continue to emphasize biz lending at the bank as we evolve into a full-service commercial bank. We recently hired a new banker to head up our cash management services and have improved our product offerings in this area with enhanced escrow products and improvements to the digital platform at both the consumer and business lines. With respect to the recent changes relating to rent regulation in New York City, we believe that we have a good understanding of our exposure at this time. While the rent regulation changes will bring some disruption to the industry, we do not see them having a significant impact on our business. Of our $8 billion in multifamily portfolio, approximately half is in New York City. At the back end, our co-ops, free market units and properties subject to the city's tax exemption programs, we estimate approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion of rent stabilization exposure in this market. It is important to note that our multifamily portfolio has always been underwritten based on in-place rents without anticipating increases, and the LTVs with the weighted -- and the LTVs have a weighted average of less than 60%. In addition, our customers in this space are generally larger, substantial owners that are committed to the New York City market for the longer term.  With respect to loan growth, we are not particularly reliant on the New York City market as we've been successful diversifying the portfolio in terms of geographic locale and property type becoming stronger throughout our overall footprint. We do not anticipate growth in this loan group and in our residential -- or in our residential portfolio as the yields on these assets are not strong enough based on the incremental cost of deposits to fund these loan types. Our focus continues to be on diversifying our loan portfolio into the business sector, and the acquisition of Gold Coast will help this diversification in the Long Island market. With respect to credit quality, we continue to have strong metrics with a reserve coverage of 1% -- 1.05% to loans and a 280% coverage -- 208% coverage to nonaccrual loans. I'm happy to report that our largest relationship in the multifamily nonaccrual category was paid off yesterday and will result in a $30 million reduction in our nonaccrual totals. Adjusting for that payoff, commercial nonaccrual loans totaled $30 million or 19 basis points of total commercial loans and a total adjusted nonaccrual loan ratio of 37 basis points to total loans. This reduction in nonaccrual loans results in an allowance coverage ratio to nonaccrual loans of approximately 284%. During the quarter, we had net recoveries of $221,000 for the quarter ended June 30, '19. With the improvement in our credit quality and modest loan growth, we recorded a reduction to our allowance of $3 million in this quarter. With respect to our credit quality, we believe we are well positioned at this point in the credit quality -- credit cycle as a significant portion of our nonperforming loans are in the residential portfolio, where we have $51 million, representing 275 loans in nonaccrual status for an average loan of $185,000. We take a conservative approach to these credits as evidenced by the historical gains recorded by the bank on the sale of ORE over the past 5 years. We believe we are well positioned with our capital position should the economy slow down in the second half of next year. With respect to deposits, we had marginal growth in the quarter and continued to see fierce competition for deposits. Deposit cost increased 8 basis points in the quarter, which impacted our net interest margin by a similar 8 basis points. We are busy adjusting our retail teams and have hired 16 new business development officers to drive deposits into the bank by calling on centers of influences, such as CPAs and attorneys, and working with our branch managers to put more feet on the street. We're also looking at revamping our processes and workflows in the branch system to free up time for more sales and business development activities. Our teams are working hard and our calling efforts are up over the previous year. With the implementation of the Salesforce CRM system, we are actively monitoring our team's activities and adding resources to improve results. It is a significant focus of the management team and comes up almost daily in almost every meeting at the bank. We're not satisfied with the results, but we'll continue to focus on these activities and adding the proper resources to the fight. It is the top priority of the bank at this time, and we will continue to focus on it. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sean Burke, our CFO, who will give some additional comments on our operating results.
Sean Burke: Thank you, Kevin. Our net interest margin was 2.47%, a decline of 8 basis points from the prior quarter. Lower prepayment fees and inverted yield curve and increasing deposit costs drove the decline. Our provision for loan losses was negative $3 million for the quarter compared to a provision of $3 million in Q1. The provision was positively impacted by improved credit quality metrics, including the level of nonaccrual loans and net recoveries, coupled with modest loan growth, which was partially offset by an increase in multifamily reserves related to changes to New York City's rent regulation laws. Our allowance remains among the strongest in our peer group. At June 30, our allowance in nonaccrual loan ratio stood at 208% and our allowance as a percent of loans was 1.05%. Noninterest income, excluding the loss related to our securities repositioning, totaled $12.7 million for the quarter, an increase of $1.5 million from the first quarter. The increase was attributable primarily to a gain on a branch sales-leaseback transaction and increased mortgage banking activity and deposit-related fees.  Noninterest expenses totaled $103.8 million, which was relatively flat compared with the prior quarter. Our effective tax rate was 28.6%, which was also consistent with the prior quarter. Our asset quality and capital ratios remained strong. At June 30, our nonperforming asset ratios stood at 48 basis points, an improvement from 52 basis points in the previous quarter. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Kevin for some concluding remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Okay. Thanks, Sean. The operating environment continues to be a challenge for banks like Investors with a liability-sensitive balance sheet. The potential for a rate reduction next week by the Fed will help, but we need to accelerate our transition to a full-service commercial bank and improve our lower-cost funding of noninterest-bearing deposits on both the consumer and commercial front. The acquisition of Gold Coast improves our presence in Long Island and gives the team a shot in the arm, creating momentum for the bank. We've been on the defensive in the last few years with our BSA issue, and this acquisition is a great first step moving forward. We're on a mission at the bank to create a special bank that makes a difference, first and foremost, with its employees and customers and the communities that we serve. We are leaders in the communities who serve our communities and strive to make an impact. The changes we are implementing will take some time, but this time -- but this team is committed to our strategic plan in creating a stronger commercial bank serving the New York, New Jersey metropolitan area. We have a plan, we have a mission, and it's time to execute on that plan. We thank you for your support. And now I'd like to turn the call -- open to -- for some questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question today comes from Mark Fitzgibbon with Sandler O'Neill + Partners.
Mark Fitzgibbon: First, a question related to the deal. Is it likely that we'll see you guys doing more of these kinds of deals in an effort to bolster deposits? And could you give us a sense for how -- in terms of deployment of capital how deals and buybacks rank in terms of priority?
Domenick Cama: Mark, this is Domenick. The -- as we reported over the years since we've taken the second step, capital deployment has been important to us and share repurchases has been a major component of that strategy. We continue to believe that share repurchases, especially at this valuation, play an important part in our capital strategy. In terms of looking at this particular deal, I think we've been vocal about our inability to do anything that was highly priced. We're very cognizant of tangible book value dilution. And so this was a transaction that was priced right, that strategically fit within the realm of our -- where we want it to be. Loan-to-deposit ratio metrics were good. Credit quality was good. As I said, geography was good. And we just thought this was another use of capital in addition to buying back strategy. So as we look out to the future, obviously, it's hard to say what we may do. But we're going to preserve tangible book value. We're going to make sure the metrics are correct on anything we do. And buybacks will always be a part of that strategy going forward.
Kevin Cummings: And I think, Mark, this is Kevin. I think it fits in well with our strategy. It's not an either/or. We're going to continue to use both and do everything prudently.
Sean Burke: And I'm going to chime in. It's Sean. The only -- the last comment I'd make here, Mark, is our bar is quite high on the M&A side. We see many opportunities and have passed on most of them. So we are cognizant of where we trade. And ultimately, what we look at has to fit our profile but also has to add something strategically. And as Kevin pointed out, they're not mutually exclusive.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then, Sean, can you help us think about expenses for the back half of the year? Is that $103.8 million a good run rate?
Sean Burke: Our guidance remains $420 million, Mark, for 2019, but we are hoping to come inside of that. But we're going to stick with the $420 million for now. But we like the run rate and it bodes well for the second half of the year.
Mark Fitzgibbon: And I know headcount has been trending down for a little while, but it looked like it bounced up about 40 FTEs this quarter. And I know, Kevin, you had mentioned I think 16 new business development people. Where is the rest of the growth coming from?
Domenick Cama: We have some summer interns, Mark, that we hire. And they'll be out of here, I guess, by the end of August, when they all go back to school. So the number -- the real number is the one Kevin mentioned, and that's -- those 16 new business development officers.
Mark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And could you share any updated guidance with us with respect to the margin, assuming -- and what your assumptions are, right?
Sean Burke: We expect margin to remain relatively stable throughout the rest of 2019, Mark. That's based on the assumption that we will get a July rate cut.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Nicholas with Stephens Inc.
Austin Nicholas: So I appreciate the comment on the stable margin, which seems to assume just one rate cut in July. If we were to get a rate cut in September and then another one in December, can you maybe talk about -- could we see the margin inflect kind of in the fourth quarter under that scenario?
Sean Burke: Yes. You would see that, Austin, and that would be -- those particular cuts, the one in September and December, if we do, in fact, get them, they will be even more impactful for the following year when we get the full year impact of the cuts.
Austin Nicholas: Understood. And then can you maybe just talk a little bit about, I know we've talked about this before, but the fixed to floating swap that you have on. And remind us when that runs off and what the kind of impact would be when that runs off, assuming we have a couple of rate hikes -- or a couple of rate cuts here.
Sean Burke: Yes. So we have approximately $1 billion that we have swapped to floating rates, but that swap comes off or ends in February of 2020. And so -- then we go back to having $1 billion that turns back to fixed. So that would be a benefit when that swap ends in February of 2020.
Austin Nicholas: Understood. That's helpful. And then just maybe just on M&A, can you -- on the acquisition announced today, congrats on that. Can you maybe just talk about what assumptions you guys have in terms of growth for that kind of -- that part of the bank? I know it's small, but any assumptions you have on the growth in terms of loan growth.
Sean Burke: Yes. We're hopeful that the acquisition in Gold Coast can deliver more growth than we modeled in, but our expectation was approximately about an 8% growth rate.
Austin Nicholas: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on the multifamily portfolio. Can you maybe -- I know you've talked about well protected on credit, low LTVs. That all make sense to me. And while I understand that, is there -- can you maybe speak to if there's any risk that -- from a risk weighting perspective, is there any risk that risk weightings could move up in any of those certain types of those loans where valuations may have gotten or may get hit? Is there any risk to that? And have you modeled anything that you could share with us?
Sean Burke: Our risk weighting with respect to multifamily assets is pretty conservative relative to what others with large portfolios, how they risk weight it, so there's less impact to us. But Austin, we don't see a major impact there, and the rationale for that is the LTVs, which would likely be impacted here or could be impacted, they are measured for regulatory purposes. The rule, it's the LTV is measured at origination.
Kevin Cummings: And just to add to that a little bit, Austin. During our underwriting the last a couple of years, we had adjusted and stressed in the underwriting process to a 4.5% and 5% cap rate. So it's not like we were -- in the rates especially in the Brooklyn market where we're coming in, in that 4 and sub-4, our underwriting, we adjusted the underwriting for a 4.5%, 5% cash rate over that period of time. So that bodes us well going into this type of situation. Should cap rates change, we feel we've been conservative in the underwriting.
Austin Nicholas: Okay. That's helpful. And then some of your peers have broken down their portfolio in a similar way as you have, but they've also made a kind of -- they've ring-fenced a small portion of loans that they considered or could be considered value-add or rather where the borrower has a strategy or had a strategy to meaningfully increase stabilized rents to market rents. Have you done any analysis on that $1 billion to $1.5 billion portfolio of what maybe is a little bit more exposed on that -- from that perspective?
Domenick Cama: We haven't, Austin. And certainly, we look at the strategy as the loans come in. But as Kevin mentioned, one of the ways that we moderate that risk is by using a low -- a higher cap rate, which essentially gives less dollars to the borrower and which also then translates into more equity. And then the second item in our underwriting that helps to protect us is we qualify the loans to a 10-year borrowing rate. So in the event -- so even if a borrower is going to borrow for a 5-year term, we have him -- P&I has to qualify at a 10-year rate. So those are the two ways that we try to protect that and we try to protect the credit. But we haven't really dug down deep into at this point understanding who's buying, just simply to decimate the building and raise all the rents. We haven't done that.
Austin Nicholas: Okay. That makes sense. And then maybe just one, last one on loan growth. I know your original guide was kind of in that 6% to 7% range. But maybe just as we look out here, can you give us some thoughts on how you think that number could look over the next couple of quarters. And then when you layer in this new acquisition, what maybe -- what opportunities that could give you? I know you kind of mentioned your assumptions on that.
Domenick Cama: Yes. Austin, the pipeline for CRE is actually down at this point. It's down by about 50%. And so we've seen our overall CRE pipeline come down to about $450 million, which we believe is going to have an impact on growth going forward. We still have a healthy pipeline in our C&I portfolio. That's the area that we remain focused on. And I'm not sure how it will bode for growth, but my feeling is that -- and we haven't put pencil to paper at this point. But just going through these numbers over the last week or so, gives me pause for hitting our $1.4 billion in growth for 2019. That's notwithstanding the addition of the portfolio that will come from Gold Coast, which is primarily a CRE. So that may add to it. That will help us get to our number. But I don't really look at it that way. I look at what current production is right now. And it looks like on a CRE front, we're down. And that truthfully is by design just given the shape of the yield curve and just the risk in the market, we just believe it's a prudent thing to do at this point, to limit growth in those areas.
Austin Nicholas: Okay. Great. And then maybe just one last one. I know you have an online bank that you started a few quarters ago. I think the goal was to maybe grow it to $250 million in deposits. Any comments on how that's going? Have you been able to lower rates there a bit recently? And then maybe just any goals to grow beyond that?
Domenick Cama: Yes. As of second quarter, we had about $300 million in the online accounts. And it's been doing well. We look at it as an alternative to raising rates here in our market. At this point, we've been monitoring the rates pretty closely and we feel this is not the right time to lower the rates, although we have seen some competitors lower rates. But there are a number of competitors who are at the same level that we're at. We're looking at the impending Fed rate cut as perhaps an opportunity to lower our rates. And hopefully, some of our competitors will do the same thing. We continue to like the vehicle. We continue to work on it. We have a team that's specifically dedicated to monitoring the website and the online bank. And at this point, we've grown it above $300 million and we're going to continue to watch that. But as I said, we're going to use it as an alternative to increasing all of our rates throughout the rest of the bank and use this as an alternative funding tool.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities.
Jared Shaw: I guess maybe on the credit. Kevin, you'd said that there's a recovery post the end of the quarter. Had any of that already been charged off? And should we expect to see any type of additional provision release as a result of that?
Kevin Cummings: We haven't looked really that far ahead yet. It's still early, but there's a small recovery there, nothing that would really impact our allowance. But I would say that our asset quality ratios continue to be strong and they are improving. And to the extent that they do, we wouldn't anticipate -- if it stays where it is, we wouldn't anticipate large provisions for the remainder of the year.
Jared Shaw: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the C&I growth. That was a good quarter for growth. Can you give a little detail on where you're seeing that. And when we're looking at that sort of line item specifically, is that sustainable with the hires that you've been doing there?
Domenick Cama: Yes. We think it is. We just -- I just met with the C&I folks this morning, as a matter of fact. And we are just slightly below our budgeted number for the year, but we feel pretty good that we'll be able to hit our number. Most of the business that we did was, in our general market area, we did some lending in New York City and in some of the boroughs. And so it's starting to reap the benefit of the additional hires and the focus on the business. It's too early to tell as to how this will pan out for the rest of the year. But so far, so good.
Kevin Cummings: Yes. The good part of that business comes in the second half of the year. It's a seasonal business. First quarter is usually the slowest and they gain momentum in the second. We expect to have a stronger third and fourth quarter.
Jared Shaw: Yes. That's helpful. And then on M&A, with this deal, I'm assuming that you are discussing with the regulators along the way and that you're not anticipating any issues there. Is that probably a good way to look at it?
Domenick Cama: Yes, that's fair. Our BSA order was lifted in December of 2018. And yes, in fact, we have been discussing this deal with all of our regulators since it came to the table.
Jared Shaw: And then once this is closed -- or I guess, I understand that you're looking at M&A as very opportunistic and it has to meet specific criteria. But could we see another deal before this is closed or before this is integrated? Or I guess when would you start to reevaluate opportunities out there?
Domenick Cama: Jared, I think Sean said it earlier that there are deals that we are looking at all the time. And at this point, it's difficult to say whether we're going to do and make another announcement before. I would say it's highly unlikely. We haven't done a transaction in quite some time. We have a lot of new members of the management, the operations and technology team. And so this deal works from a number of perspectives, not only all of the strategic perspectives that I cited earlier, but also one in which our teams can convert and handle within a reasonable amount of time. So I'm hesitant to want to do something that's going to put some undue burden on the team. I want to get through this one first since this is the first one we've done in quite some time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brody Preston with Piper Jaffray.
Broderick Preston: I just had a couple of questions on the deal. I just want to know what the expected cost saves and intangibles were as a result.
Domenick Cama: The cost saves were 45%. I think that's what we modeled. On the intangibles, what, $16 million or...
Sean Burke: I think it's $14 million of goodwill and approximately $6 million of core deposit.
Broderick Preston: Okay. Good. And I'm assuming that the cost save number does not include any branch cuts just given the lack of overlap between the footprints?
Domenick Cama: That's correct.
Broderick Preston: Okay. Great. And then with regard to their underwriting specifically surrounding multifamily, do they have, I guess, a relatively larger rent-regulated book? And are the underwriting standards that they have similar to yours?
Domenick Cama: They are a pretty clean bank, but Brody, multifamily makes up a very small component of their loan book. I think it's probably 13% or 14%, if I'm not mistaken, so it's very small.
Broderick Preston: Okay. Great. And then in terms of the accretion from the deal, will there be any material impact to the margin as a result of accretion moving forward once the deal is closed?
Domenick Cama: Probably flat, right?
Sean Burke: Yes. It's a little too small, Brody, really to move the margin needle for us.
Broderick Preston: All right. And then one last one, not on the deal, but just in terms of the pricing competition that you're seeing specifically in C&I. With LIBOR down as much as it is end of the first quarter, how -- I guess, how competitive conditions trended? Are there any industries or segments where you're seeing more or less competition?
Domenick Cama: I would say first, let me just say that the market is competitive and everyone is out there chasing C&I deals. Many of our deals get priced to treasuries, actually. A large portion of them get priced to treasuries. And to the extent that LIBOR has fallen and we have a deal that we price to LIBOR or spread to LIBOR, we do have RAROC hurdles that we have to hit. So when a lender brings a deal in, we run it to a model that tells us what the return on risk-adjusted capital will be. So even with the reduction in LIBOR, we'll adjust the spread to ensure that we're hitting our RAROC levels.
Broderick Preston: Okay. Great. And are there any lending segments that are more or less competitive than any others?
Domenick Cama: I would say not. I would say that most segments are competitive. We're active in the health care segment, and that remains competitive. Within the New York City market, we've done some high-quality hospitality. That also remains competitive. We were bidding against a number of other banks in those particular deals. But I can't put my finger on any one segment of the market that is less competitive than the others.
Broderick Preston: Okay. Great. I guess one last one for me. Just a follow-up. Is there any segment in the health care industry in particular that you're focused on with regard to C&I lending?
Domenick Cama: No. We run the gamut between hospitals, doctor practices, dentist office.
Kevin Cummings: Nursing home.
Domenick Cama: Nursing home facilities. So there's not one in particular that we focus on. We really run the gamut there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurie Hunsicker with Compass Point.
Laurie Hunsicker: I just wondered if, Kevin, you could share with us as you all look out on the acquisition front, and I appreciate that you're going slow. How do you think about a bank that has a very concentrated multifamily book or a potential concentration in rent regulation? Is that a bank that you would just step away from, not interested? Or how are you approaching that?
Kevin Cummings: Well, certainly, in our strategic plan, we want to diversify our portfolio and move more into the business lending. The multifamily asset class has served us well in our transition from a thrift to a more bank-like. And it served us very well. But too much of a good thing is not a good thing. So certainly, we love the asset class. It's very profitable with the credit metrics. There is some uncertainty with the change in rent regulation, so we're being very mindful of that when we look at whether growing the portfolio or looking at potential acquisition targets. There's a low cost of entry into the business. All you have to do is get to know some brokers and you could lever it up pretty quickly. But in today's market, with our funding costs, it's an area where we just want to maintain it or maybe shrink it a little bit to fund the business lending opportunities in the marketplace. And also, there is a greater opportunity for deposit gathering when we deal with the C&I customers.
Laurie Hunsicker: Great. That makes sense. Can you remind us where you all would go geographically? How far outside of your footprint you would look?
Domenick Cama: Yes. We -- when you say outside our footprint, I mean we've been vocal, Laurie, about where we would go. Nassau and Suffolk County has been one of the areas that we've targeted. And we've also targeted center city Philadelphia. I think we've mentioned on a number of occasion that the Philadelphia market, we believe, is attractive. We have a number of branches in the suburban areas of Philadelphia on the New Jersey side, and we think by looking at the potential transactions in that center city Philadelphia market could work to enhance the franchise. So at this point, it's -- Long Island and Philadelphia is on the extreme of where we would go right now as we speak.
Laurie Hunsicker: Great. And then certainly, Gold Coast was small. How much smaller would you go? And then would you remind us potentially how much larger you would also consider? What's the band there?
Domenick Cama: Well, I don't think we would go much smaller than $500 million in assets. It's just -- especially just given the work that's required to get a transaction like this one done. In terms of a big transaction, Laurie, it's also a difficult question to answer. And all I would say to that is anything that we would look at would have to fit within the confines of the deal -- of the metrics that we believe are suitable for us in terms of tangible book value dilution and earn-back.
Laurie Hunsicker: Okay. Great. And so I mean theoretically, if there was a $5 billion, $6 billion, $7 billion, $8 billion, $10 billion deal, would that be something you would look at if it sit within your tangible book and earn-back parameters or is that too big to digest? How do you think about that?
Sean Burke: I mean realistically, Laurie, this is Sean, just based on where we trade, we're very mindful of that. And so anything that size is likely to trade at a premium to where we are and would create a situation where it may not be ideal or meet our return profile and our expectations for tangible book value dilution and earn-back.
Laurie Hunsicker: Right. Okay. Just last quick question. Muni deposits, can you remind us how much they are and where you guys currently are with cost of those?
Domenick Cama: We have about $3.6 billion in muni deposits here in New Jersey.
Laurie Hunsicker: And what are those costing?
Domenick Cama: Weighted average cost is just a touch above 2%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Collyn Gilbert with KBW.
Collyn Gilbert: I hopped on way late. I apologize if you guys covered this already. But just a couple of questions. Can you just confirm what the outstanding balance is for your New York City rent-regulated multifamily loans?
Domenick Cama: Yes. Kevin mentioned it earlier. Somewhere between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.
Collyn Gilbert: Okay. And again, if you covered it, I can just read the transcript. But did you cover what your growth outlook was within that portfolio and within multifamily in general?
Domenick Cama: Yes. We've been vocal about the fact that we don't see growth potential coming from multifamily. As a matter of fact, when -- if I break down the $1.4 billion that we projected for the year 2019 in our original strategic plan, only about $100 million was being attributed to multifamily. Truthfully, as I look at the shape of the yield curve and where we are in terms of pipeline, I'm not even sure that we'll be able to achieve that in 2019.
Collyn Gilbert: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the NIM, I'm sure you covered it, a lot of what I would ask. But your -- can you just offer a little bit of guidance or thoughts on where you think your NIM would go in 2020 if we saw 3 rate cuts?
Sean Burke: That's really counting -- that's counting the chickens before they hatch. We're just focused on July. But obviously, it would help...
Kevin Cummings: 50 basis points next week.
Sean Burke: We're liability-sensitive, Collyn, and every rate cut is beneficial to us. We did cover some of the guidance with respect to the remainder of the year earlier in the call when we said based on a July cut, we're expecting a stable margin for 2019 -- for the remainder of 2019.
Collyn Gilbert: Okay. Okay. So did you quantify with every 25 basis point cut maybe what would happen with the margin? I know you just said stable with the first one, but I just didn't know about the...
Sean Burke: We did not, and it will change because there's different dynamics at play here because we've talked about we had an asset swap on that rolls off in February of 2020. So obviously, that will have an impact. So when you look at it in totality, the balance sheet, every 25 basis point cut helps but it helps to different degrees. And it probably gets better the further up that we go.
Collyn Gilbert: Okay. Okay. All right. And then, just finally, and again sorry if you covered it. You can just say you did and I'll go back to the transcript. On the buyback and what -- where your appetite is, maybe what caused you guys to buy back less than, I guess, I would have thought, probably maybe less than maybe what the majority of the market would have thought? But just did you already cover that?
Domenick Cama: No. Again, Collyn, as far as the buyback is concerned, I mean we believe in the buyback as an efficient use of capital. We have bought back over $1 billion, almost $1.2 billion in stock over the last 5 years since we took the second step. So as we look out, we continue to use the strategy of buying more stock back when the price falls and less stock when the price rises. In terms of just buying less and direct to your question, buying less for the quarter, that was really more in line with just trying to balance our tangible common equity ratios, our CRE concentration levels and ensuring that we do maintain enough capital for continued growth over the next 12 to 18 months. So I'm not saying that we're not buying back our stock. As a matter of fact, I'm saying the opposite. We'll continue to buy it back. The degree obviously will vary based on the price changes that occur in the stock over the future.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Okay. Thank you, Lisa. I'd like to thank you for participating on the call today. We're very excited about the Gold Coast potential, in the acquisition in the market that they operate in. That Suffolk, Nassau market is very exciting to us. I'd also like to say that buybacks are still an integral part of our capital management plan along with dividends, along with organic growth and along with smart acquisitions that meet the requirements of tangible book value dilution and those metrics. We're on a game plan to move this company forward. We're excited. And I wish everyone a good remainder of the summer, and I look forward to seeing you out on the road, and have a good day. Okay. So thank you very much and appreciate your participation on the call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-18 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad, and I'll be your operator on the call today. Currently all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor: Thanks so much, Brad. Hello everyone. We really appreciate you finding time to join us this morning. We're going to kick things off with our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, reviewing our results and then we'll open the call up for questions. We're really happy to have Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking with us. Of course, I need to remind everyone that in addition to today's press release, we have also provided presentation, financial supplement, and you can find these materials at investor.citizensbank.com. And our comments today will include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ from expectations in our SEC filings, including our 8-K that we filed today. And then we utilize non-GAAP financial measures and we provide you information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and earnings materials. And with that, I will hand to Mr. Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, Ellen. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We're pleased to announce strong quarterly results today; it's always great to get off to a good start to the year. But importantly beyond the short-term results, I feel we're really doing a good job of staying focused on evolving our long-term strategy, given the rapid changes in technology, customer expectations, and the competitive dynamics that we face. We've changed from opportunity and risk; we seek to exploit opportunities that will strengthen our franchise, while minimizing potential risk. We have a significant cross section of our leadership team engaged in these efforts and the key will be to make good decisions to prioritize wealth and then go out and execute. The balancing the long and short-term requires skill and I believe we're doing a good job overall on this. Let me give you a few high-level takes on the quarter, before John gives you the full details. Now the quarter had some seasonal impacts but the year-over-year comparisons are the most meaningful. Our underlying earnings per share was up 19% year-over-year aided by the strong operating leverage which was 3.2% and even more impressively was 5% excluding acquisitions. What really stood out for me was strong fee income growth of X% ex the acquisitions compared with only 2% expense growth ex-acquisitions. We have consistently invested in our commercial fee businesses and regaining real traction in deepening relationships. Our capital markets revenue hit a record in the quarter; up 38%, has been our Global Markets business which is foreign exchange and interest rate products where revenues were up 33%. We just handled some great talents and were able to compete highly effectively against the biggest banks and our peers. And our TOP programs really are differentiating allowing us to become more efficient while serving customers more effectively. We bumped our TOP 5 estimated impact to $95 million to $105 million which is up $5 million and were hard at work on TOP 6 which is expected to be bigger and potentially more transformational. Another highlight for the quarter was our strong year-over-year average loan growth of 6% along with sequential loan growth of 1.5%. We continue to focus on attractive areas to deploy capital and improve our risk-adjusted returns. On the deposit side, we grew average deposits 6% year-on-year and 2% sequential quarter. We bought the spot quarter and loan to deposit ratio down below 95% with some nice performance from Citizens Access which has $4.6 billion in deposits as of quarter end. Even with the strong deposit growth, our deposit costs were manageable and our NIM held steady. We now have some additional balance sheet flexibility as we look ahead. On balance sheet management overall, I'm pleased with our DSO efforts which provide us a razor sharp focus on enhancing our growth, our NIM, and our return on capital. We continue to deploy some great new technology to better serve customers and to run the bank better. Slide 14 of our presentation provides you with some of the color including four new fintech partnerships in the quarter. Sufficed to say we expect a big leap forward in our technology capability and delivery in 2019. To me, it is one of the keys to our year. So overall we maintain a positive outlook for the balance of 2019 as we expect another year of good execution and further progress across the board. Let me stop there and turn it over to our CFO, John Woods.
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning everyone. We're pleased with solid first quarter results that highlight steady execution against our enterprise level initiative, with particular focus on robust positive operating leverage. We continued our momentum in delivering cost efficiencies, while making the long-term investments required for sustainable success. So let me kick-off by covering several important highlights of the quarter. So on Page 4, we delivered EPS growth of 19% year-on-year with PPNR up 13%. A strong focus on growing the top-line, while being disciplined on expenses, drove positive operating leverage of 5% before the impact of our recent acquisitions. Overall credit quality remains very good with a relatively stable net charge-off ratio of 31 basis points and a decrease in the non-performing loans ratio. Our consumer and commercial banking segments are delivering strong and prudent loan growth, 1.5% linked quarter and 6% year-over-year and we continue to gain traction in fee income with this quarter's results highlighted by record capital markets and FX and interest rate products fees. Deposit growth outpaced loan growth during the quarter in part due to ongoing momentum in Citizens Access, and as a result, we drove a nice improvement in our spot LDR to 94.9%. This puts us in a strong liquidity position as we head into the second quarter. In addition, DDA was stable year-over-year as we continue to do a nice job of executing on our initiatives together low cost deposits more efficiently and effectively. We also continue to actively manage our capital base returning $349 million of capital to common shareholders through higher dividends and share repurchases. We delivered underlying ROTCE of 13.1% which is up 141 basis points year-over-year. And our tangible book value per share was up 9% year-over-year and 3% sequential quarter. We finished the quarter with a strong 10.5% CET1 ratio. Across both business segments, we continue to make significant investments in broadening our capabilities and strengthening the franchise, as we balanced delivering on our near-term objectives and executing against our long-term strategy. We have some exciting things to talk about this quarter and I'll expand on our strategic initiatives in a few minutes. On Page 6, our net interest margin came in broadly stable for the quarter, even though average LIBOR rose than the prior quarter and the long end of the curve was lower than anticipated. The December short-term rate drives drove higher loan yields but this was tempered a bit by robust growth and shift mix in deposits which put some upward pressure on deposit costs as well as by an increase in securities premium amortization due to drop in loan raised. Turning to fees on Page 7. We delivered very solid results despite some seasonal headwinds. As I mentioned earlier, we saw record results in both capital markets and in foreign exchange and interest rate products, reflecting continued benefits from investments in broadening and enhancing our capabilities, as we are increasingly able to win lead less mandates against the larger national players. This helped overcome expected seasonal headwinds in mortgage, service charges, and card fees. Capital markets delivered a 38% increase in fees year-over-year, with strengthened loan syndications, M&A and advisory fees, and bond underwriting fees, overcoming lower market volumes and loan syndications which were down significantly. Results were up 20% linked quarter largely tied to an increase in M&A and bond underwriting activity as market conditions improved from the fourth quarter which helped offset the impact of the typical seasonal decline in loan syndications. In global markets, FX and interest rate products were up 33% year-over-year led by the IRP team, which was able to win some nice lead transactions and take advantage of the flat yield curve by restructuring the existing client hedges. In FX, higher dollar volatility created the opportunity for favorable hedging across a number of currencies. Because of what we saw happening with the long end of the curve, we took the opportunity to lock in some securities gains and executed on targeted asset dispositions which increased other income in the first quarter. This helped offset headwinds in mortgage where Franklin fees was down $14 million linked quarter largely as lower rates and an $11 million of MSR losses and also origination levels dropped reflecting tough market conditions. The integration of Franklin is on track and while the first quarter was challenging, we see an improving environment in 2Q and continue to believe this is an attractive and important customer business for us to be in over the long-term. Turning to Page 8. Expenses were up 3% linked quarter reflecting seasonally higher salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by seasonally lower outside services costs. Year-over-year before the impact of acquisitions, non-interest expense was very well controlled up 2% reflecting strong expense management and benefits from our TOP program. We are identifying further opportunities to streamline our operations and activities across the organization to capitalize on the next level of efficiencies which include a strong focus on end-to-end automation across the front and back office. These activities will be critical to maintain our operating objectives over time. As a result, we remain committed to self fund our growth initiatives and deliver compelling products and services to an increasingly digitally oriented customer base. Let's move on and discuss the balance sheet. On Page 9, you can see we continue to grow our balance sheet and generate nice returns from the investments we've made in our geographic and industry verticals expansion strategies with strong progress and higher growth geographies like the Southeast and Texas. We are also seeing attractive risk adjusted return opportunities in commercial real estate with growth tied to high quality projects largely in office and multifamily. We remain disciplined around client selection where we are focused on larger MSAs. On the retail side, we also continue to drive growth in innovative and attractive risk adjusted return categories like education refinance and unsecured including our merchant partnerships. Overall, we grew loans by 1.5% linked quarter and 6% year-over-year, despite the impact in the planned runoff and auto non-core and leasing as well as some modest impact from asset dispositions tied to balance sheet optimization. Loan yields improved by 13 basis points in the first quarter reflecting continued mix shift towards higher returning categories and a backdrop of higher short-term rates driven by the December rate increase. As you can see on Page 10, we are doing a nice job of growing deposits which were up 2% linked quarter and 6% year-over-year with stable results in DDA, as we continue to do a nice job of executing on our initiatives to gather low cost deposits and capitalize on the inherent value of our franchise. Our total deposit costs were relatively well controlled given the strong growth of 15 basis points linked quarter reflecting the impact of higher rates and a shift in deposit mix as we drove new customer acquisition and managed down the LDR from 97.6% to 94.9% at the end of the quarter. Note that interest bearing deposit costs grew 16 basis points sequential quarter. We continue to make investments across Citizens Access digital platform where we are gaining share nationally in the mass affluent and affluent segments. This platform has contributed nicely to our funding diversification and optimization of deposit levels and costs. At the end of the first quarter, we reached $4.6 billion in Citizens Access deposits. Year-over-year, our asset yields expanded 49 basis points reflecting the benefit of higher rates and the impact of our BSO initiatives. Our total cost of funds was up 48 basis points reflecting a shift towards a more balanced mix of long-term and short-term funding and higher rates. Next, let's move to Page 11 and cover credit, which continues to look quite good with the continued mix shift towards higher quality low risk retail loan and a relatively stable risk profile in our commercial book. The non-performing loan ratio improved to 66 basis points of loans this quarter down from 78 basis points a year ago. The net charge-off rate of 31 basis points for the first quarter was relatively stable linked quarter and up modestly year-over-year from relatively low levels. Overall, we feel good about the credit metrics and trends in the book including a downward shift and criticized asset levels. Provision for credit losses of $85 million was relatively stable with prior quarter and prior year levels. Our allowance to loans coverage ratio remains relatively stable ending in the quarter at 1.06% and as we increase the mix of higher quality retail portfolios in our overall loan book. The NPL coverage ratio improved to 160% as we saw improvement in NPLs and runoff in the non-core portfolio. On Page 12, we maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions ending the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.5% which came down from 10.6% in the fourth quarter. Also this quarter, we repurchased $200 million of common stock and returned a total of $349 million to common shareholders including dividend. Our planned glide path to reduce our CET1 ratio remains on track and we remain confident in our ability to drive improving financial performance and attractive returns to shareholders. Our current plan is to announce our buyback plans later in the second quarter. As a broad comment, we expect to meet expectations. On Page 13, I want to highlight a few exciting things that are happening with our enterprise wide initiatives. As we work on running the bank better and improving our customer experience, we've launched a new digital mortgage application and home buying platforms that we're very excited about as it will drive cost efficiencies and an improved customer experience. Given our strong focus on strengthening our advice based model and consumer, we recently opened a new banking and wealth center in Downtown, Boston. This approach allows us to deliver tailored advice ideas and solutions to help our clients with all of their banking and investment needs. We are full steam ahead on the integration of Clarfeld which is progressing ahead of schedule. We continue to gain traction on our merchant partnership platform where we recently signed agreements with several new partners including ADT which should be announced later in Q2. In commercial, we continue with the build out of our Treasury Solutions business as we begin piling -- we began piloting accessOPTIMA our new cash management platform which offers clients a comprehensive suite of online cash management resources and real time mobile capabilities. We also launched real time payments to make customer payments more efficient and we are partnering with Worldpay to expand our international payment capabilities. These are just the latest examples of the significant investments Citizens is making in the commercial banking technology and solutions in order to meet and exceed the ever changing financial management needs of our clients. Finally, we continue to exceed expectations in our TOP programs where we have now increased the expected benefit from our TOP 5 program by about $5 million with an expected estimated benefit in the range of $95 million to $105 million. Our outlook for the second quarter is on Page 14 and it reflects continued momentum in both our top and bottom-line results. We expect our linked quarter average loans to be up approximately 50 basis points and we are considering selling some loans in the quarter as we seek to redeploy capital under our BSO initiative. We also expect net interest margin to be stable to down slightly due to continued but decelerating deposit repricing that will abate over the back half of the year. The NIM should bottom out in the second quarter and gradually rise in the second half of the year given less deposit pressure and the benefit of fixed loan and securities repricing at higher rates, along with further balance sheet optimization impacts. In non-interest income, we are expecting to see growth in the mid-single-digits range given continuing strength in commercial and a seasonal uptick in consumer. We expect non-interest expense to be flat to up 1% as seasonal decreases are offset by higher revenue related expenses. We also continue to expect to deliver positive operating leverage and further efficiency ratio improvement. Additionally, we expect provision expense to be in the range of $95 million to $105 million. And finally, we expect our CET1 ratio to be broadly stable. Overall, we expect our full-year results to be broadly in line with our overall guidance. But there will be puts and takes with modestly lower net interest income offset by better fee income and expense performance. Also in response to the rapidly changing environment and a little less tailwind from rising rates, we've been doing some early work on a transformational expense program designed to boost efficiency and effectiveness. This will provide additional capacity to invest more heavily in revenue producing capabilities, while ensuring that we maintain strong financial performance into the future. Stay tuned for more details on our second quarter call. To sum up on Page 15, our results this quarter demonstrate our continuing strong performance as we execute against our strategic initiatives, carefully manage our expense base, and improve how we run the bank to drive underlying revenue growth. Let me turn it back to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, thanks very much John. Brad, I think it's time to open it up for some questions.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question in the queue will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.
John Pancari: Just looking to get a little bit more color on the deposit efforts this quarter. In what areas, what types of deposits were you pushing, was there any broad-based increase in stated rates and then what's your outlook there. Is there a continued push beyond your existing national platform that you're going to continue to push the products and therefore deposit rates higher? Thanks.
John Woods: Yes, so how are you doing? Its John here, I'll go ahead and comment on that. So average deposits to total deposits were up very strongly this quarter we were very pleased to see the take up. It was driven primarily by term and savings. Those were the two drivers. I think we saw some good performance in the DDA area as well. We've been making lots of investments in that play -- in that space. So year-over-year DDA was relatively flat. We were very pleased with that. We had a strong 2018 and we look to continue that momentum going forward. Citizens Access had an excellent quarter. That'll continue into the future. I'd say that strong deposit growth really drove the LDR down to around the 95% level as you heard earlier. I think looking forward, I think you could see that LDR level staying relatively stable into the second quarter and continuing to see growth looking forward in the term and saving space. But I think big picture a big deceleration. I would say in interest bearing deposit costs, the further away you get from the Fed rise in December is going to see that deceleration in the second quarter to where that solidifies in H2 which connects back to our NIM guide which will look to increase in the later part of the year.
Bruce Van Saun: I would just add a little color there is that there is broader efforts in just Citizens Access. Citizens Access in and of itself is a huge success story, but on commercial we've been investing in certain areas where we think we can gain some real traction in picking up natural share deposits with our pre-existing customers where we maybe didn't have the capabilities we talked about ex-growth, we talked about bankruptcy. So we're building those out. Those don't turn on a dime, they build gradually with time. So we're pleased with how that's developing. And then on the core consumer side, continuing to invest in data and analytics and being a little sharper in our offerings and targeting them to different segments of the market particularly mass affluent and affluent, we are seeing traction there. So pretty good performance across the board and very pleased the LDR is at a lower level now so which gives us a lot of flexibility going forward.
John Pancari: Got it. Thanks Bruce. And then, separately just on what you just mentioned in your -- in the end of your prepared remarks transformational expense program that you're looking at. I know you said it would be fair to give us details on the second quarter call but just in general how do you view it being transformational and using that phrase, I mean is it more about how you're looking at your branches or is it a longer-term profitability change in terms of where you're operating on an efficiency ratio basis. Just a little bit more color there on how you view it as transformational? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Sure. So I think what we've done for the five years prior has been really just work on ideas and coming up with deployment of different strategies around organizational design, spans and layers, automating starting to look at process automation and robotics. I think what we're -- and also some branch thinning and the like. I think what we're after in this go round is something that's a little broader in scope and so really deploying new technologies, artificial intelligence, and the like to new strategies for technology development. So there's a lot around technology and operations and they've guts of how we're running things. There's a lot in looking at processes end-to-end in terms of the transactions that we have customer-facing transactions and how are we going to improve those both in terms of their cost efficiency and their effectiveness and customer experience. So we have a fair amount there. So it's a broader look and typically in the TOP programs up to now, we've looked for very quick paybacks. So we didn't look at having significant technology investments and we wanted things that we would pay back within 18 months. And so in this version, we'll look at things a little more broader that might require some technology and might payback over two or three years but I do think we'll be able to move the needle on the efficiency ratio with the payback from these efforts. So we're quite excited, it’s early days. We're working through some ideas. The thing I would also emphasize here, John, is that we want to pair that with efforts that are going on for finding new revenue growth and finding different trusted ways to serve customers or create new products and services potentially a bit disruptive. There's a huge effort that we're undertaking now to really focus on how can we differentiate ourselves and similar to how we grew the education refinance business or we do the Apple relationship and having a very strong point of sale financing offering. We want to drive forward, so we can have more revenue growth in our peer set and actually keep the top-line going and then create a virtuous circle where we've got a good top-line we can afford the investment et cetera. So it's really a one, two punch. So part of it is let's really go after the cost base and transformational, and some of that will drop to the bottom-line. But some of that will help fund these investments to really drive future revenue growth.
Operator: And our next question will come from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.
Saul Martinez: Hey guys, good morning. Couple of questions. First can you give a little surprised with the outlook that you've actually seen NIMs ratcheting up in the second half and you gave some broad strokes as to why but if you could us, John, give us a little bit more detail on what's underlying -- what kind of assumptions are underlying that outlook? I assume you still expect deposit costs creep. But how much of it's being driven by balance sheet optimization, what kind of balance sheet optimization and also where you expecting the security deal to gravitate up as well in that assumption?
John Woods: Yes. I will jump on that. So I think if I'd taken in two pieces. I mean I think if you look at what we expect in 2Q and then how those forces expect to unfold over the second half of the year. I think where as we mentioned stable to down slightly in 2Q. The real driver there is rates. I mean I think when you look at where LIBOR is expected to be in 2Q, all the other drivers which I'll cover in a second basically offset and you're left with short-term rates being potentially down a couple of basis points which has an impact on our floating loan portfolio. The other drivers that all seem to offset are expected to offset in the second quarter is all of those front book, back book dynamics. So you've got loan front book and loan and securities front book, back book which is positive in the second, it's positive in the first quarter, it's positive in second quarter, it will be positive for the rest of the year although possibly diminishing a bit as loan rates stay where they are. But that's been offsetting the front book back book dynamic on the deposit side. And so I think you'll see, as I mentioned in my remarks, a significant abatement of deposit cost increases the farther away you get from the Fed rate rise in December. And so then -- so a combination of that front book, back book plus our balance sheet optimization initiatives is offsetting those other forces on the deposit side in 2Q and all you're left with is rates. So when you get out of the second quarter as rates stabilized both on the short and the long end. You see deposit costs stabilizing and therefore you're left with front book, back book on our fixed portfolio driving some uplift. And I think those are the dynamics that we see at the moment in terms of the back half of 2019.
Saul Martinez: So even if rates remain where they're at long end and rates remain where they're at. The Fed funds remain where it's at. You still have positive new money yields over portfolio yields on your loan and your securities books right now?
John Woods: We do. So in the first quarter that was 80 basis points or so in terms of that net difference in the first quarter for investments. As an example a variety of our loan books or you could call it ranging from 25 basis points all the way up to 150 basis points but basically almost every category has a positive front book, back book across all of our earning assets. And as if rates stay where they are, it's possible that will shrink a bit over time but it'll and maybe a portfolio too will eventually convert to something more neutral as you get later in the year. But all in, our overall portfolio as a positive front book by dynamic 50% of our loans are fixed and so that momentum continues through the rest of the year as a positive dynamic.
Saul Martinez: Got it. That's helpful. If I could change gears on credit. I think John in various forums recently and in the past you've talked about the challenging environment in the casual dining space. And can you just comment a little bit about where -- what you're seeing there. Is that a concern and what the size of the book is and then just more broadly what you're seeing in terms of credit and what drove the uptick in your loan loss provisioning guidance for 2Q, is that just normal the fact that it is so low and you're seeing some normal seasoning on the book?
Don McCree: So it's Don. I'll comment on casual dining, it's a relatively small portion of the book and it's actually coming down a little bit. So we're working through that which we signed a couple of quarters ago. We've really slowed down if not see certain segments of our franchisee in restaurant originations. So we don't see large loss content, it's not reflected in provisions already. So we feel like we've got our hands around that book and I'll just mention we had a charge-off this quarter which was in our real estate book which was reasonably significant. It's a kind of 2013 vintage origination, so it's quite old and we've been working it through our workout groups for about four, five years now. So it kind of went a little sideways, so we charged it off this quarter and almost --
Bruce Van Saun: Really it is idiosyncratic, I would add it's Bruce. But I think that was one that was in a unique bubble wrap and trying to part it over, so we don't see any read across anything else in commercial real estate.
Don McCree: And I agree that, that's true of the overall book. What we've seen is as problems over the last five or six quarters have been very idiosyncratic. We feel very good about the overall book and the condition of the economy and what we're seeing in terms of performance by our underlying credit.
Bruce Van Saun: Let me also add that credit class came down again.
Don McCree: And all the credit ratios are very historically low and we don't see those changing.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes.
John Woods: And I said it's just the outlook for 2Q being up a bit. I mean I think we've historically had a significant amount of recoveries that come through the book and credit has been excellent. And so the outlook there remains so but possibly recovery is moderating a bit and I'm not sure --
Bruce Van Saun: The overall [ph] LIBOR.
John Woods: Yes, exactly. So that's the reason for that.
Saul Martinez: Do you disclose the size of the casual dining book?
John Woods: No, no, I don't think we give.
Operator: Question will come from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ken Zerbe: Great, thanks morning. I was actually wondering, can you guys talk just a little bit about how your plans around your balance sheet optimization are changing now that Fed maybe done raising rates this year?
John Woods: Yes, I'll go ahead and start on that. I'd say I'm not sure they changed very much. I mean we've been talking about the broad strokes of that program primarily on the deposit side where you would focus on all of the things you've heard from Bruce earlier. In commercial, new interesting I think ways to fund our loan growth in the escrow space and in consumer a lot of the data analytics and efforts around customer experience that are driving DDA take up. So I mean, I think all of that remains just as important in a world where the Fed is not raising rates as it is in a world where they are. So that that continues in that direction. On the asset side similar I mean when you look at our rotation into we call it the asset categories that have really solid risk return profiles for us like such as student or unsecured investments we want to make in our commercial business to get more swings at the bat. With respect to our customers all of that is not meaningfully impacted by the Fed going on hold. I think that that continues and it's really something you would do with or without I think the Fed.
Bruce Van Saun: I'd say that the one thing there where we might be pivoting a little bit is that mortgage growth that we've had -- we'd like to taper that off a little bit and actually we could consider some sales of mortgages that we have on the balance sheet. So back in a low rate environment fully 30-year fixed on your books is a great trade. And so we think we can offset that. We've been talking for a while about how we're going to leverage our point-of-sale offering to some new partners. One of the things we're quite pleased about is that we've now signed several important new partners including one which we can mention today, ADT it's in the press release will be out shortly on that but there's several other significant ones that will come out over the next several weeks. John, you want to comment on that?
John Woods: I will just say we've got a very good pipeline. We felt like we built a very unique value proposition with the Apple program and there's tremendous interest in the marketplace and we've got a really strong pipeline and I think there will be more news after ADT. I'm really excited about ADT.
Ken Zerbe: Got it. Okay, perfect. And then your capital markets business held up really well this quarter especially relative to peers, looks like some of that was due to bond underwriting. Can you just remind us how your capital markets business or the business mix may differ from some of your peers?
John Woods: Sure. So I will take that. So first of all, we really have a very small equity business. So if you broadly talk about capital markets, I'd say ex-equity we do a little bit of equity in the REIT space with a partner who does the equity underwriting. Our business is really threefold, it's bond underwriting with both high yield and investment grade. It's syndicated financing which is largely leveraged syndicated financing aimed at the mid-market sponsor community, and thirdly it’s M&A. So this quarter we benefited from bond underwriting particularly high yield bond underwriting as things recovered from the weak market last year and there was some pent-up demand, so a lot of our clients issued in the high yield market. And then we saw Western Reserve in particular kick in and we had a quite, quite a strong M&A quarter and that we expect to continue through the end of the year both with Western Reserve and with Bowstring which was our latest acquisition. And the way I think about M&A is it took two or three quarters to have the capabilities on our platform to begin to see deal origination. And so our win rates are very high on the M&A side, our client base is very active. We did have quite a weak quarter in our syndicated financing business and that should be bouncing back as we go through the balance of the year. So what I like about the mix of our capital markets business is far more diversified than it was in terms of different fee streams a couple of quarters or a couple of years ago. So we're getting nice degrees of offset based on different markets being active.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And what I would also add to that, it’s Bruce, Ken is I think that what Don and his team have been able to do very effectively is marry the solution set by having our coverage officers work very closely with these enhanced product capabilities. So when we go out and call on clients we show up with value-added ideas and we're able to win the jump ball against very significant competition out there. We do a really good job of that and start to see the traction we get records -- capital markets speaks, we get records, FX and interest rates. So coming up with good ideas on how to hedge risks is also something that I think we've got huge traction. And so very pleased to see the maturation of the model and the very strong team approach in terms of how we're covering funds.
John Woods: And I'll just add to that Ken. We're very disciplined as we add new clients around capital deployment against opportunities where we will -- where we do think there will be good cross-sell. So I think our new business process of several years now is beginning to yield flow based on where we've deployed capital and added clients on a net basis.
Operator: And our next question will come from Erika Najarian from Bank of America.
Erika Najarian: Just had a follow-up question on the comments in capital return. I think there was some confusion on how to treat your press when investors were putting in your financials in the Fed template. And John, I just wanted to clarify you said that capital return would likely meet expectations. I have a consensus of about $2.15 billion right now for capital return, is that the bar that you're looking to potentially meet?
John Woods: Yes, without necessarily commenting on a particular number, we have seen a range of estimates externally where I think we're broadly in line with where the market expects our buyback capacity to be. We have that flexibility. I mean the Fed template as you know we're a Category 4 firm where we're subject to the Fed template this year. We overall have a glide path that that Fed template allows us to continue to execute against and we have a dividend return expectation over time of 35% to 40%. We've talked about our expectation of getting the CET1 ratio down to about 10.2% by the end of the year. So I think the main message is number one the Fed template allows us the flexibility to execute against what we want to do and we think that will deliver against broadly against what the market expects for buybacks in the windup.
Bruce Van Saun: And so the 10.2% projection for CET1 at year-end is still in production, so.
Erika Najarian: Got it. And just a follow-up Bruce in terms of the TOP 6 program that you're looking to announce, as we think about the potential impact right now the consensus is expecting something like a 57% efficiency ratio for your company this year. That's about in line with peers should we expect that TOP 6 could bring you to a position that's better than peers, let's say in the mid-50s from a natural efficiency standpoint?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, so we have a stated medium-term objective to bring that down to 54%. And so I think a TOP 6 like program is going to be required to accomplish that. So I do think it's important particularly if the Fed is done raising rates and maybe I will hold for a while here to get less in tailwinds than we had previously. So I think we have to go back and look at what are some of the offsets that you can deliver certainly control of your expense basis. One, but doing it smartly doing it in ways that actually provide the funding capacity just so by office, so that's what we're all about. Thanks.
Ellen Taylor: Operator, can you mute that, please. Okay.
Operator: Okay, please go ahead.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, another area that we're really focused on is the growth in the fee based businesses where I think we have gotten off to a great start on the commercial side in Q1 and the outlook remains strong for the year. We got off to a little bit of a rough start on the consumer side but the outlook for Q2 is quite, quite good on the consumer side. So I'd expect to see some bounce back in mortgage and then also bounce back in wealth. So things move around there's puts and takes but I think the expense base is going to be important and then also driving that fee growth.
Operator: And our next question in queue will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Ken Usdin: Hi, good morning guys. A follow-up on the capital structure question, it's nice to hear that that guide pack to 10.2% is intact and your long-term target you talked about in January to get to 10% CET1, some peers are distinctly talking about much lower than that at this point. And then given the tailoring in the Category 4 that you just talked about, how do you evaluate at what point you might be able to run the company even lower than 10%. And then how do you also evaluate the choice of how you choose to get there or was it just the buyback or just leaving room for balance sheet growth? Thanks guys.
Bruce Van Saun: Sure. So I'll go first, John you can chime in. But I think we're gradually bringing it down to 10% and we don't really take the decision though until we get there. And then I think we need to look at a number of considerations including where our peers, what's the regulatory and rating agency comfort with operating at a lower number including our own that's importantly comfort with being there. I think there's no reason structurally or from a business standpoint that we should maintain a ratio that's above peers, our kind of business risk profile certainly is in line with peers. In fact I think we're slightly on a prudent side. So if you look at how we model the stress scenarios we come out quite robust and even in that modeling certainly our credit losses were at a median or slightly better than the median. So I think we'll have that flexibility. When we think about how we deploy our capital obviously if we can deploy it smartly to further organic growth that's kind of Mission one. So if we can get loan growth, if we can do some of these accretive small acquisitions that broaden our capabilities, we can get more from our relationships on the commercial side and the consumer side those are things that we're continuing to put on the list ahead of buybacks I think frankly. But again if we certainly don't want to have capital lying around. So we'll try to keep that ratio sharp and relatively in line with peers. John?
John Woods: Yes, I would just say just to emphasize the last point, I think given where we are in our lifecycle, I think the opportunities to deploy capital organically and in strategic initiatives including fee based bolt-ons that we've been doing remain into the future. So that's job one is to put that capital to work on behalf of our shareholders in an accretive way. And then we monitor all the other sources and uses, the outlook for earnings et cetera, organic loan growth and then we take it from there. I think we also have another lever which is our capital stack is a little bit more oriented towards CET1 and some others and most peers have more preferreds outstanding than we do. So that's another lever we can look at over time that provides benefits as well. So just really solid cash strength in the capital positioning.
Bruce Van Saun: Five [ph] points to go.
John Woods: Yes.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes.
Ken Usdin: Yes, thanks and my sort of follow-up on that, John, you just hit on it was going to be just you did have done a couple of those preferreds to start to move the capital stack towards that more efficient place, you're only about halfway there, so is that something we should expect over time as you continue to bring CET1 down we logically see that preferred stack that went underneath it?
John Woods: Yes, I think that's logical over time. I mean we're not going to have commensurate to an exact execution day on that but I mean I think that we've done this in the right way. I mean as our ROTCE has improved over the years, it becomes much more appropriate to consider the repositioning of the capital stack such that if preferred, the cost of preferreds are attractive and they are versus ROTCE and we find a good execution point, we'll consider that. But that's a nice bit of flexibility as you heard earlier in terms of our ability to reallocate and remix our capital profile.
Operator: And our next question will come from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
Peter Winter: Good morning. In the prepared remarks you mentioned that net interest income was coming in a little bit lower for the full-year, is that mostly driven by less margin expansion than you originally thought?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. So it probably reaffirmed the full-year outlook. And I think whenever you start moving through the year there's going to be some modest puts and takes. I think when you look at NII; the volume side of that equation is solid. So I think we're still looking to be solidly in the loan growth range that we set out to achieve. I think the NIM given the flatness of the curve and some of what we've experienced here early on in the year will be maybe a couple of basis points lower than what we anticipated, still positive in terms of NIM for the year-on-year. But maybe there's a little leakage there. I say where we'll make that up is I think a more robust view on fees and a better performance on expenses. So our ability here is to protect PPNR I think is pretty solid. And then we've had beats in the past couple of years on credit. So we'll see how that plays out. I feel pretty good right now where we sit in terms of the credit outlook. So that gives us the confidence that broadly reaffirms the outlook, Peter.
Peter Winter: Thanks Bruce. And then just on credit, I'm wondering can you make any comments on how you're thinking about CECIL?
John Woods: Yes, I will go ahead and cover that. I mean as you saw we Regional Bank, Peter had some commentary that we were engaging with regulators and the fact beyond and just more recently that has been -- that has been adjudicated to result in moving forward full steam ahead with executing on CECIL. We never really stopped our programs. We are launching data related pilots for the pipes and plumbing in the first quarter here and full dress rehearsals as you get into the second and third quarter on CECIL just from a process standpoint. Later in the year we'll have some more views about what that will do and how that might impact the day one capital impact of adopting CECIL. But in general as you know longer dated loans will have a bigger impact than some other categories. We do think that CECIL is cyclical which is not exactly what we think is the right way to portray exposures going into downturn. And it's very sensitive to your outlook of the economy going forward. So we are on track for our internal program, we'll talk to you a little -- talk to you some more about this later in the year in terms of the impacts but we do think that our capital glide path and our ability to execute against that is not at risk as a result of CECIL.
Operator: And our next question in queue comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.
Gerard Cassidy: Can you guys share with us clearly the direct deposit -- the Digital Deposit Program has gathered a good amount of deposits. Can you share with us, are you hoping to develop deeper relationships with those customers aside from just the savings product that they're using right now? And if so are they going to be some metrics that we can look at as outsiders to see the success of deepening those relationships?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. So let me start, it’s Bruce and I will flip it over to Brad for more color. But I would have to say that this is the tremendous success this development since Citizen Access launched and I described all these goals. So what's goal today is gathering deposits in this environment, gathering new customers. We have $4.6 billion in deposits, we have over 60,000 new households that are customers in Citizens Bank and we have developed digital capabilities and the ability to use data that I think puts us in the Vanguard of our peer group and that's cold us well, so a lot of real positives coming out of this. I think that the next day now this is up and running we certainly want to fine tune the offerings to make sure we're gathering those deposits cost effectively, while meeting customer expectations. But if you have 60,000 customers what else can you do with them. And so that's really a Phase 2 project that we kicked off. And if you think about it Gerard, we had roughly 60% of our consumer loan products today are digitally originated. So there's a possibility -- there's a potential we have a digital robot advisory service that we can also marry with ability to Skype a person right here. So there's a hybrid -- there's pure digital event, there's a hybrid person/digital offering that also could work through that channel. So there's some really interesting things to think about but I think it's going to take us a while to actually bring that to market. With that, I will flip it over to Brad.
Brad Conner: Yes, Bruce, I think you've covered it really well. There are some immediate things we're doing to enhance the platform including the fact that we're adding trust accounts which we launched with our trust account. But we see tremendous opportunity, it's a perfect client base for us, it hits right in our target customer segment of mass affluent and affluent customers. Digitally savvy as you mentioned we built Specify which is one of the first digital advisory capabilities in the market. We think that's a perfect complement to this customer base and then several lending opportunities and lending products that we're working on all of those and what are the next steps for continuing to enhance the relationships.
Gerard Cassidy: Very good. And then pivoting to the loan growth which again was strong for the quarter as you guys pointed out and I think you guys highlighted that in the commercial real estate area, you saw some growth in the office and multi-family. Can you give us some color on the geography, where are you guys seeing the best growth geographically in your footprint and outside the footprint?
John Woods: I think it's our real estate business is national and it's really, I'd say it moves quarter-to-quarter. So I'll give you two examples of expansion. We actually move people into Texas and people into Los Angeles where we have seen growth over the past few quarters. So that's both be active on the existing book of business but also do some origination. But it's really across the Southeast and in growth areas of the country where we're seeing the highest levels of growth. I say our real estate business in general, the growth will slow down over the balance of the year and that's strategic because we're focusing on the better end of the opportunity set that we see. So we have to originate a fair amount just to replace what's on our books already. But I think you should expect to see our real estate growth on a gross basis be a little slower than it's been in the past from a strategic standpoint.
Bruce Van Saun: And I would also say there's still attractive opportunities in the footprint in Boston and the Seaport District for example. So it's a combination of things that are in the traditional footprints some these growth markets that Don mentioned. And when it comes to office, we typically focus on owner occupied, so there's a low risk type of project that we're financing.
John Woods: And what's flat lining is really multifamily and anything retail. We're really not growing those with any kind of significance.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question here will come from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
Marty Mosby: Thanks for taking the questions. Got kind of a rapid fire here of about three or four questions, your mortgage hedging this quarter was a negative, was that just unusual, some basis risk in there or were you just not had it hedged or as a percent of the portfolio or you make any adjustments. So is this going to be unusual or should this be something we expect as rates go up and down have positives and negatives?
John Woods: Yes, Marlin, I will take that. This is John. So I mean I think that you're going to have, when you have an asset of this size that is $600 million, $700 million depending upon if we have a split between fair value and low comp but large assets, it's a complex asset to hedge and you're going to have some variability from quarter-to-quarter. Last quarter we had a $2 million net positive MSR valuation net of hedge. This quarter we had $2 million negative MSR valuation net of hedge. So quarter-over-quarter that's $4 million. There were other rate impacts as well. When you look at outside of just the straight hedging piece you also have to estimate what's your amortization is just in the mean servicing P&L and we had an increase of $7 million from $25 million to $30 million -- $32 million in amortization that was largely rate related as well. So all-in and quarter-over-quarter you got $11 million of largely rate driven MSR related valuation impacts. So hopefully that gives you some context.
Marty Mosby: It helps and I really appreciate your guidance. So this is kind of a statement as well as a question. We talked about the front book versus the back book. That's really what we've been trying to outline for investors is the fact that you have this historical spread between what's still in the market even though rates have come down versus what's on the books just because rates were so low for so long. And then over time that's kind of a grind up as you kind of just see that coming through. And in relation to that, you mentioned some balance sheet flexibility. I just didn't know if that was liquidity wise because your loan to deposit ratio would come down or there was some other flexibility that you were talking about there?
John Woods: Yes, I think that we have some flexibility primarily due to the fact that we've had a really strong deposit quarter after several prior quarters that were strong. But our first quarter was particularly strong and that led the LDRs come down to around 95%. I mean that provides some flexibility. We have -- we've demonstrated the ability to grow deposits at least as quickly as we grow loans. When you think about, as a good example, when you think about the big impact that growth has on the increase in interest bearing deposit costs as were 16 basis points in the quarter approximately half of that was driven by just deposit growth. So if you get ahead of things a little bit, then and you can fund your growth without necessarily having to grow a lot in future quarters. That has a beneficial impact and underpinning of net interest margin going forward.
Bruce Van Saun: The other thing, so John is describing the flexibility on the deposit side that we have. I think we had some nice flexibility on the asset side as well. So we've been well positioned to have an origination engine both on the commercial side and the consumer side that is pretty robust that gives us the wherewithal to then look into the back book and make asset sales and we made approximately $300 million of sales in the first quarter. And so we can look to do that as we go through the year and still report net loan growth. So that's all part of BSA -- BSR it's working for us on the deposit side but it's also working for us on the assets side.
Marty Mosby: And then just two bigger picture questions. You've been the easiest bank to kind of estimate what's going to be market consensus every quarter. Just wanted to get you to kind of think about, why and this may be a highlight for us because you all do ask for models every quarter. So I know you're tracking, what are buyers putting out there but what are the earnings surprises that people just start catching up to. And then Bruce I just wanted you to give us a little bit of a thought given some of the other transformational let's call mergers or placements of banks in the country. How does Citizens fit into this competitive landscape? I mean how do you see the bank being able to evolve over the last five years really talking about how you're competing a lot with everybody around you but just wanted to kind of get your thought on how you fit in there?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, sure. So with respect to the consistent track record of being able to beat pretty much every quarter that we've been a public company, I just think it's a reflection of our very strong focus on execution and we're all I think very aligned on where we're trying to take the banks and what the key drivers of a successful turnaround were and what the next phase is going to require to become a Top performing bank. So I think we've got great people, great leadership team, and we've good alignment through the organization that people know of what's expected of them. They're empowered and then we hold them accountable and they're doing a great job. So hats off to our colleagues here at Citizens. With respect to where we fit into the landscape, I do think we have really come a long way from where we started. So foreign ownership foreign parent had a bunch of difficulties and left us with a strong potential franchise but had accumulated some baggage, some lack of investment in key areas like technology, our people program, and our risk capabilities, build business model wasn't fully built out to really serve customers on an integrated way both on the commercial side and the consumer side. Balance sheet had shrunk to a position where our profitability was really emasculated. So we had a lot of work to do and I think we've now certainly made our way back into the pack and in many cases I feel that we're doing better than our results indicate and certainly better than our stock price would indicate. But I'll leave that for another day. But certainly on the commercial side, I'm so pleased that Don and his folks have put together the level of talent that we have, people who worked in big banks, who are covering the middle market and the big corporate clients so well and then we can go out and we can lead deals we could have money center banks on the right of us. We can go out and compete for an interest rate hedge and win it against money center banks which we did several times in the first quarter. We've got really, really good talent and we're well positioned. And then on the consumer side, some of the things that Brad talked about Citizens Access and our fintech partnerships and thinking about end-to-end customer experiences and the customer satisfaction is moving up nicely. I think we're doing a really good job there too. So I think we have a strategy and a capability to continue to drive this company forward and become a great bank. But I certainly would have to say as you look around the landscape and people are making scale arguments. You always keep an open mind about those things, if there's opportunities to benefit our shareholders, we have an open mind towards that but I think the more important news is that we're well positioned to continue on the path that we're onto it.
Operator: And it does conclude the questions for today.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. It was great. I know it’s a busy morning for you all; you probably have to hop to the next call. But certainly appreciate that you dialed in today and we appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. Thanks for participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-18 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad, and I'll be your operator on the call today. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor: Thanks so much, Brad. Happy 2019 everybody. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Our earnings release, presentation and financial supplement are available at investor.citizensbank.com. Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results along with our outlook for the year and then we will open the call for questions. Once again, we're pleased to have Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking with us today. And of course, I'm required to remind you that our comments will include forward-looking statements, that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations, and can be found in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today. We'd also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our filings. And with that, it's all yours, Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, Ellen. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We're pleased to report another strong quarter today, with underlying net income up 36% and diluted EPS up 38% year-over-year. These results were paced by solid loan growth of 5% year-on-year, continued NIM expansion, which combined with good expense discipline drove 5% underlying positive operating leverage, excluding Franklin American Mortgage acquisition. Our underlying ROTCE improved to 14.1%. The underlying efficiency ratio dropped to 56.7%. Our success in hitting our new medium-term financial targets has led us to raise them again, which we will cover later in the call. For the full year, our results were also strong. Underlying net income was up 32%, and diluted earnings per share was up 38%. Our PPNR growth was 13%. We consistently exceeded expectations each quarter during the year given our disciplined execution along with favorability on credit. We feel very positive about the accomplishments in progress that we made in 2018. Some of the highlights from my perspective include: first, strong execution of our TOP and our BSO programs; we had excellent progress on our customer, colleague and community agendas; we had some really strong technology innovation, including the launch of Citizens Access, reaching 10 fintech partnerships and great momentum on our digital and data agenda; acceleration of our branch transformation effort with 109 branch actions delivered; and also the smooth opening of our new campus in Johnston, Rhode Island. We made 2 smart fee-based acquisitions, Franklin American Mortgage and Clarfeld Financial Advisors, and we delivered strong returns of capital to shareholders including 2 dividend increases with a dividend now up 45% year-on-year. We also added some great talent to the company including Ned Kelly and Terry Lillis to the board, and Michael Ruttledge, recently, as our new Head of Technology. Now as we've many peer banks, there is a disconnect between our progress on the field and our stock price in 2018, but that said, we are focused on what we can control and our expectation is that if we continue to execute well, run the bank better and better and make the right investments to grow our franchise value, then the stock will recover and better reflect our true value. The market's been concerned with the possibility of recession and rising credit costs. Our view is that a recession is unlikely in '19 or '20, and the economy is on a sound footing. We have been highly disciplined in the process of growing our balance sheet and our expectation is that we will perform better than the median super regional in the next downturn. We did moderate our loan growth somewhat in 2018 relative to our beginning of the year outlook, and we've steered away from riskier lending on both the commercial and consumer sides. During the choppy Q4 loan markets, we did not take any underwriting losses or have any hung deals. We've provided our usual detailed guidance for 2019 in our slide deck, which John will cover in a few minutes. The blueprint will seem very familiar, reasonable loan growth, some NIM expansion, better growth on fees, good expense discipline and positive operating leverage. Credit provision, while normalizing somewhat, should remain well behaved. And we will continue to prudently manage our capital base. So in summary, our expectation is for another year of good execution and further progress across the board. With that, let me turn it over to John.
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce. And good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter with improving results and a great finish to a year marked by steady execution and significant progress against our targets. We continue to run the bank better, and we are entering 2019 with nice momentum. I'll touch on some of the slides in our earnings presentation. So if you pull those up, it may assist in following along. Some highlights for the quarter are shown on Page 4. We grew our underlying EPS 38% year-on-year. We continued delivering robust positive operating leverage 5% year-on-year, excluding the impact of the Franklin American Mortgage acquisition. And we did this while making the long-term investments required for sustainable success. We continued to make progress on improving returns with underlying ROTCE for the quarter of 14.1%, up 61 basis point linked quarter and 3.7% year-over-year. We continue to focus on growing our customer base and loan portfolios across our Consumer and Commercial businesses, while also expanding and investing in our fee-based capabilities. This has led to consistently strong revenue growth. We have been disciplined on expenses giving our TOP programs and mindset of continuous improvement. This has created the capacity to make significant investments in technology, digital, data and customer experience, which positions us well for the future. This plan and our ability to execute provide a strong foundation and outlook for 2019. On Page 5, we provide information on some notable items this quarter, including the impact of an additional $29 million benefit tied to 2017 tax legislation. This was partially offset by other notable items totaling $26 million aftertax, largely associated with TOP V, including several real estate initiatives such as accelerated branch closures. We also recorded $12 million of aftertax integration costs related to the Franklin American acquisition. In order to make it easier to see our core trends, we will largely focus on our results without these notable items. On Page 7, you can see that we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of 5% excluding the impact of Franklin. We also delivered an underlying efficiency ratio just under 57%. And our underlying PPNR growth year-over-year was 13% excluding Franklin. Moving to Page 10. We are pleased that despite a fairly competitive landscape, we continued to drive disciplined balance sheet growth and delivered a 2% sequential quarter increase in net interest income. And our net interest margin increased 3 basis points in the quarter, reflecting continued expansion in earning asset yields, with deposit costs in line with our expectations. Turning to fees on Page 11. Underlying fees increased $10 million despite a challenging market environment in the fourth quarter. This was driven by strength in global markets and the full quarter effect of Franklin. In global markets, FX generated excellent results up 16% quarter-over-quarter, due to elevated customer activity against a volatile but mostly range-bound U.S. dollar index. Our capital market fees were relatively flat linked quarter despite some major volatility and disruption in the loan and debt markets. Our loan syndications fees were up 20% linked quarter with very strong volumes leading to a record number of lead and joint lead transactions for the fourth quarter and the year. This was offset by lower bond underwriting fees given limited issuance in November and December. Additionally, we had a strong quarter and M&A revenue as we gained leverage from our Western Reserve Partners acquisition. On the Consumer side of the house, we now have a full quarter of fees from Franklin and the integration is on track. We also saw continued traction in our Wealth business with a 4% linked-quarter increase in managed money revenues and 19% growth year-over-year. On Page 12, we continue to focus on balancing expense discipline with the need to fund investments to drive future revenue growth. As a result, excluding the impact of Franklin, linked quarter expenses were down $5 million, reflecting the benefit of a decrease in FDIC insurance expense. We utilized some of this benefit to fund strategic growth initiatives while maintaining strong expense discipline overall. Let's move on to Page 13 and discuss the balance sheet. We continue to focus on prudently growing our balance sheet in a fairly competitive environment. We saw some nice growth in commercial loans in our industry verticals and in our geographic expansion areas. We remain very selective about CRE but are still finding some attractive opportunities for growth in areas like tenant-secured office and industrial distribution facilities. On the retail side, we continue to see good traction in some of our attractive risk-adjusted return categories like education and unsecured as well as important categories like mortgage. Overall, we grew core loans by 2% linked quarter and 5% year-over-year, notwithstanding the impact from the planned runoff in auto, noncore and leasing, which was around $1.7 billion or 1.5% year-over-year. Core loan yields improved by 14 basis points in the quarter, which was ahead of the 11 basis point improvement we saw in the third quarter. We continue to see good results from our balance sheet optimization efforts, which in the quarter delivered about 4 basis points of 14 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year before the impact of Franklin. Turning to Page 14. I am pleased with what we were able to accomplish in deposits this quarter. We continue to do a nice job of growing deposits, which were up 1% linked quarter and 4% year-over-year. In particular, we continue to see gains in DDA balances, which were up about 3% year-on-year and approximately 1% before the impact of Franklin. This is the sixth consecutive quarter we have grown DDA on a year-over-year basis. This growth is led by strength on the consumer side where our deposit initiatives are really paying off and DDA balances are up 4.5% year-on-year, ex Franklin. Our total deposit costs were well controlled, up 9 basis points, which was better than the 10 basis points we saw last quarter. Interest-bearing deposit costs rose at a slower pace again this quarter, increasing 12 basis points compared with a 14 basis point increase in the third quarter and 15 basis point increase in the second quarter. Our cumulative beta on interest-bearing deposits is in the mid-30s, as expected, and remains in line with our overall expectations given where we are in the rate cycle. We are benefiting from investments we've been making in Consumer that began back in 2016 in areas like enhancing our product suite, improving the customer experience through our customer journeys work and in analytics to improve our customer targeting. In Commercial, we are making investments to build out additional product capabilities like escrow services, and are rolling out our new cash management platform in 2019. Also, Citizens Access has contributed nicely to our funding diversification and optimization of deposit levels and costs. By year-end, we reached about $3 billion in deposits, having launched in mid-July. While this remains a relatively modest part of our overall deposit strategy, we continue to be very pleased with the progress so far. We now have over 30,000 customers through Citizens Access, with 96% of these deposits from new deposit customers and the average account size is about $72,000. Year-over-year, our asset yields expanded 55 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher rates and the impact of our BSO initiatives. Our total cost of funds was up 44 basis points, reflecting the impact of higher rates and a continued shift to greater long-term funding. This included the impact of the $750 million senior debt issuance late in the first quarter of 2018. Next, let's move to Page 15 and cover credit. Overall, credit quality continues to be excellent, reflecting the continued mix shift towards higher-quality, lower-risk retail loans and an improving risk profile in our commercial book. The nonperforming loan ratio improved to 68 basis points of loans this quarter, down from 79 basis points a year ago. The net charge-off rate of 29 basis points for the fourth quarter was relatively stable linked quarter and year-over-year. Retail net charge-offs reflect improvement in auto, which helped offset expected seasoning in the unsecured portfolio. Commercial net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were up modestly compared with the prior year, which benefited from higher recoveries. Overall, we feel good about credit metrics and trends in the book including a continued decline in criticized asset levels. Our allowance to loans coverage ratio ended the quarter at 1.06%, reflecting continued improvement in the loan mix towards higher-quality retail portfolios and improved rating agency-equivalent risk ratings in Commercial. The NPL coverage ratio improved to 156% as we saw 4% reduction in NPLs linked quarter with continued runoff in the noncore portfolio. Investors continued to be worried about a challenging macroeconomic environment and the potential for increased credit costs, but we continue to feel good about our risk management talent and profile, and our overall credit quality trends continue to be variable. We've included some good slides on Page 27 through 31 from a recent conference presentation on this topic, in case you missed them. On Page 16, we continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions, ending the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.6% compared to 10.8% in the third quarter. This quarter, we repurchased $300 million of common stock and returned a total of $427 million to shareholders including dividends. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.32 a share, which is a 19% increase over the prior quarter. With this increase, the dividend is now 45% higher than it was a year ago. Our achievements against our enterprise-wide initiatives are highlighted on Page 17. We continue to make traction on our balance sheet optimization efforts as we recycle capital out of lower-return categories like auto and leasing, where the core yields have improved and the portfolios have increased significantly, and we redeployed that capital against higher-return categories like our education refi and Merchant Finance portfolios as well as in higher-return relationships in Commercial. Balance sheet optimization contributed 5 basis points of our 17 basis points full year 2018 versus 2017 margin improvement. Additionally, we continue to deliver beyond expectations in our TOP programs, where we now expect TOP IV to deliver about $115 million in pretax run rate benefits. As we work on expanding our capabilities, in Consumer we completed the acquisition of Clarfeld Financial Advisors. Clarfeld provides a unique opportunity to accelerate our strategy of building a highly competitive wealth management business to serve some of the most affluent markets in the country where we operate. They have sophisticated high net worth and ultrahigh net worth offerings that will really complement our wealth platform. Most noteworthy in the quarter on the commercial side is the launch of commodities hedging services as well as a modest high-yield sales and trading operation. Given a further tax benefit from the 2017 tax legislation, we were able to accelerate a number of our efficiency initiatives including a significant acceleration of our branch modernization efforts. And as we bring TOP IV to a successful close, our TOP V initiatives are well underway. Bottom line, we've been able to successfully lean forward with our longer-term strategy, while also executing well and delivering strong results in the near term. On Page 18, you can see the steady and impressive progress we are making against our financial targets. This quarter, we hit the middle of the range of our 13% to 15% medium-term ROTCE target set in January 2018. Since third quarter of '13, our ROTCE has improved from 4.3% to 14.1% underlying and our efficiency ratio has improved by 11 percentage points from 68% to 57% and EPS continues on a very strong trajectory as well up to $0.98 on an underlying basis from $0.26. On Page 19, we review our full year performance against the guidance we provided at the start of 2018 as it's always good to hold ourselves accountable. You can see mostly green ticks on the right column demonstrating another year of strong execution against the backdrop of slower loan growth across the industry. We remain focused on improving the fee income line through both organic initiatives to expand capabilities as well as through smart targeted acquisitions. On Page 20, we detail our guidance for 2019. Quite similar to 2018, with good top line growth, a 3% underlying positive operating leverage target excluding Franklin and Clarfeld, further efficiency ratio improvement and capital normalization. A few points of color. We expect reasonably strong loan growth similar to 2018 in the range of 3.5% given the unique opportunities to capitalize investments in people and products. Growth will continue to be focused in the areas we believe offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. We project NIM to be of low to mid-single digits despite no short rate increases on the forecast and a flattish curve. This reflects continued execution of our balance sheet optimization efforts. We expect continued growth in noninterest income in the 11% to 13% range as we leverage our investments and expand the capabilities and continue to invest for the future. This is 4% to 6%, excluding the impact of Franklin and Clarfeld. We expect credit quality to remain well controlled with provision normalizing towards the range of $400 million to $450 million. We expect our CET1 at the end of the year to be around 10.2% with a dividend payout ratio in the range of 30% to 35%. Our outlook for the first quarter is on page 21 and it reflects continued momentum in both our top and bottom line results. The first quarter is typically a seasonally softer quarter for us given several factors, including day count, seasonal activity levels and FICA taxes associated with incentive compensation. We expect linked quarter average loan growth to be around 1% given strong commercial lending pipelines and solid growth in education and retail unsecured. We expect NIM and NII to be broadly stable reflecting no rate hike and no impact on NII. Noninterest income should be broadly stable as a rebound in capital market fees is expected to offset seasonal impacts. We expect noninterest expense to be up in the low to mid-single digits given seasonal factors like FICA taxes on incentives. In addition, we expect provision expense to remain relatively stable. And finally, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to end the first quarter around 10.5%. Overall, our view for the quarter reflects continued strong execution against our plan. So now, let me turn it back to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, John. Turning to Page 22. Let's shift gears and focus on where we're taking Citizens over the medium term. We have a mission to really make a difference for our customers, colleagues and communities so that they can reach their potential. Banks that can deliver this will build long-term franchise value and stand out in a crowded banking landscape. And we are committed to getting the balance right between building long-term franchise value while also delivering consistent earnings growth and attractive returns. The bottom of the page shows where we will differentiate to be successful. First off is our culture. We have a very powerful customer-centric culture. Next is our discipline around how we're trying to run the bank better each and everyday. I think our financial and operating discipline is fairly unique amongst the regional banks. And lastly, we are committed to excellence being a trusted advisor, having great leaders, having great digital capabilities, a great ability to use data, those things that will really distinguish us. On Page 23, let me identify some of the keys to taking our financial performance to the next level. There's 3 things that I would point to that are listed here on this page. First, what's gotten us this far are the same things that should propel us further. So having a top leadership team, having a good game plan, a good ability to execute and make the investments that position us for long-term growth, those things will continue to propel us forward. I look at what we've accomplished over the past 5 years as a great foundation for an even better next 5 years. Next, the enterprise-wide initiatives like our TOP program and our balance sheet optimization program still have a good amount of running room, and they are fairly differentiating for us relative to our peers. And then lastly, we're doing a very good job of not only delivering and putting points on the board with our short-term execution, but we're spending a lot of time thinking about our long-term strategy, thinking about what's changing in the banking environment, what's changing in technology, what are the investments we need to make to continue to be successful and position us to drive strong franchise value. And it boils down to some extent to a growth mindset, to look for those opportunities where we can find new revenue pools, new ways of doing business, new ways of serving customers, and we feel good about our ability to do just that. On Page 24, we present our new medium-term financial targets. You can see that we've outlined our expectations for the overall economic environment, which is relatively constructive. Our the medium term, we expect to deliver continued improvement in ROTCE, moving our target range up by 1% to 14% to 16%. We are not expecting much in the way of further rate increases and while GDP growth will slow relative to 2018, we do not expect a recession anytime soon. The key to the continued ROTCE improvement is continuing to deliver positive operating leverage, and there TOP and BSO will be appointed to this given the potential for fewer tailwinds from the environment. We expect to see continued efficiency ratio improvement down towards 54%, we also expect to see some normalization in credit from the excellent performance that we're seeing today. And we continue to be focused on returning capital to our shareholders through our repurchase program and targeting a dividend payout of 35% to 40%. Over this time frame, we would expect to reduce our CET1 ratio towards our target of around 10%. So to sum up, on Page 25, we feel that we've delivered strong results in Q4 and for the full year 2018. We are focused on growing the bank in profitable and sustainable ways and we will continue to deliver improved efficiency and effectiveness. We feel our balance sheet remains robust and our credit position is in great shape. And as we head into 2019, we feel very good about our ability to grow the business and drive towards our new targets. As you know, we've been a public company now for about 4 years. At the outset, we had a lot of work to do to, to address the issues that arose from the challenges faced by RBS. Today, the feeling inside Citizens is that we've turned the corner. We've addressed many of the challenges we faced at our IPO. We have demonstrated our ability to set a course, develop a plan and execute that plan. We have a long-standing effort to drive ROTCE higher, drive our efficiency ratio down, normalize the capital ratio and grow EPS. And we have made good steady progress on that path, quarter in and quarter out. We are now in a new phase that we're calling Aiming For Excellence, on our way towards becoming a top-performing regional bank. So with that, Operator, let's open it up for some questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will go to line of Scott Siefers of Sandler O'Neill.
Robert Siefers: Let's see. First question, so fees had little bit of noise in the fourth quarter just given the seizure in the capital markets, but it looks like you got traction in most of the other major line items. I guess just as you look out at -- into 2019, within your guidance, can you maybe, either John or Bruce, talk a little about sort of the complexion and the main drivers that you see to get to you -- to your guide for the full year?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I'll start, John, you can offer additional color. But I think the first area that will really power the kind of underlying 4% to 6% fee growth that we have excluding Franklin and Clarfeld is a bounce-back year in Capital Markets. So we see good pipelines going into the first quarter. The bond markets are starting to loosen and so I think we'll see some good revenues coming out of loan syndications. I think we've got really good traction now in our M&A business. We're going a good job of cross-selling that, the Western Reserve capabilities into our customer base, so we feel good about that. Our Global Markets FX and IRP capability continues to grow. We're doing more than we did under RBS. We're doing a good job of penetrating the customer base. So those would be, I think, the key drivers on the commercial side. We are rolling out a new cash management platform so we have ambition to also pick up the growth a bit in Treasury Solutions. On the Consumer side, I think Wealth is well positioned for success this year. We've made, I think, the right investments to get the right size of sales force in place, the right approach to selling, the right product capability. We're doing more managed money sales. So I think we have a very good outlook for underlying wealth even excluding what we're doing with Clarfeld. And then our card business also, I think, we're going to make some progress. We have reinvigorated that a little bit and we're starting to see some signs of growth there. Anything you'd like to add, John?
John Woods: Yes, no, I think you pretty much covered the highlights. I think the key message being that even without the deals, Clarfeld and Franklin, we're seeing nice growth and then you will see the full year effects of both Franklin and Clarfeld that you'll see that's also built into our guidance. But I think you hit the important points without Franklin and Clarfeld on both Commercial and Consumer.
Robert Siefers: Perfect. And then separately appreciate the new medium-term targets. I had one quick question on the updated capital ratios. So just if I look at things, you guys, obviously, have a very robust starting point. Just curious as you're looking at refreshing the targets if there's any thought to becoming, perhaps, even a bit more aggressive than the 10% CET1 target? And just overall what the thinking was in how you arrived at 10% as the appropriate number?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. So if you recall, last January, we had a 10% to 10.25% as our target range. We've taken the 10.25% range out and so we just moved the target to 10%. I do think we're going through a transition where the regional banks may look to push the capital ratios down a bit. There is -- the Fed proposal's out. And as we've said in the past, we don't see any reason why we can't operate at the median of our peers. So if that moves down to 9.5%, say, then I think you could see us, in the future, making adjustment and over time bring that back to where the peers are. So we are -- that may be a tad conservative to leave it at 10%. That's where we're leaving it for now. Obviously, it would drive up and have positive implications on our ROTCE if we ran it at a little more levered.
John Woods: Yes, it's okay. Maybe just add that I think it served us well to have this gradual glide path that we've been on. Given that, as Bruce mentioned earlier, we just went IPO 4 years ago, and we continue to find new opportunities to deploy capital, which is clearly our primary goal to deploy capital in excess of cost of capital and so whether that's through loan growth or targeted fee-based acquisitions, we've been pleased with the flexibility that this glide path has created for us. So we'll continue to balance that as we look towards that target.
Operator: Next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
Erika Najarian: So, Bruce, we heard you loud and clear that you noted -- somehow your stock gets more of a discount when the market is worried about a recession, and we appreciate all the back data that you've given us. Given that everybody's credit quality looks great right now, and the underlying FICO looks similar across your peers, maybe give us a little more perspective? I think you brought up a good point that you were only a public company 4 years ago and so perhaps give us perspective on the catch up that you had to do since you emerged out of RBS and how that has contributed to above peer growth rates?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, sure, Erika. I'll start with that point first and there's a good slide in the appendix that shows that as RBS ran into its challenges and needed to raise capital levels, Citizens being owned by RBS had to rundown its assets, did not receive TARP funding. And so when you ultimately delever and you're in a high fixed-cost business, it really hurts your profitability. So part of our strategy here in recovering the bank's profitability was we needed to grow assets and gain that leverage back. And I think we've done that in a very, very disciplined way. On the Consumer side, we've decided to grow our mortgage business, which brings two things. It brings fees but it also brings high-quality assets. But then we also look for some niches like education refinance loans, where we're one of the leaders, if not the leader, in the market, which is I think a very great product, a, for the borrower and for society but also good for us in terms of risk-adjusted returns. And then our merchant financing partnerships with Apple and others and stay tuned, more to come, those also I think offer very good risk-adjusted returns and we have typically a loss-sharing arrangement with our partner. So I feel really good on the Consumer side that we've been disciplined and we've had a desire to grow but we've been very careful in where we're growing. And then on the Commercial side, similarly, we've scaled up the business by hiring some great bankers. We've got really good credit people, starting with Don, who is here with me in the room but also on our credit team. And so I think we've brought over some new relationships to the bank that come with the bankers that we hire, the seasoned banker that we hired. So we've grown in our industry verticals, which tend to be bigger companies, which tend to be better credits and when we've gone into new regions, we tend to focus on the bigger companies there as well, which tend to be higher-quality credit. So another slide in the appendix shows that even just over the past year, the quality of the credit book in Commercial and in Consumer has improved. So we are not growing for growth sake. We're growing in very disciplined fashion, both on the Commercial side and the Consumer side.
Erika Najarian: And my follow-up question is as we think about net interest margin dynamics, looking forward, if the Fed is on a prolonged pause, how should we think about the dynamics beyond 1Q '19? And typically in your previous observations, how many quarters after the last rate hike does deposit repricing start really tapering off?
John Woods: Yes, I'll go ahead and take that one. So we -- it's hard to know exactly but I think we model out something in the neighborhood of 6 to 12 months post the final Fed hike where deposit costs lag starts to continue to burn in, a little bit higher earlier in that period and just kind of tapers off over that first year is how we model it out. I think the dynamics you should think about is, remember, our portfolio is about 50% floating, about 50% fixed and even if the Fed doesn't hike, we still have this momentum of that front book on the 50% that's fixed that continues to reprice over the remaining lives of those assets as long as loan rates don't fall. And so that's why you're seeing the fact that we're still confident that we can continue to drive NIM growth because of that dynamic in terms of how we're organized, and that will be net positive. In addition to that, we have our management's actions and BSO that we will add to that, that will help solidify our confidence that we can continue to drive NIM going forward.
Operator: And our next question comes from line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Matthew O'Connor: I just want to follow up on the asset quality question because -- I agree with Erica, the bottom line is you've been delivering very strong results and I do think in a selloff, people worry about your credit quality, even though all the metrics have been very strong. And I think the slide you have on Page 28 that shows the commercial book and how the quality has been improving, it's helpful. But there isn't a lot of focus on things like leveraged lending, which I'm not really sure people fully understand if that really is where the risk is and what it is, but maybe just talk a little more detail about the process of how you think about managing risk in the commercial book, what the -- how involved you are, Bruce, which I would guess is very involved, as you think about some of the big credits? And just how you can change this perception that's out there, which seems to be blown out of proportion in my opinion.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I agree with that, Matt, and let me start, and then Don certainly is well positioned to offer the color on this. At the top of the house, we want to have diversity and granularity in terms of our credit exposures and so we do run a leveraged lending limit and we kind of run it very tightly and try to get a lot of throughput against that limit. So the goal, ultimately, when we are doing sponsored leveraged loans, for example, is to serve customers that we've known for a long time, that we have confidence that they're good operators, help them finance the deals that they want to do and then limit our hold position and view that as really originate-to-distribute kind of business and I think we've been quite successful at that. And I think you can just see in the fourth quarter when the markets were seizing up that we didn't take underwriting losses, we didn't have hung deals. I think we have a good sense for where the markets are. So and then the other aspect is if you look at Commercial Real Estate, that's another kind of typical worry bead that you have to stay very focused on, what's your limit overall? How much exposure do you want to take? I would say there that there we're -- our limit is quite a bit under our peer level of exposure still today, and so there is a slide in the appendix that shows that. And I think again, the question you need to focus on granularity, making sure that you are not overweighted in any particular class like office or multifamily, making sure that you have geographic diversity, making sure you're banking really good operators that you've known for a long time. And I think we apply those same disciplines on the CRE side as well on leveraged loan. So a lot of this gets to people and leadership. Feel really good about Don, feel good about the whole credit team, Rob Allen runs commercial credit. Very experienced people. And I guess you almost have to go through a cycle to prove it, but when you run the CCAR results, we're kind of in the pack. We are kind of median. So for people to be disproportionately worrying about our credit because we're relatively new company doesn't seem to be sensible. Anyway, with that, I'll turn it over to Don.
Donald McCree: Yes. I think you hit most of the high points, Bruce. So I think it starts to decline selection first and foremost, so where we've long-standing relationships with the vast majority whether it be sponsors or corporate clients we're doing business with. Our growth of the margin as Bruce said, in the growth regions tends to be larger companies, and we've -- we purposely have stayed away from the middle market in those areas because I do worry about adverse selection as if we do get wobbly. So we're dealing with better more nimble, larger companies. The second thing that you've mentioned, Bruce, is origination for distribution. Virtually, everything we do in the risk side of thing, we distribute the vast majority. You heard there's a lot of commentary out in the system about the nonbanks and the nonbanks taking share from the banks, but that's where most of the residual risk is going on the leverage -- lending portfolios. We have very granular holds, I'd say, in our leverage lending books. Our holds are in the $10 million range. And I think the service we -- that we're are providing our clients is really diversifying and what you're seeing is try to do more multiproduct business with every client that we're banking. So the addition of Western Reserve, the addition of securities capabilities to distribute not only in loan markets but the bond markets. The ability to deliver risk management to our clients in our hedging business, foreign exchange and interest rates just makes us more relevant with the client and lets us know them better also. We're also doing -- we're doing some interesting things in our payments business where we're getting to explore patterns in our payments business, which could become early-warning indicators of companies having problems. And we've also built a restructuring business, which is a remediation business that helps clients change their balance sheets if they begin to get hiccups in their operating models. So -- and I think the last point that Bruce made is really important. That the people that we have engaging with our clients, approving our credits. Remember in Commercial, every single credit extension is approved on an idiosyncratic basis so credit quality, structure, collateral, everything, we have 30-year professionals, not only in are underwriting syndicated lending businesses but also in our credit teams, most of which have come from large money-center banks. So everyone -- notwithstanding the fact that we're relatively a new company has been around the block numerous times. And we also -- we're all acutely aware of the downside of spiking credit costs and what that can do to an operating performance.
Matthew O'Connor: That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up, Bruce, on the stock itself, I think you're very extensive to where the multiple is here. As we think about the CCAR process getting a little bit easier for regional banks to navigate, you could be one of the biggest beneficiaries there both can give a lot of capital, and I think you've been dinged because some of the legacy stuff that will change over time. But if your stock price does continue to sit at the bottom of the pack on a multiple lease, could you give a look for ways to get more aggressive on buybacks? It might not be necessarily the CCAR cycle, but are you mindful that you will have more flexibility and maybe put more toward buybacks versus bolt-on deals or balance sheet growth as we think about 2020, 2021, as kind of a backup plan if needed?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, look, obviously, we pay attention to the stock price but really the big focus is just keep running the company better than we think the stock will take care of itself. We have to be careful not to be market-timers here in terms of these programs. And you get your CCAR approval in quarterly windows and you can try to change that but it's a little cumbersome. So yes, I think when we go in and think about next year and the CCAR ask will take the stock price into account to some extent. But our view is that the flexibility that we've had, the ability to deploy it in some of these fee deals, it's a complex problem we're trying to solve. We're trying to get our returns up, but we're also trying to expand our capabilities and cement our relationships with our customers and address the kind of fee gap that we have. And so we'll continue, I think, to use good judgment on that like we have, like you've seen us in the past.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.
Geoffrey Elliott: Maybe coming back to the net interest margin. Could you help us understand why you've got a stable outlook rather than some upside in 1Q? Given that we normally expect the benefit from the December rate rise to foremostly in the first quarter? And then looking ahead to 2019, the full year, I think the outlook kind of points to low to mid-single digits up from 2018. So similar to that 4Q '18 level, can you just confirm that?
John Woods: Yes, I'll go ahead and take that. So a couple of items to think about the first quarter. First and foremost is, yes, we have the December hike but when you look at the outlook for 1Q, we've got a 17 basis point rise in LIBOR expected versus what you saw in the fourth quarter, which would have been around 24 basis points. So I think you've got to take that into consideration in terms of how that drives the -- our C&I loans and our loan yields. But the other item as I mentioned, earlier, the deposit cost lag is post-December, tends to be strongest in the earlier part of the year and tapers off towards the later part of the year as we look at it. So you'll see the dynamic of the deposit cost increase continuing to the first quarter and across the industry. And then that will taper and what will happen is the strength of the front book in the fixed part of the portfolio that I talked about before will just continue to provide benefits quarter-after-quarter. So in the earlier part of 2019, maybe as we say more stable but then as you get towards the later part of 2019, you get deposit costs dissipating and you have the continued burn-in of front book, back book, anywhere from 50 basis points in some of our fixed portfolios up to as much as 150 basis points of front-book yields that exceed back-book yields. So that's the main dynamic without management's action as I talked about before, that plays out, which we say is, I think, over the year a net positive and then the new layer on all the balance sheet optimization work that we're are doing that you need to us. Both on the loan side, where we're rotating lower-returning assets into higher risk-adjusted return assets. And even on the deposit side, we've got a series of initiatives in both commercial and consumer to improve our deposit profile. And we're excited about what that can contribute in 2019 as well.
Bruce Van Saun: And the question about the growth coming off of Q4, that's correct, Geoff.
Operator: Our next question in the queue comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.
Kenneth Zerbe: One of your peers recently just announced that they purchased an online student lender, which obviously, can make him little more aggressive with the higher end of the student lending space. Can you just talk about your very broadly your interest in acquiring tech companies specifically, to help either grow your loan portfolio or to even deepen your penetration that you have with your current clients?
Bruce Van Saun: Brad, why don't you just address where we sit relative to student loans and the threat we possibly see from that or not?
Brad Conner: Yes, well, we've talked about this a lot. We like the student loan business a lot. It brings the right kind of customers in, and we think we're really well positioned. We've competed directly with [indiscernible] for quite some time so we don't think this acquisition really affects our position in the marketplace. So we think we're extremely well positioned and complementing our ability there. And again, like you said earlier, Bruce, I mean this is an asset that brings the right kind of customers, we've stated in the very high-credit quality area of the asset class, and brings in very attractive customers and helps us with our mix shift to higher asset return -- higher risk-adjusted returning asset.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And then the second part, Ken, is I think our fintech partnerships if you look at what we've done have really been powering new capabilities. So it's a kind of build-versus-buy decision that we take. And if, for example, SigFig has a great robo-advisory product, why should we build that? Let's just figure out, which one is best on the market and then integrate it into our offerings. Same thing with our small business origination platform powered by Fundation. Why build that? You've got a great product capability. Figure out how to integrate it. So on and on and on, when you add up to 10 fintech partnerships, we've done a lot of that. And I think we've actually become quite good at surveilling the marketplace, having good prioritization of what's important and what can offer the best impact in terms of how we're running the bank and delivering for customers. And then we're effectively a very good general contractor, we know how to integrate these things reasonably, quickly and cost effectively.
Operator: And next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Gerard Cassidy: Bruce, when you look at the top-performing banks and you mentioned how that's -- your aspiration is to become more on these top-performing banks, what are some of the metrics that you identify as top-performing in your eyes, when you look at this aspiration?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, that's a good question, Gerard. And I think it's not just financial so I think the kind of knee-jerk is well, he must be talking about a ROTCE or efficiency ratio or something like that. And I think to us a top-performing bank is one that delivers well for all its stakeholders. And so consistently we've had an agenda of improvement as that what do we do across, what we call, the 3C's, the customers, the colleagues, the communities. And I think we've seen tremendous progress there and there's more to go for us to be one of the most admired banks. We have to continue to drive our consumer J.D. Power score higher, our net promoter score higher. On commercial, we're pretty much there. We need more customers, we have kind of top-of-class customer satisfaction. On the colleague front, we want to be a great place to work and build a career. And so we have an organizational health index score that we're 2 points off the top quartile, so we've made a lot of progress from the middle of the third quartile, we're getting to the top quartile. If you're in the top quartile, you attract great people, you keep on and it helps drive stock outperformance so that's important to us. On the community front, we have taken our volunteer hours, almost tripled them from 50,000. When I walked in the door we had 135,000 this year, so really make an impact and spreading more as we make more money, we can also invest more money to make communities better places to live, work and play in. Regulatory, we needed completely clean regulatory dance card, which we've achieved after a lot of hard work so that feels good as well. And then coming back to financial measures, yes, we've got to continue to drive our ROTCE higher. We haven't done that through deals as some of our peers have over time, we've done it effectively through organic growth. And so I think we're closing in on the pack and I think we can continue over the next 5 years to do what we've done to keep driving upwards within the peer group.
Gerard Cassidy: Great. Appreciate those insights. And then just is a quick follow-up, you've obviously done a few acquisitions, Franklin, et cetera. Is there a area that you're looking that you need to add to your product capabilities that maybe something that on the horizon you can acquire? And as part of that do you have any goals of where you'd like to see your fee revenues as a percentage of total revenues?
Bruce Van Saun: I'd say, Gerard, we're kind of constantly surveilling for opportunities and where we've seen a kind of desire for scale, things like the Capital Markets, M&A capabilities. There's more that we can do there. We're not done. Similarly in Wealth, I think we got a great franchise in Clarfeld. There's more that we can do there. We're not done. Some of the other areas where we don't have capabilities, we can build those organically. So Don, I mean, you've added a par loan trading group, we're starting a little high-yield group. So there's things that we can do to expand our offerings, we're starting a commodities-trading service but we don't need to acquire things, we can just build those things. So I think you'll see us with a combination of building some things and looking for smart acquisitions. And to match earlier question, if you got to compare expending capital on these acquisitions with buying back your stock and it's a constant calibration that we're looking at. But so far, the deals that we've been able to find, we've been able to get them done at, I think, attractive ROICs and relatively short earn-back periods in terms of the impact on our tangible book value. Brad, you want to add to that?
John Woods: Maybe just to add quickly to that, I think that over the medium term, we do aspire to grow fees faster than our net interest income line. And as that base has been growing over the past several years with the Fed hiking, just we've got to improve and innovate just to stay flat on the -- in the fee space. So I think we would see that improve a bit going forward, and we're in the high-20s right now, in terms of fees versus total revenues. And I think we'd like to see that get to 30 or higher.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I think like we've done is one step at a time, don't set the bar for where you want to be in five years. We're raising our ROTCE target modestly, and we think we can keep nudging it forward. The first step on the fees is to get back a three handle and get to 30 and then hopefully, over time, we can push it higher.
Donald McCree: So the other thing that I was going to add, it's Don, we also view this, and you mentioned bright side of the house with partnerships very effectively. So in any expansion effort that were under way we look at organic build, we look at acquisition, we also look at partnership. And particularly, in our cash management businesses we've struck at number of partnerships, which have extended our product capabilities and will allow us to continue to grow that business.
Bruce Van Saun: And then the Commercial Real Estate, you might want to answer that.
Donald McCree: Yes, and we have a very good partnership with the Prudential on permanent real estate financing where they do permanent real estate against our construction books, and we go to market together. We have another very interesting partnership on the equity side for REIT Equity, where we use an investment bank to comarket with us and do relending our REIT equity. So we've got quite a few of these, which allow us to broaden a service setting capture more of the opportunity with the clients.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, good.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
John Pancari: Just back to credit report. Is there any part of the portfolio where you're seeing any indications of later-cycle behavior or any weakness you just want to flag? And then secondly, in terms of your credit outlook, the $400 million to $450 million provision guidance for 2019, what type of charge-off outlook does that imply in terms of a charge-off ratio for the year?
Bruce Van Saun: I guess the -- first of, we feel very good about the totality of the portfolio. If you look at Consumer, Brad, you don't really see any trouble spots.
Brad Conner: We really don't, Bruce. It's very solid in performing in line with...
Bruce Van Saun: No migrations in delinquency bucket. So you're feeling very good and Don, you obviously, there's no hotspot...
Brad Conner: All the indicators are improving and our workout teams are relatively quiet.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And I'd say, when we look at the guidance for next year, we had I think an even higher guide for this year and we beat that comfortably. There's always a presumption that credit will normalize. There's always a presumption that you're going to be building your allowance and so provision should cover charge-offs. That really -- that happened a little bit this year but not to the extent that we thought it would. And really that's because of the back book continues to clean up and provide offsets to what you would need to set aside for loan growth. So that could happen again this year. I think, we're just always going to be a bit conservative and put a number out there that implies that we'll see some normalization implies that we'll see a decent size build in those numbers. But again, right now, we don't see a lot of issue and so we could end up doing better as the year goes by.
John Pancari: Got it, Bruce. That's helpful. And then secondly just on the loan growth front, wanted to get a little bit more granularity on how you're thinking about the components of commercial growth? When it comes to CRE, you had solid growth here in terms of high single digits on the linked quarter but even low double digits on a year-over-year basis. Can it grow at that high-single, low double-digit pace again, in '19? And then same question for pure C&I. Can it be in the high single-digit range as well?
Donald McCree: So when I answer that, I think you see lower growth levels in real estate and that's strategic. And we're being at the margin more selective on our real estate underwriting because there is some froth in that market. That's particularly true in the multifamily space where we actually downdrafted our growth about two years ago and that portfolio is beginning to mature. So I would say kind of low to mid-single digits is where you see our real estate growth. It's kind of same-ish thing. I've got -- got 5% to 6% in my mind on C&I growth. You could see us exiting portfolios as we drive towards BSO. So the actual gross growth could be lower than that as we trim the portfolio. That being said, we see very robust pipelines right now. And our origination pipelines are running higher than they were at this time last year so there is definitely client interest in engaging with this and borrowing money.
Bruce Van Saun: I think the fourth quarter was 8%, right?
Donald McCree: Yes.
Bruce Van Saun: Year-over-year on commercial C&I. So that could still continue to run hard. I think what Don was saying there was that, that gives us the opportunity to review we have a quintile analysis, what our returns up and down the customer stack and if there's ones where we're not getting the right returns, we're not getting the cross-sell that we need, we can start to run some of those off to make room for new opportunities as they come on. So I don't think we grow C&I gross at 8, we grow it something less than that because we'll start to do that catharsis of moving some relationship.
Donald McCree: And I think, back to the question that was asked before, I think what that does it allow us to move for fee lines also because we will be recycling for capital against higher opportunities on the fee side of the balance sheet. So look at loan growth and fee growth kind of in parallel.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes.
Operator: And we'll go to the next question queue comes from Marlin Mosby with Vining Sparks.
Marlin Mosby: A little bit different take on capital. Talked a lot about share repurchase. But your dividend, you're guiding towards higher payout ratios, you had about 27% kind of ending this year. You're saying that next year is going to be 30%, 35% and then your medium term is 35% to 40%. One of the things that we did when we were managing a bank where we didn't think we're getting the valuation we wanted was the dividend is actually a better way to kind of show the strength of a growing franchise. If you're growing, the dividend really reflects the ability to be able to show the value of that income stream that you're creating. So I wanted to ask you in two cents, how do you bill? And like is that part of the progression that you're showing because that's going to be a very strong dividend increase over the next couple of years. And right now, you are at 4%-ish going to 5%. If you just look at the stock price that start to move up before we think you will be by the end of next year. And then what about the sustainability of that dividend. What do you think about through the cycle being able to keep a 40%. Payout ratio?
Bruce Van Saun: Sure. So I think that's well said and if you look at the year's results, we had 38% EPS growth, and we took our dividend up 45% with the hike that we just announced today. If you actually go back to October of last year of '17, 15 months we've taken the dividend up 78%. So when earnings are growing robustly, like they have been we're quite confident to raise that dividend and achieve a higher payout ratio. I think the payout ratios were artificially constrained in banking when the Fed had kind of the -- I don't know if it was a bright line, but there's certainly a line to pay attention to at 30%. We've had our earnings growing very rapidly, and so even though in the past we were targeting 30%, we exceeded our budget, and our earnings shot ahead and so we've been a little bit south of the 30%. I do think with the increase that we made today, we can get back above that 30% this year and then you could expect if you -- if we follow suit with what we've done the last two years, we've had a second hike later this year so as long as our earnings continue to move up. I do think that investors value the dividend, investors who own bank stocks like the yield but that's supplies. And so we're very sensitive to that. John, you want to add a few?
John Woods: Yes, yes. Over time when you -- as you progress towards your target capital ratio and if you get to a level of stabilization there, you're going to basically think about solidifying that dividend in respect of your earnings being, as you can see it. Approximately 1/3 of your earnings in a given year and then you're looking for deploying capital, just in organic ways, it's going to take upwards of another third or more of your earnings in any given year and then you've got to rest to think about strategic investments whether that's small tuck-ins on the fee income side or giving it back to shareholders through buybacks. So that will change and vary over time but as a big picture, when you get to stabilization, that's sort of how we think about it.
Marlin Mosby: And then a totally different thought process, competitive advantage-wise, when you look at what we were talking about, if some of the growth that you're getting is from some very specific business lines but when we're in the area, community banks are saying is they're kind of thinking about the Boston or New England areas, they want to be more like Citizens Financial. You've been able to competitively advantage yourself in that region. So want you to talk about that. And then on the product side. How do you think you're going to create that same competitive advantage in cash management as you're investing in that? That's a product that has a lot of competition in it. So how do you position yourself in that particular product as well?
Donald McCree: It's Don, I'll answer that. So cash management, we -- so if you look at our cash management business, it breaks down into 3 or 4 different sub-businesses, so a traditional treasury services, which is our payments businesses, our credit card business, our trade finance business and our merchant services business. The overall business has actually been growing faster than the industry. So we've been putting investment in it over the last couple of years and it's been growing quite nicely, and we're embedded very well with our core client base. Bruce mentioned we're putting a lot of investment around our digital portal right now and expanding our capabilities to stay on par, if not better than a lot of the competition. So we expect to get continued lift and incremental lift of those investments. Really starting the back end of 2019 is what we're targeting. In terms of competition, with the community banks, one of the reasons we're trying to build the diversity of product capabilities is to be able to solve any problems that our clients have. And frankly, our product set when we engage with clients is now close to complete, so if it's [indiscernible] interest rates are currency and have commodities or if it's raising capital to build a facility or do a dividend to an owner or if it's just regular way working capital lending, I would put us up against anybody not just community banks but even the largest banks in our ability to actually problem-solve and help our clients do their most important transactions. A huge incremental element of that issue was the M&A acquisition we did and the quality of assignments we're getting on our clients most important actions, which is buying and selling companies, is quite strong right now. So I've got zero worry about our ability to compete particularly, in our target segment, which is that midsize, mid-cap kind of company where we're very relevant.
Bruce Van Saun: Brad, a couple of thoughts?
Brad Conner: Yes. I mean, look we get the question all the time about our ability to compete in Petersburg and Philadelphia and Boston as some competitors are coming in. Bruce it goes back to a lot of things that you talked about earlier, which is we think we provide a great value proposition in those markets. We're very focused on exceptional customer experience. We've got a great presence in those markets, so we're strong on convenience. We've been investing heavily in digital. And you talked about some of the things that make a bank great and top performing. We're very involved in the communities of those markets, and we think that's tremendously valuable. So like Don, I don't have any concerns about our ability to compete head-on with anybody in those markets, whether it's a big national or whether it's a community.
Bruce Van Saun: And it's real strength, both on the consumer side and the commercial side.
Brad Conner: Absolutely.
Bruce Van Saun: And in between with small businesses as well.
Brad Conner: Exactly.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lana Chan from BMO.
Lana Chan: Just two quick questions. One on the fee income guidance for 2019, seems pretty strong. Did you give the impact of the CFA acquisition for 2019?
Bruce Van Saun: No, we hadn't. We didn't think that rose to the level of materiality as Franklin did.
Lana Chan: Okay. And so drivers would primarily be what on the fee income side, in terms of 11% to 20%?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. We had touched on that earlier. So it's on the commercial side, a bounce back in Capital Markets. Another strong year from what we call Global Markets or FX and interest-rate business and the introduction of some new -- a new platform, a new services in our cash management area and then on the consumer side, really well. I think we'll be quite strong even ex-Clarfeld. And then our card business, we've been investing in getting some growth there as well.
Lana Chan: Okay, appreciate it. And on the -- on capital, in terms of your capital stack, I know you did some preferred in 2018. How do you feel about the capital stack now going forward?
John Woods: I'll go ahead and take that. I think we're well position. I mean, I think when you look at where we stand, we have less than 1% of our -- 1 percentage point, if you will, in our Tier 1 stack in the 81% area, whereas most peers are over 1 percentage point, contributing to their Tier 1 ratio. So that's dry powder. We'll consider that over time as we think about optimizing capital. But as we've been able to grow our ROEs and our ROTCEs, then clearly the benefit of that preferred deal that we did earlier this quarter is very compelling. So again, we'll consider that over time in our submissions and our interaction with the Fed, but I think you could look at that as another area of opportunity and potential that we have versus peers. And we'll be trading that off against growth opportunities going forward.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.
Peter Winter: I was curious about deposit growth. Is the goal to grow it in line with the loan growth this year? Or could you do it -- or could be a little bit faster with some of the initiatives you have underway?
John Woods: Yes, I think our goal is to grow deposits roughly in line with loans. We have -- we think about deposits -- really funding for loan growth and keeping that LDR in that range that we've talked about in the high 90s that you've seen from us. And I think that -- I mean that could come down a tick. But generally, that's worked well for us and has allowed us to continue on our path of driving net interest margin higher and driving ROTCE higher. And I think when you come back to the BSO program, we're looking to not only grow the overall level of deposits, but we're looking for ways to improve the quality of those deposits. And that's a big part of when we talk about BSO contributing in '19 and beyond. We've got a fair bit of opportunity within the deposit portfolio itself to contribute, so we're excited about that possibility.
Brad Conner: And John, I was just going to add to that. One of the things that we have been able to do is to outpace some of our peers in low-cost deposit growth, particularly DDA. You talked about in your opening comments, and we really do with -- believe what -- some of the work we've done around value proposition and sophisticated data and analytics. That's something we can continue to do is to outpace competitors on low cost...
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. That's another area at upside if we can close the gap in DDA-to-total-deposits ratio. That would be very powerful.
Brad Conner: Exactly.
John Woods: Completely agree.
Peter Winter: Can I just -- one, last one. Just on the mortgage market. It's gotten a little tougher, since you acquired Franklin American. I'm just wondering are you still comfortable with the guidance of 2% accretive this year, 3% next year?
John Woods: Yes, I think, couple of things there. Sure, it's -- mortgage market is cyclical, and you've got to be thinking about that as your managing the business and Brad can comment on that. But as we look out, we're responding on the expense side and on the capacity side as a lot of mortgage companies are. And so you could see us continuing to aspire to hit those targets, maybe in a slightly different way. With a smaller mortgage market, you might see a tiny bit less on the revenue side, but you'll also see a little lower on the expense side as well. So I feel like we're still on track not only in the integration, but also in terms of what we expect for that platform to deliver. It's bringing a significant number of customers into the bank. We love the strategy over the long term that this platform provides us, and I think our guidance is still intact that we communicated earlier, maybe with possibly a slightly different path to get there.
Bruce Van Saun: The other thing that, Brad, you might briefly mention. I know we're running over here a little bit. But the mortgage business offers a great opportunity to innovate. So we're moving to a more digital model. We've got some fintech relationships teed up for this year, so we're quite excited about all of that.
Brad Conner: That's exactly right, Bruce. We've made a lot of investments. We keep talking about the investments we've made in data and analytics capability but that really does allow us to grow our direct-to-consumer side of business. And that's really supported by a great digital offering. And so we do have some fintech partners that we're working with on the digital side that create a digital offering on the front end. So we think there's opportunity even beyond just sort of the dynamics of the market.
Bruce Van Saun: Sure.
Operator: And our next question in queue will come from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.
Saul Martinez: I'll be quick. Just one quick question, the Citizens Access, it seems like you're ahead of the initial schedule in terms of the deposits raised, $3 billion. What sort of a reasonable expectation going forward for how quickly this can grow up over the next say year or 2? And what proportion of your deposits it can ultimately represent?
John Woods: I think we may have covered this before. I'll start off. I think we look at this being less than 10% of our deposits over the long term rate. I mean, I think this is -- as we mentioned upfront, it's a relatively modest part of our overall deposit base, which is quite large. And so when you think about $3 billion, that's really around 2 percentage or a little bit more than 2% of our deposit base. It's incredibly important strategically though. This is one of the fastest-growing segment of the deposit markets in the United States. The customers are incredibly affluent. We're intent on a test and learn strategy so that we can drive some of what we learn from this incredibly value customer segment back into our branch businesses. So it has outsized qualitative importance to us over time, as I said, in all likelihood into single digits of total deposits. But important not only in the here and now, but also over time in terms of how we may want to expand our offerings on the platform.
Bruce Van Saun: I'd say, we -- if you look at what we raised, it was about $3 billion in slightly less than 6 months. That's $1.5 million a quarter. I think we'll have to decide as we go through the year to where do we want to put the throttle because it's quite price elastic. But I would think we could do $1 billion a quarter quite easily as we go through this year and still stay underneath John's let's keep it under 10%. And then the other thing I would say is that in addition to test and learn back to our core customers in our footprint, there's also an opportunity that we're really focused on is how we turn those kind of 1-product customers into more fulsome customers. And so there's testing and learning there as well as to now we have 75,000 new customers. What else can we do for those customers? We're servicing 200,000 mortgages with Franklin. We have through our merchant partnerships, over 1 million customers. And so it's I think really exciting to have those good digital capabilities, those data capabilities, and then start to figure out how can we drive new revenue streams and deeper relationships across that whole set of relationships that we're building. Okay, I think that's the queue. So we're glad we had a chance to stay around and answer everybody's questions today. And for all of you on the call, thanks for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and support, so have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-10-19 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference call. My name is Brad, and I’ll be your operator on the call today. Currently all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor: Thanks so much, Brad, and hello everyone. We really appreciate you joining us today. We’re going to start things off with prepared remarks from our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, he will review our third quarter results, and then we're going to open up the call for questions. We’re also really happy to have in the room with us today Brad Conner, who's Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking. In addition to our release, we have a presentation and financial supplement available at investor.citizensbank.com. And of course I need to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are absolutely subject to risks and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ from expectations in our SEC filings, including the 8-K we filed today. We also need to remind you that we utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and our material. And with that, I'm going to give it over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay thanks, good morning everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We're pleased to report another very strong quarter today, paced by strong top line growth of 7% excluding FAMC, Franklin and good expense discipline which combines for positive operating leverage of 4.4% year on year. And we continue to achieve good balance sheet growth in the current environment with sequential loan growth excluding FAMC of 1% and year over year growth of 4%. That's a very good result considering we're still running off non-core assets and reducing our auto and leasing portfolios. We've focused on some great niches, on the consumer side, and we've invested in broader coverage on the commercial side to achieve this growth. Our strong execution to-date in 2018 has led to some very nice improvement in key metrics. EPS growth year on year is 37% underlying and 34% on a year to date basis. Our ROTCE reached 13.5% underlying which is into our target range of 13 to 15% and the efficiency ratio was 58% underlying. We are confident in our Q4 outlook and we expect to finish the year strong. Our capital strength continues to be a real advantage as we have the capacity to grow our balance sheet and drive organic growth to make small smart key based acquisitions and to return significant capital to our shareholders which we did and exceeded 500 million in the current quarter. We've had a couple of great slides in the deck today covering our progress against our strategic initiatives and some of the recognitions we've been garnering. I've just crossed my five year mark at Citizens and I feel really good about how we've been able to turn around the bank and shift from defense to offense. We now have a clear view of what it will take to be successful longer term and become a fast performing bank, and we're making significant investments to position us well for the future. That said, we understand the need to deliver consistently strong and improving results each quarter, and I feel our team has done a great job of getting that balance right. So with that, let me turn it over to our CFO, John Woods, to take you through the numbers in more detail and provide you with some color, John.
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning everyone. We delivered another strong quarter that highlights steady execution against their enterprise level initiatives with particular focus on robust positive operating leverage. We continued our momentum in delivering cost efficiencies while making the long-term investments required for sustainable success. Some quick highlights, we grew our underlying EPS 37% year on year. We delivered operating leverage of 4.4% excluding the impact of the Franklin American Mortgage acquisition, which closed on August 1. We continue to make progress on improving returns with underlying ROTCE for the quarter of 13.5%, up nearly 60 basis points linked quarter and 340 basis points year-over-year. Our consumer and commercial banking segments are delivering improved returns by driving prudent balance sheet growth and controlling our deposit costs in a very competitive environment, across both business segments we are growing our customer base, deepening relationships, running our capabilities and investing in new technologies to enhance the customer experience. I'll expand on our strategic initiatives a little later. On Slide 3, we provide information on the Franklin American acquisition and related integration costs, and in order to make it easier to see underlying trends, we show you our results without the integration costs and provide further color on our result, excluding Franklin on Slide 4 and 5. As I mentioned, you can see that we delivered positive operating leverage of 4.4% excluding the impact of Franklin with an efficiency ratio of 57%. Also, PPNR growth year-over-year was 13% excluding Franklin. On Page 6, net interest margin results came in as expected with a two basis points increase excluding the impact of Franklin even though average LIBOR rose less than anticipated. We are pleased that despite a fairly competitive landscape, we continue to drive disciplined balance sheet growth and delivered a 2% sequential quarter increase in net interest income. Turning to fees on Slide 7, you can see a $28 million improvement driven by mortgage banking fees given the addition of Franklin. Excluding net impact, fees were up 1% linked quarter and up about 3% year-over-year. Our capital market fees were relative flat sequentially this quarter, notwithstanding some pretty significant headwinds in the space. Overall loan syndications market volume was down approximately 40%, but we were down less than the market in the space and offset to syndication volume with bond underwriting where we continue to gain traction and M&A advisory fees given our ability to leverage the Western Reserve Partners acquisition. In global markets where we continue to build out our offerings, fees were down slightly from record second quarter levels, reflecting a $3 million adjustment related to CDA methodology change. Interest rate product fees were down 4% due to a decline in variable rate loan demand and the impact of the flattening yield curve. In FX, we held our ground by being proactive with clients against the backdrop of increased dollar volatility and looming trade policy concerns. On the consumer side of the house, we saw good traction on our wealth business with increased sales volumes and a 5% linked quarter increased in managed money revenues and 23% growth year-over-year. And in our mortgage business, we've hit the ground running with the integration of Franklin. We are very excited about the scale that business brings us in servicing and the opportunity to serve over 200,000 new customers. The integration is on track and while the current environment is challenging, we continue to believe this is an attractive and important customer business for us to be in over the long-term. Turning to Slide 8. On our reported basis, our expenses were driven up by the impact of Franklin and about $9 million of integration cost largely in salaries and benefits outside services and other expense. Excluding Franklin, we are pleased to report that linked quarter expenses were flat given continued strong expense discipline and benefits from our top program. Let me elaborate a bit on that. Our commitment to self funding investments continues to drive our ability to ensure our expenses remain well controlled, this is a direct result of all of the work we’ve done over the past two years with our top programs. The efficiency and revenue benefits from those programs have a compounding effect that has funded our growth initiatives allowing us to expand our capabilities across the bank and facilitate various business initiatives such as Citizens Access and many others. Let’s move on to discuss the balance sheet. On Slide 9, you can see we continue to grow our balance sheet and expand our NIM. Despite slower growth across the industry, we continue to see strength in certain segments and commercial. This was against the backdrop of heightened non-bank competition and very liquid corporate balance sheets given the benefits of tax reform and repatriation. And while we are very selective about CRE, we are still finding some attractive opportunities for growth. On the retail side, we saw nice tractions in some of our attractive risk adjusted return categories like education and secured as well as important categories like mortgage. Overall, we grew loans by 1% linked quarter. As a reminder, we sold corporate loans late in the second quarter which had about 25 basis points impact on third quarter growth. Loans grew by 4% year-over-year, notwithstanding headwinds from the planned runoff in auto, non-core and leasing which was around $1.6 billion year-over-year, which impacted the growth rate by about 1.5%. The gross of our planned runoff, our loans were up 5.5% year-over-year. Loan yields improved by 12 basis points in the third quarter, which was lower than what we saw in the second quarter, this reflects the backdrop of the lower increase in average LIBOR over the same period which had a corresponding benefit to our overall funding costs. Also we continue to results from our balance sheet optimization efforts and remain well-positioned to benefit in a rising rate environment. I'm pleased with what we are able to accomplish in deposits this quarter. As you can see on Slide 10, we continue to do a nice job of growing deposits, which were up 2% linked quarter and 4% year-over-year. And in particular, we continue to gain traction on DDA balances, which were up over 1% linked quarter and 4% year-on-year excluding the escrow balances contributed by Franklin. Our total deposit costs were well-controlled, up 10 basis points compared with 11 basis point increase in the prior quarter. Interest-bearing deposit cost rose at a slower pace this quarter as well, increasing 14 basis points compared with a 15 basis point increase in the second quarter. For the most part deposit costs have been relatively well-behaved, despite increased deposit competition we are seeing in the industry overall. Our cumulative data on interest-bearing deposits is in the low 30s as expected and remains in line with our overall expectations given where we are in the rate cycle. And given the actions we are taking, we expect cumulative betas to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter. We continue to be optimistic on the trend of deposit costs. We are benefiting from investments that began back in 2016 in areas like increasing our brand marketing spend to closer to peer levels and in analytics to improve our targeting through digital and direct mail offerings on the consumer side. In commercial, we are making investments to build out additional product capabilities like escrow services and are rolling out our new cash management platform early next year. Also in July we launched Citizens Access, which contributes to our funding diversification and optimization of deposit levels and costs, through the end of the quarter we raised about 1 billion dollars, and we expect to hit about 2 billion of deposits by the end of the year. While this is a relatively modest part of our overall deposit strategy. We're very pleased with the progress so far. About 97% of these deposits are from new customers and the average account size is about $70,000. We are right on target with the type of affluent customer, we are looking for. Year-over-year our, asset yields expanded 47 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher rates and the impact of our BSO initiatives. Our total cost of funds was up 35 basis points, reflecting the impact of higher rates and a continued shift to greater long-term funding. This included the impact of the 750 million senior debt issuance late in the first quarter of 2018. Our borrowing costs were positively impacted by the slowing pace of LIBOR this quarter. We also benefited from the mix shift this quarter as we redeemed higher cost sub debt at the end of June and replaced it with lower cost filled advances. Next, let's move to Slide 11 and cover credit. Overall, credit quality continues to be strong, reflecting the continued mix shift towards higher quality lower risk retail loans and a relatively stable risk profile in our commercial book. The non-performing loan ratio improved to 73 basis points of loans this quarter down from 85 basis points a year ago. The net charge-off rate of 30 basis points for the third quarter was relatively stable linked quarter and up modestly year-over-year from relatively low levels. Retail net charge-offs were up modestly, reflecting seasoning in the portfolio which is very much in line with our expectations and performing in line with the model loss curves. Commercial net charge offs for the third quarter were relatively stable versus last quarter and up from the prior year which benefited from higher recoveries. Overall, we feel good about the credit metrics and trends in the book including a meaningful drop in criticized asset levels reflective of continued favorable credit quality. Provision for credit losses of $78 million declined from the second quarter with particular improvement in the real estate secured portfolios. Our allowance to loans coverage ratio remain relatively stable and in the quarter at 1.08%. And as we increase the mix of higher quality retail portfolios in our overall loan book, the NPL coverage ratio improved to a 149% as we saw continued improvement in NPLs and run-off in the non-core portfolio. On Slide 12, we continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity position ending the quarter with the set-one ratio of 10.8% which came down from 11.2% in the second quarter with approximately 18 basis points of impact from the Franklin acquisition. Also this quarter, we repurchased $400 million common stock and returned a total of $529 million to shareholders including dividend. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.27 a share and we have the ability through CCAR to increase the quarterly dividend another 19% to 0.32 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2019, subject to our board's approval. Our plan glide path to reduce our set-one ratio remains on track and we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive improving financial performance and attractive returns to shareholders. Third quarter achievements against our enterprise initiatives are highlighted on Slide 13. I’ll point out that we are making traction on our balance sheet optimization effort as we recycle capital out of lower return categories like auto and leasing. With the core yield have improved and portfolios have decreased by more than 7% and redeploy it against higher return categories like our education refi and merchant finance portfolios as well as in higher return relationships in commercial. Additionally, we continue to deliver beyond expectations in our top programs where we now expect top four to be at the higher end of our range and deliver $105 million to $110 million in benefit. As we work on running the bank better, we’ve launched the next phase of process reengineering opportunities with the focus on consumer operations, mortgage and project delivery. As we’ve seen some real benefits from the work so far, for example, in consumer banking our efforts to improve new relationship experience for deposit account opening have reduced new to bank customer attrition increased the net promoter score by 10 points and increased mobile enrollments by more than 30%. And for our commercial clients, we’ve implemented our concierge service model which has significantly increased the speed with which we address client requests. We are also leveraging enhanced data analytics and transformative technology such as AVIs, robotics and cloud to improve the customer experience and work more efficiently. We have been able to use robotics and process reengineering to improve cycle times for key clients processes. For example, we’ve reduced on boarding times for new cash management clients by 60% since the first quarter this year. On Slide 14, we highlighted some of the longer-term investments we are funding in order to precision us for sustainable success. Bottom line, we have been able to successfully lean forward with our longer-term strategy while also executing well and delivering strong results in the near-term. On Slide 15, you can see the steady and impressive progress we are making against our financial targets. This quarter we hit the lower end of our 13% to 15% medium-term ROTCE target. Since 3Q '13, our ROTCE has improved from 4.3% to 13.5% underlying, and our efficiency ratio has improved by 11 percentage points from 68% to 57% excluding the impact of Franklin. And EPS continues on a very strong trajectory as well up to $0.93 on an underlying basis from $0.26. Our outlook for the fourth quarter is on Slide 16 and it reflects continued momentum in both our top and bottom line results. We expect to produce linked quarter average loan growth of around 1% to 1.25%, given strong commercial lending pipelines and solid growth in education and retail unsecured particularly with a strong showing in third quarter Apple iPhone upgrade loans. We also expect net interest margin to expand by approximately 3 to 4 basis points linked quarter reflecting the ongoing impact of our BSO activities, particularly our deposit initiatives and the benefit of rising rates. In non-interest income, we're expecting to see growth around 5% to 7%, with a strong quarter for capital markets, given strong pipelines and some seasonality. Also, we will see an additional lift from the full quarter impact of Franklin. Excluding Franklin, core growth is expected to be about 2% to 4% linked quarter. We expect noninterest expense to be up around 2% to 3% in the fourth quarter also including a full quarter impact from Franklin. Excluding Franklin and notable items expense growth is expected to be around 1% to 2% with positive leverage and further efficiency ratio improvement. Additionally, we expect provision expense to be in the range of 85 million to 95 million. And finally, we expect to manage our step one ratio to end the year around 10.8% and we expect the average LDR to be around 98%. In addition, we are anticipating a tax gain as we finalize the impact of tax reform, which is expected to be largely offset by costs associated with top five. To sum up on Slide 17, our strong results this quarter demonstrate our continuing strong performance as we execute against our strategic initiatives and continue to improve how we run the bank to drive underlying revenue growth and carefully manage our expense base. We are very pleased to have closed the Franklin acquisition and successfully launched Citizens Access this quarter. Our outlook remains positive as we continue to work to become a top-performing regional bank. Let me turn it back to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, John. And Brad, why don’t we open it up for some questions from our viewers.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question, here is going to come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt O'Connor: I was wondering if you could about the prospects to accelerate the share buybacks just given how weak your stock has been and obviously the earnings and capital levels are quite strong.
John Woods: I will go ahead and start off with that Matt. I mean I think, I think we done a nice job this quarter of returning capital to shareholders. As you saw in our remarks, we have returned $529 million, 400 million of that coming from repurchases. And we like the opportunity to return capital to shareholders over time as we talked about. We have a glide path that we are pursuing that allows us to balance, not just the return of capital, but also deploying that capital into growth opportunities. We still see nice opportunities for growth and we will continue to monitor that over time and react accordingly in terms of how that glide path plays itself out.
Bruce Van Saun: I guess within the parameters that we set, Matt, in CCAR, we did have more weighted earlier in the fourth quarter period, and obviously on this, we're taking in more stock. So, we can’t exactly market time. But as you said, stocks that kind of astonishing valuations at this point. So we'll take advantage of that.
Matt O'Connor: And then just separately, if you look at the revenue growth, not just this quarter but year-to-date, among the highest in the industry, and obviously, hopefully, that's sustainable. But if it's not, do you have leverage to cut costs? You can continue to meet your targets, obviously, you got the top initiatives and even focused on the operating leverage, but frankly you haven't needed to maybe manage the cost as much because of revenues been so strong. But if it does, slow you have the flexibility to meaningfully bring down the expense growth.
John Woods: Well, Matt, I think we've had a very consistent model here to deliver that top line growth. And so, we've got very strong capital position, we’re growing loans prudently with that by finding niches in consumer and by our expanding our coverage for us, and overall size of our business in commercial, and I think there is still room to go with that. So, if you start with roughly 70% of your revenue is net interest income and you can grow your loans, we been able to grow roughly 5%. But a nice level of loan growth and an asset sensitive balance sheet with in a rising rate environment plus our DSO initiative means that’s the formula to get very strong kick up in revenues. Then combine that with the investments we've been making in our fee based businesses and deepening relationship with our customers, we should be able to keep growing feeds. I think and certainly in this single-digit level ex acquisitions. So, I’m still optimistic that the formula that's worked will continue to work. And if you look last year, we had 10% revenue growth, which was top in our peer group. I think my memory serves me against 3% expense growth with 7% positive operating leverage. We’re probably now in a 7% or 8% top line growth, keeping expenses down around 3%. So we’re 4.5% operating leverage on an underlying basis. And I think the good news on, if you can achieve that revenue growth, you can continue to fund the investments for the future that we've made and keep your expense growth in check. So, one thing I would point out that I think differentiates us versus peers, is the consistency of the top programs that relentless focus on improving end-to-end processes and customers experiences while extracting costs that frees up dollars, so that we can hire more customer facing people, invest in the fee business, invest in great technology. We were first to market in our peer group with online mobile advising with our specified product first to roll out to national digital bank. So, I think we’re doing a great job and having a top line growth allows us the flexibility to make those investments and still deliver the positive operating leverage and still drive our ROTCE higher.
Operator: And our next question will come from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
Peter Winter: I'm just wondering if I look out, are you seeing any let up on pay down activities or borrowers getting near the end of tapping some of this excess liquidity for growth that could lead to better loan demand next year?
Bruce Van Saun: John, you want to take that.
John Woods: Yes, I'd say, there is not a perceived trend where we've seen it is a little bit of drop in utilization. So, we pretty consistently strong new business pipeline across the board, all year long, and we continue to see that as we look into the fourth quarter and into next year and that’s both lending in our fee business. That's is going to offset a little bit by what Bruce mentioned, which is a little bit more selectivity on our part, we see terms and conditions overstretched and a little bit lower utilization. So, I think that the utilization trend, we don’t see it changing right now and are seeing a particular change in sentiment among borrowers, but we’re seeing a lot of activity across the board. So, we continue to be optimistic around growing our business.
Peter Winter: And then the loan to deposit ratio, it's 98% I guess it's supposed to be stable in the fourth quarter. Do you think that ratio could move lower next year with some of these deposit strategies that you have?
John Woods: Yes, I will go ahead and take that. I mean I think the idea here is that we want to have deposits fund our loan growth, and the outlook that we have now is for deposit to grow at least as fast as we grow loans. And so, we've seen great frankly take up in our deposit growth, and I should add that a big part of that deposit growth comes in the DDA space, which we’re really pleased to be able to -- to be able to continue to do that here throughout 2018, consistently growing that. And in terms of where the LDR goes, I mean I think we’re pretty comfortable in that upper 90 range call it 97, 98, 99. And we've had a demonstrated ability to manage to that and feel like that's likely to be durable into the future.
Operator: And our next question will come from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.
Saul Martinez: First question and I know you spent some time on the strategic initiatives. So forgive me, if this is a little bit repetitive. But where do you think you are just more broadly on the balance sheet optimization efforts? And maybe to use a baseball analogy with the Red Sox going to the World Series, what inning are you in? And where do you see the most opportunity still? Is it still in education lending? Can you just walk us through the various initiatives to optimize the left and right side of the balance sheet, and kind of how much further you can go there?
Bruce Van Saun: Sure, it's Bruce. I will start and flip it over to John. But if I have to put it into baseball terms, I would say we’re still maybe only in the middle innings, fourth inning or so. If you go back 3 to 4 years ago, we were doing this on an informal basis. So it was really kind of myself, CFO, Treasurer working with the Vice Chairman, trying to figure out which way we needed to tilt capturing deposits, regaining our deposit market share after -- under our, yes, the balance sheet had shrunk and we needed to reflate the balance sheet, that was pretty easy pickings. And so, commercial really was going out doing the heavy lifting getting the deposits back on the balance sheet. But as times moved by, we thought the success we've had with top, we could try to replicate and put in place a more formal PSO program where we would have specific initiatives on the left side of balance sheet and the right side of balance sheet with actions that would be monitored ownership, et cetera, same kind of structure that we have running top. And so, I think we're making traction on the asset side. We are running down certain portfolios. So, you can see auto is running down, leasing running down, those are not credit concerns. Those are simply not a good use of capital. We’re not making the returns that we would like there. And then you saw us make a loan sale in the second quarter out of corporate, and so I think we got to be very disciplined, if we’re not getting deeper relations and cross sell than we have to exit credits, and we can do some of that naturally but we can also punch some and sell them. So those have been kind of minuses and then growth is really focused on consumer trying to find attractive niches, education refinance we’re one of the pioneers of that market it is still a very attractive market. The upgrade program we have with Apple and merchant financing at point of sale as another very attractive area we have another relationship and another one coming soon. And so, we're excited about that, so we will continue to push into areas where we see opportunities. On a commercial side, I think we build out our industry verticals, so we can go up market a bit into the mid corporate space. Those tend to be full relationships where we can get a good share of wallet. So, we’re seeing some nice traction there. In commercial real estate, we really have become very under scale, in RBS, under RBS ownership because they were running off commercial real estate exposures globally. So, we really just been regaining our market share and again, being very, very selective about where we’re playing. In fact, I should point out we have a sell of these from work out is running commercial real estate. And with Don and his acumen, I feel really good about what we’re doing in commercial real estate. On the right side of the balance sheet again, we wanted to have more tools in the tool kit. So, we launched Citizens Access, which is off to a fantastic start. It's exceeding all of our metrics that we set out at this point, so very pleased with that. We have noticed that in commercial, we're not always playing with a full toolset there as well. So, we're investing in having full escrow capabilities. The bankruptcy capabilities, there is a new cash management platform we're rolling out, so we want to gain a bigger share of natural deposit relationships, which should come with less pricing pressure. So, those are a few other things, I feel there's still and one of the great thing about Citizens is we've been a self-help story. And if something is not great that's a good thing because that means we can fix it and continued to propel our earnings higher. Let me go around the horn here and see if anybody wants to add to that. It was a longwinded answer, so I don’t want to take the whole call out of it. John, next
John Woods: I will just add just a high level point or two, if that was well covered. And I think I would highlight the fact that, year-over-year net interest margin is up 15 basis points and 5 basis points of that comes from BSO. And so even without rates, we remain self-help on the net interest margin space, and that's good. And I think we got a lot of room to run. We’re still about call it 10 or 15 basis points short of peers in terms of net interest margin, and one of the places that manifests itself is in non-interest-bearing deposits where about 25% of our deposits are in non-interest-bearing space. We continue to grow that space because we’re making up ground that since the IPO and even you could see that getting overtime, north of 30 that's really our target is to get north of 30. And all of the initiatives that we have in place in the consumer side and commercial side, which we won't go into in too much detail, but investing in data and analytics, increasing our markets spend back to peer levels, our product offerings in commercial, replatforming the cash management business will all support that engine of net interest margin growth overtime.
Bruce Van Saun: Just let Brad.
Brad Conner: Yes, I was just going to add one other things and it really ties in what you guys would say. One of the positive stories for us has been our ability to grow DDA in lower and no cost deposits. And part of the reason for that goes back to Bruce, what you are saying is, we were underway. We have a very attractive -- we’re not getting our fair share from our own customer base. So, we have a very attractive affluent customer base and we weren't getting our fair share of the low cost deposits. And I think with all the initiatives we have around, rebuilding the value proposition for our affluent customers and then the investment we’re making in segmentation and targeting that gives me a lot of confidence. We can continue to grow. We can outpace the growth of those low cost deposits.
Saul Martinez: That's Great. If I could follow up on regulations, we should get proposals on S.2155. I would think fairly soon, and if we do move to a more of a potential standards that are based on complexity versus risk. Does that change at all? How do you manage capital and liquidity? Specifically on capital, could it help trigger at least a rethink of 1025 CET1 target potentially going lower?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, look, I think we have always said that our risk profile is certainly no worse than median. In fact, we think it's slightly better than median. So, there's no reason over time for us to carry capital surplus versus the peer median. So, most peers are professing that they are going to move down, but they think, they have plenty of capital to safely run the bank. And so, we will calibrate off of that, so if the peer median moves down, we will move our goal post down. But I think the nice thing of the rethink on the bracket we’re in under 250 is that it would just increase flexibility around decisioning. So just like Matt said earlier, in one of the first questions on the call today now that the stock price of regional banks and ours in particular washed out would you maybe want to buy more stock, you have to go through a process today, the way CCAR works that you probably gain some new flexibility based on the rethink that’s taking place. Anything, John?
John Woods: Yes, I think that's exactly right. I think flexibility on the capital side increases, I would say that occurs either with us as 155 or with the SEB. Both of those things are either financially would allow for that flexibility and would allow us to balance RWA deployment against capital return much more effectively. On the liquidity side, we got less of an impact. I mean we tend to run ourselves in a conservative way in terms of our internal models with respect to that. And so from that standpoint, I think capital is going to be the bigger impact versus liquidity.
Operator: And our next question will come from Brian Klock I believe its Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
Brian Klock: A bigger picture question I guess first for you Bruce. The progression and profitability and expansion profitability in the best in the group, and anything about your bottom lower end of your 13% to 15% ROTC guidance range. I guess, is there a thought process maybe enter into this yearend planning process and for next year that, would that be an opportunity to think about updating? And how do you think about maybe moving that up since you guys have executed pretty well here?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. So, look we’re quite pleased that we’ve run ahead of pace to get into that 13% to 15%, we’re certainly ahead of the budget for the year and I think coming into the year consensus has been taken up about 10%. So, again reflects very good performance throughout the year. We typically look at all of the metrics and the targets at yearend when we put our budgets to bed, and then on the January call we’ll give you detailed guidance for '19. And then potentially look at whether we want to refresh those medium targets. I think the thing that everybody is aware of is that, as you get farther into this expansion, at some point you’ll have credit costs rise and start to normalize, which would create some headwinds against PPNR. But at this point, we feel good I mean we feel good about the economic outlook for 2019. We don’t think any recession is around the corner. I feel good personally through 2020. At this point, we don’t see the build ups and accesses that you would start seeing, if you were getting closer to a recession. So, I think we’ll take all that into account when we consider whether we’re going to move to 13% to 15% higher.
Brian Klock: And maybe to follow up on some questions and discussions on the NIM earlier, and John, I just wanted to get double check that. The NIM expansion, the guidance for the fourth quarter, so they would include obviously the impact of the good growth from Citizens Access, which that has come in at a higher deposit beta and even the impact of the FHLB advances. Was that sure the $2 billion of long-term borrowings increased on a spot-to-spot basis so that from FHLB advances in that increase?
John Woods: Yes, I think that what you’re seeing there, maybe just I’ll take the deposit part of this first in the context and then I’ll cover borrowings. But that does include in the fourth quarter, the impact of Citizens Access going from $1 billion to $2 billion. Really what that does is, it basically balances and optimizes our promotional activities across the whole platform. So as we’re profitably supporting the loan growth in the fourth quarter, we can do that in a much more efficient way with the combination of our input print activities connected with Citizens Access trajectory. So that’s all included and is beneficial to the NIM in the fourth quarter. As it relates to borrowings, yes, I mean borrowings are up on a spot basis. On an average basis they’re pretty flat over the last couple of quarters going into the third quarter. You may be seeing an increase in spot that occur just in terms of natural variability that you’re seeing in the commercial deposit flows. And so at the end of the quarter, you have some deposits what was that they come back in and that’s really you’re seeing not really a signal that is headed north in the significant way.
Brian Klock: And then I can just squeeze one more in. One of the things that you guys have done this quarter, which you’ve kind of bucked the trend for the industry this quarter and for the full year, for that matter is have DDA growth. And I know you mentioned even excluding the First American Mortgage escrow deposit that’s up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. So maybe just kind of highlight the fact that to me it sounds like that’s growth in customer accounts, and I think Brad you commented on that to, but it does seem like to me that commercial customer accounts that you’re growing. So maybe can you just talk about how you guys are executing better than the rest of the industry is on DDA growth?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I will start with that and it's really a combination of deepening with our existing customers and new household growth. So, we've got good strong household growth. And part of that is the investment we made in data and analytics which allows us to spend more on marketing to acquire customers, and then I mentioned this in my comments earlier. We've long had a very attractive household base at Citizens very steeped in affluent customers, and we really haven't got our fair share over time of their low cost, their DDA deposits. And a lot of work we've done in the last year or two is really very hard on the value proposition we launched and we platinum values, lot of segmentation work around building the right value proposition, and that has allowed us to grow our DDA balances with our existing customer base. The last point I'll make and then turn it over to Don is just to that point of household growth. I do want to make a point that’s been very, very high quality household growth. So our primary household relationship our mobile active metrics are some of the best we've ever had, so it's not only good household growth but its primary and active households.
Donald McCree: On our side, I will just add, Bruce mentioned the investments we’re making in our cash management business and that goes really from the product level all the way through to the service level and it's allowing us to add business on our credit services platform. And that should accelerate as we roll out the new platform in 2019.
Operator: Your next question here will come from Kenneth Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kenneth Zerbe: With Citizens Access, obviously, you're up to a really good start. I know you’re targeting the 2 billion by year end. But I guess the question is, how do you stop that growth because I just went online, I saw you’re offering 212 on savings accounts. Like, how do you get people to not continue to go into that product?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, I will start and, Brad, you can chirp right on it. But it’s a very elastic market with respect to pricing, so you can turn the dial up or down based on where you are kind of in the forced ranking of those offering. So that's one thing Ken, if you wanted less deposits from that channel, you could just drop your pricing and it will kind go to the level that you want. So that's one thing. But what I would say more broadly than just competing on rate, I think one of the reasons we've been so successful is that we really, really focused on delivering a great customer experience which we try to do everything, but I think we really nailed it here. Then you can you can go online Ken, we will happy to have you as a customer, but you could -- after this call, you could get on our website open and fund an account in under five minutes. That's basically proven. So it's really a great, easy to use experience and ability to get reporting on what you got and some nifty stuff. The other thing that I think we done exceptionally well is I think we have really regional peer leading data capabilities. And so, we put back to work to target households and keep our overall account acquisition costs quite well. And so that's part of the equation as well. So, it's really your functionality where you are on the pricing ladder. And then your account acquisition your data capabilities that determine your success factor, and I think on all those dimensions, we've pegged it almost perfectly.
Brad Conner: Yes. Bruce, I agree with all that. And then one of the points that I would make is, if the question is sort of around this concept of cannibalization and you just going to continue to encourage your own customers to take that the higher cost offers, the answer is. We’re getting 75% of our customers out of footprint, so this has given us a national capability. So 75% of customers are coming in our out of footprint and only 3% are coming from our own customer base. So, this is a whole new customer segment that we’re attracting that we weren't reaching because they’re not traditional branch users.
Kenneth Zerbe: Got it.
Bruce Van Saun: I think it also gives us just more confidence around. It's almost a petri dish to improve our digital and data capabilities which is only going to help us in the long run with our core franchise as well.
Kenneth Zerbe: And I understand you can drop the rate on. I guess that presumably implies that your customers are pretty much hot money customers and you're going to lose the customer so they are, I mean is the right way to think about this customer base more or like on a wholesale borrowings to some extend like you’re…
Bruce Van Saun: Not at all.
John Woods: Let me jump in. It’s John. I mean I think just throwing some numbers out there, just to give you a sense of where we are. So, after the last rate hike we did, we lagged our rate rise, and so it’s not just dropping rate, but it's also lagging rate. There is a customer experience part of this story and there are product enhancement in the future phases of this platform that we’re going to invest in to deepen the relationship. This is not intended to be a won and done launch. And so, you’ll see more build out in the test and warm way, using this is the backbone of a digitally savvy channel that serves incredibly attractive customer segment that we want to learn, learn more about how to serve. So, again we lagged at the last 25 basis points rise from the Fed, we rose by 12 basis points. On the next Fed hike, we’ll take a look at what make sense there and is clearly a very efficient way lower cost channel that is superior to wholesale funding.
Bruce Van Saun: I think, Ken, the stress test assumptions around that and really would say, that this is analogous to just your own affluent customers. If you have a lot of cash, you care more about the rates that you’re getting. And so in our core customer base, the folks who of means are going to try to make sure they’re getting a good break on the deposits and that’s really all this is. The average account size as John indicated was $70,000. So, these are relatively affluent customer.
Operator: And we have Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill Partners. Please go ahead.
Scott Siefers: I think most of my questions have been hit. I guess one though which is on the fee guide, John said it’s a little actually quite a bit stronger than I had anticipated. I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks, capital markets should be a good quarter. But I wonder if you can just spend a moment or two talking about sort of what’s going well what’s not going as well as you hope to as you look at that fee guide into the fourth quarter and beyond?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I’ll go ahead and start and then maybe Don, can follow up. But in the outlook, the cap markets and global markets are both expected to be drivers. But really a lot of our fee categories contributing to our expectations for 4Q, including service charges and frankly onsie-twosies across several of the other categories including investment and trust. So, in the cap market space our pipelines are strong, that's the business that you have monitor the external environment very closely because of the ebb and flows there and we probably made a lot of investments and capabilities there and in global markets that is providing that lift. And I'll let Don elaborate.
Donald McCree: I would say that’s all correct. Go back to where what John said in his remarks, the syndicating lending business was quite weak in the third quarter, just to the market down raps across the board and we’re seeing that come back. In the fourth quarter, I would also the M&A business is kicking in as we begin to benefit from Western Reserve now that we're a year and half in. So those obviously transactions take a long time to mature but what we’re beginning to see transactions lined up to close in the fourth quarter.
John Woods: And then Don, in global markets, which is FX and interest rate, risk management we built a great team. We've got a great platform and we're expanding our capabilities, we’re now offering options capability to some of the things that we had to standoff as we separated from RBS we’ve now got those in place, we’re gaining traction there.
Donald McCree: I think that’s important. I think you have realized a lot of these businesses were two or three years into and it take a while to build the products build the team and get out in front of the client base and market them. And I think the number of wins we’re achieving across the board is quite encouraging.
Operator: And we will go to the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
Erika Najarian: Given your strength in lending trends, I was wondering, if you could give us your perspective on how non-bank competition has potentially accelerated in the businesses that you have been expanding in? And how sort of the structure and the rate offerings are different from that over the traditional banks?
Bruce Van Saun: So, obviously, the growth of the non-banks has been something that we've been dealing with for years. I go back 25 years ago when we begin to sell risk to non-banks when the old age FHLB designation came in the commercial banking industry. But we see in that twofold, obviously, they're competition, but they're also a distribution channel for us. So, we originate a lot of leverage risk and sell to the non-banks as part of our distribution efforts. And our strategy in leverage finance is to hold very little of the origination that we undertake particularly responses, so our whole levels versus our volumes are quite well. So, we view them as a different type of competitor. They don’t have some of the same accounts challenges. We have as banks as some of the ratio that we didn’t manage to, but I don’t see them as a massive limitation in terms of the ability to continue to grow the business.
John Woods: Yes, on the consumer side, I would say there is two asset classes where we’re non-banks compete. One is on personal unsecured lending program and the other is education refinance. And we particularly in the personal unsecured space we have seen the non-banks be pretty aggressive there. I think the big differentiation between us and the non-banks is they're playing a lower credit, profile then we are. So we maintained our discipline of staying really up in high prime space and were seeing our competitors go down credit.
Erika Najarian: Got it and just, oh I am sorry, don't mean to interrupt.
Bruce Van Saun: That’s fine. Go ahead, if you have another one.
Erika Najarian: Just a follow up, could you help us size the residual risk that is on the balance sheet? And also do you have any term exposure on any sponsor back transactions that you do keep?
Donald McCree: We have about 2% of our assets in sponsor leverage finance right now, so it's relatively small. Some of it will be….
Bruce Van Saun: That's commercial.
Donald McCree: Some of it will be trend. Some of it will be revolver.
Erika Najarian: Got it.
Donald McCree: We kind of play and maybe a five-year kind of maturity bucket on the pro rata side.
Operator: And the next question in line will come from the line of Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets.
Lana Chan: Just a quick question, have you given an estimate on terms of FDIC surcharge savings going into next year?
Bruce Van Saun: No, we haven’t done that. But we’re very much looking forward to it because it is an attractive number, so stay tuned. We’ll probably that will be in our guidance when we do that in January.
Lana Chan: Okay.
Bruce Van Saun: You want to add something, John.
John Woods: Yes, I just mentioned, it's about $15 million a quarter for us. And if anybody’s guess when, it will actually and the general sentiment is that by the end of this year, we’ll go ahead and stop that of the surcharge from being applied, but a $15 million a quarter and we’ll -- as Bruce said we’ll build that in to our outlook as we consider how we want to make investments and drive profitability into 2019.
Lana Chan: And just a follow-up on the securities book and you will see a backup of the long end of the curve recently. Does that change how you view securities deployment or investments opportunities?
Bruce Van Saun: No, I mean I think securities portfolio is primarily a liquidity store as we try to manage against LCR and our internal view about liquidity stress. It also helps us moderate our interest risk exposure. Those are the top two reasons and then we attempt to ensure that we’re doing that in, with the lowest cost way with the highest profitability. In the third quarter, I think front book yields were about 350, 360, run-off yields were about 245 or thereabouts so you’re going to see continuing improvement in that book if the long end continues to behave as the way it’s been behaving. So that’s a good trend for us.
Operator: And our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.
Gerard Cassidy: Can you share with us, clearly as you’ve already discussed about your capital levels being very strong. One of the largest mortgage originators out there Wells Fargo and in case that there's excess capacity in mortgage bank, residential mortgage banking, now that you have Franklin. Are there opportunities to make other acquisitions to build up even more economies of scale? And if so, do you kind of have to wait until integrate Franklin before you could do something?
Bruce Van Saun: I think Franklin was the silver bullet that got us where we need to be in mortgage. So, I wouldn’t see us stepping out and doing any more acquisitions in the mortgage space. Having said that, I do think there will be consolidation in the industry, there’ll be marginal players that are driven out of the business given where gain on sales has moved and that bodes well for the scale players. So, I think we should benefit from that trend.
Gerard Cassidy: And second when you look at optimizing your balance sheet and when you get it to the level where you, where it's optimal. Where do you think, I know ROE is the function of the denominator equity of course and the numerator. But, when you look at it from an ROA perspective some of our best regional banks have ROAs that are in 160s, 170s. What do you think in an optimal environment your ROA could get to?
Bruce Van Saun: I guess we haven't focused that much on that metric, Gerard, you know I think we continue to see that move higher as we run the bank better. You know we have, you have to consider where you are in the cycle and your business mix and so I think our focus is really been on ROTCE we mentioned earlier we’re currently targeting 13 to 15, we’re now in that range. I think if we continue to run the bank well the way we've run it and we can keep delivering operating leverage and get the balance sheet optimizer, there is certainly room for those metrics to move higher.
John Woods: That would imply, I mean there's just the math associated with that that would imply that we would get to the mid ones or thereabouts. You get to the mid teen, on returns you’re basically talking.
Bruce Van Saun: Into the reserve math our focus has really been on the ROTCE.
Operator: And next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.
John Pancari: On the margin side, I just want to engage your updated sensitivity for an increase of 25 basis points by the Fed. What would that equate to in terms of your expected margin benefit at this point?
John Woods: I think that would be on a parallel shift, which is really the issue there, I mean on a parallel shift you’re in that call it $10 to $15 million range in the first quarter and that compounds thereafter close to around 15. In the short end, our sensitivity is about 75%. So we get most of the benefit even if the long end does not rise.
Bruce Van Saun: The stat that we quote typically has been to a gradual 200 basis point rise what would be the impact there. And I think last quarter that was high fours. I think were actually trending up a little bit towards the mid fives some of that is just fine tuning our models but we kept the asset sensitivity reasonably stable. We think that's the proper position to have in a raising rate environment. So we'll continue to benefit as the Fed lifts rates.
John Pancari: And then also on the NIM, is that, that 5 basis points of structural upside to your NIM annually that you see from the balance sheet optimization. Is that still intact that still around 5 basis points that's in your outlook?
John Woods: Yes, we said that previously that without rates we're looking to get somewhere in the neighborhood of approximately five basis points.
Bruce Van Saun: And on a year-over-year by quarter basis this quarter, I think we got 5 out of the 14. So I think we are trending towards that this year and we can update that as part of our guidance for next year in January.
John Pancari: Thank you and last thing for Don. What you mention that you do lead a good number of leverage transactions, but a syndicate a lot of it out what percentage of your leverage deals that you syndicate? Are you in the lead position? And then what is your average hold level?
Donald McCree: I would say our hold level is in the 10ish range, I don't have the exact number so just to call it 10 million, so relatively small. We plan a lot of deals that are kind of 300 million to 400 million in size so that will give you a sense. I think the general rule in my careers been you want to hold less than 5% of the risk you're originating that’s what we try to do. And I would say we’re probably leading of that 65% to 70% of the deal, these are I believe leads or jointly.
Operator: And our next question will come from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Kevin Barker: In regards to some of the movements around the liabilities, we know the wholesale deposits went up quite a bit this quarter. And some of that could be seasonality and how you are funding your balance sheet specifically at period end. Given that Citizens Access has come on board and you should see an acceleration of deposit growth there. Do you expect wholesale deposits to decline in the fourth quarter? Or was there some seasonal aspect that you would see a shift between your interest bearing deposits and your wholesale funding?
John Woods: Yes. I think on the wholesale side we tend to see that relatively stable where the trade off is that at least in the near-term on Citizens Access is, as we’re trading off promotional activities that might otherwise have occurred in the businesses, in the branch businesses that we can do more efficiently through Citizens Access. So, there is a little bit of trade off there. And sure at the margin, you might find a little bit of impact on the wholesale, but that tends to be structurally a bit stable and we’ll be in place of the near-term.
Kevin Barker: And then when you think about your fee income going forward, you expect Franklin to continue at this rate with the margins that they’re generating given the capacity constraints within the mortgage industry beyond the expense phase that you’ve already laid out?
John Woods: Yes. I‘ll start up with that and maybe Brad will add, but I mean our margins are down in the industry for both our legacy Citizens business and which we’ve seen, and we’ve seen that in the data that came over in the history for Franklin. I think there is, two forces there that are going to correct that. One is, we are endeavoring to get much more efficient and take capacity out ourselves which Brad can talk about. And therefore to offset that decline in revenue due to margin by being more efficient on our platform. And then as Bruce mentioned earlier, the other participants in the marketplace there is some non bank players they’re just aren’t going to make it. And we expect that the capacity will come out therefore you’ll see margin stabilize a bit over time, it’s just a natural ebb and flow of the mortgage market. But I’ll stop there and see Brad has anything more to add.
Brad Conner: Yes, really not much more to add beyond this. I think you said it right, we would fully expect and we’re already started to see it with the competitors taking capacity out and that will have the natural balancing impact of bringing margins back to more normal level. And then in the mean time, we’ll be very, very disciplined about expenses.
Bruce Van Saun: Look, I would just add. It's Bruce. That we’re very excited about this acquisition that is really gets us the scale that we needed. It diversifies our originations channels. It’s a real quality operation with great technology. We’re going to keep moving aggressively to better customer experience and digitizing frontend origination got some great plans in the business. And so, we have high hopes for the business, and the market is a little soft that we'll work our way through that. But this is something that we wanted to be in and we think it’s an important product capability that we need to offer to our consumer customers on their life journey where we can be their trusted advisor and help them go through a very big personal transaction for them. And now I think we’re in the business with the right scale and the right way.
Operator: And there are no further questions in the queue at this time. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Well thanks again for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support. I think there is a great opportunity to make money in this stock. I’ll just add fortuitously. We continue to execute well and we maintain a positive outlook for the fourth quarter. So, have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: And that’s concludes today’s conference call. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-07-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference call. My name is Paul, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor: Thank you so much, Paul, and good morning everyone. We really appreciate you joining us on another busy day. Our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will start the call by reviewing our second quarter results, and then we're going to open things out for questions. Also with us in the room today are Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking. So, I need to remind you that in addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation and financial supplement that you can find on our Web site at investor.citizensbank.com. And of course our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and we provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K we filed today. And we also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and earnings release. And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thanks, Ellen. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. We're pleased to report another very strong quarter paced by strong top line growth of 8% and good expense management, which combined for positive operating leverage of 4.3% year-on-year. We achieved good balance sheet growth with 2% sequential average loan and deposit growth led by strong performance in commercial. Year-on-year, our loan growth was 3% and deposit growth was 4%. We continue to feel good about our capital management strategy, that is, we have been able to fund strong organic loan growth, deliver attractive levels of capital return to shareholders, and target modest size fee-based acquisitions to expand our product and our service offerings. Today we announced the 23% increase in our dividend to $0.27 per common share. We also remain on track to close our Franklin American Mortgage acquisition in early August. The strong executive so far in 2018 continues to deliver impressive improvement in key metrics. In the second quarter, our EPS grew by 40% year-on-year, our ROTCE improved to 12.9%, which is up 3.4% year-on-year, and our efficiency ratio improved to 58%. We remain confident in our outlook for the second-half with strong performance expected to continue. Today we announced our TOP V programs, which is not a surprise since we had one every year, but certainly not something that should be overlooked. Our management team operates with a mindset of continuous improvement. We are constantly seeking ways to run the bank better and to do more for our customers. The program announced today goes on the work of previous programs delivering approximately 100 million in run rate benefit by the end of 2019 with two-thirds of that coming on the expense side. These programs have been key to both our consistent delivery of positive operating leverage plus our rising customer satisfaction scores. We continue to achieve good external recognition for our progress with customers and on innovation. You can see that laid out in our slide deck. Suffice to say, we feel we've shifted from playing defense and catch up to now playing offense and leaning-forward to utilize new technologies, embrace the digital operating model, and leverage data. More work to do, but we are heading in the right direction. So with that, let me turn it over to our CFO, John Woods, who will take you through the numbers in more detail and provide you with some color. John?
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning everyone. I'll run through the highlights of our second quarter results which start on Slide 3. We generated net income of 425 million and diluted EPS of $0.88 per share, which was up 13% linked quarter and up 40% year-over-year. Once again, we delivered solid positive operating leverage of 7% year-over-year, or 4% on an underlying basis adjusting for some notable items we had in the prior year. Net interest income of 1.1 billion was up 3% linked quarter, driven by 2% average loan growth. Our net interest margin increased two basis points linked quarter and 21 basis points year-over-year. I will cover the margin in more detail in a few minutes. We delivered nice growth in fees, which came in at 388 million, up 5% linked quarter and year-over-year, and up 2% on an underlying basis from the second quarter of 2017, which included near record capital market fees. We continue to make progress on our efficiency ratio, which came in at 58%, roughly a 2.5 percentage improvement linked quarter and year-over-year on an underlying basis. This strong performance drove a nice improvement in ROTCE, which came in at 12.9% compared with 11.7% in the first quarter and 9.6% in the second quarter of last year. These excellent results reflect our commitment to delivering strong revenue growth while maintaining operating expense discipline resulting in consistent and robust operating leverage. As you know, we are always looking to find ways to run the bank better and improve our return. In a few minutes, I will walk you through the next phase of our TOP program, which will contribute further efficiencies and revenue opportunities for us, while funding investments to drive future growth. Let's go to Slide 5 to cover our NII NIM results. Despite a very competitive environment, we continue to deliver attractive balance sheet growth with average loans up 2% linked quarter and 3% year-over-year, which helped us drive a 3% linked quarter increase in NII. Our net interest margin improved in line with our expectations, up two basis points linked quarter and 21 basis points year-over-year, reflecting a nice improvement in loan yields, given the pick-up in short-term rates and improvements driven by our balance sheet optimization efforts, where we were able to shift the mix of our loan portfolio towards high return category. Loan yields were up 19 basis points this quarter, more than offsetting higher funding cost of 15 basis points, which reflects the full-quarter effect of 750 million in senior debt we issued in late March and the impact of rise in short rates on our deposit cost. Note that we grew period end deposits by over 1% in the second quarter and the spot LDR ended the quarter at 97.5%. Taking a look at fees on Slide 6, non-interest income was up 5% linked quarter and 2% year-over-year on an underlying basis. The improvement in linked quarter fees was driven by a strong quarter in capital market, where we continue to leverage investments we made in talent and broadening our capability. Market conditions in the second quarter helped drive robust activity in loan syndication, where we closed a record number of transactions and nearly doubled loan syndication fees in the first quarter level. FX and interest rate product revenue was a record for us this quarter, up over 20% on a linked quarter basis and over 30% year-over-year, reflecting the increase in loan demand and a favorable interest rate and currency environment, which drove increased hedging activity. Linked quarter service charges and fees were up from a seasonally lower first quarter level, while trust and investment fees increased, reflecting higher sale volume. The remaining fee categories were relatively stable linked quarter. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest income also benefited from strong contributions from FX and interest rate products and from higher trust and investment fees. Capital market was down modestly compared with the record levels in Q2 '17. The outlook for Q3 is strong as our pipeline and activity levels continue to be robust. Turning to Slide 7, our expenses remain well-controlled. Linked quarter expenses were down $8 million, given the seasonal decrease in salaries and benefits. Outside services were $7 million higher, reflecting costs tied to our strategic growth initiatives and work we're doing to run the bank more efficiently. Other expense is also $7 million higher driven by an increase in advertising and charitable contribution. Our expenses also included about $3 million of transaction costs related to the Franklin American Mortgage acquisition, which we expect to close in early August. Year-over-year expenses were up 3% on an underlying basis, including higher salaries and benefits and outside services expense, driven by continued investment to drive growth. We remain focused on finding ways to self-fund our growth initiatives and are doing a good job of finding efficiencies in same discipline. Let's move on and discuss the balance sheet in Slide 8. You can see we continue to grow our balance sheet and expand our NIM. Overall, we grew average core loans 2% linked quarter and 4% year-over-year, driven by strength across most of our commercial business lines and in education, mortgage, and unsecured retail in the consumer side. The growth in commercial loans were somewhat impacted by the sale of $353 million of lower return commercial loans and leases near the end of the quarter associated with our balance sheet optimization initiatives. For the quarter, our period end loan growth was 1.8% or 2.1%, excluding the impact of this sale. Our loan yields continue to improve given our balance sheet optimization along with continued discipline on pricing. We also benefited from higher LIBOR rates during the quarter. We remain well-positioned to benefit from the rising rate environment with asset sensitivity to a gradual rising rate to 4.6% versus 5% last quarter. Our asset sensitivity has naturally moderated given the rising rate environment. Let's take a look at our funding costs on Slide 9. Total funding costs were up 15 basis points, which reflected 11 basis points tied to deposit cost and four basis points associated with borrowed funds. This included the impact of the $750 million senior debt issuance late in the first quarter. Year-over-year, our total cost of funds was up 33 basis points, reflecting a continued shift to greater long-term funding along with the impact of higher rate. This compares with asset yield expansion of 51 basis points. The industry overall seems some increased deposit competition, but for the most part, deposit cost have been relatively well-behaved, and I'm very pleased that we continue to grow DDA. Our cumulative data on interest-bearing deposits is now 28%, and remains in line with our overall expectations, given where we are in the rate cycle. We continue to invest in analytics to improve our targeting to digital and direct mail offerings from the consumer side. And in commercial, we are making investments to build out additional product capabilities and to roll out our new cash management platform early next year. Also, earlier this month, we launched Citizen's Access, which will contribute to our funding diversification and optimization of deposit levels and costs. We expect to raise about $2 billion of deposits through this nationwide direct to consumer digital channel by the end of the year. So this is a relatively small part of our overall deposit strategy. We think it will be an excellent complement to our highly-accretive retail lending initiatives, such as education, finance, merchant finance, and home equity. We are very excited about this platform giving us access to our whole new set of deposit customers with the minimal effect on our existing deposit base. Next, let's move to Slide 10 and cover credit. Overall credit quality continues to be strong, reflecting the continued mix shift with higher quality, lower risk retail loan, paired with the stable risk profile in our commercial book. The non-performing loan ratio improved to 75 basis points of loans this quarter, down from 94 basis points a year ago. The net charge-off rate of 27 basis points for the second quarter is relatively stable both linked quarter and compared with the prior year. Retail net charge-offs improved from the first quarter, mostly reflecting a seasonal improvement in auto. Commercial net charge-offs for the second quarter were up $15 million versus last quarter, which benefited from a modest net recovery. Provision for credit losses of $85 million included a $9 million reserve build, primarily tied to loan growth. As we increase the mix of higher quality retail portfolios in our overall loan book, our allowance for total loans and leases ratio has decreased modestly to 1.1%. The NPL coverage ratio improved to 148% from 144% in the first quarter and 119% in the second quarter of 2017, given continued reductions in NPLs and run-off in the non-core portfolio. On Slide 11, let's cover capital. We ended the quarter with a strong CET1 ratio of 11.2%, which was stable compared to the first quarter and the prior year. This quarter as part of our 2017 CCAR plan, we repurchased 3.6 million shares and returned $257 million to shareholders, including dividend. It's also worth noting the total amount returned to shareholders in the 2017 CCAR window was $1.3 billion, including dividend. As you know, we received a non-objective to our 2018 CCAR capital plan, which includes up to 1.02 billion share repurchases. We announced an increase in our dividend today by 23% to $0.27 per share, and we also have the ability to increase the quarterly dividend again to $0.32 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Overall return of capital to shareholders in the plan is up 300 million, or 23% versus 2017 CCAR. Our planned glide path to reduce our CET1 ratio by at least 40 basis points over the cycle remains on track, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive improving financial performance and attractive return to shareholders. Let's move on to Slide 12. Our TOP programs have successfully delivered efficiency that allow us to self-fund investment and continue to drive future growth. We have executed very well on the TOP IV initiative, which are now expected to deliver $100 million to $110 million pre-tax by the end of 2018. We are also very excited to share the details of our new TOP V program today, which highlights our focus on continuous improvement and delivering value to our shareholders. This program targets a pre-tax benefit of $90 million to $100 million by the end of 2018 with approximately two-thirds tied to efficiency initiative. On the efficiency side, we are constantly challenging ourselves to do even better, and we continue to see further opportunity. We will continue to focus on transforming our branch footprint in support of our shift to an advisory service model. We are also working to simplify more of our organization by leveraging new process improvement and agile ways of working across the bank. Our customer journey's work will drive end-to-end process efficiencies with simple and excellent customer experiences. On the revenue side, we are embarking on the next-phase of our data analytics efforts to enhance the targeting of our product offerings and improve the customer experience. We will continue building out our fee income capabilities to new work on customer journey and the build out of full-service bond underwriting capabilities. And we are planning to continue our successful commercial banking expansion into attractive MSAs, such as Dallas and Houston, where we already have a presence tied to industry vertical. In short, our management team remains fully committed to strong execution of these programs, which allows us to serve our customers better, make the company stronger, and deliver long-term value to our shareholders. On Page 13, we have provided color on how we are progressing against our strategic initiative. This slide highlights some of the progress we are making against our efforts to optimize the balance sheet and the investments in our fee generating capability. We also wanted to highlight some of the interesting things that are going on our businesses as we remain focused on becoming a top performing bank. On Slide 14, you can see the steady and impressive progress we are making against our financial targets. Since 3Q '13, our ROTCE has include from 4.3% to 12.9% as we approached the lower end of the range of our 13% to 15% medium-term ROTCE charges this quarter. Our efficiency ratio has improved by 10 percentage points over that same timeframe from 68% to 58%; and EPS continues on a very strong trajectory as well, up to $0.88 from $0.26. Let's turn to our third quarter outlook on Slide 15. I should point out that this outlook is before the impact of Franklin American Mortgage, which we expect to close in early August. On the bottom of the slide, I will talk a little about the impact we are expecting for the third quarter from the transaction. On a standalone basis, we expect to produce linked quarter average loan growth of around 1.25%. We also expect net interest margin to continue to expand modestly in linked quarter. In non-interest income, we are expecting to see a modest increase with continued strength in capital market, given the strength of our pipeline heading into the third quarter. We expect non-interest expense to be up modestly in the third quarter with positive operating leverage and further efficiency ratio improvement. Additionally, we expect provision expense to be in a likely range of $85 million to $95 million. And finally, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to end the third quarter around 10.9% including the impact of Franklin American Mortgage and expect the average LDR to be around 99%. Moving to Slide 16, we expect the Franklin American Mortgage transaction to close in early August. It should contribute about 550 million of loans held for sale, and about [technical difficulty]. We also expected deliver about 25 million to 30 million of servicing and origination fees for the third quarter with an MSR of about 600 million at the end of the quarter. We expect expenses to be in the same range as fees excluding integration cost of about 10 million in the quarter. As we told you when we announced the deal, we expect our CET1 ratio to be impacted by about 18 basis points. To sum up on Slide 17, our strong results this quarter demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategic initiatives and continue to include how we run the bank to drive underlying revenue growth and carefully manage our expense base. Our outlook remains positive as we work to become a top-performing regional bank. Let me turn it back to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thanks, John. Paul, why don't we open it up for some questions?
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill Partners. Your line is now open.
Scott Siefers: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi.
Scott Siefers: First just sort of a tic-tac question on the guidance, the 1.25% average loan growth expectation for the third quarter, it's granted [ph] a very subtle change, but just a little lower than the 2Q. John, I guess I am wondering if there has been any change in demand, customer appetite et cetera, or is that just a function of the late 2Q portfolio of sale? In other words, are we sort of at a steady state 6% annualized on kind of apples to apples basis, or has there been any change in your mind?
Bruce Van Saun: I'll start off, Scott, and then John and maybe Don can offer a commentary. But I would say we feel very good about our ability to originate loans particularly on the commercial side. And we had a very strong pipeline coming into Q2. We were a little sluggish in Q1 as the whole industry was, but ultimately we're going to trend in line with the industry. Because of the hiring that we're doing and the geographic expansion and build up of some of our verticals, I think we should be kind of at the north end of where our peers are, which we have been able to sustain. I think the outlook for Q3 continues to be very positive on the commercial side. We've got good pipelines heading into Q3, and the sale that we did late in the quarter is just part of our balance sheet optimization efforts. And we -- probably that impacts the outlook by 25 to 30 basis points. So you would probably be looking at an annualized rate of 6% or so in the third quarter, absent the impact of that sale. Consumer has been kind of impacted somewhat by market conditions being a little sluggish in the first-half. There is a usually a seasonal pick up in Q3 tied to our education finance business. And so, we would expect to see a bit of a pick-up there. As you know, we are running down auto and we have had HELOC as a phenomena in the market that's been prepaying and paying off. And so, we have had that as a little bit of a headwind on the consumer side. But overall, I feel very good about the outlook for growth, and I think if we are kind of on a year-to-date basis a little bit behind, a tad behind on the loan growth. We have made up for it with running ahead on NIM, where we have had another rate hike than we assumed going into the year. And so, I think the NII outlook continues to track really well for the full-year, maybe a little less on loan growth, little more on NIM, but certainly moving towards the high-end of the goalpost for the full-year outlook. I have said a lot, John; you want to pick-up the ball from there?
John Woods: Yes. It's a real high-level point maybe on consumer and commercial. So, some headwinds as you mentioned with auto running down and a pick-up and some attrition that we have seen in home equity, but the things looked to be balanced out a little bit in 2Q. We are looking forward with refi, some strength in mortgage, and in the unsecured space overall. So that looks good. And in commercial, as you mentioned lending pipelines are holding strong. After a very solid 2Q, we still see the pipelines holding steady in both the C&I and CRE space. So from that perspective we are feeling good about it. And if you look at how we are comparing, Bruce gave you the overview, but when you think about how we are looking versus HA [ph], pretty much across the board, we are either in line or better. So I think we are executing well on that front. So those would be the only comments I would add.
Scott Siefers: Okay.
Bruce Van Saun: Don, you have any comment?
Donald McCree: No, just confirm the pipeline look good. I feel very good about the fact that - you will see it continue to manage the balance sheet for assets that are just not working for us on a total return on yield basis. And the good news about the assets we sold is we sold them at far better, which is a reflection of where the market is. So, it was a very attractive sale for us.
Scott Siefers: Okay.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And I would just add one last point, Scott, is that we're constantly calibrating -- we have loan growth opportunities. Do we pursue all of that or do we either look at the back book or throttle back on the front book depending on where we think the funding cost that are going to go where we need deposits to fund the loan growth. And so that constant calibration is what it's going to cost us to fund the loan growth, is it going to be NIM accretive, is it going to be ROTCE accretive? And I think what you are seeing is that we have been able to sustain loan growth at the high end of peers, still have our NIM expand, still have our ROTCE expand because of some of the attractive lending pockets that we've identified.
Scott Siefers: Okay, that's perfect color. Thank you. And then if I can ask just one really quick separate one on the mortgage company acquisition? Granted it's small, but on the financial information you detailed on Slide 16 for the impact, does the accretion grow at all after the third quarter? Or once we pop in the NII fee and expense impact for the third quarter, is that sort of steady state from there on out?
John Woods: Yes, thanks, Scott, good question. So yes, what that reflects exclude the synergies that once we close on the deal, we will start executing against the various expense synergies that we talked about on the funding side, on the operational side and in servicing category. So you can -- I think we mentioned that we would expect that things would modestly accretive in 2H [ph]. And so that's our outlook there. And we talked about the 2% in 2019 and 3% in 2020, but -- so that's you are seeing on [indiscernible] synergies.
Scott Siefers: Okay, terrific. All right, thank you guys very much.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
John Pancari: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi.
John Pancari: Back to the commercial loan growth just want to see if you can give us just a little more color on what is really driving that in terms of loan types, is it more larger corporate? And then if also you can give us an idea where the new money yields are for the commercial loans that are coming on the books right now? Thanks.
Donald McCree: So it's really across the board. I mean it's concentrated in some of our industry verticals which tend to be slightly larger accounts and our expansion mortgage which also tend to be slightly larger credit, so more of mid-corp and middle market. And the reason for that particular expansion mortgage is we are being careful on credit quality. So as we are in new markets, we want to be dealing with bigger companies with slightly more financial flexibility. We are also seeing a little bit better utilization of working capital, which I think is indicative of some of the tax effect coming through with particular our midsized companies. And we are seeing a decent amount of M&A activity in terms of funding of M&A oriented activities in the client base. And I would say yields have held up pretty well. I mean our front book originations aren't too far off our existing portfolio. And we are being selective. If we are seeing overly competitive situations where yields are unattractive from a return basis, and we don't have cross-sell, we are passing. And we have actually seen a fair amount of aggressiveness in the market which we don't like. But we are being highly selective in terms of where we thought. And the way we look at it is not just loan yields, but it's overall return on credit extension, so it includes cross sell capability into our cash management business as well as our capital markets and mortgage business.
John Pancari: Okay.
John Woods: And just to add a little bit to that, the new loan yields coming in are in the middle market space are in the mid 450s or so. And you can see that we are as yield continue to go up driven by the Fed, we're able to capture most of that into the coupon from the front book and that plus cost will drive very attractive funding opportunities as we look at that base.
John Pancari: Got it, okay, thanks. Then separately in terms of the loan loss reserve I know you are -- a little bit more down to about 110 basis points overall. How are you thinking about that level here particularly as you -- particularly given the space of growth you have seen in certain loan portfolios like in the commercial and everything and where we are in the credit cycle? Where do you see that going from here?
Bruce Van Saun: I'll start and then maybe John you can chime in. But that's just been modestly declining I think. If you go back a couple of years ago, it might have been in 116–117. And it's down around 110. I think there is a number of things that play. Obviously, the credit back book is very, very clean. And so that's a factor. And then as we remix loans and run offs on far legacy dodgier loans if you will and really expand in areas where -- on the consumer side we're pristine in terms of our credit risk appetite. I think that remixing also requires lower overall reserve levels. And so I think it's really a reflection of where we are in terms of our credit risk appetite, where we are in the credit cycle. And we feel good about those levels at this point.
John Woods: Yes, just would add, I think we would see now that there are in terms of where we are in the cycle when you look at charge offs rates being where they are in 20s, we all imagine that's on the lower end of where things will likely be through the cycle. But just how the accounting works and that's what we are tied to, how the accounting works we are looking at the current loss model which really wouldn't allow us to really put out much more than what we are doing. And I mean I think the…
Bruce Van Saun: We are building reserves. Two quarters in a row we -- this quarter we had 9 million billed provision over charge offs. So I think we're keeping up with some of that loan growth, but we have such good results on that credit backlog that's netting to not much of increase in the overall allowance.
John Woods: Yes, and that mix shift that Bruce mentioned is a driver, so we're just heading -- we are seeing better quality stuff come in the front books that's going at the back.
John Pancari: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Your line is now open.
Saul Martinez: Hi, good morning everybody. Couple of questions, first, can you talk a little bit about your expectations for deposit costs up 11 bps? But if I just look at interesting bearing is up about 15 sequentially, can you just give us a sense of how you think about the glide path there? And you mentioned the cumulative beta still been relatively low. Where do you think -- as the rate cycle progresses, where do you think that can go to in terms of both cumulative beta but also the incremental beta on the later hikes?
John Woods: I'll go ahead and take that. So I mean, yes, we had deposit cost up 15 basis points from interesting bearing. I think it's important add that when you include our very solid DDA growth really the all-in growth in deposit cost was 11 basis points. And that's been really and dramatic of the investments we have been making in that space to really drive DDA. And we are really proud to be able to continue to grow DDA in this environment which is better than many have been able to do. So that's the position we are in. We continue to see some opportunities to grow DDA going forward which will offset the interesting bearing cost as you indicated. Cumulative beta is around 28. I think you could see us getting into the low 30s in the second half of the year in terms of cumulative betas, even ending the year still in the low 30s. And sequentially betas, by the time you get to the end of the year, it depends on who many hikes you get, right? If you look out of the window and say, listen, there is a sense that we will get more at least but may be not the second one, you could see sequential betas getting into the 50 or 60% level by the time you get to the end of the year really being driven by that at least one more hike that we think we will get either in September or November.
Saul Martinez: Obviously, you have the asset sensitivity in the mix shift, though the balance sheet optimization helping you, but is there a point at which the beta in terms of rates or betas that an incremental hike becomes NIM neutral?
John Woods: Yes, just something to think about on the loan side, our loan betas are around 60% and continue to hold in at that level. When you think about deposit base, you got to remember about all the non-interest bearing funding including equity that needs to adjust that level. So even out of deposit beta at 60%, the effective beta is really 45%, and so it continues to be useful and accretive to grow into that kind of environment, and we're constantly looking into that on a quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month basis, and we monitor the incremental loan growth against the incremental deposit cost and we make financial decisions that are quite prudent in that regard. But I don't think we should be scared away from 60% deposit betas because of that other effect that I mentioned.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, and I would just add to that. So if you look at the overall asset sensitivity that we published in response to 200 basis points gradual hikes, we held in pretty much around a 5% level. I think we're tad under 5%, but that speaks to John's point that the dynamic right now still is for NIM accretion as the Fed continues to hike. And I'd say when you look at our deposit costs, if you kind of align the peer group, a super-regional peer group about who is growing deposits and who is actually flat on deposits, and who is actually shrinking their deposits and allowing their LDR to flow it up, I think we're doing a darn good job in terms of -- you know, you could draw regression equation on that. And so, we're going to have slightly higher growth in our interest-bearing deposit cost, because we're actually growing deposits because we have a loan growth. And that's all to the good because we have NIM expanding, we have our ROTCE expanding, and so we've got that calibration really under focus, and we're managing it very well in my view.
Saul Martinez: Okay, that's helpful. And if I could just follow-up on the asset side, loan yields were up a lot this quarter, 33 bips and I think 40 plus for commercial, how much did the LIBOR blowing out relative to the Fed funds help and how should we think about asset yields and commercial loan yields I guess specifically with incremental hikes?
John Woods: Yes, I mean that helps, right. So I mean we get 30-some basis points and that's a bit of help.
Bruce Van Saun: That was there last quarter though too. So that's been kind of on a sequential quarter basis, you've had the LIBOR anticipating the moves, and so it's relatively neutral I think from Q2 to Q3 because they both have that phenomenon.
John Woods: They do, yes. So first quarter the phenomenon was really stronger than second quarter. And you saw three months LIBOR and one month LIBOR kind of tightening in a little bit, but Bruce is exactly right quarter-over-quarter, 1Q to 2Q similar phenomenon. As you head into 3Q, we're going to continue to get asset yield growth, but it will be more balanced with the consumer side of the house. In 2Q, you saw C&I really driving it in Q3, it will be more balanced between consumer and commercial. And the other thing to talk about, we still are in about even post swap adjusted basis with 52% of our assets are floating. But the other 48% continues to drive improvement when we get that - when you don't have the rate, I just take benefits from that, from the lag effect on the flipside of the asset block.
Saul Martinez: Okay. Just one final quickie, on the guidance for Franklin American, that 25 to 30, is that I guess we should think of that as a two-month impact and then as opposed…
John Woods: Yes, roughly yes.
Saul Martinez: All right, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Ken Usdin: Hi. Good morning, guys. For Bruce or John, I was just wondering around the CCAR outcome, you guys had written in your own press release about your discontent about the outcome, and I was just wondering if you can just help us understand what your perception is about the disconnect and what you're trying to do in terms of the dialogs about the models, and hopefully that I can get into a better direction for you guys because obviously you have a ton of capital and so the ability to continue to -- you return plenty of it, but just in terms of the outcome and the outlook, I think it would be helpful to understand. Thanks.
John Woods: Yes, sure, Ken. And this is a private conversation that we're having with the Fed, but I'll tell you kind of the headline of it so you get a sense as to where we think the -- but the Fed changed their PPNR model in the 2017 CCAR cycle to move away from more of an average industry approach to firm-specific approach. And I think when they built that model they pick up data from right after the great recession, which we think has data elements in it. So when you think about the super-regional peers, most of the super-regional peers had the benefit of TARP funding and were able to grow their balance sheets, and dues, in some cases acquisitions that were quite accretive. Citizens uniquely was owned by a foreign government, if you will, 80% owned by the U.K. government, not eligible for TARP and needed to shrink its balance sheet too because they didn't get the TARP funding, but also because its parent needed to raise capital levels, and I was there, so I know I saw that firsthand. And so, from peak to trough, the Citizens balance sheet shrunk by 30% and peers actually went the other direction, I think the average peer was 125 to 160; we were 160 down to 125 over a five-year period. When you shrink, as you know, in banking, you end up with an impact on your fixed expense base, so your overall expense ratio goes up, which really depletes your PPNR. So if you're picking up that data, you're going to get one set of results for most banks; you're going to get a unique set of results for us who has unique history. And then when you look at how does the Fed run the CCAR model, they actually assume that your balance sheet is going to grow, they don't assume that it's going to shrink when they do their forecast through stress. And so, you have a total inconsistency between the assumption on what's going to happen to the balance sheet and then the data that they're picking up for their PPNR model. So that's the short version of it. We've had continuing dialog, and we're actually hopeful because we think this is a very clear logical argument that we're putting forth, and when those have been presented to the Fed in the past, they've been willing to consider them and make adjustments. So we're hopeful that that will resonate.
Ken Usdin: Understood, okay, thanks for that. Appreciate that. John, one question for you, there are lot of focus obviously on the right side of the balance sheet, can you help us understand how much more efficiency improvement do you have on the left side? You have talked about a lot of the things that you're working on in terms of the mix and the changes. But any tangible examples of where you still see an asset yield improvement that we may not be getting yet in the current results?
John Woods: Yes, absolutely. So, on the asset side, we think about it as reallocating capital from lower return categories. We missed a fair bit of that out there. We've got a relatively large auto book and an asset finance book and a non-core book that all tend to come in a bit lower on the risk return profile than maybe some of the other opportunities that we have up there in the student space and emerging finance and all in within C&I. So there's still a fair bit of that to go, and you can't really fix that kind of stuff in one or two quarters; it takes years to be able to fully transform the balance sheet, and so, we have embarked upon this with the level of formality and you will continue to see benefits coming out of that behavior over the next year or two. I would also mention we not only see opportunities across loan categories, but within loan categories themselves and where we want to rotate more return basically bottom quartile investments that we may have made and maybe increasing the velocity of exiting those relationships and rotating them into and reallocating the capital in different relationships is also an opportunity, and that's indicative of what we did with the $350 million that you saw in 2Q. So I think there's still a fair bit let to go on that front.
Ken Usdin: Got it. Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Ken Zerbe: Great, thanks. Good morning. I guess, first question just in terms of the broader guidance, I certainly appreciate the third quarter guidance, it is very helpful, but when we think about like the full-year guidance that you had given a couple quarters ago, specifically loan growth I think was 4.5 to 5.5 and fee growth of over 4.5. Are those targets are superseded by the third quarter, meaning should we no longer rely on the full-year targets you gave a few quarters ago? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: We'd say, Ken, that will give you annual guidance at the beginning of the year, it's the policy. And then, we will give you quarterly updates and we will comment in around about the annual guidance as go, but we are not in the business of updating that full-year guidance every quarter. You have got two quarters in the bank, you have got detailed guidance on 3Q, and so really I hope it's left us to beat the puzzles to come up with a fourth quarter for all you analysts on the line. But if you just look at the trends of how we are performing, as I mentioned that to an earlier question that I think on NII, we are very strong, and you can do the projections based on what's in the tank in 3Q and you'd come out, I think towards the top end of the goalpost on NII, and I think the roadmap to get there as I indicated is maybe a little less loan growth than initially assumed, but better NIM expansions than we had initially assumed. On fees, I think you can project that out, and we are going to be a little light I think of the range. It depends if you want to include Franklin American that would put us back in the range, but except, we probably be a little lighter than ranged. On expenses, we are tracking to kind of -- certainly the range is not the left goalpost to the range. So when you stir that together, you are going to find I think a strong PPNR that's consistent with the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year. And then where we have had -- I think a solid improvement is going to be our credit cost. So we feel good about our ability to deliver against the guidance at the beginning of the year both on a PPNR basis and on a credit cost.
Ken Zerbe: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, just in terms of Citizens Access. When we think about the growth there, and presumably they are come at somewhat higher cost than your normal deposits, your branch-driven deposits. How does Citizens Access change? How you feel about your asset sensitivity going forward?
John Woods: Yes, I will go ahead and take that one. So, as you know, we just launched this thing, just for context. This is a nice diversification performing sources, but when you think about, what we are trying to drive here approximately $2 billion by the end of the year, that's less than 2% of our deposit base. So we want to keep it in context. We are excited about it. We think it's a great platform to test and learn innovative approaches to customer experience, but nevertheless it's still about -- it's less than 2% of our deposit base. With respect to cost, the launch rates as you know when we think it launched to typically a little higher to drive awareness and consideration, but it's still lower than the marginal large commercial and consumer promo and wholesale borrowings that are on our balance sheet. And so from that perspective, it's very important qualitatively, but even financially at the margins these are desirable deposits to be on the balance sheet, just to give you a couple of numbers here and then I think from -- even at our launch rate, which we have the unique ability to be able to do, so that we can lag pricing later on we are around 2% on savings and that's the majority of what we have going on here. Even large commercial depositors would be in excess of that and really the promotional ways, when you consider the cannibalization it typically occurs in a branch-based promotional activity, those rates will be higher than what we are driving out of Citizens Access as well. So we are really excited about it on both fronts, both the strategic aspects of it and the financial aspects of it in the box that we are keeping it on the balance sheet.
Bruce Van Saun: And I would just add, John, I think it gives us access to a whole new customer set and a customer base that we haven't had access to before. We are 11 days into the launch. We are optimistic about the progress we've made. And we have already taken deposits in all 50 states. So it's a good sign that we are reaching new customers.
Ken Zerbe: All right. Great, thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
Kevin Barker: Good morning. Could you talk about your growth projections over 2019-2020, or maybe over the next three or four years for Citizens Access, given the structure of that and how much you expect it to grow, or at least be a portion of your overall deposit base?
Brad Conner: Yes, I mean, I'd say this, I mean, it's hard to see where this goes, right, and so we will remain nimble as it relates to where we want this to head. But you wouldn't imagine that this thing would get out of a single-digit percentages of total deposits going forward, or maybe I guess into the five to at the very highest ten, but I would say a good expectation would be maybe high single-digits, but we are going to -- like I said, we are going to test and learn. This is new for us, and we are excited about how things have launched you out of the gate. But it won't be a huge part of our deposit base over the next couple of years as we look out into the future.
Kevin Barker: Okay. And do you view this as an alternative to funding the typical branch deposit base in order to gain new customers and potentially grow assets through these new customers, or do you view this as like an alternative funding source to replace the wholesale funding?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, let me take that, but I would say that it is an alternative funding source that can be compared and contrasted with some of our higher cost marginal dollars of funding. So what would those be, certainly on the commercial side, we have pockets like borrowings from financial institutions or pooled government funds that you could look that marginal cost of that versus using this channel. Certainly on the consumer side, the kind of promo CD pricing to cost new money from our existing customers into the bank, you could compare and contrast that versus this offering, which is much more diffuse and going to attract money on a much broader basis. And so that's principally how we would view it. Having said that, what Brad just said, I think it's quite important the kind of test and learn and enhancing our digital capabilities, and then can we offer additional products and services digitally to these customers. We have some very attractive lending products for example, but maybe those customers would be interested in, we will see where it goes.
Kevin Barker: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was hoping if you could just elaborate on the appetite for some of the fee revenue deals, and then, specifically in mortgage, do you feel like you've got the scale on the servicing side that you want there, or is that an area of opportunities though?
Bruce Van Saun: I would start here and say, you know, I think the areas where we haven't had the scale, the biggest holes really have been on the consumer side fee activities. The first was mortgage. I think this really addressed what we feel we needed. So I don't think there is really more we need to do in mortgage. The second area has been wealth, and we've been building that organically getting the business model right in terms of how we distribute through our branches and become trusted advisor to a much broader swat of our client base. We are missing some opportunities I would say at the highest end of the pyramid, and the cross-sell over into commercial where we offer great banking services to some middle market companies and very wealthy families. But we really don't have that high-end capability that competes well in the marketplace with some others. And so, that might be an area for example where we look to do an acquisition or other things in the footprint that can potentially get us more breadth and get us a bigger financial consultant for us faster than doing it organically. So those will be the areas on the consumer side. I'd say on the commercial side, we did the M&A boutique. We still have opportunity I think based on the size of our customer base to expand that, and so we might build off that platform and higher organically, or if we can find some other boutiques that maybe cover certain industry verticals, we could seek to bolt-on that way to that platform. I think there are opportunities potentially around the payment space and some of the innovation that's taking place there. Some of those things could be through FinTech, some of those things potentially could open opportunities for acquisitions, but I think we are now feeling good about our capability to source deals due to diligence, execute them well. That was kind of muscle that we didn't have, we didn't need, we haven't done a deal prior to one last year, and I guess it was 13 years, I think 2004 was the Charter 1 deal. But now we've got the capability inside the bank, and we feel good about our opportunity to source these things putting in. I think they're going to be straight down the fairway modest in size, fit a strategic need and have good financials associated with them.
Matt O'Connor: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Erika Najarian: Yes, good morning. I just had a few follow-up questions, Bruce it's been really impressive to see the ROTCE improvement and what's really stunning is even you look to do that with the CET1 ratio just essentially flat lining at 11.2%, and I'm wondering given the 290 basis points difference between the co-run model and the Fed model like Ken was mentioned in his line of questioning, if there is not a significant amount of improvement in terms of the difference in modeling, what kind of flexibility do you have over the near-term to take that down on an organic basis in terms of your CET1 ratio?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Well, I think we still have a fair amount of flexibility. So we're targeting to bring that down 40 to 50 basis points this year when you think about the Franklin American deal. And then I think we -- if you look at rolling to next year, the SCB is likely to go into effect, which even if we hadn't resolved, if we don't resolve this issue, I think we still have plenty of flexibility to keep moving down on our glide path. So I don't really see much impact at this point. We just feel better, I think it's a negative to the perception of how we're going to perform and stress to have these results published and see ourselves in a route with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley in terms of huge stress losses, which doesn't make any sense to anybody. And so I think from a reputational standpoint, it's good to have that adjusted and have us back into the pack after all at ROTCE now is converging with the pack and there shouldn't be the same kind of PPNR impacts that the Fed is modeling. It's quite apparent when you look at it. So I think the first thing is I just like to get it fixed, because it's wrong, and it doesn't help our reputation to have those results published. I think down the road it could create some flexibility that if we need it, it would be a little more room to work with, but we feel comfortable with the glide path that we're on, and that will continue, we'll execute that through the next CCAR cycle and then we'll see where we are a year after that.
Erika Najarian: Got it. And a follow-up question for you, John, I think what Bill was asking is in other conference calls that we've heard through this earnings season, the CFOs have indicated that the each net subsequent 25 basis points of rate hike will be less impacted on NIM as the previous. And I just wanted to make sure that we're hearing you right that because of the DDA growth and continued optimization on the asset side that you believe that Citizens is going to buck that trend?
John Woods: I wouldn't say that, Erika, I would definitely -- would say it and just to make sure I was there earlier; we agree that each 25 basis points of increase in Fed does drive all equal and increase in the sequential data that one would appear in. So that's clear that we agree with that. We just also would offer up that we happen to be growing DDA in an environment where most are not. So, on a net basis, that's helping that and it's having somewhat of an offsetting impact, but not fully reversing the impact of the fact that sequential betas will grow, and we will experience growth in sequential betas like others, but not to the extent that would otherwise be the case if we don't grow in DDA.
Erika Najarian: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.
Peter Winter: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi.
Peter Winter: I was curious about the commercial real estate lending environment, you guys are still having very good growth, and we've heard from a number of banks this earnings that probably getting more cautious on commercial real estate just given pricing and loosening of underwriting, I'm just wondering what you're seeing.
Donald McCree: Yes, we definitely are also getting at the margin more cautious, and being more selective where we see terms and conditions being stretched. We haven't seen that much movement in price in terms of price deterioration, but we have seen a little bit of move in leverage and structure, and we are staying disciplined. The other thing that you're seeing in some of our real estate growth is we have a large construction book, which is funding. So it's transactions that we have put in place on unfunded construction standpoint several years ago which are funding up onto the balance sheet right now. So I would say a growth on the origination side we think will moderate a little bit, but it wouldn't necessarily mean that our growth on the asset side will moderate on the funding effect.
Peter Winter: Thanks. And just a follow-up question, could you just talk a little bit about the impact of the flattening yield curve on your margin, and are there steps you could take to offset some of that pressure?
John Woods: Yes, I'm going to take that one. And I think the way to think about our exposure there is that we're about 75% and this is short end of the curve. But when we have a flattening yield curve, then that can give you a sense for what opportunity cost area is. That would otherwise be the case, as that non-occurred. So we got 4.6% asset sensitivity number that we spoke about earlier, that assumes the parallel shift increase in rate. So you note 25% half off of that when we don't get that increase on the long end. It's hard to fight gravity on the long end of the yield curve, and we are sensitive to the short end and maintain a majority exposure to the short end, and lot of our C&I lending really drives that exposure, and that's really the best defense I guess I would say to continue to drive net interest margin in an environment where the Fed continues to move, but the long end remains certainly well.
Peter Winter: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Gerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning. Bruce, you talked about the CCAR and the discussions you've had with the Fed. Obviously with the reform to Dodd-Frank, you guys will be falling on a CCAR possibly as soon as next year if not the following year. Aside from the obvious headline, it's not going to be in the news anymore, what do you think, or how are you guys thinking you will maybe behaved differently not having to go through the formal process will you be able to give back more capital quicker, what's your thinking on that?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, I'd say -- let me just emphasize that I think stress testing is a very valuable exercise, and it's embedded in our bank and every other super-regional. We have it basically built into our risk appetite framework, and it's tied to our strategies. So when we make decisions in terms of where we're allocating our capital, we run it through our stress test to ensure that we're making wise decisions. So just want to make that point first off, Gerard, is that if you fall out of the public exercise you're still going to be doing stress testing because they're quite valuable in terms of how you're running the bank.
Gerard Cassidy: Correct.
Bruce Van Saun: I think if we're not in that public exercise I think you just gain back time and maybe some effort in terms of how you have to package things up and present them, but we'll still have examiners on our local teams who are going to want to see how we're doing those exercises, it might be a little bit of time and effort savings. I think the big thing that you gain probably is just a little more flexibility where the management team regains control over making those capital decisions, and it's not a once-a-year exercise. That would sure be great for example if you forecast that you're going to have 5% loan growth, if the loan growth comes in at 4%, you don't have to go through a whole resubmission, you'd simply be able to say, "Okay, so my capital building up a little bit. I can go back and buy some more stock, and I can neutralize the impact of not having the loan growth that I assumed." And so I think that's the thing that we look forward to is to kind of start to operate the way normal companies do and normal industries not having to go through the full mother may I exercise that we have to today.
John Woods: And just to add to that, Gerard, as Bruce mentioned earlier, even if we don't get out of the stress test regime, the SCB has some really intriguing and desirable attributes from a flexibility perspective so you forget some maybe even most, but not all of the flexibility you would get if you get out entirely, you would still have the uncertainty factor of the annual SCB it would be assigned but you would get back lot of the flexibility may be even in the near-term even before we get out of the test itself.
Gerard Cassidy: Very good. I'm encouraged with Vice Chairman's quarrel speech this week that hopefully all you guys will benefit from the changes that are coming. And as a follow-up, obviously it's brand new; you guys just rolled it out your national and digital strategy, Citizen's Access, in your thinking, do you think this business will be more competitive versus your -- I know you're in a day-to-day blocking and tackling businesses, very competitive in your footprint, your physical footprint, do you guys have a view on which one is more competitive, or are they just really just very both competitive?
John Woods: I will start off and frankly maybe Brad can add. I think on a pricing standpoint, they both seem to be very competitive. I mean when you look at that the branch of footprint activities, and talking earlier about when you think about TOP online and direct bank offers being around those call at the 175 to 200 basis points range for savings, even in branch businesses which have all of the physical cost associated with it, we're seeing in our footprint, competitors going out at 175, which is at the low end of the online bank with no legacy physical plan that you have to recover as well. So the competition is pretty stiff in both places. We just have to pick our spots. And I think we've done that well in terms of differentiating on customer experience, and we've got one of the best customer experiences we believe that's out there, and Brad can elaborate that, but being clear about how we target the level of growth and where we invest funds, I'll turn it over to Brad.
Brad Conner: John, I think you're absolutely right. They're just different, right, they're both very competitive; they're just different. I can't stress enough that it is a completely different customer segment. So you really have to understand the customer that's using the direct bank. It's a different customer. It is highly competitive. You win on customer experience, which we think ours is exceptional, and you win with data and analytics capability and having sophisticated ways of reaching the customers. And we think we're very good at that as well. So we think we can win in both places, but in terms of which is more competitive I think they're equally competitive [technical difficulty].
Gerard Cassidy: When you guys did your analysis and your work before you launched it, what was your conclusion on what percentage of customers if they choose to purchase one of your products, is it rate-driven, what percentage of that customer is driven to your product just because of the rate?
Brad Conner: Yes, let me answer that a little bit differently, because I'm not sure I can tell you what percentage of rate-driven, what our research did tell us is that the customers who use the direct banks are on -- they're digitally savvy and they shop online. So there is certainly a rate element of that, but they expect an extremely simple experience and they expect low fees, and of course the cost of the direct bank is much lower to operate. We've launched a direct bank that really has no fees with a very simple experience. And so…
Bruce Van Saun: You can open an account under…
Brad Conner: You can open and fund an account in less than five minutes. So again, it's a different customer. They are rate sensitive, but I think what they really are looking for is a simple experience.
Bruce Van Saun: And Gerard, I think you're in our footprint, so you might want to try it out.
Brad Conner: Well, to have you open an account.
Gerard Cassidy: Absolutely, I will and I'll report back. Thank you so much guys.
Operator: And there are no further questions in the queue. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, great. Thanks again everyone for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and your support. We continue to execute well, and we maintain a positive outlook for the balance of 2018. Thanks again, and have a great day.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-04-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference call. Now my name is Kevin, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor: Thanks so much, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. We really appreciate you joining us today. We're going to start things off with prepared remarks from our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, who will review our first quarter results, and then we'll open up the call for questions. We're really happy to have in the room with us today, Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking. In addition to our release, we have a presentation and financial supplement available at investor.citizensbank.com. And I need to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are absolutely subject to risks and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations in our SEC filings, including the 8-K -- this Form 8-K we filed today. We also need to remind you that we utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and our earnings release materials. And with that, I'll hand over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thanks, Ellen. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. We're pleased to report that we're off to a good start to 2018. We continue to deliver good top line growth. We had 5.6% year-on-year revenue growth. We're also doing a nice job of managing expenses. This resulted in positive operating leverage of 2.1%. Our ROTCE improved to 11.7% as we chart our course towards our new medium-term targets of 13% to 15%. We achieved year-on-year average loan and deposit growth of 3% in the first quarter. We saw linked quarter spot and average loan growth of around 1%. Based on our pipelines, we feel this will pick up as the year progresses. Similarly, based on strong Capital Markets pipelines and the benefit of seasonality, we expect to see some good fee growth in the second quarter. We continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives, building out our customer coverage and our product capabilities, while making critical investments in technology, in our digital platform and data capabilities as well as in our customer experience initiatives. We continue to find new ways to streamline our processes and organization in order to become more efficient and to self-fund these investments. Our projects, TOP and BSO, are delivering consistent results. And as you may suspect, we are working hard on the development of TOP V. Stay tuned for our July call and for more details. We continue to make progress in building excellence in our capabilities. We're now gaining some external recognition for our progress. For example, we were named the #1 bank in the U.S. in terms of customer experience by Temkin. We also were ranked the Best Bank by Global Finance magazine in the Northeast and in the Great Lakes regions. There's certainly more work to do, but we're making good progress, and we're poised for a strong 2018. We have a good plan. We have a good leadership team. It's executing well across the board, and we have an engaged and motivated colleague base. So with that, let me turn it over to our CFO, John Woods, who will take you through the numbers in more detail, and provide you with some color. John?
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with our first quarter results on Page 4. We continue to execute well and are off to a good start to the year. We generated net income to common shareholders of $381 million, diluted EPS of $0.78 and ROTCE of 11.7%. Last year's first quarter and fourth quarter reported results are impacted by notable items largely related to tax matters. So to make it easier to see underlying trends, let's turn to Page 5, and we will focus on our underlying results that exclude these items. Year-on-year growth in Q1 was very strong as we grew net income to common shareholders by 31% and EPS by 37%. This reflects our continued focus on driving positive operating leverage, which came in above 2%, along with favorable credit costs and a lower tax rate due to tax reform. Strong net interest income and a continued focus on expense discipline helped deliver an efficiency ratio improvement of 125 basis points to 60.4%. We also see the impact of our disciplined risk management on our credit quality metrics as we continue to drive improvement in the mix of the portfolio overall. Provision expense came in at $78 million for the quarter, which was a little lower than expected despite an $8 million build in the reserve. Nonperforming loans remained relatively stable at 78 basis points of loans. We continue to actively manage our capital base, returning $283 million of capital to shareholders through higher dividends and share repurchases. Tangible book value per share increased 5% year-over-year to $27.24, and our CET1 ratio was a robust 11.2%. Taking a deeper look into NII and NIM on Page 6. We delivered attractive and disciplined balance sheet growth, which helped drive a 1% linked-quarter increase in NII in spite of the impact from day count. We've benefited from the earlier-than-anticipated move in 1-month LIBOR this quarter and a relatively steeper yield curve overall for much of the quarter. As a reminder, approximately 75% of our sensitivity is associated with the short end of the curve. Linked quarter net interest margin increased 8 basis points, reflecting improving earning asset yields, given higher rates, and improved mix, which drove a 16 basis point improvement. This was partially offset by an 8 basis point impact from higher funding costs. Year-over-year, net interest margin improved 20 basis points, reflecting a 42 basis point benefit from earning assets, partially offset by a 22 basis point impact from funding costs. Our margin performance continues to benefit from our balance sheet optimization efforts, which again drove about 1/3 of our year-over-year NIM improvement. We also continue to be well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment with our asset sensitivity relatively stable at 5%. Turning to fees on Page 7. On an underlying basis, non-interest income decreased 4% linked quarter, reflecting an expected seasonal decline in service charges as well as a reduction in mortgage banking fees and trust and investment services fees, largely related to the impact of long-term rates on product demand. In mortgage, our originations were down about 19%, in line with overall industry headwinds, given rates and a shift away from refi volume. We're making investments to grow our MSR portfolio and to shift production towards more conforming volume. In wealth, investments in the business are helping to drive improvement in the mix of our fee-based sales, which came in at 42% this quarter. However, we saw a reduction in transaction fees from strong fourth quarter levels, which was paced by strength in fixed-rate annuity sales. Capital Markets fees declined modestly from fourth quarter and first quarter, as there was a market fall-off in Middle Markets-indicated transactions. As a partial offset, we did see a pickup in debt and equity Capital Markets activity, which benefited underwriting fees. Our Capital Markets pipeline's very robust heading into the second quarter, including several deals that were originally targeted for the first quarter. Overall, the pipelines have improved significantly since the start of the year. Turning to expenses on Page 8. On an underlying basis, expenses were up 3% linked quarter, reflecting seasonally higher salaries and employee benefits. Outside services were seasonally lower, and other operating expenses reflect lower insurance and pension costs. Year-on-year, our expenses were up 3% on an underlying basis, as salaries and benefits expense was higher, reflecting annual merit increases, increased stock-based compensation costs, revenue-based incentives and the impact of strategic growth initiatives. We also saw an increase in outside services costs tied to our consumer strategic growth initiatives. We continue to remain disciplined on the expense front as we identify opportunities to streamline our operations and organization to find efficiencies. This allows us to self-fund our growth initiatives and enhance our capabilities to serve customers. Let's move on and discuss the balance sheet. On Page 9, you can see we continue to grow our balance sheet while expanding our NIM. Total average and spot loans were up 1% on a linked-quarter basis and 3% year-over-year, with core loan growth rates slightly higher. We grew the average core retail portfolio 5% year-over-year, with expansion in residential mortgages and higher risk-adjusted return categories like education, which is largely tied to our refinance product, as well as nice traction in other unsecured retail loans, driven by our merchant finance -- financing partnerships and our personal unsecured product. This growth was partially offset by planned reductions in the auto portfolio and run-off in home equity, given high levels of payoffs in line with industry trends. On a spot basis, core retail loans were up 4% year-over-year and relatively stable linked quarter given the auto and home equity trends. Average core commercial portfolio growth of 2% year-over-year reflects strong momentum from our geographic expansion strategies, Private Equity, Industry Verticals and Commercial Real Estate. On a spot to basis, the commercial core loan growth came in at 3% year-over-year and 2% linked quarter. Growth was impacted by the sale of about $190 million of commercial loans late in the first quarter as part of a strategy to source, underwrite and distribute leverage loans as well as some softer results in small business lending. We expect to deliver stronger loan growth in the second quarter. This reflects the strong Q1 spot growth in commercial banking and overall strength in their lending pipelines, which are up over 35% from the beginning of the year through mid-April. Additionally, in retail, we expect particular strength in education finance, given higher seasonal volume and our continued investment in the space as well as the renewal of our flow agreement with SoFi for high FICO score loans. On Page 10, looking at the funding side, we saw a 6.5 basis point sequential quarter increase in our cost of deposits, reflecting the impact of higher rates and spot deposit growth of 1%, partially offset by progress on our initiatives to control deposit costs. We continue to fund attractive balance sheet growth at accretive risk-adjusted returns. Our overall funding costs were up 9 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our cost of funds was up 25 basis points, reflecting deposit cost increases of 20 basis points as well as the structural shift to more long-term borrowings, including our $750 million senior debt issuance near the end of the first quarter. Year-on-year, spot and average deposit growth was 3%. Note that while funding costs were up 25 basis points, overall asset yield expansion was 43 basis points. Our deposit betas remain in line with our overall expectations given where we are in the rate cycle. We did see our betas tick up a little, which is what you would expect to see in a quarter following a Fed hike, but we are right on our expected glide path. Our cumulative beta on interest-bearing deposits is in the mid-20s. We've seen some increased competition for deposits, but for the most part, deposit costs have been well behaved. We are continuing to invest in analytics and improve our targeting through digital and direct mail offerings on the consumer side, and we're continuing to migrate away from our historical approach to promotional pricing. In commercial, we are making investments to build out additional product capabilities and roll out our new cash management platform early next year. We feel good about our ability to execute against our optimization strategies and drive greater efficiency and deposit gathering. Next, let's move to Page 11 and cover credit. Overall credit quality remains strong, reflecting the ongoing mix shift towards high-quality, lower-risk retail loans and a relatively clean position in the commercial book. The nonperforming loan ratio improved slightly to 78 basis points of loans linked quarter, while improving 19 basis points year-over-year. The net charge-off rate improved to 26 basis points from 28 basis points in the fourth quarter, given seasonal impacts. Our commercial charge-offs were very low again this quarter, and retail net charge-offs were $3 million lower than the fourth quarter, primarily due to seasonality in auto and education. Provision for credit losses of $78 million was $8 million above charge-offs. Despite this reserve build, the provision was down $5 million compared to the fourth quarter and down $18 million versus a year ago, reflecting improvement in overall credit quality. On Page 12, you can see that we continue to maintain robust capital and liquidity positions. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.2%. This quarter, we repurchased 3.9 million shares and, including dividends, returned $283 million to common shareholders. On Page 13, we have provided color on how we are progressing against our strategic initiatives. We've changed this slide a little in order to highlight some of the progress we are making against our efforts to optimize the balance sheet, investments in our fee-generating capabilities and our top program revenue and efficiency initiatives. We also wanted to highlight some interesting things that are going on in the businesses. Overall, we are executing well in our TOP IV program, which is on track to deliver $95 million to $110 million of pretax run rate benefit by the end of 2018. The TOP programs have successfully delivered efficiencies that have allowed us to self-fund investments, to improve our platforms and product offerings, while achieving profitability goals. We are already looking at opportunities to find further efficiencies in the future by expanding the work we are doing around customer journeys, lean process improvements and agile ways of working to more areas of the bank. I can tell you that we are constantly challenging ourselves to do better, and we have plenty of wood left to chop in the efficiency area. Let's turn to our second quarter outlook on Page 14. We expect average loan growth to come in at about 1.5%, and we expect NIM to be up modestly in the quarter. In noninterest income, we are expecting to see a mid-single-digit pickup from seasonally lower first quarter levels. We expect to keep expenses broadly stable in the second quarter with positive operating leverage and with efficiency improving. We expect the credit environment to continue to be relatively benign, and that provision expense will push a little higher into the $80 million to $90 million range. On the tax rate, we came in a little lower than expected for the first quarter, given a change in timing on certain tax items that moved to Q2 from Q1. For the second quarter, we are expecting our effective tax rate to come in at about 23%. To sum up, on Page 15, we feel like we've delivered solid results in Q1. We feel our balance sheet across capital, liquidity and credit position remains robust. We will maintain our mindset of continuous improvement in 2018 and look to drive more TOP and BSO program benefits. We are also driving innovation across the bank and investing heavily in technology, our digital platform and customer journeys, which positions us well as we work towards becoming a top-performing bank. We will maintain our mindset of continuous improvement in 2018 and look to drive more TOP and BSO program benefits. We are also driving innovation across the bank and investing heavily in technology, our digital platform and customer journeys. And lastly, we are positive about our outlook for the second quarter and the rest of the year. And we reiterate broad full year 2018 guidance, although we expect we'd be better than the guidance range on credit. With that, let me turn it back to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thanks, John. Kevin, I think we can open it up for Q&A now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank.
Matthew O'Connor: I was just wondering if you could talk a bit more about the fee revenues. We're seeing it in some other banks as well, but just kind of some softness across a number of categories. And you were pretty clear about Capital Markets pipeline being strong and bouncing nicely in 2Q, but just some of the other categories were also a little bit soft, and I'm wondering kind of what that says about just the underlying activity among the customer base and maybe why that is the case.
Bruce Van Saun: Sure. Why don't I start, and then we can pass it around here for color? But, Matt, I would say probably the disappointments in Q1, really Capital Markets, where we saw, I'd say, a number of transactions push from Q1 to Q2. We, I think, had seasonal slowness at the start of the year, and things seemed to pick up nicely in March, although, as I said, didn't get everything done. So that bodes well for, I'd say, a quite positive outlook in Q2 in Capital Markets. The other area that I'd call out is the mortgage business, where I think there was just general market softness. There's a shift away from refi. Some rates have gone up. And so it was just a tougher quarter than we expected in the mortgage base. Most of the other lines, I would say, were really just impacted by seasonality. We get an extra day in Q2. We get some seasonal benefit. Service charges and fees is always up. There's -- so there's things that we anticipate when we give the guidance for Q2 that we have pretty good visibility into. So John, I don't know if you want to add to that.
John Woods: No, I think that's right. I mean, I think you're seeing -- as we get to the end of the quarter, we mentioned that pipeline's looking much better in Capital Markets as we get into the second quarter. A little bit of seasonality on -- in the IRP space. And as you mentioned, in mortgage, although it was a down quarter, we're seeing some improvement in our conforming mix. So that will bode well going forward as well.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, okay.
Matthew O'Connor: That's helpful. And then just separately, if we look at the deposits, the noninterest-bearing demand deposits continue to grow year-over-year. Obviously, there's just some seasonality linked quarter, but you're still growing those year-over-year. Some of the bigger banks are seeing outflows, and I'm just wondering if you could talk about maybe how your mix is a little bit different. Or do you think it's more granular in terms of why you're still able to grow the free deposits in this higher rate environment?
Bruce Van Saun: John, why don't you start, and then, Brad, offer some color?
John Woods: Yes. I think that's right. I mean, we did see that we've been investing a lot in this over the last couple of years, as you know. And on the deposit, I think this is a reflection of our deposit initiatives starting to take hold. On the consumer side, we're seeing some traction. We're -- we've been investing in data and analytics. We're improving our targeting and promotional efficiency, and that's starting to play itself out. We've revised our promotional approach to attract more stable deposits at attractive rates. And the emphasis is basically shifting from rate-led to more of a moderating on rate and starting to close the gap a little bit on marketing. We've been extending the duration and targeting direct mail and move mass promos. So that's nice to see on the consumer side. And similar themes on the commercial side where we've been making ongoing investments in our product offerings and targeting certain segments, where deposits are more likely to be able to be driven versus others. So yes, we're pleased to see that improvement, and those investments will continue.
Brad Conner: Yes. John, I think you hit it. I think the big thing for us has been the improvement in analytics and targeted offerings. The other area that you didn't touch on, and we've signaled this for several quarters in a row now, is our focus on our Mass Affluent and Affluent customer base and redesigning the value proposition and the product set for that. So we relaunched a whole new value proposition. Our Platinum product suite, I guess, about a year ago, we just think we're getting good traction from that in investment and analytics.
Bruce Van Saun: And some of the interest rates are coming with that initiatives.
Brad Conner: Exactly, exactly.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe, Morgan Stanley.
Kenneth Zerbe: If we have [indiscernible]
Ellen Taylor: Ken?
John Woods: Ken, we're having a little trouble hearing you, Ken.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, you're on a bad line. Ken, you're on a bad line.
Kenneth Zerbe: Is this better?
John Woods: A little bit.
Ellen Taylor: A little bit.
Kenneth Zerbe: Okay. Sorry. Hopefully, this will be clear.
Bruce Van Saun: That's good. Now you're good.
Kenneth Zerbe: Okay. If we do get SIFI reform, because you're no longer subject to CCAR, can you just talk about how you think about accelerating capital return? Has your thinking changed at all over the last several months or quarters?
Bruce Van Saun: I'd say we're probably more optimistic that we can maybe move down our glide path a little faster overall. But generally, I think we've been measured in terms of bringing the capital down. I think as a relatively new public company with not a very long track record that that's a sensible approach. We're thinking 40 basis points, maybe 50 basis points this year was the target we set out at the beginning of the year. As you know, last year, we stated 11.2%. We were trying to get down to the 10.7% to 10.9% range. But because we overshot and did better than our budget, and we also had the benefit of tax reform on our DTL, we ended up with earnings that we couldn't return to shareholders given the way CCAR works. So one of the things that we're actually excited about is the de-designation, and then also the new proposal for the stress capital buffer, which I think gives more flexibility back into the hands of the banks. And so you have guardrails about where you need to operate. But then you also, if you have situations like we had, where you're outperforming and making extra income, you can potentially return that to shareholder as the year -- as you're in the middle of the year as opposed to waiting for the next cycle, which is a real benefit. Or if you were anticipating you were going to get 6% loan growth, and it turns then to be 4%, then you can do something with that extra capital that's piling up. So anyway, I'd say, in general, we feel more positive, but I think we'll continue to be measured, and we'll just bring this down. And as I said in the past, there's no reason that we need to be above the median of our peers. Our stressed credit losses are actually slightly below the medium. And so over time, I think we can certainly provide it right into where the median of our peers are.
Kenneth Zerbe: All right, great. And then separately, with your NIM guidance, can you just help reconcile the 5% asset sensitivity that you guys mentioned versus the guidance that NIM should be up only modesty in second quarter given the rate -- the recent March rate hike? Like what are the pluses and minuses there that would limit the NIM expansion?
John Woods: Yes. I'll go and take that. Thanks. And you know what? I think you should know that, as we mentioned, the NIM performance in the first quarter, we did have an earlier 1-month LIBOR benefit. So that was up maybe about 9 basis points on average. And by March, a 1-month LIBOR was 20 basis points higher than we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. And so we're not planning on that recurring. So that would be one item that I would highlight in terms of the second quarter. Also, we mentioned that there was a big increase in the long end in the first quarter, which had an impact on our premium amortization in our securities book, which was slowed down as a result of that movement, and you wouldn't necessarily plan on seeing that happening again in the second quarter. Lastly, I'd highlight the fact that the full quarter of mix shift in our funding, where we did a senior unsecured issuance at the end of the first quarter, and you'll see the full quarter effect of that in the second quarter. So those are some of the takes. But nevertheless, even with all of that, we're still expecting that NIM will expand. And that's given by our ongoing asset sensitivity, driven by the fact that loan yields are expected to be up again and up very nicely with good solid loan beta offsetting our deposit beta in the second quarter.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter, Wedbush Securities.
Peter Winter: I was curious about the guidance for net interest income for the full year. Last quarter, you said it was 7% to 9%. It does seem like the margin is coming in better than what you expected for the full year, and you're getting that rebound in loan growth. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about the guidance for the full year on net interest income.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. What I would say, Peter, we're just broadly saying that we hold to what we said. I think you could go down each of the major income categories, and we haven't been specific on that. But given trends, certainly net interest income is pushing out to the upper side of the bounds with the NIM performance. And I still think that we'll see a decent level of loan growth over the course of the year. And then kind of when you go down, I still think we can hit the range for fee growth. And the expense growth is tracking to be in the range. And the one thing that John called out is that I think given the first quarter result and the guide for second quarter on credit that we're likely to be certainly below the range we set on credit. So that's a little more color for you. But where we really try to focus our comments on these quarterly calls is the upcoming quarter and not get into reforecasting explicitly that full year guidance. But we're certainly comfortable with the numbers we've put out there for the full year back in January.
Peter Winter: Okay. And just a follow-up. Is there any update you can give on your Apple partnership, and/or -- and also just the personal unsecured lending and how that's going?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I'll just start, and I'd say that our view is that we have a very strong relationship with Apple, that's centered around our shared focus on customer experience, and we would continue to see growth in the relationship. And then secondly, on the personal unsecured product, we've really launched that with a vengeance maybe 18 months ago, and we've had a tremendous takeup. We're using our data analytics capability to target not only our customers, but also prospective customers. And we're bringing new customers into the bank. And I think that's going exceptionally well, but I'll turn it over to Brad for additional color.
Brad Conner: Yes. Not sure I have a lot more to add, Bruce. On the Apple front, we have a great relationship with Apple, and we've stayed focused on giving them great service. I think we do that, and that's a good relationship. On PERL, we're very pleased with the product. It's performing, credit-wise, the way we expected, good demand for the product. We have stayed in the prime-plus space. So we've stayed at the very, very high end of the market. I think there's opportunity to go in the credit spectrum there. But at this point, we're staying focused on our knits -- sticking to our knitting and staying in a really high credit quality area and feel very good about it.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian, Bank of America.
Erika Najarian: Just following up on Ken's question, could you give us a sense of -- on your variable rate loans on the asset side, if could you give us a sense of what the short-term benchmarks are? And on the liability side, if your long-term debt is swapped out and, if so, what the underlying benchmark would be.
John Woods: Sure, I'll jump in on that one. So basically, on the floating rate side of things, you have a couple of key benchmarks in the C&I book. It's primarily 1-month LIBOR, although we do have a few million dollars of three-month LIBOR indexed on the commercial side, but generally at the one-month LIBOR book. And when you think about the other big floating books, you've got the home equity portfolio, which is essentially a prime base, Feds funds base book. So that's from the asset side. On the liability side, we do have primarily a floating rate book there. And the -- what we swapped that too, is actually one-month LIBOR and three month LIBOR as well. So there's a mix there with, frankly, the majority of that actually going to 1-month LIBOR. And when you think about what's contractual with respect to three month LIBOR on the asset side and three month LIBOR on the liability side, we've been monitoring that because of what's been going on with three month and 1-month LIBOR over the quarter. We're pretty balanced, at least contractually, with respect to the asset side and the liability side of the three month point on the curve. So let me know if that's responsive to what you were looking for.
Erika Najarian: No, that was very clear. And a follow-up question is, of course, we'll hear more about your new -- about TOP V in July. And given how successful these initiatives have been, I'm wondering if you could give us a sense on how much of TOP V will be revenue-driven rather than expense-driven?
Bruce Van Saun: Sure. I'll start. John, you can add color. But I think each year, what we try to focus on is an effort around efficiency and extracting inefficiencies to streamline how we're running the bank. And we'd like that to make up, I'd say, at least 40% of the pot to whatever total number we get to. We also then have always great ideas in terms of how we can serve our customers better and deliver additional products and services or expand into some new adjacencies, we've done, for example, geographically into the Southeast region on the commercial side. So I think there's opportunity there as well. And I'd say what we find heartening here is that we're able to come back and do this year in and year out, which I think sets us apart really from peer banks, who might have a major, major program maybe every 3 years or so. But we've tried to instill this into our culture and our DNA at Citizens that it's our responsibility to come up with these ideas about how we're going to run the bank better and do more for our customers and do more for our shareholders. So John, maybe you could add some additional thoughts?
John Woods: Yes. Just maybe a bigger picture when you think about our targets for ROTCE progression over the medium term that we talked about last quarter. We've built in that there would be, on the expense side, something on the order of 60 basis points over that period of increasing our ROTCE. And if you triangulate that back to our expense base, that comes in somewhere between 1% and 2% of our expense base in savings each year coming out of TOP. So that's been an incredibly important part of how we're driving expense saves. So we'll continue to do that.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez, UBS.
Saul Martinez: On asset quality, the $425 million to $475 million, keeping that obviously implied a pretty big ramp-up, and you mentioned that there's a high probability of being below that range. But I guess, a couple fold question. One, why not just change the guidance? But maybe more importantly, just as you look across the different parts of your portfolio, obviously, credit has been remarkably good, but are there any areas that either you're concerned about or that you're watching a little bit more closely as being a little bit more vulnerable to a normalization credit?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. So I guess, to my earlier answer, we don't want to be in the habit of updating our full year guidance quarter in and quarter out, so which is why we're using those broadly comfortable. But I think the beat on credit is materially enough outside of that initial range that I think we needed to call that out. So that's the answer to the first part of your question. On the second part of your question, I'd say, certainly on the consumer side, there's nothing in terms of delinquencies or roll rates that gives us pause. So I think we're going to have a very good clean year on consumer credit. And again, on the commercial side, we have a net recovery position, which is pretty fantastic. But again, when you look at what we have in NPLs, what we have in criticized assets, we're in very good shape there as well. So you're likely, over time, to take a hit here or there. Maybe you have a recovery that allows you to offset it on the commercial side, but we could see that migrate up a little bit over the course of the year. Specific portfolios, they all look in pretty good shape. Energy's certainly in great shape. We're keeping our eye in the franchise world on some of the casual dining segment, but that's relatively modest, and I think that will behave okay. But anyway, I'd say those would be the areas I would highlight. John, anything you'd want to add?
John Woods: No. I would just -- just to add to the point on the consumer delinquencies. Even the 30- to 90-day delinquencies quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year are down. So we're just seeing good trends there and wholesale credit quality hanging in there very nicely with net recoveries. So that's really the story.
Brad Conner: No, I think I agree with that on the wholesale side. The things we're struggling with are generally idiosyncratic and not that large. So we feel very good about where we are.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, good.
Saul Martinez: That's helpful. Just on deposit competition, you mentioned the deposit pricing. You mentioned cumulative betas around, I think, mid-20s, but can you just give a little bit more granularity across the different businesses, retail, commercial, wealth, where you're at, what's the dynamic, and also where you feel betas are maybe relative to where terminal beta could be for each of those segments?
John Woods: Yes. I'll tell you what, we'll talk about the terminal betas maybe top of the house. We don't -- haven't necessarily gotten into where it would be across each individual segment. But in terms of within consumer, you'll see terminal betas that are lower than commercial, of course. But overall, we've mentioned that through the cycle, we would be at approximately 60% cumulative beta over the entire tightening cycle, which we tend to think about at approximately a 300 basis point or so Fed funds number. When you break that down, as I mentioned, consumer on the lower end, commercial on the higher end, within consumer, we are breaking that down a little bit further. When you look at the core consumer in the retail space as well as even when you get up into Mass Affluent, we're seeing betas being pretty well behaved in the low single-digit range. It's when you get into the wealth sectors that things start to get a bit higher, and those betas get up into the high 20s and the low 30s. But overall, still very solid single-digit betas cumulatively through the first quarter in the consumer side. Now on the commercial side, you'll see cumulative betas that are maybe a bit higher than that and maybe up into the 30s or so, and that gives us the overall cumulative beta in the mid-20s. So let me see if that's responsive, and if there's any follow-ups.
Saul Martinez: No, no. That's helpful. So if I think about the 60% cumulative beta, obviously, commercial's going to be above that, and the other retails are going to serve both of those?
John Woods: Yes, yes. Commercial is 70% to 75%. Let's call it, cumulative, in apples-to-apples relates, that's 60%, and for consumer maybe 35% to 40% to give you something to anchor to with respect to the 60%.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja, JPMorgan.
Vivek Juneja: Bruce, a question for you. I heard a question on capital return overall. I just wanted to talk to you about dividend payout. Where do you see that going? I know you've had good increases, but obviously, you're still well below peers. And recognizing, yes, you're still relatively in your infancy after the IPO, but what are you thinking since the Fed has now said the 30% line has also been removed, and your peers are talking about 40% type getting to those levels?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. No, I think we've said that kind of in the medium term, we were targeting to get back up around 40% or so. And you saw us make 2 moves in the last CCAR cycle, very significant increases. One of the challenges we've had is our earnings have grown so quickly that you end up actually lagging where you'd like to be in terms of your payout ratio. So again, as we get more flexibility under the new kind of Fed proposal, then, potentially, we could accelerate as we're growing our earnings. If we are exceeding our estimates we've set out at the beginning of the year, potentially we could move -- be more responsive and move that dividend up quicker. But again, I think bank stock should trade with a healthy yield. We understand that. I think we, currently, with our capital surplus, can have our cake and eat it, too. We can continue to have nice loan growth and support the organic needs of the business, and certainly return shareholder capital at a good clip. And the dividend would be the top of our list in terms of what we want to do for shareholders.
Vivek Juneja: Question for Don, since I heard him on the line. Don, any color on sort of what's giving you the confidence that some of the slowdown we saw in Capital Markets activity in Q1 should start to dissipate soon? What are you seeing that's giving you -- in terms of timing, and that it actually should start to pick up?
Donald McCree: I'll repeat what Bruce said, is we started the year with pretty weak pipelines actually. And literally, since early February, we've just seen them build and build and build and build. So the activity levels on the teams are quite strong right now. We're seeing it flow through already on the fees that we're printing for the quarter. So we're confident in both our client's desire to transact, given the environment and the tax rate and general growth that people are seeing. Sponsors are quite active right now, and we're seeing it in our pipelines.
Bruce Van Saun: I would say also, Vivek, that we would expect to see M&A pick up as the year goes by. And we feel it's fortuitous or maybe we were good, but doing the acquisition of Western Reserve last year gave us the capability that we can now really serve those Middle Market companies that are looking to use acquisitions as part of their growth strategy.
Donald McCree: And when I said, pipelines, I'm talking about M&A also. And I think we're actively adding to our M&A teams because they can't handle the business that they have in-house right now. So it's quite strong.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Marlin Mosby, Vining Sparks.
Marlin Mosby: A very detailed question, but we have heard a lot of pressure from the mortgage banking and production side. And some mentioned gain on sales. Sometimes, that's when rates are moving higher. You kind of are repricing fast enough. That's just as kind of a norm that you get a little bit of squeeze temporarily. Is this more pricing or rate-related in the sense of maybe gain on sale of margins going down a little bit this quarter?
John Woods: Yes. I think it's more a function of as volume comes down with higher rates, the industry is trying to fill up the capacity that you have the excess capacity you have available, and you see a squeeze on margins. So I think it's just a normal market volatility -- a normal market activity as people are trying to fill up the capacity they have.
Marlin Mosby: Got it. And then when we think about -- your capital ratios have been relatively flat. As you now move into the next phase with more flexibility on returning this capital, do you envision meaningfully kind of bringing that number down? And do you have kind of a target you'd like to get to in the next couple of years?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. So the flexibility actually comes down the road. So it's not really here yet in terms of the CCAR cycle. So I think we gave guidance for this year that we'd like to bring our capital ratio down towards the 10.7%, 10.8% if you look at our full year guidance. We also set out our medium-term targets, which we said we'd like to bring it down to 10% to 10.25% when we set out those targets. So you could see us at 11.2%, bring it down 40 basis points, and then do that again, and then continue to chisel it. And it may be the case that the median moves lower, and that there's opportunities for us to move below that range. But that's the kind of flag that we've planted at this point in our planning process.
John Woods: Yes. Maybe just to add on top of that, I think Bruce is right. I mean, that flexibility point that we're very pleased and supportive of is really an NPR, and we're working our way through that process with the Fed. And if all goes as originally indicated, this would be a CCAR 2019 cycle that -- where the flexibility would come later in '19 and into '20. We're supportive of it, taking away the soft cap on dividends and addressing some of the concerns from the industry around balance sheet growth. That's all very positive. Lots more questions to be asked in the NPR, but the flexibility will come later, as Bruce indicated.
Marlin Mosby: And it's positive in the sense that you have so much earnings growth right now with the tax benefit and just the organic growth that payout ratios are going to be up '19, '20. That keeps the momentum into the last two years -- or that next two years after we get the top-end earnings really creating a lot to give back this year.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy, RBC Capital Markets.
Gerard Cassidy: Can you share with us -- you had some, as you've pointed out, some nice growth in your demand deposit accounts, which some of your peers haven't really seen. And when you look at that, could you share what percentage of your consumer customers have checking accounts, where there's no fees associated with them because either they keep a higher balance or there's a special product that they're using that doesn't charge them fees?
John Woods: To give you a percentage that don't have fees, I, unfortunately, don't have that in front of me. I will tell you, our core checking products or our -- sort of our baseline checking product is something we call, One Deposit, which is they have the ability to waive your monthly service charges just by making a single deposit every month. So the majority of those customers do not incur a fee. But in terms on an overall percentage, I don't have that available.
Gerard Cassidy: Okay. And then, Bruce, obviously, as you've pointed out, you're relatively new. As a publicly-traded company, you have very strong capital. Of course, you've got a glide path to give it back to shareholders. Another angle would be, of course, to do acquisitions. Could you just give us your views on what you see on the merger landscape for other depositaries over the next, let's call it, 12 to 24 months?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I think, Gerard, we've been pretty clear that where we're focused in terms of looking for acquisitions would be really in the fee space. So it would be adding to our capabilities, as I'd like to say, getting a little farther down the track faster in areas in the commercial side and Capital Markets or on the consumer side and wealth or in mortgage MSRs, for example. So those have been the areas that we have interest. And we've had dialogue, and I think we'll eventually do some more things this year, much like we did the Western Reserve M&A boutique last year. So I think they'll be of probably modest size because we have a lot of organic growth. So we want to stay focused on executing our plan, but then supplement that with things that we can easily plug and play. The other area that I think we're focused has been on the fintech space. And so we have about half a dozen relationships currently with various fintech partners, and some really great stuff, our specified digital wealth offering, our business banking loan origination and fulfillment platform that we have with Fundation, just to name a couple. But I think our intent is out, and we probably could add a handful of additional ones also this year. So when it comes to straight depositaries, that's really not on our shopping lists, and you won't see us looking to do that in 2018.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Pancari, Evercore.
John Pancari: You have mentioned the better loan beta, where you're trending right now. How much of that is the pricing environment? I mean, we're hearing that it's certainly not terribly accommodative right now, and that there's some spread compression a lot of your peers are dealing with. And then, therefore, how much of that is also just your structure, and that you've got a fair amount of portfolios that you're still sub-scaling, but are higher yielding and you're growing there, so the remix is helping your loan yield?
John Woods: Yes. I'll go ahead and hit that. I mean, loan yield's up 14 basis points in the quarter, and you think about converting that into a beta. I mean, that's really driven by our floating fix mix. And we're basically about 52% or so, as I recall, the percentage, swap adjusted floating loans versus approximately 48% on the fix side. So that's the big driver in loan betas. And you heard a little bit earlier the indices that we're exposed to, that the indices are going to be primarily 1-month LIBOR and Fed funds in terms of driving that beta on the loan side. And you could think about that beta cumulatively being around 60% or so. When you think about a much higher beta on the commercial side, say, call it in the 80s, being offset by more of the term lending that sits on the consumer book. So I think that's how you should think about our loan betas on that side.
John Pancari: Okay, all right. And then, actually, on that front, the new money loan yields, where you're bringing on new production, do you have that for commercial versus consumer?
John Woods: Yes. I mean, so I would say overall, on the commercial side, new monies coming in, call it, 25 basis points or so over runoff money. And then on the consumer side, basically every book, new money coming in, in a healthy way over runoff, with maybe the possible exception to mortgage, where you've got the negative or the convexed aspects of that kind of portfolio, where you see the bias towards refinancing the higher rate stuff. So I think that's a natural industry-related phenomenon. But basically, across the board, when you run the table across consumer and commercial, we're in a situation where our new front book is accretive versus our runoff. And that's providing upward lift as well, and will continue into the second quarter.
Bruce Van Saun: And that extends, John, to the securities books as well.
John Woods: Absolutely, yes. On the security side, our runoff is about $250 million. Our reinvestment is about $320 million on the securities side.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes.
John Pancari: Got it. That's helpful. One separate thing on the expense side. I know you indicated a couple of times that you continue to invest heavily in IT. Can you remind us of the size of your IT budget? I believe you have previously indicated about $195 million in CapEx. I'm just wondering what the overall IT budget would be in terms of the...
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, John, we went through a period probably from 2010 to 2016 or probably 6 years there. We've had it up around $250 million. We've pulled it back a bit last year to the $195 million. As you said, I think we needed to pause and digest some of the things that we've put in place. But this year, I'd say we're probably in a $225 million, $235 million ZIP Code. And the nice thing that I'd say about that is it's really moving and pivoting towards offense. So much of that spend now is directed at how do we serve customers better, how do we digitize, how do we use data. And so I think there's an unlimited appetite that folks have inside the company. And I remind folks, Rome's not built in a day. We have to pace ourselves. But I think we're really spending much more on offense, and the results are showing by you can see the awards we're picking up for customer experience or best bank. I think it's really great to see.
John Woods: Maybe just add to that just briefly. So because of the way accounting works, and there's some capital budgets, and across peers, sometimes, it's hard to normalize apples-on-apples. But some of the industry materials that we've been able to get our hands on would indicate that maybe in the neighborhood of 8% of revenues is about where our peers are coming out. And you would see us on an apples-to-apples basis being around 10% of revenues. When you consider our capital expenditures, plus some of the things that get expensed and the other support from an IT perspective of the businesses on a customer-facing standpoint. So when you think about it like that, we feel like we're in line or in pace with the industry or maybe a little better.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin, Jefferies.
Ellen Taylor: Ken? Maybe we lost him.
Bruce Van Saun: Ken? Maybe his question got answered or -- okay. Next? Is there anyone else, Kevin?
Operator: No. At this time, we have no further questions in queue. And with that, I'll turn things back over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, great. So thanks, everyone, again for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and your support. We're off to a really good start. I think we maintained a positive outlook for 2018, and also for another year of strong progress for Citizens Bank. So thanks, and have a good day.
Operator: Now that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q4  (2018-01-19 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we'll conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor: Hey, thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining us this morning. We know it’s a busy day. We’ve got a lot of really positive ground to cover. Our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and CFO, John Woods will review our results and provide an update on our financial targets. And then we're going to open up the call for questions. Also joining us today in the room are Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking. And of course, our lawyers want me to remind everyone that in addition to today’s press release, we’ve also provided a presentation and financial supplement and each materials are available at investor.citizensbank.com. And our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from our expectations in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today. We also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and earnings release materials. And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thanks, Ellen. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining our call today. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong and improving results and a great finish to a year of significant progress and good execution. We continue to run the bank better each and every day. We're taking good care of our customers and we enter 2018 with some nice momentum. The highlights of the quarter from my perspective were the continued delivery of good top line growth with 8% year-on-year underlying revenue growth as well as robust positive operating leverage of 6.4%. For the full year, underlying revenue growth was 10% and the operating leverage was 6.8%. The commitment to positive operating leverage has powered improvement in our key metrics. Our underlying ROTCE hit 10.4% in Q4 and our efficiency ratio improved to 58.5%. Our success in hitting our medium term IPO financial targets has led to our establishment of new medium term targets, which we will cover in some detail later in the call. Suffice it to say, we believe we have a good plan and a good leadership team that is executing well across the board, giving us confidence in our outlook. We continue to deliver well on our strategic initiatives and we continue to do more and better for our key stakeholders, for our customers, our colleagues and the communities that we serve. We remain focused on raising our capital return to shareholders. We announced an increase in our Q1 dividend of 22% to $0.22 per share and we returned $424 million to shareholders in Q4 from both dividends and share repurchases. As we look to 2018, we expect our agenda to be largely consistent with 2017. We are hopeful that the macro environment will deliver some tailwinds, given the recent tax legislation, faster economic growth, a path to higher short rates and regulatory reform. But as always, our focus will be on execution and the things that we can control. So with that, let me turn it over to our CFO John Woods who will take you through the numbers in more detail and provide you with some color. John?
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. Let's get started with our fourth quarter results. We’ll start on page 4. As Bruce mentioned, our reported results reflect the impact of tax reform and other notable items that we’ve detailed on page 5 of the earnings presentation. Including these items, we generated net income of 666 million, EPS of $1.35 and a return on tangible common equity of nearly 20% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, including the notable items detailed on page 37, we delivered net income to common of $1.6 billion, EPS of $3.25 and ROTCE of over 12%. Excluding the notable items, underlying fourth quarter results were very strong. ROTCE was 10.4%, net income to common of 349 million was up 24% while EPS was up 29% year-on-year. And we delivered positive operating leverage of 6.4% with strong NII and fee income result across our businesses, which drove the improvement in our efficiency ratio to 58.5% for the quarter. Overall, credit quality continues to be excellent with non-performing loans coming down to 79 basis points of loans. We continue to actively manage our capital base with a 7% year-over-year increase in our tangible book value per share to $27.48 and a robust year end CET 1 ratio of 11.1%. We are focused on shareholder returns and payout 1.1 billion to common shareholders through higher dividends and share repurchases. That's up 70% from 2016. And we continue our positive trajectory with the 22% increase in our quarterly common dividend that we announced today. Moving to page 5, let me cover the notable items in the quarter. Given the tax legislation in December, we’ve revalued our net deferred tax liability and recorded a one-time tax benefit of $331 million. We utilized 22.5 million to invest in our colleagues and the communities we serve. All in, these items contributed 318 million to net income and $0.64 to EPS this quarter. In addition, in connection with our continued balance sheet optimization program, we completed the sale of a $67 million TDR portfolio of home equity and mortgage loans at a pretax net gain of $17 million. We utilize those proceeds to cover TOP IV initiative costs. On page 7, we present our fourth quarter results, excluding these items. As you can see, we continue to deliver strong results with net income to common of 349 million, up 2% and EPS up 4% linked quarter. We continue to deliver on operating leverage, which came in at 6.4% year-over-year with revenue growth close to 8% and expense growth less than 2%. We posted another strong quarter from a return perspective with ROTCE of 10.4%, up 200 basis points year-over-year. Our efficiency ratio was 58.5%, an improvement of 3.7 percentage points. Both of these metrics are well ahead of our medium term IPO target. These strong results reflect continued execution against our strategic initiatives and our commitment to focus on continuous improvement to drive further revenue growth while maintaining operating expense discipline. On page nine, for the full year, we delivered underlying EPS growth of 34% with positive operating leverage of 6.8%. Also, we grew our balance sheet nicely. Notwithstanding an increasingly competitive environment, average loans were up 6%. At the same time, we expanded our net interest margin by 16 basis points. We are also seeing the solid return on the investments in our fee businesses as underlying non-interest income was up 7% in 2017. Taking a deeper look into NII and NIM on pages 10 and 11, we continue to deliver attractive and disciplined balance sheet growth, which helped us drive a 2% linked quarter increase in NII. Net interest margin improved 3 basis points linked quarter and 18 basis points year-over-year, which reflects a nice improvement in loan yields and better result in deposits, given the benefit of our balance sheet optimization efforts and a more constructive rate environment. On a linked quarter basis, retail and commercial loan yields were each up 5 basis points. Partially offsetting the higher loan yield, deposit costs were higher by 2 basis points, reflecting the rising short rates. Total average deposits increased 1% from the prior quarter, driven primarily by growth in demand and term deposits. Period end deposits were up 2% with increases across most categories. Turning to fees on page 12, on an underlying basis, noninterest income increased 2% linked quarter, largely reflecting strength in FX and interest rate products and trust and investment services fees along with positive results in mortgage banking and letter of credit and loan fees. These growth areas were partially offset by lower capital market fees, which were still strong but came off the record levels we delivered the past couple of quarters. Year-over-year, our noninterest income was up 3%, driven by strength in the capital markets business, given our expanded capabilities, higher trust and investment services fees, given the improved sales productivity and fee based sales results. Card fees were also better, given the higher purchase volumes, along with the benefit of the first quarter revision of contract terms for processing fees. While mortgage banking fees were down driven by a decline in servicing fees with a relatively stable production fee income, our origination volumes outperformed. Turning to expenses on page 13, on an underlying basis , expenses were stable compared to the third quarter. Lower salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses were offset by an increase in outside services, which includes costs related to our strategic growth initiatives. Year on year, our expenses were up 1%, as salary and benefit expense was higher, reflecting the impact of strategic hiring, merit increases and higher revenue based incentives. We also saw an increase in outside services costs tied to our strategic growth initiatives. We continue to remain highly disciplined on the expense side as we identify opportunities to redeploy expense dollars out of the lower value areas in order to continue to self fund our growth initiatives and enhance capabilities to serve customers. Continuous improvement is part of our DNA and we continue to become more efficient, which allows us to fund our growth initiatives and maintain strong operating leverage. With that, let's move on and discuss the balance sheet. On page 14, you can see we continue to grow our balance sheet and expand our NIM. Overall, average loans were up 1% on a linked quarter basis and 4% year-over-year. In consumer, we grew the portfolio 5% year-over-year with continued expansion in residential mortgages and high risk adjusted return categories like education, which is largely tied to our refinance product as well as continued strength in other unsecured retail loans, which continues to be driven by our product financing partnerships and our personnel unsecured product. As you know, we have been reducing the size of our auto portfolio and that should continue over time. As a result of these efforts, in addition to higher rates, we've expanded consumer portfolio yield by 5 basis points in the quarter and 38 basis points year-over-year. We also saw nice growth in commercial with average loans increasing 3% year-over-year where we continue to execute well in mid corporate and private equity, commercial real estate and franchise finance. This growth is muted somewhat by our efforts to reduce capital historically deployed against lower return areas like select portions of the C&I book, where we aren’t gaining in crosssell and in asset finance where we had historically focused on big ticket leases, given RBS ownership. Our overall goal in commercial is to raise returns and build strong relationships, while still achieving good loan growth. The net results in commercial reflect a 7 basis point improvement in yields linked quarter and a 70 basis point increase year-over-year, reflecting the benefit of higher rates and optimization efforts. Also, Citizens remains well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment with our asset sensitivity relatively unchanged at 5.1%. On page 17, looking at the funding side, we saw a 2 basis point sequential quarter increase in our cost of deposits, reflecting the impact of higher rates, but also good discipline and progress on initiatives. We continue to find attractive balance sheet growth at accretive risk adjusted returns, which is driving NIM higher in spite of these gradually rising deposit costs. Our overall funding costs were also up 2 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our cost of funds was up 21 basis points, reflecting deposit cost increase of 17 basis points as well as a shift to more long term funding. This compares with overall asset yield expansion of 39 basis points. Our deposit betas remain in line with our overall expectations, given where we are in the rate cycle and we feel good about our ability to execute against our optimization strategies and become more effective in our future deposit gathering. Next, let's move to page 18 and cover credit. Overall, credit quality continues to be excellent, reflecting the ongoing mix shift towards high quality lower risk retail loans and a relatively clean position in the commercial book. The non-performing loan ratio improved 6 basis points versus the prior quarter to 79 basis points of loans this quarter, while improving 18 basis points from the year ago quarter. The net charge-off rate increased to 28 basis points from 24 basis points in the third quarter, given seasonal impacts and the maturing of our portfolio. Our commercial net charge-off was very low again this quarter, while retail net charge-offs were 11 million higher than the third quarter, in part due to higher seasonality in auto and education and a modest reduction in recovery. Provision for credit losses of 83 million was 5 million above charge-offs. The provision was up 11 million compared to a relatively low level in the third quarter and down 19 million versus a year ago, reflecting the improvement in overall credit quality. Lastly, our allowance to total loans and leases ratio was relatively stable at 1.12% and our NPL coverage ratio improved to 142% from 131% in the third quarter and 118% in the year ago quarter. On page 19, you can see that we continue to maintain robust capital and liquidity position. We ended the quarter with a CET 1 ratio of 11.1% or 11.2% when incorporating the benefit of a proposed FASB accounting standard tied to the recent tax legislation. We ended the year with a CET 1 ratio above guidance, given our strong fourth quarter performance, lower risk weighted assets and the impact of the tax legislation. This quarter, we purchased 8.8 million shares and returned 424 million to common shareholders including dividend. As expected, our board approved a 22% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 a share. On page 20, we continue to provide color on how we are progressing against our strategic initiatives. Suffice it to say, we are executing well overall and we’ll continue to make adjustments as needed. Page 21 provides some detail on our TOP IV initiatives. The TOP programs have successfully delivered efficiencies that have allowed us to self fund investment to provide our platforms and product offerings. We have largely completed the TOP III program, which launched in mid-2016 and we estimate that it has delivered run rate benefits of over $115 million as of the end of 2017. Our new TOP IV program is doing very well and we are on track to deliver another $95 million to $110 million of pretext run rate benefit by the end of 2018. On page 22, you can see the steady and impressive progress we're making in improving our performance. Since 3Q ’13, our ROTCE has improved from 4.3% to 10.4%. And our underlying efficiency ratio has improved from 68% to 58.5%. Our EPS continues on a very strong trajectory as well with a CAGR of nearly 30% over the past four years to $0.71 from $0.26. While we are pleased with the performance, we still have opportunity for further improvements, which we will cover shortly. On page 23, we review our full year performance against the guidance we provided at the start of 2017. You can see the green ticks on the right column, demonstrating another year of strong execution. On pages 24 and 25, we detail our guidance for 2018. Quite similar to 2017 with good top line growth, a 3% to 5% positive operating leverage target, further efficiency ratio improvements and capital normalization. Let me add a few points of color. We are expecting slightly slower loan growth overall given competitive market conditions, but still in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. Growth will be focused in the areas we believe offer attractive risk adjusted returns. We should see strong NIM improvement in the range of 9 to 12 basis points, which reflects market expectations for rate hikes in April and October as well as continued execution on our balance sheet optimization efforts. We expect continued growth in noninterest income in the 4.5% to 6% range as we leverage our investments and expand the capabilities and continue to invest for the future. We expect credit quality to remain well controlled as our charge-offs should gradually normalize and some growth in provision will be needed for loan growth. We expect our LDR to be about 98% and CET 1 at the end of the year between 10.6% and 10.8% with a dividend payout ratio of around 30%. This payout ratio would be higher, but for the first half impact of tax legislation and the timing of CCAR. Next, let's turn to our fourth [ph] quarter outlook on page 26. This is typically a seasonally softer quarter for us, given several factors, including day count, seasonally activity levels and elevated FICA taxes. We expect loan growth to come in at about 1% and we should see about a 5 basis point improvement in NIM for the quarter. We're expecting our effective tax rate to come in at about 23% percent, including a small historic tax credit impact. We also pay our preferred stock dividend in the first and third quarter each year. Overall, our view for the quarter reflects continued strong execution against our plan. And with that, let me turn things back over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, John and I think you missed the first quarter there. You said the fourth. Everybody knew what you're talking about. So, let's turn to page 27 and let's focus on where we're taking Citizens over the medium term. We have a mission to really make a difference for our customers, colleagues and communities, so that they can reach their potential. Things that can focus on and deliver this will build long-term franchise value and stand out in a crowded banking landscape. We aim to become a top performing, widely admired bank. To get there, we will rely on our customer centric culture, our mindset of continuous improvement and building excellent capabilities. And our Credo informs and guides our culture and behaviors. This mission, vision and credo really resonates with our stakeholders and is a key foundation of our past success and it's an important reason I am confident in our future outlook. On page 28, let me identify some of the keys to taking our financial performance to the next level. The good news is that we believe there's plenty more for us to do to drive improved performance. We have plenty of fuel left in the tank so to speak. I’ll highlight a couple of things here on this page. First, we believe that our commitment to continuous improvement through execution of TOP programs and BSO is differentiating and will drive continued outperformance versus peers. Second, we are excited about the opportunities to leverage the investments that we've made in our fee based businesses over the last few years. I think overall, we have a tremendous opportunity to continue investing, to build up these businesses and to realize the revenue potential in our franchise. And lastly, prudent capital management and balance sheet rate positioning will continue to help drive improving returns. On page 29, we unveil our new medium term financial targets. You can see that we've outlined our expectations for the overall economic environment, which is relatively constructive, particularly given the recent tax legislation. Over the medium term, we expect to deliver continued improvement in ROTCE, moving to 13% to 15%, including the benefit from the recent tax legislation. We expect a rising rate environment to be helpful in reaching our targets, as we are factoring in that short rates will increase on average a little over two times per year, given the current rate curve. We expect to deliver solid top line growth while driving annual positive operating leverage in the range of 3% to 5%. This should lead to continued efficiency ratio improvement down to 52% to 56% and we also expect to see some normalization in credit from the excellent performance that we're seeing today. And we continue to be focused on returning capital to shareholders through our repurchase program and targeting a dividend payout of 35% to 40%. Over this timeframe, we would expect to reduce our CET1 ratio by approximately 30 to 40 basis points annually to a target of around 10%. As we did with the original ROTCE walk, we presented an updated version with a roadmap of how we think we can go from roughly 10% today to 14% on a full year basis give or take with time. So to sum up, page 30, we feel that we've delivered strong results in Q4 and for full year 2017. We will maintain our mindset of continuous improvement in 2018 and we will look to drive more TOP and BSO program benefits. We feel our balance sheet capital and credit position remain robust and as we head into 2018, we feel very good about our ability to grow the business and drive towards our new targets. We're making good steady progress across the board as we aim to become a top performing bank. So with that, operator Brad, let's open it up for some questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go to the line of John Pancari with Evercore.
John Pancari: Just on the tax side, just wanted to get your updated thoughts in terms of the benefit of tax reform, as you look at your expense base, since you look at your investments, I know you've got the TOP IV plan and the program is very much in place, how much of that tax benefit do you think longer term ends up accreting to the bottom line and sorry if you already alluded to that? And then separately, what areas in terms of technology spend are you putting new money to work? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Sure. So I think certainly in the near term, most of that tax benefit flows through. We announced at the end of the year the bonus program for certain employees here and a contribution to the community foundation that we run, which I think was the right thing to do. We're looking at our overall technology spend. I think, we've been funding that at a very good clip. So, at the margin, we might try to get a few more things through a little faster, but I think that's really at the margin. So I think that in terms of our own spend, we're going to mainly let it flow through. I think the question over time is what happens in the marketplace to some of our peers. We don't intend to lead on this, but do some folks offer a little bit back and get more aggressive on loan terms, for example, that takes the market to a different place than it is today. I don't anticipate that happening in the near term, but we'll see how that plays out over time. So we're optimistic that there should be a pretty good benefit that we get to produce in 2018 from the overall tax reform and I think that should be pretty well sustainable in our view, although over time, you might see a little bit of it competed away. Just in terms of where we're spending money, one of the things that we've been pleased with is we've said that for much of the last five years, we were playing catch up in terms of our technology spend in freshening our application suite and the infrastructure that we run. We're now moving to the good news having been largely caught up, we can focus on playing “offence”. And so there's a lot more funding going into things like digital, so the origination and fulfillment platforms that will create efficiencies and better customer experiences. So I'd say that's really where the future spend is going.
John Pancari: And then on the medium term targets, the ROE outlook and the efficiency ratio, in terms of medium term, how do you define that timeframe, just want to get a little bit of clarity around that and then what type of rate environment do those medium term targets assume?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. So I think the medium term, we're being, I think, just a little less specific than we were during the IPO walk when we kind of laid it out and said, it was three years and we hope to get the 10% by Q4 of ’16. It actually took us three quarters more to do that. We executed the plan well, but we didn't get the lift in rates that we had anticipated. So I think our view now is to be a little less specific, just call it, medium term, but I still think you kind of think in terms of three year cycles. And so, I'd say it's fundamentally roughly a three year view plus or minus depending on what happens in the environment. Again, one of the keys will be what happens with rates over that period. You can see on the walk on the page that still we have an asset sensitive position. We still expect to get a benefit from that. If we look at triage among dot plots, consensus estimates, forward curve, we come up with an expectation right now that we should see two rate hikes per year for the next three years. That includes ’18, 19 and ’20. So that's built into the forecast here. One of the things I will point out is notwithstanding, we had far fewer hikes than what we assumed when we put the IPO targets out we found other ways to compensate. We got more positive operating leverage than we anticipated. So we're not sitting here reliant on the rates, but they certainly would create a tailwind if that scenario develops.
John Pancari: And then one last thing, if you do get that type of move at the short end, but not much follow through at the longer end, if you get a flattish curve throughout this period, does that take away much, are you still able to offset that?
Bruce Van Saun: It takes away some. So, John, you could add here, but I think we don't anticipate a full parallel shift. But, if we really had a pure flattening of the curve, that would take away a percentage of the benefit.
John Woods: Yeah. That’s exactly right. I mean, we've built in an expectation that short rates will rise, that will rise faster than long rates over that timeframe, so we’ve already got that built in. Even if that occurs, we can still stay on this path and it's anchored not only through our 5% asset sensitivity, but the fact that that will actually moderate over time along with the flattening, so that’s built in.
Operator: And we can go to the next question. It will come from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill and Partners.
Scott Siefers: John, maybe best for you, but question just on the loan growth guidance, so it looks like as you look into the first quarter, pretty steady rate of growth with what you've been doing recently, but to get to the full year guidance, it looks like it might take a little bit of an acceleration throughout the course of the year. One, am I interpreting that correctly? And two, just maybe a little more color on what the drivers would be behind any acceleration?
John Woods: Yeah. I mean that's right. You’ve got that right. We're coming in around 1% for the first quarter and to get to that 4.5% to 5.5% that we're talking about, things will pick up later in the year. I mean, we came out of 4Q and saw that in the industry as well as in our own businesses, a little bit of softening in some of our areas that which drive that loan growth, but we're seeing some pick up and the pipelines are strong. And as we go through the first quarter, if we can realize those pipelines and see the pull through that we expect and we'll see a pickup later in the year. The key areas that would drive that on the consumer side continue to be education loans and mortgage as well as on secured. And on the commercial side, we've been investing in our geographies, in our growth markets and opportunity and talent along with that geographic expansion. And so, those things will continue to drive growth into 2018.
Bruce Van Saun: I would add to that John and say that I think the consumer side has been relatively consistent. So we kind of get the run rate of 5% annualized growth almost quarter in and quarter out where we need to start to see the build is on the commercial side. And I think as John indicated, the pipelines are good. I think, there's been some pent up demand looking into Washington and some uncertainty. What was going to happen now that that's been resolved and I think there's positive sentiment towards the tax cut. Hopefully, that releases some animal spirits and we get more loan demand and a follow through as the year goes on. So we would expect to see the commercial side pick up a bit. Don, do you want to add any color to that?
Don McCree: I think that's right. I think just to echo what John and Bruce said, I think we are seeing the pipelines build. We're seeing the M&A pipelines build faster than the loan pipelines. We think the loans will follow the M&A pipelines and are indicative of new money demand we might see and I would remind people that we really rolled out the regional strategies midyear last year, so they're going to begin to take hold this year as we add new clients. So we’ve got a combination of more activity with our existing clients and then adding new opportunities into the book.
Scott Siefers: And then if I could just ask one more on the margin, so obviously some pretty decent expansion here, as you look into the first quarter, I guess, I'm just curious how you see the progression going throughout the year? I guess my initial guess would have been the guide could have been even a little bit higher, just trying to figure out if that's conservatism or any sort of change in anticipated deposit betas or how you see things progressing?
John Woods: I’ll go ahead and I’ll start off on that. The outlook of 9 to 12 basis points for 2018, in terms of deposit betas, those are built in, where deposit betas are behaving as expected at this point in the tightened cycle for us. We did have some expectations that betas would continue to increase. The farther we get into the tightening cycle, so that is built in to the 9 to 12 basis points that we're talking about. And so, I think by – if we do get that April and October move from the Fed, we'll be right on target with moving towards the potential of the 300 basis points through the cycle move and we’re right on track from that perspective. So we felt pretty good about that NIM outlook, given what we've built in on betas.
Operator: And our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.
Geoffrey Elliott: On capital, it looks like you've got some run down built in but really not targeting CET 1 much lower than you did previously, despite the fact that we seem to be entering an elusive regulatory environment, why is that?
John Woods: We’ve been targeting this approximately 40 basis points or so of capital decline glide path over time. I think that serves us well over a couple of -- through a couple of lenses. We still have opportunities for deploying that capital and when we find opportunities to deploy that capital organically and in an accretive way, we think that's a good use of the capital. We continue to compare the ability to deploy the capital against what the economics would be of a buyback and when we find opportunities that are accretive, we would deploy that on behalf of shareholders and that glide path over time will -- we will resume that march downward. This past year, we were the victim of basically higher earnings and a little bit lower RWA usage as we talked about earlier on the call in terms of loan growth and of course the tax legislations. So I think there are some unique factors that were at play in 2017 and I think we'll get back on that glide path reduction on CET 1 in 2018 and beyond.
Bruce Van Saun: I think Geoffrey, getting down to 10 to 10.25 is part of the medium term targets. And there's a bunch of things that go into that. It's the spot posture that the regulators have regarding the stress test, but then also the rating agencies and what you're targeting in terms of your credit rating. And so I think the good news here is that we can get a very acceptable ROEs, medium term ROEs and still maintain what we think is a strong capital position that gives us flexibility as John described.
Geoffrey Elliott: And I think in the past, when you've been asked about bank M&A as a channel for deploying capital, the answer has been not yet, but three years out, post the IPO, you’ve hit the initial target, is that changing at all? Is there any more appetite for bank M&A?
Bruce Van Saun: I'd say there's really no change there. There is beginning to be an appetite to do what I would describe as fee based bolt-ons. So the, Western Reserve M&A boutique that we bought in 2017 I think was a great transaction and it's working really well, integrated well and we're getting lots of two way flow with that property. I think we could do more things in commercial, in the capital markets space to keep building out our capabilities. Over on consumer, we have I think a desire to really capture the potential that we have in wealth management in the organization. We've been doing that organically and so there could be opportunities potentially to add through acquisition there. And then, I'd say there's other opportunities around mortgage, for example, buying MSRs, if you want to account that as an acquisition is another thing and maybe some things in the payment space and some of the things we're doing with fin-tech. So I think we've built the capabilities now. We have a strong team that can look outside the organization to spot opportunities and react to opportunities. But again, I think it's walk before you run. It's to relatively safe, well thought out deals that are right in the middle of the fairway that are accretive and get us, like I like to say, farther down the track faster versus an organic pathway and then the rest of it is, let's keep focus on running the bank better and getting that organic growth and let's not get distracted going off and looking for bank M&A.
Operator: And we will go to the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.
Kevin Barker: I’ve noticed that some of your deposit growth has been decent and then your deposit betas have also started to slow a bit from the beginning of the year. Could you just give us a little bit of color on what you're seeing as far as deposit competition, specifically in the northeast? And how you see some of the go forward deposit betas at least in the next couple of quarters?
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. I think this will be a team effort, but Brad, why don't you start with the color on the consumer side and some of the geographic markets that we have.
Brad Conner: I would say for the most part, competition has been pretty well behaved. We've seen a little bit of increased competition on the money market side, but for the most part, the competition has been pretty well behaved, the deposit costs have been well behaved and competition has been pretty attractive. We are continuing to make investments in our ability to be more targeted in our deposit offerings. So, we're really moving away from promotional pricing and investing in analytics and the ability to do targeted digital offerings, targeted direct mail offerings, which we think will help us keep our deposit costs lower and keep our betas in check, but competitively, we feel pretty good about where the market's been.
Bruce Van Saun: Don, do you want to talk about the commercial?
Don McCree: Yeah. I’d say the same thing. I mean, it was really beginning -- at the beginning of last year, where I felt we really organized the business around strategic deposit gathering. And before that, I think we were lurching a little bit in and out of the market in terms of gathering deposits and we're now managing over a multi-quarter basis, so that’s helped us gather with our core clients in a much better way and contain costs at the same time.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. John, do you want to fill in the blanks on the betas? A - John Woods Sure. Yeah. So on the betas, you’re right. I mean I think when we mentioned last quarter that we expected betas to be lower this quarter, that wasn’t a Fed move. That would drive it in 4Q. And so that occurred and as expected, I think looking forward, you could think about similar behavior in the quarters in which there's a Fed hike, in the quarter that after the Fed hike, you can see betas rise and that’s as expected. We're right on our glide path in terms of where we expected to be on betas. We're in the low-20 on beta, just up a tiny bit from – in 4Q and we expect that to stay in the 20s as we see things progress throughout 2018, maybe getting up towards 30. If we get those two hikes, we'll be more than halfway through an overall tightening cycle and we’ll be about halfway through our overall beta estimate of around 60%. So, things are progressing on plan.
Kevin Barker: Okay. And then a quick follow-up of the other side of the balance sheet, the other retail consumer loan growth has been fairly robust, especially this quarter, up 23%. And it's one of the higher yielding asset classes, could you just describe some of the puts and takes on why that's growing at the level it is.
John Woods: It’s been a good quarter for us on the unsecured side. So our partnerships, including the Apple relationship, has been strong, so we’ve seen good growth there. We’ve seen good growth in our core product, our personal and secured loan and we see upside in both of those areas and we've seen continued strength in demand for the product as well. So all of those are good risk adjusted assets and we see some good runway in all of those products.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. And I think what's interesting to note is that we have a pipeline of potentially some other partners that are going to be coming on stream as the year goes by, which should continue to add to the growth.
Operator: And our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Matt O'Connor: Can you talk about some of the fee revenue drivers in 2018? I think, you had some pretty big upgrades in the treasury management and mortgage and obviously the mortgage market is a bit influx here with lower refis, but maybe talk about fees in general and then those two specific areas, how meaningful the opportunity could be in those.
Bruce Van Saun: Sure. Why don't I start and then John you can provide more of the details. But I'd say that we still remain quite positive on the trajectory we've had on the commercial side of the house. So we've been adding clients and building up our capabilities so that we can do more for those clients. So that's a very strong powerful combination to have broader capabilities and a growing client book. And so if you look probably over the last three years, I think our fees on the commercial side have grown in double digits, low double digits, 11%, 12%, really on the back of capital markets and then also, what we call, global markets, which is FX and interest rate hedging, which we used to do in conjunction with RBS, and we’re able to break that away and set up a great operation on our own. So, those we expect to continue to grow. And as you mentioned Matt, what we call treasury solutions here, the cash management business being the biggest element of that should get a real kick probably not till late in the year, because the re-platforming starts to roll out late this year, but I think we've made steady improvements to the platform and now we're going to take a step function to having a really terrific platform. And so I think we’ll start to get even more traction on treasury solutions. Treasury solutions, I think, has been growing in the high single digits, even without that. So we've had strengthened our card offerings and our payables offerings and some of the other areas, but not as much in the core cash management space. And then on the consumer side, really the wealth to us remains the really big upside area and we've fought a few headwinds, by having mix shift and kind of how we approached the business and how the business plays out in terms of products, but we're moving much more towards a managed money orientation as opposed to a transactional orientation around annuities. And so, in the short term, that's been a headwind. But in the long term, that's actually quite positive, because it will build up more annuity like book of revenues and I think those lines are getting pretty close to crossing and you can see in Q4, we had a nice step up and we would expect to see that continue. Mortgage, as we've talked about, we've had fits and starts in that business. I think we now have a strategy that focuses more on conforming in the mix. So let's really get the retail channel the way we want it, more focused on conforming. Let's move and invest in our direct to consumer business and then let's get scale in the servicing by buying some MSRs. So I think we have a good strategy there. We've actually built a very good platform. Our fulfillment and service and capabilities are very strong. So we think that business will contribute as well. So that would be my kind of long winded highlight. And I don't know if I left any for you, John to fill in, but go ahead.
John Woods: You got most of it, Bruce. And you covered and I think the theme is we've invested in all of these fee income capabilities by adding seasoned wealth, adding one-off, there is mortgage, the leadership investments that we make across the commercial phase, re-platforming, we've done product enhancements and advanced with the re-platforming. So, all of that will drive towards the mid single digit growth that we're targeting for 2018 on the fee side and we’re going to be working hard to achieve that goal.
Don McCree: I might just add one thing on the mortgage side. You talked about the shift to direct to consumer. Really, our growth up until now has been almost exclusively through hiring loan officers. But as we've been doing that, we’ve been making 1 billion investment in building the capability for direct to consumer, so building the data now really need to underpin your ability to do direct mail and digital offering and that investment has been made. So we think we really are at a point [indiscernible]
Operator: And we will go to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Ken Usdin: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the BSO part of TOP plus BSO and maybe help frame us in terms of whether it's in terms of the 9 to 12 basis point NIM name expansion for ’18 or just a broader sense of how much upside do you see from that program specifically and separate that from rates maybe?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. So if you look historically, Ken, we’ve probably approached close to 50-50 on the contribution from our NIM expansion from BSO. It wasn't necessarily a formal program, but just the steps that we're taking to focus on the mix and sharpen our pricing and being selective about where we play. I think when we’re at ’18, maybe 8 of that or so was coming from BSO and the rest was coming from rates. So, we tried to really look through and capture that. And then I think going forward, so in recent quarters, it's been a little less, it's maybe 35%, maybe 40%, but still a meaningful contributor. So I think one of the goals we have is to close the NIM gap that we have with the peer median. And we know where the gold is. We got a gold mind and the gold. So we know we still have mix work to do, we still have some pricing work to do and we have now, I think at this point, under John’s leadership, put this into a more formalized program where we'll have tasks and we'll monitor progress and just like we do with the TOP programs. So that's really the background there. John, you can add some additional color?
John Woods: Yes. Just a point or two, I think, a good way to think about it in an environment such as 2018 where we expect rates to move and we've got 94 basis points, I think the number that you heard from Bruce around 30% to 40% is a good way to think about would be to contribute. And in a period where there is no rate moves, really, a lot of the drive comes from BSO. So for example, in 4Q, there was a little bit of rate overhang left in 4Q, so 3 basis points that you saw in 4Q, maybe close to 2 of that came from BSO, because we didn't have a rate move. But again, when you get out to ’18, they will go back to 30% to 40%, Ken, as you heard from Bruce. So that probably helps you think about it. And actually, really it doubled down on -- in an environment where there is no rate move, we're still focused on self-help and we're still driving net interest margin in an environment like that.
Ken Usdin: And then just a follow-up specifically more on some of the loan buckets that continue to run down as part of it, do you actually get a line of sight into the home equity and auto and where and how far out do you see this stabilization in those parts of the buckets or are they just going to kind of continually drift down?
John Woods: Yeah. I'll start off and then I’ll turn it over to Brad or Bruce or whoever wants to add in, but -- and I think the -- I think auto will be a gradual glide over the medium term and we frankly use that as a way to drive upside by finding higher risk return opportunities in the education space or in other areas in unsecured and that allows us to run down the auto book on that kind of path. So that will give you a sense for basically what we expect there and maybe I’ll let Brad to add a lot of detail.
Brad Conner: Yeah. So let me add on the home equity side. So there's an interesting dynamic on the home equity side, which is that home equity line of credit has a 10-year draw cycle and then it moves into repayment. So for the industry and for Citizens, the big books of origination were back in the 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 timeframe. So, our largest books that are hitting the end of the draw period come to an end in 2008. So that's really what more of the drag has been for both the industry and the Citizens and senior home equity portfolio grow. We have a big step down in home equity line starting in 2009 that hit the end of their draw period. So we do think that, I’m sorry, 2019, is when you will start to see home equity grow because we won’t have that headwind of a large book sitting in the end of the draw period.
John Woods: Yeah. So we would -- when we look at the HELOC on a risk adjusted return basis, it's very attractive and it's a great product for the mass affluent, which is a key segment of our consumer base. So we're still investing in that business. We've really improved the customer experience. We have great net promoter scores. We're going through a much faster fulfillment cycle. So I think we're very keen on that business. On auto, I'd say we've been using that when there was not much loan demand, we ran it from 10 billion or 11 billion, up to 14 billion and now we have it back down in the 13s and it's running back down to 10 or 11. So that is -- because it's a two year duration, relatively short portfolio, we can use that as a shock absorber based on what other loan demand is out there in the marketplace. And right now, we're in a mode of withdrawing capital from that business, but the HELOC has been, as Brad said, more environmental. We want to grow that business. We're actually putting new lines on the books, but we're still suffering from paydowns.
Brad Conner: And those paydowns drop about a third between ’18 and ’19. So it’s certainly dynamic.
Ellen Taylor: And so I was just going to add one thing that our direct to consumer marketing effort in home equity has been really successful following the build out in data and analytics and we improved our originations in that channel from about 150 million in 2015 to over 1 billion in 2017.
Bruce Van Saun: So that investment is not just paying dividends in the mortgage business. It’s also in the HELOC business and it will be in all our portfolios.
Operator: And our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
Vivek Juneja: Couple of questions. Consumer efficiency ratio, Bruce, John, still pretty high, up given or take 72% last few quarters. What's your outlook in that, what will it take to get that down meaningfully, because obviously we've had rate hikes, the rate hikes have obviously greater benefit upfront. So, is that a question of scale or what do you think you need to do to get that down meaningfully?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. I'd say it's a combination of things, but the same positive operating leverage that works for the company is what we have to effect in the consumer business in order to keep driving that down. I think it -- actually when I was here, it probably was close to 80%, so we've had good headway in getting it this far. There's a number of things that are going on on the cost side of the equation. Brad has been a leader in the TOP programs and looking for efficiencies and straight through processing and that will continue. We're trying to reduce the overall size of the branches in terms of our branch transformation efforts. So there's a little bit of pruning of the number of locations, but the greater element of that program is trying to take 4200 square foot branches and turn them into 2500 or 2200 square foot branches. And so we're, I’d say, by 2021, I think we'll have gone through 50% of the branches as the target. So we're focused on that. That'll continue to hive down some of the costs and a good chunk of that will be reinvested in digital. But I think you can get more efficient in terms of your touch points with your customers in a digital sense than versus the higher cost full branch structure. So -- anyway so there's good work going on, on the expense side of the house. And then on revenues, we've got to get back to growing households. We think some of the investments that we're making in having well thought out products that for different segments for the affluent, the mass affluent, the mass customer is gaining traction. So that's helpful. We've invested in something we call, customer journeys, to try to really make like for example, the account opening experience, be really pleasurable for the new customer and that has a good impact on keeping that customer, the fraud experience, problem resolution, there's a number of these journeys that we’re re-engineering from front to back, which I think will help boost the top line by reducing attrition, increasing loyalty and increasing crosssell and the consumer portfolios also are contributing. So as we grow personal and secured and education, et cetera, those portfolios drop a lot of net interest income to the bottom line. So, I think what we're expecting for the whole company in terms of driving that efficiency ratio down, we have to get that from consumer and we see it. We have a path to do that.
Vivek Juneja: Completely different question and we’ll shift gears. Any commentary from you folks and from Don and Brad on loan pricing terms you're seeing in the various categories?
Don McCree: Yeah. On the commercial side, it's as aggressive as it’s ever been and it's basically a deal by deal, borrower by borrower. I think it's been down drafting materially for several quarters, if not several years. So I think we're getting to a point where you're probably not going to see material incremental downdrafts. So I think we've seen a lot of it, although every transaction is quite competitive, both on bank balance sheets and on site balance sheets through this intermediation of the bond market and the non-bank markets also. So it's an environment that we've been operating in for the last several years and we expect this to continue, but we're navigating.
Bruce Van Saun: And I think Don you can comment on this, but probably the new thing is the non-bank’s competition has really picked up.
Don McCree: And that's significant in the leverage finance business as in the underwriting business. I think for us, some of that’s being offset and the one thing we didn’t talk about in terms of the progression of the fee revenues is in addition to the investments we've been making. We want to take increasing leadership positions in the transactions that we’re involved in. So while we were a participant several years ago, we were moving to a joint leader ranger, now moving to a ranger, which while we’re growing the business also is allowing us to capture a greater share of both balance sheet economics and fee economics on a transaction by transaction basis. So the fact as you know, it's kind of a put and take constantly, but net net, we're doing pretty well.
Brad Conner: I would say on the consumer side, we haven't seen a lot of change. It’s been pretty – certainly, the market has been rational without question, a few competitors have entered in the rural space, the education and refinance space, but it really hasn't moved the market much, and in fact obviously on the auto side, we’ve maybe seen margins even widens a little bit on the auto side, which is encouraging.
Operator: And our next question in queue will come from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.
Peter Winter: The provision expense, when I look at credit quality, it's been very good and then the guidance for the provision expense for ’18, the range is a little bit higher than what I was looking for and I'm just wondering the reserve build is not a function of keeping reserves to loan ratio fairly steady with the loan growth or would you want to start build building the reserve with more growth on the consumer side?
Bruce Van Saun: What I would say Peter first off is that's about the guidance that we gave for 2017 was I think the same exact range that we're giving for 2018. So we were very favorably surprised by how strong the environment was and how all of our credit metrics improved. I think when you now turn the calendar and look at ’18, one of the questions is we want to get the loan growth in the range that we talked about, midpoint of that is 5.25, something like that. So you would be adding to reserves to fund the loan growth. What happened this year is that even though we thought that covered was pretty bare in terms of problem credits or back book issues, we still had a lot of positive surprises. So whatever we needed to fund in terms of the allowance build, we actually had offsets coming in, in terms of back book improvements. I don't know if you can -- again if you're really clean, can you count on that happening again. So I think we're being conservative here and just saying, well, let's assume we get the loan growth and let's assume we don't have a lot coming from back book credit improvements, then that would start to move your provision number higher. There's also a little bit of seasoning in some of the consumer portfolios that will start to move the charge-off number up a little bit, certainly, well behaved and in control, but that would also be a factor that comes with a good thing, if all the net interest income is being delivered. So anyway, I'd say that's our call at this point, if 2017 -- 2018 plays out like 2017, there could be some positive upside there.
Peter Winter: And just a quick follow-up, if Congress were to raise the SIFI threshold, would that accelerate the medium-term target on your common equity tier 1 ratio?
John Woods: I don't think so. I mean I think that we set that target in part related to business opportunities that we talked about before and the fact that we continue to have organic and other opportunities to deploy capital over time that are accretive that we want to balance against the capital return and just where we are in our life cycle as a company post IPO. It just feels like an appropriate glide path, whether that SIFI threshold was at 50 billion or 250 billion. We of course are supportive of that directionally and believe that that would help moderate the interactions that we're having with the regulators, but I think the glide path would remain.
Operator: And the next question in queue will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.
John Hearn: This is actually John Hearn on for Gerard. Just a quick question on the commercial utilization rates in the quarter. Could you tell us where they were and then just how that compares to where they performed in the past?
Don McCree: I think they're right around mid-30s and I think relatively stable across the year, up and down a tick, and up a little bit year-over-year, so maybe low-30s ending 2016, getting into the low to the mid-30s here at the end of 2017. So about as expected.
John Hearn: And then just one follow-up from earlier comments on the merchant financing programs, you're expecting to announce some partnerships this year and another is a degree of risk sharing there with the partner, so is that expected to continue as new people join us.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. So I’ll start and Brad you can complement. But, yeah, I think we will have more announcements this year. We're working on some things that are in pilots and so stay tuned. But this is a -- I think we provide a very high quality customer experience and a good partnership experience for our partners. And so there's other folks who want to see if they can do a program similar to what we pioneered with Apple. And I think each of the arrangements has its own negotiation around how the economics are going to work and so kind of the pricing that we get is oriented around a targeted rate of return. And so if there is more loss sharing that we don't need as much for the use of our balance sheet and vice versa. So anyway, we're pleased in general that we can offer the flexibility. We can construct these things around the rate of return and we think that the risk adjusted rate of return that we're getting are attractive at this point.
Brad Conner: Yeah. I really don't have anything to add other than I really completely -- we expect to have more partnership announcements this year and expect to have then, some degree of risk sharing through all the partnerships.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.
Ken Zerbe: On slide 17, it looks like most of the funding growth has been coming from the term deposits or timed deposits. Can you just talk about that, like, I'm just curious more about the strategy, it doesn't obviously seem to be having an impact on your margin or your deposit base today, but I’m kind of wondering how that plays out over the next year or so?
John Woods: Yeah. And I think, we have all of those tools in the toolbox with respect to our deposit categories and from time to time, we will have a promotional strategy on term, which allows us to control cannibalization and other things that may happen in a promotional approach, but we're more pleased with our DBA growth and really that's the driver of all of the initiatives that you're hearing about, coming out of the consumer space with all the investments that we're meeting there in terms of better pricing and investments in data and analytics. And the targeting that we're doing there from a digital perspective, so our emphasis is on DDA and from time to time, we can serve our customers in a promotional way through term.
Brad Conner: I think you said it well, we think there's a good opportunity and continued DDA growth. We’re pleased with the progress we have there this year.
Ken Zerbe: And then just last question in terms of the capital markets business, obviously, it ticked down a little bit this quarter, but from a higher pace over the last couple of quarters, I mean was there something unusually negative in this quarter, I mean, should it bounce back towards that $50 million range or is it just, I’m trying to think of what the outlook is. I mean, I understand the total fee guidance is what it is, but –
John Woods: Yeah. I think the way to answer that is, it's going to be a moving mix of fees across M&A and bond underwriting and syndicated lending and leverage finance based on deal flow that’s materializing. I will say with the changes in tax legislation, we expect more activity in general. There was one slight anomaly in the fourth quarter that we called a couple of deals forward in the third quarter in terms of closing. And if you pushed into the first quarter, so it was always a timing difference and we did see people, both on the M&A side and on the syndicated loan side basically migrate around at year end, based on what their individual cash aspects of their transaction are. So I look at it not on a quarter-on-quarter basis, but on a year-on-year basis. And you're going to have quarterly anomalies I think. We feel good about the, as I said before, the breadth of that business now, the position we have in terms of underwriting and climbing up the tables and the swings we're having based on the size of the client base and the fact that that’s growing.
Bruce Van Saun: And Ken, you may recall the trajectory that we used to put up quarters in the 20s for capital markets and we had the 30s, the 40s, 50s and I was joking that 50 is the new 30, but I think there will be some volatility based on market conditions and when deals close. And so we're pleased that the investments we have in the business have borne fruit, that the environment has been healthy and we would expect the capital markets on a year-over-year basis to be up in 2018 versus 2017.
Operator: And our last question in queue will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
Marty Mosby: Wanted to focus on the balance sheet optimization and in all your kind of guidances and you get to funding, you talk about loan to deposit ratios and you’re bumping up against that 100% level, but given the methodology of liquidity coverage ratios, shouldn't that be the driving force for liquidity versus your loan to deposit ratio? Do you see 100% as any type of constraint on your balance sheet and loan growth?
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Well, we have actually worked to try to bring that down gradually. So the history was, we were probably in the 93 zone when I arrived and we needed to sell the Chicago region to fund the separation from RBS and some charges we had to take. So we took the gain and that ultimately removed net about 5 billion of deposits that put the LDR up around 99. We printed a year end spot of 97.6. And our guidance has been to bring that to 97 to 98. I do think there's still a psychological impact, if you go over 100. So I do think we are working to keep below that and maybe over time, bring the LDR back towards 95 or so. Having said that, I think another thing is happening. As you point out, the LCR is actually a much more sharp instrument to determine what's the nature of your actual liquidity and funding position. And so there, we've had a very strong LCR just because we have in the deposits a high percentage of our deposits come from consumer, which stress test very, very well and we've termed out all of our borrowings. We have the same kind of term funding structure that our peers do, which we didn't have originally. So when the LCR begins to be published and I think investors pay more attention to that, I think the LDR over time becomes the secondary measurement. But at the current time, we're still managing it. We're pleased with where we have the LCR and we feel very good about our overall liquidity and funding position.
Marty Mosby: The other thing is, when you talked about your long term kind of goals and profitability, one of the things that you said under your operating assumptions was asset sensitivity moderates as rates normalize. Does that encompass neutralizing the asset sensitivity because you have about $7 billion that needs to be extended, neutralized?
John Woods: No. It just happens naturally. So as rates are higher, deposit betas go up and so you capture less from the moves that are late in a hike cycle as opposed to the earlier ones. And so we're not intending to say, this is the precise moment to put a big hedge on a neutralizer sensitivity. In fact, we've actually tried to maintain it a little bit here and we'll just let it glide down naturally with time.
Operator: I’ll hand the call back over to you Mr. Van Saun.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, great. Thanks, everyone for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and also your support along our journey. We're pleased with the progress that we're making. We recognize however that there is still plenty of work in front of us to build a truly great bank. So thanks again and have a great day.
Operator: And that concludes today's conference call. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-10-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Third Quarter of 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Justin and I'll be your operator today.

I'd like to remind you all that in addition to our press release today, we posted a presentation and financial supplement on investor.citizensbank.com. And of course, our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which as you know are subject to risks and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from our expectations in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today. We also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and earnings release material. And now with that, I'm going to hand it over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, Ellen. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call today. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong results, as our disciplined execution continues to drive strong momentum. The headline results show that we reached our key medium-term IPO target this quarter with a 10.1% ROTCE, a 59.4% efficiency ratio and a 1% ROA. This is notwithstanding a lower rate environment then was assumed back when the targets were set. While these results mark good and consistent progress, we have more work to do to run the bank ever better and become a top performing bank. I believe that the same formula that has taken us this far can continue to propel us to even better results. We're being very disciplined in where and how we play in our capital allocation. We have a mindset of continuous improvement that allows us to self-fund our growth investments, while delivering superior operating leverage. We've added some great talent and built out many excellent capabilities. And lastly and perhaps most importantly, we have focused on delivering a great customer experience in both the commercial and consumer segments. We've launched our TOP IV program and we continue to solidify and add initiatives. We pumped our target range by 5 million this quarter. We're putting a similar governance structure around our balance sheet optimization or "BSO" initiatives, which will be led by John Woods, our CFO. Turning to specific highlights of the quarter, we had excellent year-over-year revenue growth and operating leverage. Year-on-year, adjusted revenue was up 10% versus 3% adjusted expense growth, delivering 7% positive operating leverage. NII was up 12%, as loans grew by 5.4% and the net interest margin improved by 21 basis points, with about half of that due to self-improvement and half due to raise. Adjusted non-interest income was up 4% and that was really paced by strong growth in capital markets revenues. On a linked quarter basis, our underlying revenue growth was 2.5% against expense growth of 1% for 1.5% sequential operating leverage, which annualizes of course to 6%. NII was 3.5% sequentially - grew 3.5%. That was paced by 1.5% spot loan growth and an 8 basis point rise in the NIM to 3.05%. Our average loan growth was a little lower at 0.4%, which reflects somewhat the sluggish and stretched conditions in the C&I space that we saw throughout a good chunk of the quarter, but we're cautiously optimistic of a pick-up in Q4 continuing on into 2018. We continue to be highly focused on capital management. We returned $315 million to shareholders in Q1 or in Q3, I'm sorry. So overall, it was another strong quarter. We feel good about our positioning, the opportunities that we have in front of us and our ability to execute. So with that, let me turn it over to our CFO, John Woods to take you through the numbers in more detail. John?
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with our third quarter financials, which start on slide four. We generated net income of $348 million and diluted EPS of $0.68 per share. Our reported net income was up 9% compared with the second quarter, driven by higher net interest income and lower credit related costs. Year-over-year, net income was up 17% and EPS was up 21%. We also present our results on an adjusted or underlying basis in order to show a clear picture of the operating trends in our business. On this basis, net income for the third quarter was up 25%, EPS was up 31% and we delivered positive operating leverage of 7% year-over-year, reflecting revenue growth of 10% and expense growth of 3%. Net interest income of $1.1 billion increased 4% linked quarter, driven by loan growth, higher loan yields and benefit from pay accounts, partly offset by an expected increase in our funding cost. Our net interest margin increased eight basis points linked quarter and 21 basis points year-over-year. We will spend more time on the margin in a few minutes. On an underlying basis, non-interest income of $381 million was unchanged from second quarter and was up 4% year-over-year, while our efficiency ratio improved 95 basis points compared with the prior quarter and 390 basis points year-on-year excluding the notable item. We delivered more than 50 basis point sequential quarter increase in ROTCE this quarter to 10.1%, achieving the IPO-based new interim target of 10%. This result was up over 200 basis points from the prior year quarter before the impact of the notable items. Our efficiency ratio of 59.4% for the third quarter also exceeded our medium term IPO target of 60%. We are very pleased with these strong results, which reflect continued execution against our strategic initiative and our commitment to focus on continuous improvement to drive further revenue growth, while maintaining operating expense discipline. Although, we have attained our ROTCE target, we are confident that we can do even more to drive further improvement. We are constantly seeking to run the bank better and leverage the potential of our franchise. There continues to be upside from leveraging the investment for the past several years, optimizing the balance sheet and focusing on continuous improvement in how we serve customers and maximize efficiency. In a few minutes I will update you on the status of our TOP program, which will contribute further efficiencies and revenue opportunities, while funding investments to drive future growth. Taking a deeper look into NII and NIM on slide five and six, we continue to deliver attractive and disciplined balance sheet growth, which helped us drive a 4% linked quarter increase in NII for the quarter. We grew average loans and loans held for sale by 0.4% on a linked quarter basis and average retail loans were up 1.2%, offset by a small reduction in average commercial loans, largely reflecting the impact of the sale of $600 million of lower-return commercial loans in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of the sale, average commercial banking loans and loans held for sale were up 1%. On a period-end basis total loans and loans held for sale were up 1.5% linked quarter and up 5% year-over-year. Average loans and loans held for sale were up 5.4% year-over-year, I'll provide some additional detail on the growth shortly, including the impact of our balance sheet optimization effort. Net interest margin improved 8 basis points linked quarter and 21 basis points year-over-year. This reflects a nice improvement in loan yields given the benefit of our balance sheet optimization effort, which included an ongoing mix shift towards higher return category and the rise in short rate. The improvement in the margin, included a two basis point benefit from higher than expected commercial loan interest recovery. On a linked quarter basis consumer loan yields were up 11 basis points and commercial loan yields were up 25 basis points. An increase in funding cost partially offset the benefit of these higher loan yields. Deposit costs were higher by six basis points reflecting the rise in short rate and growth in the average commercial banking deposits. Total average deposits increased by 2% from the prior quarter while period end deposits were down slightly given an elevated level of commercial deposits at the end of the second quarter. Our average LDR came in at 97.6%, which was consistent with our outlook. Total funding costs were up seven basis points, which reflects the full quarter impact of our $1.5 billion senior debt issuance in May. Turning to fees on slide seven, on an underlying basis, non-interest income was stable linked quarter, as higher capital markets fees and service charges and fees were offset by lower mortgage fees and a reduction in foreign exchange and interest rate products. Capital Markets fees were a record for the quarter, and were up 47% year-over-year, showing continued momentum from the investments we've made in talent and broadening our capability, recording [ph] the strongest quarter given favorable capital markets, particularly in September. We also saw an increase in M&A fees following our second quarter acquisition of Western Reserve, most remaining fee categories were relatively stable linked quarter. Year-over-year on an adjusted basis, non-interest income was up approximately 4% This reflects strong contribution from the capital markets business given our expanding capabilities and higher card fees, which was our higher purchase volume, along with the benefit of revised contract terms for core processing fee, which commenced in the first quarter of this year. Mortgage banking fees were down as reductions in loans sale gains and spreads were partially offset by increase in servicing fees. Foreign exchange and interest rate products fees were also down, driven by a reduction in variable rate loan demand. Trust and investment sales were relatively stable as we continued to drive improvements in our mix of fee-based sale. Turning to expenses on slide 8, on an underlying basis, expenses were up $9 million, largely reflecting higher salaries and employees benefits tied to revenue growth initiatives and higher outside services cost which reflect cost tied to our strategic growth initiatives, along with an increase in other expense, which included $4 million in expense associated with legacy home equity operational cost. Year-on-year our adjusted expenses were up 3%. Salaries and benefits expense was higher, reflecting the impact of strategic hiring, merit increasing and higher revenue base incentive. We also saw an increase in outside services costs tied to our strategic growth initiative. We continue to remain highly disciplined on the expense front, as we identify opportunities to redeploy expense dollars part of lower value area in order to continue to self-fund our growth initiatives and enhanced capabilities to our customers. On 3Q expenses include approximately $15 million for our strategic growth initiative, including our efforts to improve our retail customer experience, expand our wealth management business, broadening our capital market capabilities and bolster our M&A advisory business. We funded these franchise investments with about $14 million in efficiency savings realized through our TOP programs and operational transformation initiatives. In short, we continue to seek opportunities to become more efficient which allows us to fund our growth initiatives and maintain strong operating leverage. With that let's move on and discuss the balance sheet. On slide 9, you can see we continue to grow our balance sheet and expand our NIM. Overall, average loans and loans held for sale were up 0.4% on a linked quarter basis and 5.4% year-over-year, driven by growth in education, mortgage and unsecured retail on the consumer side and broad strength across commercial. Commercial loan growth was muted by the impact of the sale of $596 million of lower return commercial loans and leases near the end of the second quarter, associated with our balance sheet optimization initiative. As I mentioned, NIM was up eight basis points in the quarter and 21 basis points year-over-year. These results reflect further expansion of our loan yields given our balance sheet optimization efforts which contributed about half of the year-over-year increase, continued discipline on pricing and the benefit of higher rates. We also benefited by about two basis points from higher than expected interest recoveries in commercial. Also we remain well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment with assets sensitivities relatively unchanged at 5.4%. On Page 10 and 11, we provide more detail on the loan growth in consumer and commercial. In consumer, we grew the portfolio 6% year-over-year, with continued expansion in the residential mortgages and education, which is largely tied to our refinance product, as well as continued strength in other unsecured retail loans, which continued to be driven by our product financing partnerships and our personal unsecured products. We are also seeing ongoing benefits from our focus on enhancing our portfolio mix by driving growth in higher return categories. As you know, we have been slowing growth in auto and that should continue overtime. As a result of these efforts, in addition to higher rate, we've expanded consumer portfolio yield by 11 basis points in the quarter and 38 basis points year-over-year. We also saw nice growth in commercial with average loan increasing 4% year-over-year, where we continue to execute well in commercial real estate, mid corporate and middle market, industry verticals, and franchise finance. This growth is muted somewhat of our efforts to reduce capital historically deployed against lower returning areas like select portions of the C&I book, where we aren't gaining in cross sell, and asset finance where we had originated big ticket leases given the overall RBS relationship. The overall goal is great returns and build strong relationships while still achieving good loan growth. The net results in Commercial reflected 25 basis point improvement in yields linked quarter and a 75 basis point increase year-over-year. On page 12, looking at the funding side, we saw a six basis points sequential quarter increase in our cost of deposits reflecting the impact of higher rates and growth and higher beta commercial deposits. We continue to find attractive balance sheet growth at accretive risk adjusted returns, which is driving NIM higher in spite of these rising deposit costs. Our funding costs were up seven basis points sequentially which reflects the full quarter impact of our $1.5 billion senior debt issuance in the second quarter. Year-over-year our cost of funds were up 19 basis points reflecting the impact of higher rates along with greater long-term funding. This compares with overall asset yield expansion of 39 basis points. We expect a slower rate of increase in fourth quarter deposit costs given the timing of rate hike and the impact of some of our deposit strategy. Next let's move to slide 13, and cover credit. Overall credit quality continues to be excellent reflecting the continued mix shift towards higher quality lower risks retail loans and a relatively overall clean position in the commercial book. The non-performing loan ratio decreased nine basis points versus the prior quarter to 85 basis points of loan this quarter while improving 20 basis points from the year ago quarter. The NPL coverage ratio improved to a 131% relative to 119% in the second quarter and 112% in the year ago quarter. The net charge-off rate decreased to 24 basis points from 28 basis points in the second quarter with continuing favorable credit trends and results. Our commercial net charge-offs netted down to zero this quarter, reflecting an increase in recovery while retail net charge-offs were $4 million higher than the second quarter in part due to higher seasonality in auto. Provision for credit losses of $72 million was $7 million above charge-offs which includes additional reserves for estimated hurricane losses. The reported provision was relatively stable compared to the second quarter and down $14 million versus a year ago reflecting the improvement in commercial due to recovery. Lastly as we continue to increase the mix of higher quality retail portfolios and our overall loan book, our allowance to total loans and leases ratio was relatively stable at 1.11%. On slide 14, you can see that we continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity position. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.1%. As part of our 2017 CCAR plan, this quarter we repurchased 6.5 million shares and returned over $350 million to shareholders including dividend. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.18 a share today and we have authority through CCAR to increase the quarterly dividend again to $0.22 per share in early 2018 subject to regulatory [ph] approval. On slide 15, we showed a scorecard and how we are executing against our strategic initiatives. We are intensely focused on developing strong customer relationships and growing franchise in a profitable and sustainable way. In the consumer business, we are committed to becoming a trusted advisor to our customers through our clearer [ph] advice and product strategy. We continue to build out our mass affluent and affluent value propositions as these are key segments for us. We are also investing in several projects that will reengineer critical services we provide to customers. This should result in the improved customer experience and greater efficiency. We continue to drive attractive loan growth across the network, which has been our education refinancing loan product and total partnership length and stronger credit which had attractive risk adjusted returns, as we optimize the balance sheet we have continue to reduce the auto portfolio in order to enhance return. And while we continue to build scale and add capabilities highlighted by the launch of SpeciFi our new digital investment advisory platform, we also saw continued progress migrating sales mix towards fee based product which represented 41% of investment sales in the third quarter in 2017 compared to just 30% a year ago. We have increased our efforts to reposition and improve the returns in our mortgage business in the current environment. We trimmed our loan officer headcount by about 10% in the quarter in order to drive productivity and increase our focus on conforming loan mix. In addition, we are investing in a direct to consumer origination platform which we believe will provide a lower cost challenge to originate performing mortgages. In Commercial, our expanded capabilities helped deliver another very strong quarter in capital markets as we continue to leverage the investments we've made including our enhanced bond underwriting platform and our recent acquisition of Western Reserve. Treasury solutions continues its steady progress with fee income growth of 7% year-over-year due to strong momentum in our commercial card program as purchased volume was up 35% year-over-year, driving a 31% increase in fees. Our initiatives to deepen customer relationships are helping to drive continued balance sheet and customer growth with 5% average loan growth year-over-year reflecting strength in middle market, commercial real estate, corporate finance, franchise finance and mid-corporate. We're also starting to see the benefits of our geographic expansion initiatives with strong balance sheet and fee growth in those markets. The TOP program had successfully delivered efficiencies that allowed us to self-fund investments to improve our platform and product offering. We have largely completed the actions needed for the TOP III program which launched in May 2016 and is expected to deliver run rate benefits of approximately $110 million by the end of this year. Our TOP IV program is a further example of our commitment to continuous improvement and delivering value to our shareholders. As we work through our combination of initiatives to enhance revenues and drive efficiencies we are raising our target for the program by $5 million to a run rate pretax benefit of $95 million to a $110 million by late 2018. On slide 16 you can see the steady and impressive progress we're making against financial target. As previously noted this quarter we hit our 10% post-IPO medium term ROTCE target. Since third quarter '13 our ROTCE has improved from 4.3% to 10.1%. Our efficiency ratio has improved by nine percentage point over that same timeframe from 68% to 59.4%, exceeding our medium term IPO target of 60%. And EPS continued on a very strong trajectory as well, up 160% in four years from $0.68 from $0.26 with a CAGR of 27%. This rate of growth and improvement continues to outperform peers over the period as we have made efforts [ph] in terms of key performance measures. That said we still have opportunities for further improvement and we'll work hard to deliver that. Now let's turn to our third quarter outlook on slide 17. We expect to produce linked quarter average loan growth of around 1% to 1.25%. We also expect net interest margin to remain broadly stable linked quarter. We are expecting non-interest income to be broadly stable given the record level of capital markets fees in Q3. We also expect to realize a modest TDR transaction gain in 4Q, which will be offset by costs associated with our strategic growth initiatives. We will treat those as notable items so you will be able to clearly see the operating trends in our business. We expect expenses to be broadly stable in the fourth quarter, perhaps up a tad given seasonality. Additionally we expect provision expense to improve to the range of $80 million to $90 million, reflecting loan growth and a modest increase in commercial net charge-offs given the higher level of recoveries in the third quarter. We expect the tax rate to tick up temporarily to around 34% for the fourth quarter as a result of an $8 million impact on the tax line tied to the launch of our historic tax credit investment program this year. The full year 2017 tax rate is expected to be about 31% on a reported basis and 32.25% on an underlying basis, excluding our 1Q '17 settlement. We expect to manage our Step I ratio to around 10.9% with an expected average diluted share count of approximately $490 million to $495 million. And finally we expect the average LDR to be in the 97% to 98% range. With that let me turn it back to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay thanks John. And with that operator why don't we open up for some Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Ken Usdin: Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. I was wondering John if you can talk a little bit more about that balance sheet optimization side, and specifically how do you expect that to work through the asset yield side of the equation? What are the areas you'll continue to kind of move out of low return and how much can that help the overall asset yield going forward ex-rates?
John Woods: Yeah, thanks, Ken, good question. We're thinking that the key areas that we'll focus on would be in the consumer side, it could be even - I mentioned it before that auto is a low return business. We like our auto business. But we're moderating the portion of the balance sheet that auto will take up going forward. So you could see loan yields rising as a result of that. On the commercial side, the areas that we're looking at, as you may have heard in my remarks include on an ongoing basis taking a look at the back book in C&I, which is a typical business as usual, kind of behavior. But we think that can add benefits to loan yields over time. As well as in asset finance. As we mentioned we have some legacy assets that were put on during [indiscernible] days in the larger ticket area. We've been moderating our exposure there. We'll also drive loan yields higher. So I think we've got a lot of benefit going forward in balance sheet optimization. So we're optimistic that, that will provide lift ex-rates in the future.
Bruce Van Saun: And Ken, it's Bruce, I'll just add to that. I think what we're really seeking to do is put a little more program discipline. I think we've been doing a good job of balance sheet optimization all along. But we're going to look for opportunities to shift the mix in consumer in particular and formalize that, and have targets in place. We'll look for pricing discipline across all portfolios John mentioned auto. But I think there is opportunities in elsewhere, in consumer and then in commercial in particular as we look at rollovers. So we will have a program that allocates out responsibilities to specific individuals with targets that we monitor much the way we run the TOP program.
Ken Usdin: Great, thanks for that color Bruce. And just a second question, then how does that translate into earnings asset growth. I would presume that this assumes that out even as you deemphasize some and grow others that you'll still planned to net grow loans. And can you help us just triangulate how that translates between loan growth and turning into earning asset growth. This was the first quarter in a while where we saw flattening out on the earning asset growth side. Thanks guys.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. And there again I think the goal is to continue to achieve good levels, robust levels of earning asset growth going forward, while we're making those remixing decisions. But I think we've done that pretty well all along. I'd say the things that hit the numbers this quarter really was the aftermath of that late Q2 loan sale on commercial and then some. I'd say the stretched conditions that we saw in commercial we're not really going to push on our rope here. If it's not there we'll be disciplined, but I think we saw in September things starting to pick up a bit. And I think the sentiment in Washington if we start to see the pro-growth agenda take place that can also create I think more loan demand which will ease some of the pressures that we're seeing on the commercial side. I might flip it over to Don for some color there.
Don McCree: Yeah I think that's exactly right. The other thing I'd mention is we did have a reasonably strong quarter in our bond businesses, which were reflected in a little bit of a reduction of our outstandings from utilization standpoint, particularly on the corporate businesses. So we picked up a little bit on the fee line while we saw a little bit of moderation in the loan growth. Our pipelines look pretty strong right now and I would just echo what Bruce said around terms and conditions. It's very aggressive out there with everyone looking for loan growth. So if transactions are getting too stretched from a terms and conditions from a pricing standpoint, we'll probably stand back and let that go away. So that will be a moderating factor, but as we look deeper into the fourth quarter and into next year and begin to get some certainty around some policy coming out of Washington we think it could be a quite a good backdrop for continued expansion of the business. And then the last thing I'd say as we are seeing a really good client growth in our expansion markets. So while terms and conditions are tough, we're adding clients and that should result in incremental demand as we go forward.
Bruce Van Saun: And I'd just add to that, I'll flip it to Brad too for some color. But the other thing I'd point out Ken is that we’re very consistent on our consumer side loan growth. So we've been kind of in a 5.5%, 6% annualized growth rate every quarter which we saw again this past quarter. I think some of the reason we've been able to achieve that is we have unique spaces that we're playing, such as the education refinance market, such as personnel unsecured with our corporate partners. And so we expect to continue to see opportunities to build on that. And so that can inure us from any little dips that we see in the overall consumer loan demands. So Brad maybe --.
Brad Conner: Yeah. Bruce I think you articulated it well. We've got a unique space in student and unsecured which is providing the runway for both of those to continue to grow. We've had good growth in mortgage lending and we believe that will continue. And really what we're talking about in auto really shouldn't change the trend line because we've already been pulling back in auto. In fact you saw that.
Ken Usdin: Yeah.
Brad Conner: Begin to reduce in and we've got out of this relationship a couple of quarter or last quarter or so. I think there is plenty of reason to believe that the trends that we've seen up until now can continue.
Ken Usdin: Yeah. Got it. Thanks very much.
Bruce Van Saun: Hey, Ken.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is open.
John Pancari: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi.
John Pancari: Also on the balance sheet side, I just wanted to talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of deposit competition and is there pressure to implement pricing programs to bring in deposits? And also what do you see right now as to what your deposit beta is trending and what're you thinking could move?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, why don’t I start and flip it to John. But you know I think the consumer side continues to be well behaved. And so I think we're continuing to see discipline hold throughout the market and the higher you get in the cycle you start to see the betas rise. But right now they are still quite low. On a commercial side obviously there is sophisticated companies there, as you particularly get up into the bigger size companies, they have treasurers and they're looking for - to participate as rates go up. They see the cost of their loans going up. So they want that cost on the funds that they're leaving with us to reflect the rate rise. And so I think we've done a good job of continuing to grow there and rotate out some of the higher cost segments like financial institutions and government and try to get more organic growth coming from corporates. And then particular areas that we haven't really fished for deposits in like commercial real estate, we are launching some new products like escrow deposit. So I think overall, we're really pleased that we're tracking to our own models in terms of how things are going. And the last thing I'll say is that we're also - even though we're paying up a little for these deposits, what we're doing with the funds in terms of the loan growth that we're funding is very attractive. So the areas that Brad just talked at Refi loans, the personal unsecured loans have very good yields. And so it continues to benefit us, these transactions at the margin, if you look at match funding of what's growing and the asset side what's growing on the deposit side, those were very accretive and they are accretive to our NIM and they are accretive to our ROTCE So with that why don't I pass it over to you John.
John Woods: Okay. Yes, just getting into the deposit beta part of it, so you asked about where we are on there? So on a cumulative basis through 3Q total deposit beta will be 17% and in quarter sequentially up 36% [ph] for the third quarter. We would see that coming down a bit in the fourth quarter, in part due to the fact the Fed going to take a quarter off and give here in the third quarter. And also just give us some breathing room to allow the deposit initiative to really start to kick in. So on the consumer side, the investment that we're making in beta and analytics and really we're finding our promotional approach. And on the commercial side the investments that we're making in product offerings and targeting with respect to the segments that are more deposit rich. So that kind of optimization going on the deposit side, along with the where the macro coming out we will see the betas, in core betas come down there in 4Q.
John Pancari: Okay, John, thank you. That's helpful. Then separately on the credit side, I know you saw your order losses increase on a linked-quarter basis, and I know you pointed to seasonality there as well, but they are also up 14 basis points year-over-year. So can you just talk about what you're seeing there in terms of order losses and your outlook as we go forward? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Let me start perhaps and flip to you but, I would say on a linked-quarter there is partly seasonality. The other thing that we're seeing is a little bit of kick up related to our out of state, out of footprint state expansion initiatives that we commenced about two years ago. And I think there might have been a little adverse selection there in a couple of states. And so those linkages are having slightly higher loss rates in net earning [ph] is quite true. It's not anything that is significant. We have since when we decided that we're going to start to run down the size of the auto portfolio we've now exited in those states. And so it's limited to a fairly narrow period vintage wise but that's really I think the main thing that you're seeing there. Brad you want to add to that?
Brad Conner: You hit it. 2Q is seasonally low, that is the typical seasonally low period. So that explains the quarterly increase and to the point we've got very isolated, it was related to auto footprint 2016 vintages. We stopped those vintages right away. And the other thing I would just point out was we said for quite some time we've began to expand our credit from super prime to sort of mainstream prime. So we always expected a little bit of an increase and very much in line with what we expected and we have given some guidance on consumer losses a quarter plus ago.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, so not something that we're worried about. So tracking to what we expected.
Brad Conner: Tracking to what we expected exactly.
John Pancari: Okay and that auto footprint stuff, that should be - that adds to the [ph] year-over-year pressure?
Bruce Van Saun: I'm sorry you broke up there.
John Pancari: The year-over-year increase in auto losses that's mainly coming from the auto footprint stuff?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, I think it's the two, it's the auto footprint plus the starting - when we've started to mixing more prime in with the super prime correct.
John Pancari: Got it, and the size of that auto footprint?
Bruce Van Saun: It's relatively small, and it's quite small on an overall basis. The vintage we're seeing the stress in we stopped originating in that, that's [Multiple Speakers] we spotted. So it'll be an immaterial piece of the portfolio.
John Pancari: Got it, okay, thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Brian Klock of Keefe Bruyette & Woods. Your line is open.
Brian Klock: Hey good morning gentlemen. So congratulations first on hitting the 10% return on common equity target. And then I'll start with the good momentum you guys have had in the commercial bank and with the sort of retooling there. A lot of your peers haven't posted positive C&I growth. So if you can talk about what you're seeing there, what's helping contribute to your better than peer growth in the commercial book?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, let me start and flip to Don, but I think there's a couple of things one is that we continued to add great coverage bankers as we've expanded geographically, brought in some really excellent bankers from some of our regional peers, to head up those efforts. And so as they build out their teams it's natural that we're going to gain market share, and as they bring some of their relationships over to citizens. We added a new Head of Healthcare industry vertical as well. So really part of it is just we're playing offence, we're trying to expand the overall customer base and that's allowing us to grow. The other thing I'd say is that we've just focused on pockets where we do expect that there should be relatively more growth. So some of the mid-corporate bigger sized companies historically we were a little bit under scale there. We were focused more on the middle market. I think if you go back or maybe the four years I've been here, we've taken the middle market customer count from say 2000 to close to 2500 but the mid-corporate companies with revenues from $500 to $2.5 billion we've taken that from 450 to 750, and those tend to be bigger credits overall. So we've seen some nice growth there. So that's really I think reflective of the growth investments that we're making and then the focus that we have on particular industries and companies. Don?
Don McCree: I think that's right, the discipline around client planning and market planning is at a totally different level than it was a few years ago so that is presenting a little bit of a tailwind to us. And I think in addition to the bankers that we've hired, we vastly improved our product capability. So the relevance that we're going to market with across the trading rooms, across the capital markets, across M&A now it's resonating with the client. We're still a relatively mid-sized bank, but we have world class players in our sweet spot which is the middle market in the low end of the larger companies. We've just got great bankers out in front of these clients and it's terrific traction. So we're very pleased with the progress we've made and as Bruce said, we've added probably 40 bankers in our expansion markets over the last quarter and half and they're from really strong local banks SunTrust and U.S. bank and JP Morgan and in the various markets and they bring clients with them and we're already winning business because of their relationships so it's very encouraging.
Brian Klock: And thanks for the color and just a follow-up on the consumer side, you mentioned earlier Bruce, the good growth from the investments you've made there and obviously the education book is growing pretty well, very strong, if maybe you can, you or Brad can kind of give us the break out in that education book of how much is come from your core refinance product the in-school and your relationship with SoFi.
Bruce Van Saun: I'll steer that directly to Brad.
Brad Conner: Yeah. So there was couple of events of that but if you - let me answer from the standpoint of originations in the third quarter. So the third quarter originations about 10% of our student originations came from purchasing SoFi loans, about 60% of our work came from the - 55% are so came from our own organic originations and then the remainder from are Ed Refi, yeah, I'm in the remainder from the in-school product. So it's about 90% of our block was - in the third quarter was organic originations.
Brian Klock: Perfect, thanks for your time guys.
Bruce Van Saun: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Ken Zerbe: Great, thanks. Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi.
Ken Zerbe: In terms of - let's assume that the market - or we don't get the very hikes that the market expects, right, if we look at just simply the remixing of your assets into a higher yielding asset classes, but also so that I'm assuming a natural upward pricing and deposit, betas around deposit cost, can you get NIM expansion just from those two pieces without higher rates?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. I think enough for two Ken, but I think if you look at the year-on-year growth in the NIM of 21 basis points, about half of that was self-help, and then the other half was really due to rates, if rates didn't move higher I think you would have the less pressure on your deposit cost for sure. So I'm not sure you'd be getting the squeeze there, it would be the - what we saw when we were lower for longer, there is an opportunity cost of the asset sensitive position in no rate hikes, but there is general stability in that environment. So it puts the onus back on us to keep remixing and being disciplined on pricing and some other things we've talked about earlier in the call around balance sheet optimization which I think can still help us get some NIM less, so John you want to add to that?
John Woods: Yeah. Well, said, I think the one way to think about is that we're still on a business ex perspective about, call it 15 basis points below the median of the normally situated [ph] peers. And so without rates moving, we feel like we're in the - we've made a lot of progress on balance sheet optimization. We feel like we can make a big dent in quality, just like we're doing on the profitability side, top of the house in ROTCE. We're going to be closing the gap on the NIM side as well. And that doesn't depend on rate, given what you heard Bruce, in terms of the mix shift alone drove about half of our benefits year-over-year.
Ken Zerbe: All right. Great. And just staying with the deposit side - sorry the funding side, I saw you used some cash to pay down a bit of FHLB this quarter. Are you done with most of sort of the restructuring of the deposit side, such that we are at a good point between wholesale borrowings and core deposits, or is there more to go?
John Woods: Yeah. I think we're [indiscernible], if you look at - I think we're in the neighborhood of 14 million [ph] or so of borrowings. That should be about stable going forward. We think about that in terms of generally wholesale borrowings funding portfolio. So we look at the whole balance sheet. We're in kind of at right spot. And so what we expect to see big changes in that going forward.
Ken Zerbe: Great, thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter, Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.
Peter Winter: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi.
Peter Winter: On the fee income side, the outlook for the fourth quarter is kind of stable. I'm just looking out in 2018, where you see some of the biggest opportunities on the fee income side? And then secondly any thought about fee income acquisitions to enhance some of that growth?
Bruce Van Saun: I'll start as usual and then maybe flip to John for some additional color. But I think the positioning we have on the commercial side is quite strong across everything we're doing. So our capital markets capability, the purchase of M&A capabilities with Western Reserve and integration and ability to start creating more leverage and more flow opportunities for them. And I think we have opportunities to just to continue to expand capabilities pushing to things like securitization and some other initiatives that we have. So everything of the capital markets platform provided that the market conditions stay favorable, I think we can continue to see growth there. I do think on the global markets which is our FX and interest rate risk management platform that we are still scratching the surface. We used to be on RBS' platforms, we've migrated to our own platforms. We I think have a much broader capability in terms of product. And then also we've up tiered the quality of our team. So we have I think more intellectual capital and ability to show good ideas to our customer base. So I'd see nice upside there. And then on our cash management business, we've also upscaled our capabilities. We're working through a replatforming of the business that will, I think, put us right up there with the top sized banks in terms of capabilities. And that will be implemented late in 2018. So I see some potential some momentum there. So I'm feeling good about what we've accomplished so far in commercial and I think we're positioned for further growth. On the consumer side, it's been a little tougher slotting. One of the things we've invested heavily is our wealth management capability. We see really lots of potential there, untapped opportunity. And I think we're have the business positioned very well to start to gain further traction to have that show up in the numbers. I think at this point we're kind of expanding the relationships that we have inside the branch business, but we're moving more towards the mix of managed money as opposed to what we did historically, which was more transaction based sales and annuity type products. I think that's great for customers and it's great for us in the long-term, but it creates a near term revenue headwind which the lines haven't really crossed yet. So we've been building up our managed money book. That's creating I think more of an annuity type revenue stream going forward, but that's resulted in the business being somewhat flattish over the past six quarters or so. I expect we'll start to see that breakout and we should see growth there in 2018. And then the mortgage business has been - we've done some very good things and putting a good foundation in place. Our servicing and fulfillment capabilities are amongst the best rated by JD Powers consistently and that wasn't the case the couple of years ago. But we still have to, I think hone the model to get more conforming loan officers that are better integrated into the branches and build some additional capabilities direct to consumer potentially enter into the correspondent business. So there is more work to do there, but ultimately there will be revenue upside there as we get that right. So that's kind of a long winded answer. I don't know if there any additional color John that you want to add to that?
John Woods: I think you hit it. We're making investments across these four or five businesses, and I think that capital markets we have seen some breakout. But I don't think we call any of these businesses fully insured [ph], and so I think that's the forward-looking view on [indiscernible] going forward.
Bruce Van Saun: Anything from Don or --?
Don McCree: No, I think you've covered it.
Brad Conner: The only thing I would add is that I think on the mortgage side in terms of the opportunity to continue to grow speed, bring more scale, we talked about possibly getting into the corresponding business, maybe acquisition and then getting more scale and a very good servicing operation that we have is a real opportunity for us.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, great. And then the last part you said potentially more acquisitions, I think yeah. I think we will look to do smart bolt on acquisitions potentially in the areas that we just talked about, if it can get us farther down the track faster I like to say. So like with the M&A boutique, Western Reserve that we did in 2017 they took us from roughly six M&A bankers to 36 M&A bankers which given the size client base we have is where we need to be. We potentially still can scale up I think and serve our customers well. But if there is things we find in wealth or capital markets or the payments space that make sense to us, we're going to start having the periscope out and start to look at things. But again I think there will be very digestible from a size standpoint. They won't knock us off our game in terms of capital return. And so I think they will just be things that we feel make sense. They're down the fairway, they fit and they can help address the need to get up that fee percentage and do more for our customer base.
Peter Winter: Great. Thanks a lot, great color. Thank you.
Bruce Van Saun: Sure.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Vivek Juneja: Thanks. Hi Bruce, hi John. Question on your consumer loans, loans to - for financing iPhones and Vivint [ph] et cetera. Can you give some color on how that's doing, it seems like we could need to see growth there which - off those products, are you seeing more of it? And also some color on the credit performance you've seen since you've started this several quarters ago now.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, I'll take that. And we're very pleased with the programs. Continue to go very well in both the Apple program and Vivint program are growing for us. They've been very good partners. We do have other similar type of retailers and merchants coming to us asking us to work with them on building programs for them. So we certainly think that there is upside. The credit performance has been very good and in line with our expectations and I'll just throw out a reminder that all the programs that we've entered into up until now have a degree of risk sharing. So that even makes the credit performance more stable on those programs. So all in all, we're very bullish on that as a business opportunity.
Vivek Juneja: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.
Geoffrey Elliott: Hello, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. First, just a little clarification, on the NIM outlook the broadly stable, is the base for that the 3.05 or is the base 3.05 excluding the clash loan recovery, so 3.03?
Bruce Van Saun: That's the 3.05.
Geoffrey Elliott: Great, thanks. And then I remember back at the time of the IPO you had the midterm 10% ROTCE target. And then you've also had a longer term target and I think you had some charts pointing to something more in the 12% range for that. I guess the question will be you've got to the 10% this quarter, how long do you think long-term is now?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, I think the 10% we've build those is our medium term IPO base targets. And I think what we have said all along is let us achieve those targets before we raise the bar. It feels great to work hard and execute well and hit those targets. And think we will as we work on our budget for next year and freshen our strategic plan, you could expect us at some point next year to give you some additional targets that would be higher than where we are today. So I said in my opening remarks that I do think, what's gotten us this far, what's taken us from 4 to 10 is still pretty much the crux of how we want to operate the business. We want to be disciplined on expenses to try to find efficiencies. So we confirmed our growth and investments. We have a very strong capital position, so we can continue to grow the balance sheet and bring new customers to the bank. We're investing in the fee businesses and we should start to see increasing traction through deeper customer relationships. So everything that's taken us from 4 to 10 should be able to continue to propel us higher as long as we stay really disciplined and execute really well. So stay tuned and we'll I think have a comparable set of targets that we would move higher and that will be sometime in 2018 we'll reveal that.
Geoffrey Elliott: Great. Thanks very much.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. But just on the tax rate, what should we think about for 2018? Obviously some noise in the fourth quarter that you've alluded to, but what's a good run-rate? I know there been some efforts at the top to lower that in general?
Bruce Van Saun: I would say I'll start and John, if you want to add color, but if you look at the underlying rate for the year take out the noise of some recoveries in Q1 and historical credit matter in Q4, we're about 32 in a quarter, there is a constant tension between the growth in net income that we have and then the planning that we can actually do to knock the rate down from what statutory rates are. So we will continue to work through that, and we'll give you guidance on that in January when we have our year-end call, and give our outlook for 2018. But those are really the dynamics. We have income growth which comes through at a higher fully effective rate, and then we have to figure out plans like low income housing and other federal credit programs, that we invest and we continue to lock the rating around 32 which is where it is now. Obviously the wild card in all this is the corporate tax reform and we will be a big beneficiary of that staying at 32% rate. Clearly would increase our after tax cash flow and our EPS and ROTCE and all those measures by a significant amount. So certainly I think there is broader benefits to the economy from getting a tax reform and tax cut package in place, but there is specific benefits to regional banks and to us in particular even our high tax rate. And that also may knock out some of the program. So right now I think the scuttlebutt is that low income housing would be continued, but many of the other programs around energy, around historical tax credits, the broad range will be up and they will be grandfathered but you won't be able to continue with some of those programs but there will really be less need to do those kind of investments if the rate is lower in the first place. So, John, anything to add on that?
John Woods: Yes, just to add that so our tax rate being in the neighborhood of 32%, the attention that we have indicated [ph]. I think part of reason for that is that we are under penetrated in tax advantaged investments and the text credit opportunities that many of our peers have availed themselves over many, many years. So we got started as a little bit latter and we are catching up and we will catch up overtime and continue to invest in those programs. So but you'll see that that offset our earnings growth being offset by a ramp on catching up to the pack in the tax exempt area.
Matt O'Connor: Okay. It's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Due to time constrains, we will turn the call back over to Mr. Van Saun at this time.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Actually we could go, if there is a few more people in the queue, we can take up two or three more, Justin.
Operator: Sure, we do have some questions here in queue for you. Next we'll go to line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Your line is open.
Marty Mosby: Thank you, well saved by the bell there. I want to ask you about when you look at the increase in your loan yields, 75 basis points increase or 75 basis points increase in the fed fund rate, so again almost a 100% beta on your asset side. Now some of that's related to just being asset sensitive and some that's related to the balance sheet optimization. But there is a strategic decision ahead of the company which is, when do you begin to think about neutralizing some of your asset sensitivity. So just wanted to get a feel for how you're thinking about and tackling that strategic decision that's in front of you?
Bruce Van Saun: All right, so what we've seen overtime is that we managed that, in let's just talk about the gradual rate rise scenario up 200. We've been in that 6% to 7% benefit position from that scenario. That's overtime come down to around 5.5% and it happens naturally just as rates start to rise - we start to roll down. I still think that, that positioning to stay asset sensitive, as we are in the early part of the rate list cycle is a sensible place to be, because we have a coil spring that releases, and every time the fed continues to move, and rates continue to go higher. And I don't think that cycle is through yet. So we'll stay asset sensitive, we'll glide down and that's how we are planning to manage it. I think it's too early to go upon a big hedge and try to capture the additional income because I think you give up a fair amount of your upside. John, anything you want to add?
John Woods: No I think you hit it well, nothing I would add.
Marty Mosby: And then you mentioned your loan to deposit ratio is one of the things you're really guiding towards, is that because you feel like that is a constraint in liquidity or do you look at more the liquidity coverage ratio as the way you're managing liquidity on a tactical basis?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah I think you hit it there. I mean we started to build liquidity coverage ratio as basically how we look at those, and I think that's a much more sensitive measurement of what our liquid asset position is versus what deposit outflows could be in [indiscernible]. So it's a much more reliable measure and we have a strong LCR ratio. Year over year it's more of an output of that, but nevertheless it is a helpful measure to report and easy to calculate, it's right off the balance sheet. So we look at both, but the primary measure really is the LCR.
Marty Mosby: So no reason to think there's any constraints from a liquidity standpoint in the near term?
John Woods: Well, no. We manage all of our resources as if there are constrained, right I mean so capital liquidity is better up, and we balance our liquidity, our sources against our opportunities on the asset side. And so we're seeing nice flows on the deposit side. We have 2% growth in deposits this quarter which is high end of peers. So we're feeling pretty good about our ability to fund our growth going forward.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah and the LCR is well above the minimums. So feeling quite good about where the liquidity and funding position sits today.
Marty Mosby: Perfect thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
Kevin Barker: Good morning. Could you talk about the credit performance that you're seeing within the student loan portfolio from the 10% originations from SOFI and the 55% organic and then also the in school product that you also mentioned?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah they're all performing extremely well. We monitor it very, very closely, as you would fully expect, we look at each and every little vintage, look at the emergence of the loss curves for each individual vintage, and each and every vintage of those portfolios is performing right in line with the expectation that we have, and in some cases better. So we don't see any stress in those portfolios. Keep in mind that we play very much in the super prime space as it relates to those products. So we have average FICOs in the 780 range or above for all of our originations. So these are very high credit quality loans and we're improving the credit quality with our cash flow of the borrowers with the refi products. So they're performing extremely well.
Kevin Barker: Okay and then a quick follow up on some of the deposit conversation, are you seeing deposit betas accelerate in certain markets more than others, specifically in the Northeast versus some of your Midwest branches?
Bruce Van Saun: Deposit betas, is there is geographical disparity in that?
Brad Conner: There is a little bit I mean we certainly see some competition, some difference in competition and in terms of what are the lean rates for money markets and CD, there is a geographic mix to that. But beyond that no measurable difference then in betas by geography.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah so nothing large scale today, as Brad mentioned. Maybe a bit more traffic in the CD area where we're seeing it, seeing some great [indiscernible], but not as much in money market. So our cost of funds impact is limited.
Kevin Barker: Thank you.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay Justin, we probably have time for one more.
Operator: Certainly, our last question comes from the line of David Eads of UBS. Your line is now open.
David Eads: Hello, thanks for taking the question. Going back to the balance sheet, there was a - about a little over half a billion dollar increase in the other loans held for sale category. Just curious is that agency mortgages or is that some other sort of loan portfolio that's being positioned for sale? And I guess kind of on the mortgage side you're talking about repositioning that business. Should we expect the amount to be held on a balance sheet, the pace of growth on the balance sheet to slow, or is that really, okay you're going to try to keep [ph] now that you see business growing about the same pace and just accelerating the pace?
John Woods: I'll try to jump in on that and others can add in. So in the other - what's held for sale is mortgage stuff but it's also loans that were pending syndication. So you'll see both of that driving the held for sale category and so they are both drivers, and we had flow in both of those areas that would increase to the health of those numbers at the end of September in particular the syndication volume that is yet to be pulled down. On the mortgage fronts, yeah, I mean I think we're looking to remix our off balance sheet leverage, if you will, and some non-conforming piece, but the non-conforming is still a good product for us. We're seeing good risk adjusted returns there, they drive customers in to the bank. Those customers are candidates for deposit products and maybe are actually existing customers of the bank that we're serving and they are also candidates for our other offerings. We are looking to drive both of those and the off balance sheet conforming piece won't come at the sacrifice of non-confirming piece.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay any color Brad or --?
Brad Conner: No, I think that John said it exactly right. We are looking to really just acceleration of the non-conforming piece.
David Eads: Right, thank you.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Well, why don't I just wrap up the call here by thanking you once again for dialing in today. We truly appreciate your interest. It's really gratifying to hit our milestones this quarter. We're going to continue to stay focused on the work in front of us, yet to come to build a great bank and to do even better. So thank you and have a great day.
Operator: That now concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-07-21 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is John; I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we'll conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor: Thanks so much, John, and good morning to everyone. We are really appreciating you joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Our Chairman and CEO Bruce Van Saun and our CFO John Woods are going to spend some time reviewing our second results. And then we'll going to open up the call for questions. We are really please to also have on the call today with us is Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking. And I'd like to remind everybody that in addition to our press release today, we've also provided presentation and financial supplement and these materials are available on investor.citizenbank.com. Of course, our comments today will include forward-looking statements and those are subject to risks and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K we filed today. We also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and in our earnings material. And with that, I am going to hand it over to you Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thanks Ellen. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us our call today. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong results as our momentum continues. We've got terrific leadership team and continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives. We are balancing our desire to build the great franchise for the long term with our need to deliver consistent financial progress near term. We are turning the corner so to speak from our turnaround phase to a new growth phase with a desire to become a top performing regional bank. I believe our customer spend for culture, our mindset of continues improvement and how we run the bank, and our commitment to excellence and key capability are the unique ingredients that will allow us to standout in a crowded banking landscape. As to current performance, the highlights of the quarter from my perspective include strong revenue growth, good expense discipline and positive operating leverage. Our fee based businesses continue to gain traction and our credit quality, our capital liquidity and funding position all remain excellent. Revenue growth was 10% year-on-year and operating leverage of 7.4% on an underlying basis before lease impairment impact. ROTCE at 9.6% is approaching 10% and our underlying efficiency ratio was 60.4%. John will take you through our outlook in a few minutes. But in short we continue to have a positive outlook and we believe there is a plenty of fuel left in the tank to propel the next leg of our journey. We announced our TOP IV program today which is now following a seasonally predictable pattern. We've assembled the series of revenue and expense initiative that we project will benefit pretax income by about $100 million by the end of 2018. These TOP programs have been pivotal in our ability to deliver consistently high levels of operating leverage, while also creating the capacity to invest in growing our franchise and our capability including some great progress that we are making in digital, data analytics and process automation. We've done a good job of analyzing how banking technology and consumer behaviors are changing and increasingly we are playing often and making investments that will strengthen us well into the future. We also announced the 29% increase in our quarterly dividend with CCAR approval for another 22% in early 2018. Combined with authorization for $850 million of share repurchases over the next 12 months of CCAR period, we aimed to deliver strong return of capital to our shareholders. Our CET1 ratio will continue to normalize back towards peer levels with time. So with that let me turn it over to our CFO, John Woods to take you through the numbers. John?
John Woods: Thanks Bruce. And good morning, everyone. Let's get started with our second quarter financials. We'll start on Slide 4. We generated net income of $318 million and diluted EPS of $0.63 per share. Our reported net income was relatively stable compared to first quarter which as a reminder included the benefit of approximately $23 million related to the settlement of certain state tax matters that contributed $0.04 EPS. On an underlying basis excluding the benefit, net income for the second quarter was up 7% and EPS was up 11% in each quarter. Year-over-year, net income was up 31% and EPS up 37% year-over-year. Our second quarter results included $26 million pre-tax charge related to impairment on aircraft lease assets primarily in our non-core portfolio which is in runoff mode reflecting a more recent continued decline in value of select category with aircraft. The impact of these impairment reduced noninterest income by $11 million and noninterest expense by $15 million. In order to better understand our underlying performance, we've prepared a supplemental schedule which backs this impairment out of PPNR and re-classes them as credit related cost. On this basis, our total credit related cost came in at $96 million, which was stable compared with the first quarter and up modestly year-over-year. On a reported basis, we delivered positive operating leverage of 5% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the lease impairment, our operating leverage was 7.4%, reflecting revenue growth of 10.1% and expense growth of 2.7%. Net interest income of $1.03 billion increased 2% in linked quarter driven by loan growth of 1%. And net interest margin increased 1 basis point in each quarter and 13 basis points year-over-year. We'll spend more time on the margin in a few minutes. Noninterest income of $370 million declined $9 million on a reported basis, but was up modestly before the impact of lease impairment. On a year-over-year basis, noninterest income was up 4% or 7% on an underlying basis. For the second quarter, on a reported basis our efficiency ratio came in at 61.9%, but this was impacted by the lease impairment. On an underlying basis, the efficiency ratio includes 132 basis points with 60.4% and 435 basis points year-over-year. We delivered second quarter ROTCE 9.6% which was relatively stable with first quarter but increased on 9% on an underlying basis and from 7.3% year-over-year. These strong results reflect continued execution of our strategic initiatives and our commitment to driving revenue growth while maintaining operating expense discipline. As you know, we are always looking to find ways to run the bank better and leverage the potential of our franchise. In a few minutes, I'll walk you through the next phase of our TOP program which will contribute further efficiencies and revenue opportunities for us, while funding investments to drive future growth. Taking a deeper look into NII and NIM on Slide 5 and 6. We continue to deliver strong balance sheet growth, which helped us drive a 2% increase in NII for the quarter. We grew average loan 1% linked quarter and 6% year-over-year, and I'll provide some additional detail on the growth in a few minutes including the impact of our balance sheet optimization effort. Net interest margin increased 1 basis point linked quarter and 13 basis points year-over-year which reflects a nice improvement in loan yields given the pickup in short rate and the benefit of our balance sheet optimization effort which are improving the mix of our portfolio for its higher return category. These benefits were partially offset by a 2 basis points drag try to increase securities premium amortization at the average 10 year yield decreased about 20 basis points linked quarter. We also saw an increase in funding cost this quarter. We issued $1.5 billion in senior debt in May given very attractive market conditions which was a bigger and earlier issuance than planned. Deposit costs were higher reflecting the rise in short rate and the impact of seasonally lower DDA balance. Note that we grew period and deposits by over 1% in the second quarter and spot LCR declined modestly to 96.6%. Turning to fees on Slide 7. Noninterest income was down 2% linked quarter including an $11 million impact from the lease impairment reported in other income. Excluding the impairment, linked quarter fees were up slightly driven by another record quarter and capital market due to continued momentum as we leverage the investments we made in talent and broadening our capability. Market continued to be strong in the second quarter which helped drive robust activity in loan syndication. We grew loan syndication fee 23% as we increased the number of lease or joint lease transaction by 34%. We also saw record mortgage banking fees which were up 30% reflecting higher origination volumes and loan sale gains. Linked quarter service charges up from a seasonally lower first quarter. Letter of credit and loan fees increased 7% driven by an increase in commercial loan prepayment fee. Most remaining fee categories were stable in quarter. On year-over-year basis, we delivered very good noninterest growth of $26 million, or 7% on an underlying basis. We are pleased by strong contribution provided from the capital market business given our expanding capability and from mortgage banking which benefited from higher production fee. We also saw momentum in card fee which reflected the benefit of revised contract terms for processing fee which commenced in the first quarter along with higher purchase volume. Turning to expenses on Slide 8. We saw $10 million increase in linked quarter expenses which include $50 million impact from the lease impairment reported in other expense. Before these charges, expenses were down $5 million, primarily due to a seasonal decrease in salaries and benefits. Occupancy costs were also slightly lower as cost associated with our branch rationalization effort and seasonal maintenance cost were higher in the first quarter. Outside services cost of $5 million higher as a result of an increase in consumer loan origination and servicing cost. Year-over-year expenses increased 4% including higher other expense driven by the $15 million in lease impairment but were up 3% excluding this charge. Salaries and benefit expenses were stable as the benefit of the change and the timing of incentive payment for the first quarter this year offset an increase in compensation and impact of strategic hiring. We continue to look for ways to self fund our growth initiative and are doing a good job of finding efficiencies and staying disciplined. Let's move on and discuss the balance sheet. On Slide 9, you can see we continue to grow our balance sheet and extend our NIM. Overall, we grew average loan 1% linked quarter and 6% year-over-year, driven by strength across most of our commercial business line and education, mortgage and unsecured retail on the consumer side. The growth in commercial loan is partially offset by the sale of $596 million of lower return in commercial loans and leases nearly end of the quarter associated with our balance sheet optimization initiative. Our period-end loan growth would have been 1.4% excluding the impact of the sale in line with our guidance. As I mentioned, NIM was up 1 basis point in the quarter and 13 basis points year-over-year. Our loan yields continue to improve given our balance sheet optimization effort along with continued discipline on pricing. It also benefited from higher LIBOR rate during the quarter. We were in well position to capitalize on the rising rate environment. With assets and security to a gradual rise in rate at 5.5% versus 6% last quarter. Our asset sensitivity is naturally moderated given the rise in the environment. On Pages 10 and 11, we provide more detail on the loan growth in consumer and commercial. In consumer, 7% average year-over-year growth is led by continued strength in the residential mortgage, education and other unsecured retail loan which continues to be driven by our product financing partnership and a personal unsecured product. We are also seeing ongoing benefits from our focus on enhancing our portfolio mix by driving growth in higher return category. As I mentioned in the last call, we are slowing growth in auto and that should continue in the second half of the year. As a result of these efforts, in addition to higher rate, we've expanded consumer portfolio yield by 12 basis points in the quarter and 30 basis points year-over-year. We also nice growth in commercial with average loan increasing 6% year-over-year, where we continue to execute well in commercial real estate, mid corporate and middle market, industrial vertical and franchise finance. The increasing rate and enhanced vigor around five portfolio returns had helped drive the 16 basis points improvement in linked quarter and 52 basis points increase year-over-year. On Page 12, looking at the funding side. We saw a 7 basis points increase in our total funding cost, driven by an increase in deposit cost which included the impact of seasonally lower DDA and the impact of $1.5 billion senior debt issuance. Year-over-year, our cost of fund was up 14 basis points reflecting a continued shift to greater long-term funding along with the impact of higher rate. This compares with asset yield expansion of 27 basis points. Next, let's move to Slide 13 and cover credit. Overall credit quality continues to be excellent reflecting the continued mix shift towards high quality, lower risk retail loans. Compared with the growth in the larger company segment of our commercial book. The nonperforming loan this year decreased 3 basis points to 94 basis points of loan and improved from 101 basis points a year ago. The net charge-off rate decreased to 28 basis points from 33 basis points in 1Q. Retail net charge-off increased modestly from the first quarter while our commercial net charge-off was lower by $5 million. Provision for credit losses of $70 million was $5 million less than charge-off. This was the decrease of $26 million from first quarter level. However, including the lease impairment, total credit related cost was stable at $96 million. As we increase the mix of higher quality retail portfolios in our overall loan book, our allowance to total loans and leases has come in at 1.12% while the NPL coverage ratio has been relatively stable at 119%. This also reflects continued run off the in non-core portfolio. On Slide 14, you can see that we continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity position. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.2%. This quarter as part of our 2016 CCAR plan, we repurchased 3.7 million shares and return over $200 million to shareholders including dividend. It's also worth noting the total amount returned to shareholders in the 2016 CCAR window was $957 million including dividend. As you know, we received the non objection to our 2017 CCAR capital plan which includes up to $850 million in share repurchases. We announced an increase in our dividend today by 29% to $0.18 a share. And we also have the ability to increase the quarterly dividend again to $0.22 per share in early 2018. On Slide 15, we show the benefit from executing against our strategic initiative. We are intensely focused on developing strong customer relationship and growing the franchise in a profitable and sustainable way. In a consumer business, we are committed to building strong relationship with our customers and through our talent advice and product strategies along with enhancing our distribution network and digital offering. These investments are well aligned with our wealth effort, as we also continue to enhance our advisory capabilities and build out a Mass Affluent and Affluent guiding proposition. We continue to drive attractive loan growth across the number of areas such as in our education refinance loan product which has attractive risk adjusted return. As we optimize the balance sheet, we continue to reduce the auto portfolio in order enhance return. In wealth, we saw nice life in fees year-over-year with total investment sales up 14% linked quarter and 27% year-over-year. We continue to make progress on a year-over-year basis and shifting the mix of sale towards more fee based business which came in at 38%, up from 20% in Q2, 2016. In addition, our FC headcount is up 12% year-over-year, which is contributing towards the scaling of the business. And in mortgage, we continue to make progress including a secondary origination which was up 14% year-on-year, an increased as a percentage of total origination from 33% to 38%. In commercial, our expanded capabilities helped deliver another record quarter in capital market. As we continued to leverage the investment we've made in broadening our capability. Treasury solution is on the right track with fee income growth up 8% year-over-year, and strong momentum in our commercial card program. Mid-corporate and middle market benefited from our initiatives to deepen customer relationship with loan balances increasing 4% and deposit up 11% year-over-year. We've seen strong balance sheet growth in our expansion market and more modest growth in established markets. Moving on to Slide 16. With TOP III event have successfully delivered efficiency that have allowed us to self funding investment to improve our platform and products offering. In 2016, our TOP II program delivered $105 million in annual pretax benefit across our revenue and expense initiative. We've largely completed the actions needed for the TOP III program which launched in mid 2016 and is expected to deliver run rate benefit of approximately $110 million by the end of 2017. Slide 17 has the details on our TOP IV program which is a further example of our commitment to continue improvement and delivering value to our shareholders. Through a combination of initiatives to enhance revenues and realize efficiencies, we are targeting a run rate pretax benefit of $90 million $105 million in 2018. On the revenue side, we are focused on building new channels primarily to enhancing our digital capabilities and building out our direct to consumer mortgage program and leveraging our call centre to offer solutions to our customers. We also plan to add corporate partnership and installment lending expand C&I lending in the Southeast and to expand our commercial real estate offering. We'll also continue to build out our fee generation capabilities in the mortgage business and securitization capabilities for third commercial client. On the efficiency side, we'll continue to focus on simplifying our organization, leveraging centers of excellence and rationalizing roles and responsibilities for that bank. We'll take a hard look at reengineering key processes to leverage automation and become more efficient. We'll optimize our technology infrastructure and streamline our network support. Our management team is committed to realizing the full benefits of our TOP program to serve our customers better make the company stronger and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. On Slide 18, you can see the steady and impressive progress we are making against their financial target. Since 3Q, 2013 our ROTCE has improved from 4.3% to 9.6%. Our efficiency ratio has improved by 6 percentage point over that same timeframe from 68% to 61.9%, or by 8 percentage point to 60.4% on an underlying basis. And EPS continued on a very strong trajectory of wealth more than doubling the $0.63 from $0.26. The rate of growth and improvement continue to outperform peers over the period. That we realize we still have worked to do. Let's turn to our third quarter outlook on Slide 19. We expect to produce linked quarter average loan growth of around 1%. We also expect net interest margin to continue to expand by about 3 basis points linked quarter given continued improvement in our earnings asset yield and improved funding mix. We continue to project full year loan growth to be with in the 5.5% to 7% full year guidance range. In noninterest income, we are expecting to see a modest decrease given seasonal factors such as a strong second quarter result in capital market. We expect expenses to increase slightly in the third quarter with a relatively stable efficiency ratio. Additionally, we expect provision expense to be higher in a likely range of $85 million to $95 million, a modest increase in net charge-off. And finally, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to around 11% and expect the average LDR to be around 98%. With regard to the full year 2017 outlook. We expect to come in above the high end of the range for NII and operating leverage. And below the range on provision and within the range for loan growth. So with that let me turn it back to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Well, thanks John. On Slide 20, we've included our updated vision, plan and credo statement. We are turning the corner, moving out of our turnaround phase and shifting gears to focus on what it takes to be a truly top performing bank. The key to sustainable success is to stay focused on our customers and colleagues to bring out their best. On Slide 21, we layout what would distinguish us in a crowded banking landscape. A strong culture focused on the customer, our commitment to financial discipline and achieving excellent capabilities in key areas. And on Slide 22, we make the case that there is plenty of fuel left in a tank to propel our ROTCE higher. The same levers that propelled us from roughly 4% ROTCE to 10% are still in place. And our management has a proven track record of execution. To sum up, on Slide 23, our strong results this quarter demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategic initiatives and continue to improve how we run the bank to drive underlying revenue growth and carefully manage our expense base. Our outlook remains positive as we work to becoming a top performing regional bank. So with that John let's open it up and we'll take some questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America, Merril Lynch. Please go ahead.
Erika Najarian: Yes. Thank you for taking my call. Good morning. My first question is on future capital return. Clearly the announcement out of the 2017 CCAR was very strong. And you have stronger loan growth than peers. That being said, the 11% target for the end of third quarter on CET1 seems robust still relatively to your risk profile and size. And I am wondering as we look further out over the next two or three years. Should we expect on your capital total payout into grow and Bruce may be give some insight on how you are thinking about dividend versus buyback in future CCAR?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Sure. So what we've been progressing through time since separation from RBS is what I referred to as a glide path of normalizing our capital ratios. And this year we gave guidance range that we likely ended 10.7 to 10.9 down from roughly 11.2 when the year started. I still think we will achieve that so we are on track to come in within that range. And I think we can continue to follow a glide path down in subsequent CCAR in the second half of this CCAR cycle i.e. the first half of 2018 and then in future CCAR cycle. So our view is that we so far have been a bit prudent as a new company, keep a little bit of capital buffer, give us flexibility to both grow loan and return good level of capital to shareholders. And we can continue to do that into another cycle or two. There is no reason at the end of the day that our -- we should have to sustain that buffer or loss profile, credit loss profile were below the median versus peers. So I think we have a good level of discipline and risk appetite and we certainly can manage down towards the median level of peers. And I think what you are hearing from peers is they'd all like to be lower as well. So we are following them down. And if they continue to move down and we can continue to move even further. So with respect to dividend versus capital, I think we have always viewed it's important to have a good dividend on the stock and have a good yield and now that the Fed appears to have no longer a bright line at 30% payout ratios, we are start moving ahead of that and I think we have confidence in our earnings trajectory that we can continue to raise that dividend and raise it at a good clip and be able to sustain that dividend and take it even higher. So that's really important to us. We also will continue to repurchase shares. I think $850 million is up meaningfully from what we repurchase last year. So as earnings grow and our capital generation grows, it gives us the flexibility to kind of have our cake and eat it too. We can raise the dividend, we can buyback stock and we can grow loans. I don't know John if you want to add anything for that.
John Woods: No. I just think that with respect to the buyback I think we are feeling very strong about that outlook. And I think one thing we are trying to do is the balance our opportunities to deploy capital internally against returning that to shareholders. And I think we'll have to do that -- to do that going forward.
Erika Najarian: Thank you. That was clear. Just as follow up question. Given your more robust loan growth prospects than peers and you also mentioned in your TOP IV initiative, expanding commercial lending in the Southeast. In line of 97% LDR how should we think about your deposit gathering strategies from here? Really how should we think about pricing from here in terms of trying to and keep up the pace of loan growth and deposit growth. And whether or not buying deposit further down the line is part of the plan.
Bruce Van Saun: I'll start and John you can -- but I think we've done a good job of sustaining good deposit growth that's kept pace with the loan growth. So obviously when we sold the Chicago franchise we took the LDR from roughly 93 up to 98 now basically we've been on treadmill where when we grow loans we grow deposits at similar clip. Where we've focused has been on the commercial side where when RBS ran into difficulty and we ran a balance sheet down, we ran off a lot of the commercial deposit base. So we've been now on a mission to go out and get the operating count and grow interest bearing deposit from the commercial side. I am pleased to see that this quarter, by quarter end of spot basis their LDR low on 60. It had been its higher 250 at one point. So I think there are still more room to run in terms of leveling that out and maybe ultimately getting that commercial LDR in 140 to 150 ranges which I think is probably where peers are. So we had that going on the consumer side, continuing to focus on better tools, better data analytics into customers so we can make more tailored offers and we can bring in incremental fund that our customers have away from us but we like to bring onboard into the bank and I think we can find ways to do that cost effectively without raising the overall cost of our back book. So those are some of the initiatives that will continue but I think we've demonstrated a good track record of being able to manage in a basis of kind of high 90s, 97 to 99. I think over time we like to bring that down a bit maybe 95 to 97. But we are very comfortable with where we are. Our LDR is really, really strong so the fact that we have so many consumer deposits and we termed out a lot of our wholesale borrowing with the senior debt issuance and terming out some our FHLB advances. We have a very strong overall funding profile. John, you want to add to that.
John Woods: Yes. Just, well, I think the growths in our deposit are tracking in line with our expectations. We are optimizing our balance sheet across businesses, targeting higher value customer segment and looking at longer-term growth in the checking and cash management businesses. And on that last two on the commercial side where we are seeing some growth. We are making investments in our technology replatforming, and we think that's going to pay us nice growth in the deposit side going forward. And one other point, we've been able to deploy these deposits with very attractive returns. And that's double digit well above capital and so we are feeling very good about where these deposits are getting deployed given, unique opportunities on the asset side.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And just to your last point, Erika, I don't think we are in the market or in the hunt to go out and buy deposits. I think we think we can grow -- we probably look at digital strategy to gain some additional deposits before we go out and actually go purchase deposits.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit on the outlook for about 3 basis points increase in the NIM. On the one hand it's little bit better than I think, most peers are playing to but it's also coming off of a second quarter NIM that was up only 1 basis point. And obviously you are one of the more asset sensitive bank and I think in prepared remarks you mentioned there is an increased drive from the bond premium amortization -- gather if you look at the two quarter progression of NIM, I guess I would have thought to maybe all the more expansion given the positioning of your balance sheet.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Maybe I'll start briefly and then John, I know you can handle this one. But I'd say is there were some idiosyncratic factors in Q2 that needed the increase that we expected to see. The first one was that not only did we not get parallel shift when the Fed move which can dampen the full benefit of your position. Your asset sensitive position. We actually saw a flattener so the 10 year on average was down 20 basis points during the quarter. So that was a drag that was not anticipated. And that creates the securities premium amortization and that roughly had 2 basis points impact on the NIM. And John you can talk about third quarter but in brief we would not expect to see the 10 year move dramatically. It will be ranged down so we are not relying on a rebound in order to get the 3 basis points lift. So the hit happened in Q2. Does that show you upside beyond the 3 basis points in Q3 if you saw a reflation back end of the curve just to be clear on that point. The other thing that was idiosyncratic to us was that we went out and issued $1.5 billion in senior debt and we had anticipated an issuance size of about half of that but as you are seeing it's been very conducive in the market when rates come down to go and issue and lock in spreads in attractive financing term. So we upsize and we went earlier than we had anticipated which I think is a right thing to do. Again, it's locks and it was a bit opportunistic and but it locks in a very good piece of debt in our funding structure that will benefit us many quarters into the future. So we can take a basis point there on the chin for being opportunistic. And you should feel fine about that. So that will not recur in Q3 either. So that's why when you look at the things that hit us a little bit in Q2, we would not expect to see those things hit us in Q3. And we should get the full quarterly run rate benefit of the Fed hike which came relatively late in the second quarter. John, over to you.
John Woods: Yes. So, I think you covered it. Bruce, I'd just say reiterate the point of -- the two points were related, security premium amortization we had a both the 5 year and the 10 year were down, cost of 20 basis point quarter-over-quarter. And that led to a desired effect on data offering. So as you mentioned, those are the latest. So when you look at out the 3Q, couple of points I made there. I think you made the point that we are not relying on increases in the 5 and 10 years in order to support that outlook. So I think that's important to note. We are just indicating that the absence of that drag we are expecting even now we think more of range bound view. And the other point I hasten to add is loan yield are expected to expand similar to the second quarter. We had strong loan yield expansion in the first and second quarter. We are expecting to see that in the third quarter. The June hike of course we'll see that fully layered itself in the C&I book, but I'd mention the fact we are going to see the full quarter effect of the March hike on our large HELOC portfolio. And some of you may know we only get two months of benefit in the second quarter with that portfolio. And we are going to full three months in third quarter. So those are the leases that I highlighted. We feel good about our guidance which we give.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ken Zerbe: Hi, thanks. I guess two questions in particular. One of your peers was BB&T, but they announced sort of that they had asked the Fed for an accelerated buyback earlier than sort of now over the average of the year. When you asked the Fed for approval to buyback shares, did you put in any kind of acceleration that more buyback could be done in the first half or did you spread it equally over the course of the year? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: We typically haven't called exactly how we've staged that, Ken, but generally speaking we've been pretty much averaging on that. We will take advantage of ASRs during the quarter to get a bump by taking those shares out day one of the quarter. So we've been doing that. If we want to accelerate we would have to make a new request to do that.
Ken Zerbe: Got it. Okay, that helps. And then second question just in terms of provision expense. Obviously, good quarter this quarter your guidance is better than what I was expecting for next quarter but when you look out first quarter next year, is the factors the underlying drivers of the improvement in credit quality, is it enough to keep provision expense/reserve release happening over the next several quarters or is there a point where provision does start to take up all things equal. Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Well, I think we are going into this year. We had a roughly, if my memory serves me 325 or 330 of charge-offs a provision last year and coming into this year. We took that up to potentially I think move it to down 425, 450 or something to 475. So our expectation was that as we continue to grow loans, we need to be building our provision and that the commercial business which had very, very low level of charge-offs would start to normalize. We called out today that we think for the year it will certainly be well below the next goal post of that range. You can see what we are tracking to. And I think the reason for that one is that commercial has still stayed relatively pristine. We don't see any material trouble spots or migration areas. You can always get hit with the so called scud missile. But we hope we don't see any of those. But in any case commercial outlook continues to be good. And then on the consumer side, there are kind of assets, the high quality assets that we are putting on in those portfolio continues to keep us in very good standing over there. And delinquencies look really good as well. So I'd say the trend -- our expectation would continue to be favorable and so it's not. Yes, we should start to see some gradual rebuilding of those levels over time. Stay tuned for the guidance for next year but in terms of this year, we are still pretty optimistic about both Q3 and then the Q4 outlook. I don't know if anybody here wants to try and --
Don McCree: It's Don. I think that's exactly right and we got a very good process now that we call to the portfolio and have a lot of early warning signal. So we can see out a few quarters in terms of general trends in the portfolio. And as we do continue to participating and grow in this market, we are staying -- we are trying to stay very disciplined from our new origination standpoint knowing markets are very aggressive right now.
Bruce Van Saun: And Brad you said, maybe you could comment, you had the runoff of some legacy core assets which is -- we are getting some recoveries there and that's helping. And it creates the room for you to grow some of your [Multiple Speakers]
Brad Conner: Exactly. And as you said, Bruce, the stability of the asset that we are putting on remains very good. Delinquency looks strong. We had given a little bit more detail guidance two months back about what our range or losses would look like over the next -- through the next year and half or so. And we remain very confident in the guidance that we gave there. All the trends remain right in line with what we talked about.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Gerard Cassidy: Thank you, good morning. First, you mentioned your desire to become a top performing bank and you gave us I think it was on slide 20, 21 some of the internal niche or cultural issues that you guys are focused on. Can you share with us what some of the financial metrics will be that you're looking at to be to achieve this top-performing status? And when do you think you might be able to reach a those metrics?
Bruce Van Saun: So I think it's a little premature Gerard to tell you what the next set of metrics are. I want to achieve the ones that we set out to achieve when we went on the IPO journey. We are getting damn close. So that feels quite good. But stay tuned. I think we will in due course be rating putting out the ROTCE target obviously efficiency ratio, ROA, those are the measure that investors look for. And I think as we've said we've plenty of fuel in the tank to continue to execute our strategy, what works for us going from 4 to roughly 10, should work for us going forward. And we should -- we have plenty of capital to put the work to grow the balance sheet, reduce the share count. I think we've been investing in the key businesses to broaden our capabilities and figure out how to deepen relationship with our customers, whether they are on the commercial side or consumer side. We are starting to see some benefits flow from those investments which have been great to see. And I think we have a real fanatical commitment to positive operating leverage in terms of trying to find ways to run this bank more efficiently and more effectively serving customers better at a lower cost point. And we will continue with that. So if we can continue to pull those levers I think it won't be too long before we'll be able to put out a new set of goal posts.
Gerard Cassidy: Very good. And then John, you mentioned on slide 29 I should say, you guys shows the interest rate sensitivity trend and you highlighted here that as rates go up, the asset sensitivity has naturally migrated to about 5.5%. As we look out over the next 12 months, where should we see that trend progress to?
John Woods: Yes. Your question, I mean we like where we are right now. I think that we plan to remain an asset sensitive bank and we plan to keep that upside potential and gas in the tank as you heard from Bruce earlier, there will be pressure over interest rate tightening cycle which is pretty natural. But like I said we will continue to have an outlook for exactly where that will be but we expect to maintain a strong asset sensitive positive over time and continue to participate in the upside on the rate tightening cycle.
Bruce Van Saun: And one thing you can note Gerard is that I think we were at about 6% and it had two hikes since then. And we've now are positioned at about 5.5% so the gradual rise to 200 rise scenario. So I think that will give you an indication that just naturally as we get deeper into the hike cycle that sensitivity start to fall. So we are not fighting that or just kind of letting that drift down but relative to peers we are still one of the more asset sensitive banks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.
John Pancari: Good morning. On the expense side, just given now that you've laid on the TOP IV program and on top of the progress you made on TOP III in all itself, wanted to see if you can give us some color on what that means for the positive operating leverage outlook. For when you look at 2018 and maybe another way to put it, what type of efficiency ratio could we expect for 2018 as this starts to get layered in? Just trying to get idea where we are going with this when it hits the numbers. Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. It's little early to give the 2018 guidance. I think what we've seen from these TOP programs historically is we are pushing that operating leverage to a 3% to 5% guidance range. I think if you went back a couple of years ago it was probably 2% to 4%. So it's helpful in that and continuing to sustain a good level of positive operating leverage. So I'd probably leave at there for now. We are not ready to give 2018 guidance but it's certainly helpful to enhance modestly and sustain the operating leverage outlook. And also creates funding capacity for us to reinvest in the businesses to go out and hire more corporate bankers and mortgage loan officers and wealth advisors and investing some great new technology offerings in digital and data analytics and things that we are doing. So it's incredibly helpful and I think what you've seen is that we don't just consume it with other expenses and investments. We've actually been able to be disciplined and let some of that flow through the bottom line and keep the positive operating leverage at close to the top of our peer group on a consistent basis.
John Pancari: Okay. All right. And then separately just on credit. I'm sorry if you provided some detail already but I know you mentioned that your trends are intact from a consumer side. More specifically in terms of the auto trends clearly we see the stress that the industry is going through and the severity implication of lower use car values and all that. Wanted to get your updated thoughts on how you are trending there on the lost -- I mean on the credit side within the auto book. And then separately also on credit. I know you mentioned what that your percentage of the lead arranger status you have with your shared national credit is up. What is that as a percentage of total share national credit books as of today? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: I'll let Brad go first and Don you can follow and John feel free to chime in.
Brad Conner: Yes. So on auto, let me roll back a little bit and remind that we did expand the credit of the -- to get the better risk adjusted yield or returns in auto. So we have seen the auto --
Bruce Van Saun: Your test really super prime and then we move into the prime.
Brad Conner: Exactly.
Bruce Van Saun: We are seeing that migration and I don't think anything out of bounds from what we --
Brad Conner: And exactly where I was going. We are seeing that migration. We are seeing a little bit of losses come off exactly the way we had projected and losses are moving right in line with what we had [Multiple Speakers]
Bruce Van Saun: It's important to note the foot side of that is higher yield on the book.
Brad Conner: Exactly, higher yield on the book. And so we look at the trend I mean certainly we are seeing a little bit of reduction in used car value but very much in line with what we had projected. We talked about that for last quarter in terms of making an adjustment to our provision for that expectation that's trending very much in line. In fact, what I'd say we saw this quarter a used car value stabilized. So that was good sign for us.
Bruce Van Saun: The other thing Brad that you might point out is many of the autos that we are financing are in favorable sub segments to the market.
Brad Conner: So we are highly concentrated in pickup trucks and SUVs which we've had-- which have performed better in terms of used car value and the projection of those asset car, those car classes are also better. So again I think I just go back to where we started which is we are very much in line with what our expectations were at the time that we priced the vintages, we were seeing the trend move very much in line with our expectation and really no areas of concern.
Bruce Van Saun: Great. Any color on that John?
John Woods: Yes. Just like I said risk adjustment returns by going into prime and quite attractive and we feel good about deploying the capital in that space and like that balance between the super prime and prime. So as Brad mentioned no surprises on that front.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Don on--
Don McCree: John, on the SNC book, I really don't think about in terms of what the lead position. I think the lead position; I'll have the exact numbers into 20% of range. If I had to guess across the overall SNC portfolio, but the important thing there is two things. One is on the origination side, and you are speaking the cap market space were climbing the lead table very nicely. So we are kind of top five and all of those in lead table from middle market origination which we are really pleased with that. And we are leading many more deals on the capital market side. Then in the overall SNC book, the real key to me is, are we earning an adequate return on each of those capital commitments. So we have a much disciplined process as we deploy capital, make sure we think we can cross sell and generate adequate returns on the capital deployment. And as Bruce and John mentioned, we are going back to the book as part of our optimization program exiting those credits where we are not good progress in terms of building broad relationships. And the important thing for me is, we just every quarter adding incremental capabilities to be able to service the clients and operate in a high quality way and the acquisition of Western Reserve this quarter is an important addition to the arsenal in terms of being able to provide high quality M&A advice.
Operator: And the next go to line of David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Eads: Hi, good morning. When we look at the loan growth outlook maybe if you just give a little color on what you are hearing in terms of customer demand. And I guess quickly on the commercial side. And then is the outlook you guys giving kind of expecting sort of the same dynamic where you have fairly steady growth both on the consumer and the commercial side.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I'll start and flip to John. But I said we are pretty consistent with outlook that we gave in Q2. So we had kind of 1.5% spot expectation which we hit if you exclude the late in a quarter loan sales. And partially that's a reflection of some of the uncertainty still down in Washington that we saw that boost in soft data after the election that people are hopeful that there is a Republican President and Congress and that we should be able to affect their pro growth agenda. And it's been a long time in coming. So that uncertainty I still think still keeps some of our customers on the commercial side a little reluctant to go full board. And really take down lines that they have or generate some new momentum in terms of capital expenditures or some acquisitions. So that's been I think the situation until it changes. And it looks like we'll go through Q3 in a similar position as what transpired in Q2. I think the consumer generally has been healthy and we sort out areas where little pockets where we can be distinctive and find some risk adjusted return areas like education refinance loans and personal unsecured or installment partnerships that we have with Apple that we expand now to Vivin and to HP. So I feel good that the balanced we've achieved with growth on the commercial side and the consumer side can continue but. Why don't I flip it to you both Don for some quick color.
Don McCree: Yes. I completely agree with that. We are seeing a lot of engagement with clients. But lot of is around refinancing. So the net new money demand is still pretty tepid out there. So I'd say about 50% of our growth is probably net new money and 50% of our growth is refinancing of other bank clients. So still -- we feel very good about what we are seeing in our origination pipeline. We like to see a boom in cash financed M&A but we are not seeing it yet. We are seeing private equity flow, really a lot of properties being passed back and forth between private equity firms. So that's not creating net new demand. But we are able to capture more than a fair share. I don't see any reason that's going to change. Part of our expansion effort into the Southeast and growing New York Metro and growing the Midwest where we've added a lot of bankers and new leadership in those markets will allow us to add net new client. That's what's going to drive the balance of our net new money growth as we guys look forward --
Bruce Van Saun: And we just brought new head of the healthcare industry in as well. Brad?
Brad Conner: I think he said pretty well but I mean on the small business side probably a very similar story to Don which is the demand is somewhat tepid but it's in that way for a while. Obviously, the mortgage refinance activity is down just for the rate environment. But in the other consumer areas it's been relatively stable and strong demand as you said we carved out some nice niches that seemed to have quite a bit of run rate to them and our view going forward is relatively similar position.
David Eads: Great. Thanks for the color. And just one on the securities book. I mean looks like the end to period balances were down a little less than a billion buck, the average was pretty much unchanged. Was there any kind of repositioning or anything going on there that we should be aware of going forward?
John Woods: No repositioning there, just a same approach that approach we look at that as a liquidity back stop and way to moderate our interest rate risk profile. And it drives where our LDR levels which are quite strong. So nothing to --
Bruce Van Saun: Or there maybe we were holding some money out when rates were lower in terms of the reinvestment and cash flow, would probably the only thing I'd highlight there.
Operator: There no further questions in the queue. And with that I'll turn it over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Well, thanks again everyone for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest. Again, we believe we are firing on cylinders. We will continue to focus on disciplined execution of our plan. Thank you and have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-04-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad, I'll be your operator on the call today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we'll conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor: Thanks so much, Brad, and good morning to all of you. We are really pleased that you joined us this morning. We are going to start things off with our Chairman and CEO Bruce Van Saun and our new CFO John Woods covering the highlights of our results and then we will open up the call for questions. Also joining us on the call today are Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking. Of course, I have to remind everyone that in addition to today's press release we have also provided presentation and financial supplement and you could find those at investor.citizensbank.com. And our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. And we provide information about the factors that may cause those results to differ materially from the expectations in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today. We also provide non-GAAP financial measures and information and reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and in our earnings material. And with that, I will hand it over to you Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call today. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong results, picking up where we left off in Q4 and well positioned to continue our momentum going forward. We are doing an excellent job of executing on our strategic initiatives, taking care of our customers and demonstrating a mindset of continuous improvement in how we are running the bank. The highlights of the quarter from my perspective includes strong loan and deposit growth, good net interest margin expansion, excellent results in our fee based businesses, and good control of expenses. Revenue growth was 12% year-on-year, positive operating leverage was 7%. This drove ROTCE higher reaching 9% after excluding a non-recurring tax benefit. Our efficiency ratio is now at 61.7% and NIM is at 2.96%. I’d like to recognize our commercial bankers for an exceptionally strong quarter. We’ve built great platform in capital markets and in our FX and interest rate management businesses and attracted first class talent. We also continued to up our game through an ongoing investment program in treasury solutions. Added great coverage bankers and our team approach to how we cover clients and provide tailored solution is really paying off. This quarter showed quality strength, and potential of each of these businesses. I am also pleased that our continuing ability to innovate. Our Apple partnership is going well and we’ve added two more partners and have a nice pipeline as well. We continue to access Fintech capabilities trough partnerships and we will roll out our robo advisory product to clients this quarter. And our ed refi loan products continue to address a real market need. We’ve stayed nimble on how and where we deploy our capital, with balanced and attractive loan growth in both consumer and commercial. Growth in consumer is expected to continue in mortgage, personal unsecured and student lending. We have ended our flow agreement with SCUSA on auto loans, part of an overall strategy to strengthen our auto loan book. We continue with our SoFi flow agreement on education refinance loans. We've been pleased with the results to date. And we remain focused in commercial on both borrowers and industry segments where we see growth and an ability to develop a meaningful relationship. At the risk of stealing John’s thunder, we working through a top 4 program and hope to have it ready by our Q2 earnings call to provide you with some details. I believe that this ability to consistently find ways to run to bank better and tap the potential of our franchise is a key differentiator of Citizens relative to our peers. So with that, let me turn it over to our new CFO, John Woods, to offer his first impressions and then take you through the numbers. John?
John Woods: Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to first say that I'm extremely pleased to have the opportunity to join Bruce and the Citizens team on the journey to build the top-performing bank. Since the IPO, Bruce and the team have made tremendous progress with great momentum coming in to 2017. Since my early days here at Citizens, I am taking on the leadership in three high-priority areas. First, balance sheet funding optimization; second, continuation of our top initiatives to grow the bottom line and self-fund strategic initiatives; and third, partnering with Don and Brad in driving fee revenue growth. We had some success in these areas and I hope to contribute to further enhancements going forward. I'm impressed by the quality of our leadership team and their clear understanding of our direction and what we're trying to achieve. In short, I'm excited about the opportunities that lie before us. So with that, let's jump into our first quarter financials which start on Slide 4. We’ve generated record net income of $320 million and diluted EPS of $0.61 per share. These results were up 13% and 11% linked quarter and up 43% and 49%, respectively, year-over-year. I’d like to remind you that we did benefit from approximately $23 million related to the settlement of certain state tax matters that lowered the tax rate by 5.2 percentage points and added $0.04 to EPS. Excluding the tax settlement impact, net income was up 33%, EPS was up 39% and the tax rate would have been 31.6%. Note also that under new accounting rules for equity compensation, we had a modest benefit in tax expense. This has been included in our first quarter and full year guidance. Operating leverage was positive linked quarter and year-over- year we generated positive operating leverage of 7% driven by revenue growth of 12%. Our net interest margin increased six basis points linked quarter and 10 basis points year-over-year. And we improved our efficiency ration 50 basis points from fourth quarter and roughly 4% year on year to 61.7%. These strong results reflect good execution of our strategic initiatives and our commitment to drive revenue growth while maintaining operating expense discipline. Our ROTCE of 9.7% improved 1.3% in the fourth quarter and 3.1% year-over-year. On an underlying basis, ROTCE of 9% was up 55 basis points linked quarter and 2.4 percentage points year-over-year. Taking a deeper look into NII and NIM on Slides 5 and 6, we continue to deliver strong balance sheet growth, which helped us to deliver a record $1 billion in NII. We grew average loans 1.5% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year and I will provide some additional color on the growth in a few minutes. Margin improved six basis points linked quarter and 10 basis points year-over-year, which reflects improving loan yields thanks for the pick-up in interest rates and the impact our balance sheet optimization efforts. These benefits were partially offset by higher deposit and funding costs. The deposit costs increase reflects growth in commercial deposits over the quarter, the impact of higher interest rates and mix shift in consumer to more term and time. Note that we grew period-end deposits by over 2% in Q1, which reduced the spot LDR to 97%. Turning to fees on Slide 7, linked quarter fees were up slightly as strong results in capital markets and card fees helped overcome some seasonal impact. Linked quarter service charges were slightly down, reflecting seasonality in day count. Card fees increased from revised contract terms commencing this quarter for core processing fees and a reduction in rewards expense. We had another record quarter in capital markets driven by loan syndications, bond underwriting and advisory fees. We saw $5 million increase in trust and investment services fees, thanks to higher investment sales volumes, as we've added wealth advisors and continue to invest significantly in our wealth platform. Foreign exchange and interest rate product fees were down modestly from strong fourth quarter levels, while mortgage banking fees were down from fourth quarter levels that included higher MSR valuations and higher origination volumes. On a year-over-year basis, we delivered outstanding non-interest income growth, which is up $49 million or 15%. The story is much the same as the biggest drivers of improvement came from capital markets, card fees and foreign exchange and interest rates products and income. Turning to expenses on Slide 8. We saw a slight increase in linked quarter expenses largely as a seasonal increase in salaries and benefits and occupancy was partially offset by lower insurance fraud and regulatory costs, Outside services and Equipment expenses. Compared to first quarter 2016, expenses increased 5%, but there is some noise in those numbers that I want to call out for you that elevates the growth in salaries and benefits and other expense lines. The biggest driver was an increase in salaries and benefits of $19 million but that includes a change in the timing of incentive payments. Last year, the payment was made in second quarter and we pulled this forward this year into the first quarter impacting payroll taxes and 401k expense. Other expense increased $11 million, which includes the impact of the FDIC insurance surcharge, which was not a factor in 1Q 2016. When we exclude those items, the year-over-year expense growth rate was closer to 3%. Let’s move on and discuss the balance sheet. On Slide 9, you can see the continued benefit of our efforts to grow our balance sheet and expand our NIM. We grew average loans 1.5% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year reflecting growth across most of our commercial business lines and in education mortgage and unsecured retail on the consumer side. NIM was up six basis points in the quarter and 10 basis points year-over-year reflecting improved loan yields partially offset by higher deposit costs. We’ve done a nice job of improving our loan yields giving our balance sheet optimization efforts along with greater discipline on pricing. We've also benefited from higher LIBOR during the quarter as the market anticipated the tightening by the Fed. We remain well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment with asset sensitivity to a gradual rise in rates, at 6% at the quarter end. On Pages 10 and 11 we provide more detail on the loan growth in consumer and commercial. In consumer 6% average growth was led by continued expansion in education, residential mortgages and other unsecured retail loans, which was driven by our partnership with Apple and our new personal unsecured product. We, continue to improve and enhance our portfolio mix by driving growth in higher-return categories. We are slowing growth in auto and that will likely accelerate in the back half of the year as our partnership with SCUSA comes to a close in April and we further reduce volumes in select geographic areas. As a result of these efforts in addition to higher rates, we’ve expanded portfolio yields by 10 basis points in the quarter and 22 basis points year-over-year. We also saw nice growth in commercial where we continue to execute well in commercial real estate, mid-corporate and middle-market, industry verticals and franchise finance. The increase in rates and enhanced rigor around the acquired portfolio of returns have helped drive a 23 basis point improvement in yields linked quarter and a 41 basis point increase year-over-year. On Page 12, looking at the funding side, we saw a five basis point increase in our total funding cost with a 4 basis point increase in deposit costs mostly tied to growth in commercial deposits. Year-over-year, our cost of funds were up nine basis points reflecting substantial growth in higher cost commercial deposits to fund robust loan growth as well as the impact of higher rates in terming out some of our borrowed funds. Next let’s move to Slide 13 and cover credit. Overall credit quality continues to be strong, reflecting the continued mix shift towards high-quality lower risk retail loans compared with growth in the larger company segments of our commercial book. The non-performing loan ratio remained flat to fourth quarter levels at 97 basis points of loans and improved from 107 basis points a year ago. The net charge-off rate decreased to 33 basis points from more elevated in 4Q levels that included a $7 million increase in the auto portfolio related to a onetime methodology change. Retail net charge-offs decreased $20 million, while our commercial net charge offs were up slightly. Provision for credit losses of $96 million, decreased $6 million from relatively high fourth quarter levels. As we continue to grow higher quality retail portfolios, our allowance for total loans and leases ratio has moved down modestly to 1.13%. On Slide 14, you can see that we continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions. This quarter, as part of our 2016 CCAR plan, we’ve repurchased 3.4 million shares and returned over $200 million to share holders including dividend. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.2%. As a reminder our CCAR capital plan targets the repurchase of up to $130 million in shares in the second quarter of 2017. It's also worth noting that the total and not returned to shareholders to date is 3 quarters of the 2016 CCAR window at $756 million including dividends. On Slide 15, we show an update on progress against our strategic initiatives. I’d like to highlight that we continue to drive attractive loan growth across a number of areas. In consumer, we continued with strength in our mortgage loan officer recruitment efforts reaching 560 at quarter end, which should help provide an offset to industry wide origination headwinds. We continue to reduce the auto program to enhance return and we've seen really strong growth in our education refinance loan products, which has attractive risk-adjusted returns. In wealth, we saw nice plus in fees this quarter with the total investment sales up 13% linked quarter and 25% year-over-year. We continue to make progress in a year-over-year basis in shifting the mix of our sales towards more fee-based business, which came in at 36% compared to 14% in 1Q 2016. In addition our FB headcount is up 9%, which is contributing towards the scale in the business. Commercial continues to deliver impressive results with a strong quarter and capital and global markets demonstrating the potential of these businesses given our expanded capabilities. The build out of Treasury Solutions is also on the right track with higher fee income growth linked quarter and year-over-year along with strong momentum in our commercial card program. Moving on to Slide 16, the top programs have successfully delivered efficiencies that have allowed us to self-fund investments to improve our platforms and product offerings. In 2016, our top 2 program delivered $105 million in annual pre-tax benefits across our revenue and expense initiatives. Our top 3 program, which launched in mid-2016, is on track to deliver targeted run rate benefit of $100 million to $115 million by the end of 2017. We have been working on a top 4 program and we expect to provide additional details on this on our second quarter call. On Slide 17, you can see the steady progress we are making against our financial targets. Since 3Q 2013 our ROTCE has improved from 4.3% to 9.7%, which equates to 9% on an underlying basis. Our efficiency ratio has improved by 6% over that same time frame from 68% to 62%, and EPS continues on a very strong trajectory as well. More than doubling from $0.26 to $0.57 on an underlying basis. Let's turn to our second quarter outlook on Slide 18, we expect a pretty linked quarter loan growth of around 1.5% on a period-end basis and 1% on an average basis. We continue to project full-year loan growth to be within the 5.5% to 7% full-year guidance range. We also expect net interest margin to continue to expand by about three basis points to four basis points linked quarter given the forward curve benefit. In non-interest income, we are expecting to see a sequential decrease given the strong first quarter results in capital markets. The commercial activity pipelines have moderated somewhat as the market reassesses the political and economic outlook. We expect to keep expenses broadly stable in the second quarter with positive operating leverage and efficiency improving. We expect stable to slightly higher provision reflecting loan growth with relatively stable net charge-off levels. And finally, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to around 11.1% and we will manage the average LDR to around 97% to 98%. With regard to the full year 2017, outlook we broadly reaffirm on the balance sheet. And expense guidance that we previously provided but expect to come in at or above the high end of the range for NII and operating leverage. To sum up on Slide 19, our strong results this quarter demonstrated our ability to continue to improve how we run the bank. We have delivered well against our strategic initiatives that help us drive underlying revenue growth and carefully manage our expense base. We remain committed to being prudent capital allocators and enhancing our returns for shareholders. In the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on execution and making further progress for all stake holders. With that let me turn it back to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks John before we start the Q&A, let me turn it over to Brad for some brief words on a media article on our Checkup program. Brad.
Brad Conner: Thanks, Bruce. We have confidence in the Checkup program as an important part of our strategy to serve customers well and ultimately be better positioned to deepen relationships. We believe it's important to note that recent media coverage did not suggest customer harm nor have we identified any. Nevertheless we have commenced a through review to determine whether there are any issues in the delivery of the program. My current expectation is that we are in a good position based on feedback and survey results we already have. Our surveys show that customers who go through the review are highly satisfied and most would recommend a Checkup to someone else. An engagement and organizational health index at our braches is up, customer alignment is up and the [indiscernible] is down since we moved to this mode of interaction that our branch based customers. However we're open to things we learn from review that we can adjust to become even better. So back to you Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, thanks Brad and with that operator we're ready to open it up for Q&A.
Operator: Thank Mr. Van Saun. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.
John Pancari: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi.
John Pancari: Could you update us on your – your updated thoughts on the ROTC expectation at this point. I know you had a target of 10% medium term. You're certainly close to that now, so can you talk about where you expect that could go over the course of the next year and how soon you could be, up towards your original targets, when you spun off. Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: John I have repeatedly not want to be drawn in on putting a pin in the exact timing that we get to the 10%, what I would say is that we've made nice progress, kind of consistently last year and now in the first quarter and we are getting closer, a lot will depend on first the environment and continued movement in the interest rates, which provide some tailwind and then our continued ability to execute on our strategic initiatives. So I think we have momentum, I think we’re as you say getting relatively close. So hopefully it won't be too long but what I would ultimately say is that once we get to that 10% we won't be satisfied. We will look out, we will be doing our strategic planning effort this summer and we'll consider whether at the appropriate time it is appropriate to raise that target even higher.
John Pancari: Okay, all right thanks and then separately or just around the auto business, I know you indicated outside of the of the SCUSA purchases, ending that you are shrinking that that portfolio, so if you can talk about the rationale behind it and the magnitude of the shrinking we could expect and then separately any update on credit there. Is that influencing that decision?
Bruce Van Saun: Now it's really John, you can add to what I say or Brad, but I think that the real reason is that we grew the auto book when there wasn't much happening on the consumer side. So there side. So there was very little demand for credit from consumers except in the auto arena. So we ramped up our own self originations and we supplemented that with the SCUSA flow agreement, which got us into the prime space in the super prime space and delivering quite returns. Our view is always that the runoff in auto was a bridge to hold us and deploy some capital until ultimately the consumer can back and if you will got his/her mojo back and so we've seen that now. We've seen increase in demand for personal unsecured and revolving credit, student lending, mortgages. And so as those other portfolios grow, there's less need to have the auto and frankly the auto now that our returns have lifted is dilutive to our overall ROTCE and overall returns. So I think you'll see us we probably peaked at maybe $14 billion in total loan balance. I think that will probably be lower by about $1 billion and I would expect that trend to continue into next year. I do know, John or Brad?
John Woods: The only thing I would add in the specific question around in any way related to credit performance, the answer is no. Our credit performance has been strong, right in line with our pricing expectation and our expectation is, to your point, it's all about the return on the business. It's not in any way related to the credit performance.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, anything from you.
Brad Conner: Yes, just getting back to the point about reallocating that capital to hire a better use. I may have mentioned in my remarks that this generates higher risk-adjusted returns for us when we rotate that capital into those other consumer businesses, so we're excited about that.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes
John Pancari: Okay great thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Eads: Hi, good morning, and welcome John. Maybe starting with you, I think when you talked about kind of the strategic priorities, you started with opportunities for to optimize and improve on the funding side. See if you can kind of drill into more detail of where you think opportunities might be there, whether it is on the consumer side or the commercial side – how you think that’s going end, what opportunities are going to be shaking out given the changes to the dynamics for deposit given higher rates?
John Woods: Yes, thanks. And I think I've just talked about it on both sides and partnering with Don and Brad on this. In early days, there's been nice momentum in both of those businesses on funding. I'd say that we're entering into an environment here, which we'll all talk about rising rates and how we all operate in that environment. But looking forward, when you look at overall balance sheet, we're looking to remix and as we just talked about on the asset side and better use of that capital, we're constantly looking for better ways to fund that portfolio and that's part of our franchise. And we have some momentum there in terms of getting the right mix of commercial and consumer, so I think you'll see a bit more on the commercial side and getting a better representation of commercial deposits in our footprint. And there's also – we've seen good control of deposit cost in the consumer side. So like everybody, we're going to constantly look at that and look for ways to better fund the balance sheet.
Bruce Van Saun: Brad, we want to add some of the initiatives may be that you have going on in consumer, targeting of that segmentation of the customer base, mining products and having data analytics to really tease out the products from with good offers to different segments of the base?
Brad Conner: Yes, you bet. A couple of things we've got. I think we talked about this a little bit on last quarter's call. We have redesigned our value proposition for our massive and affluent consumers. I think you’d get a much better value proposition to serve the needs of those customers. And then we invested very heavily in analytics and really understanding our customer segments and how to reach them with very specific and targeted offers so that our offers are much less about putting broad offers out, if you will, across the entire branch base that’s targeting the specific customers and specific customers sets. And we think that will really allow us to be much more efficient in driving lower-cost deposits.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And Brad, you're also looking to focus on where the opportunities are for deposits?
Brad Conner: Yes. I mean, I think we’ve got materially more sophisticated in our deposit strategies over the last couple of quarters and added staff and added specific programs and added industry base focus to where we work with those deposits that are attractive and attractively priced, so we’re very confident there.
Bruce Van Saun: And we will start to emphasize some of the industry segments that have that are cash rich as supposed to on a credit needy. I think it's part of the rotation that we're looking at as well.
Brad Conner: Correct.
David Eads: Great. Thanks, guys. That’s very helpful. And may be second question, obviously a really good quarter on the fee side, you talked about may be a little bit of pullback on the capital markets. I'm curious, is the equitation that this step up in the card fee line should be sustainable and kind of a may be fluctuating, but broadly sustainable at this higher level?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Let me take that and then I’ll ask my partners to color. But first off, with respect to capital markets, it really was an exceptionally strong quarter and I think it really shows that we built some great capabilities. We had to move off of being a partner with RBS for many of these products, and we've now stood them up on our own. We've got really good teamwork going between coverage bankers and our product specialists, and we're making great traction and the market conditions were very favorable and I think we hit the ball out of the park. I think what we're cautioning is that we were at record levels when the capital markets fees were in the mid-$30s very recently, we just hit a $48. I still think the numbers this year, the outlook is strong but it's kind of capturing lightning in the bottle at this point for $48. But like I used to kid with Don and his team, when we were in the $20s, $30s, the new $20 and then we were in the $30s, $40s, the new $30, so I think we will continue to see as we built up our book of customers and continue to expand our capabilities that will push that number at over time. On the card side, what I would say is that, look, the renegotiations that we had with our core processing vendors creates a sustainable lift. There was some of rewards expense adjustment in the quarter which would not repeat, but that will be partially offset by seasonality in Q2. So I think we'll see a good percentage of this lift stick but not all. So, Don, I don’t know if you want to add any color?
Don McCree: No, I think you’re exactly right on capital markets. I mean, the only thing I'd add is it is incredibly competitive out there right now and aggressive, so we're trying to maintain a level of discipline on the transactions we do. Highly encouraged by the quality of the franchise and the transactions that we are doing, we're winning in disproportionate share of what we're seeing. So as you said it is the function of activity in the market, discipline, and then quality of franchise. I think we will continue to have strong quarters going forward. Our treasury services business, just to mention that, my other fee line has got tremendous momentum and it's really led by card which is growing at 30% to 40% a year. So that's the way for the future in terms of our treasury business, so on both …
Bruce Van Saun: Yes.
Don McCree: Really nothing to add, Bruce. I think you said it right.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay.
David Eads: Great. Thanks so much.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks Eads.
Operator: And our next question will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Matt Burnell: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just focusing for a minute on commercial lending. What are the trends you're seeing there in terms of demand by size or maybe industry verticals? A couple of your competitors over the last few days have mentioned a growing demand in mid-market and maybe below mid-market relative to where it's been the last few quarters. Can you give us a little more color in terms of those trends and the utilization rates?
Bruce Van Saun: Don, you want to take that?
Don McCree: I'd say utilization just to start with that, it's up slightly not in a material way. So we're seeing pretty standard utilization. Our pipelines in our mid-market business are actually quite strong. And the question is what closes and when does it close and how does the demand continue to materialize? We saw quite robust kind of conversations in demands early, early in the year off the back of the changes in administration. And I would say, given some of the uncertainty of delivery of some of those programs and potential delay into the back end of the year, it's moderated a little bit. But we're encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of pipeline growth and activity in conversations. I will say that it's been offset by two other factors. One is there has been very tremendous capital markets activity and in our mid-corporate and some of our industry vertical businesses, we've seen a lot of refinancings into the capital markets given the strength of the capital markets. You can see that in our fee lines as we capture some of that opportunity. And at the margin we've got more disciplined on returns, so we are turning certain parts of the book to try to build better returning portfolios. So we've seen shrink in places like our leasing business, which has been offset by growth in other parts of our business. So I guess I'd summarize it by saying client activity is strong. We think the franchise is strong. We're adding a lot of new clients. So we're optimistic as we look out through the next several quarters, whether it materializes in the second quarter or third quarter is the timing question get's in the back of my mind.
Matt Burnell: Okay. And just staying on the idea of commercial, you’ve mentioned a couple of times so far this call about growing commercial deposits prudently. And I'm curious, John, if you think that that's going to add to pressure in terms of deposit beta over your relative to what your prior expectations have been.
John Woods: I think we are going to talk a little bit about how those funds are being deployed as well. You have heard a little bit earlier. We're putting that money to good use. We're making prudent decisions on the pricing side. And we have – we're doing better on the loan yield side. So you've got to look at those sides of the balance sheet there when you talk about what we're doing with those funds. Sure, commercial deposits have bit higher beta than a consumer deposits. But as you heard earlier from Don, we are under-penetrated on that side. We've got some very interesting things going on in the products front that will help to create some momentum on raising commercial deposits. And we feel good about where that will go in terms of from a mix standpoint and how we will put that capital and liquidity to work.
Matt Burnell: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ricky Dodds: Hey guys, this is actually Ricky Dodds from Matt's team. Just a quick question on the buildout and wealth in mortgage. It seems to be going pretty well and appreciate the update and the press release. Just wondering if you could give a little more color on sort of what's left to do there? And how you think you guys are doing on the build versus maybe your initial expectations? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Brad, you want to take that?
Brad Conner: Sure. I would say we're feeling pretty good about both of those areas. I will start with mortgage. We were up 22 this quarter, up 125 year-on-year. I think the key for us has been we feel really good about the progress we're making in turning our operations around. So we've really seen improvement in our customer satisfaction operations, which has allowed us to recruit loan officers and retain loan officers. Obviously the entire industry is seeing a little bit of slowdown in terms of demand. But all in all, we feel good and the progress that we're making with hiring our loan officers have been in our conforming geographies as well, which will help drive fee income. So we feel very good about that. I'd say on the wealth side, good quarter for us and we feel good about the progress we're making. We continue to see improved growth. We talked about it last quarter. One of the things that slowed our trajectory a little bit in growing fee income was a movement from to more managed money, fee-based products and we're seeing that trend continue but we feel like we've sort of crossed over that threshold where not yet that sustainable source of fee income and so continuing to have good success and good progress. And I would say yes, maybe to your question about how do we feel against our original projection, we feel like we're pretty much on track there guys.
John Woods: Well, I'd say it's probably taken us longer…
Brad Conner: Taken us longer.
John Woods: …to get here, but we have made some I'd say slight adjustments in the mortgages to make sure we are focusing on the conforming geographies to make sure we get fulfillment on servicing where it needs to be. And in wealth, I think we're just building it the right way, putting the right products in place, we're putting the right customer segmentation and delivery mechanisms in place. We've got the robo advisory now up and running this quarter, and so I am really excited about really where both businesses are today and the outlook although I'd say to be fair, it's taken us a little longer to get there.
Ricky Dodds: Okay, great. Thanks. And just a quick one on occupancy cost this quarter. It looks like you called out about $5 million and branch rationalization or upgrade cost. Wondering if you can give a little color on that and then is that something we should expect going forward as you continue to sort of make improvements to your footprint?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, there's probably of that increase. I think it was maybe 3 or 4 was related to the branch charges. But what we're focused on here is what we call refer to as branch transformation, which is to take a look at all our branches and try to figure out how to reconfigure them. So in most instances, we don't need as much space as we have, so we want to reduce the overall square footage in the branches and we want to take what was space dedicated to transactions and the remaining space should have more private rooms for conversation. So we can deliver advice to our customers, and we can also use the foyer , the entrance room for putting in some very sophisticated machines that people can do a lot of the banking that require tellers right on those machines. We're probably looking at a 10-year timeline based on our lease expiries to get to all our branches and we're kind of in the early stages of that. So initially, you'll see the charges for the refurbs exceed what we get in terms of the back book of lower rent from the restructured branches. But as time goes by, that becomes a nice driver because ultimately, we'll be driving the occupancy expense, lower and because of the less square footage, and that will swamp the cost of a handful of branches each quarter getting refurbished. So anyway, that's what you saw in Q1.
Ricky Dodds: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.
Vivek Juneja: Hi, Bruce. Hi, John.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi, Vivek.
Vivek Juneja: I wanted to talk a little bit about reserves, reserve levels for your loan portfolio, obviously crisp and very good, but how you're thinking about reserves to loans have come down a little further to 113% and where do you see that leveling out?
John Woods: Look, we're comfortable with where that is Vivek and I think it partly reflects the shift in some of the portfolio that you've seen, you've seen someone runoff of – some of the legacy poor assets that service by other home equity portfolio being replaced with very high prime and super prime consumer assets, which has been an upgrade. And I think in the commercial side, you're seeing growth in the kind of mid-corporate space, which tend to be higher rated credit. So I think it's really just overall function of the decisions we're making in terms of how we plan where we play. If you look at the coverage ratios of things like NPLs, that continues to go up. And I think we're up to 118% on that basis. So overall, I think we're probably getting to a point where you won't see significant further reductions from that 1013%. But hopefully if we keep working down the book of NPLs, you might see that number continue to improve somewhat. The other thing I'd say that's quite interesting is while we’re focused on getting higher yields and we're also improving the risk-adjusted returns on our loan book, we're seeing that our stress test losses are actually reducing because of some of the impacts that I described that's running off these legacy portfolios and putting really good quality back on the book. So you kind of have the hatch wrecking effects, better yields, better risk adjusted returns and lower stress losses, which is really great to see.
Vivek Juneja: Okay, great. You basically [indiscernible] into my next question, which was CCAR. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that and given your continued very strong capital levels, your plans for how you're thinking about capital return and capital deployment?
Bruce Van Saun: Sure. And again, we've been, I think very consistent and predictable that we've been on a glide path that we want to have strong returns of capital to shareholders and strong loan growth. The fact that we were birth from RBS with a high capital ratio has allowed us that flexibility. We're coming closer and closer to where peers are but we still have, I think, relatively high rates. I think you could expect more of the same in terms of our approach this year. When I think about what we want to do with capital, certainly, increasing the dividend you saw us raise the dividend and the payout ratio is going up. We'd like that to continue, and we'll also want to continue to fund loan growth as a high priority. And then when we have excess, we'll use that to repurchase the shares. So that's it in a nutshell.
Vivek Juneja: And are you still targeting, Bruce, as you look out what kind of target capital ratios rather than me putting words in your mouth let me just give that too. What are you thinking? Where you would like to run with that?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, we haven't really freshened that view. As you recall when we did the IPO roadshow, we said we wanted to bring it down to around 11%. I think last year, we came from 11.7% to 11.2%-ish. So the glide path in the past couple of years has been down 50 basis points or so. I think it’ll cross over 11% this year and still have a differential to peers. So I think this continued glide path can continue not only this year but into next year, and so we'll stay tuned on that. We'll probably post you on that sometime in the middle of the year.
Vivek Juneja: Thanks, Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay.
Operator: And our next question will come from Scott Valentin with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Scott Valentin: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Just on the unsecured portion of loan origination, just wondering, I know you guys used combination of partnerships and I guess internal initiatives. Just wondering over time if you plan to internalize all of that, will partnerships remain a key component into driving that unsecured loan growth, consumer loan growth?
Bruce Van Saun: Let me start and Brad can add some color on this. But clearly, we've had – I think we've taken the view that to grow our card portfolio is challenging because the payback period for actually growing that book takes some time and so there were better uses of expense dollars to grow other portfolios. One of the things when we looked at the unsecured space and struck up the partnership with Apple, was that the returns are accretive much faster, so we were able to make an investment to build the capabilities to support Apple, but then as the balances come on the books, we're not paying for zero balance transfers and heavy marketing expenses. So we like that aspect about the program and the risk-adjusted returns on that portfolio are very good from our standpoint. We have – because of that, being partnered with an iconic company like Apple, we've had other reverse inquiries and we've actually gone out and solicited some, so we've got two new partnerships set up that will gain some traction as the year goes by. One is with Vivint, a smart alarm company and the other is with HP, and stay tuned because there could be more in the works. So we like that capability that we have developed and partnering with real class companies and so that I think will be a growth feature going forward. We've also determined that there is an opportunity, much in the way with add refi lending products that we can offer attractive propositions to borrowers who are carrying high-cost debt. There is other customers of ours who maybe carrying multiple revolving credit balances who can consolidate that into an unsecured line of credit, and so we introduced our pearl product last year and that has real traction too. So I think you'll probably see a combination of it too. You will see some direct mailing and branch offers to our customers on the pearl product and then married to an overall trust on the partnership side. So, Brad, you want to add to that?
Brad Conner: [indiscernible] I think you said it right, I mean, we have a very high quality list of other potential partners that have reached out to us. I think we have new capability and we think we can continue to expand with a very attractive set of customers. I’d just point out to that Vivint is a very good commercial bank customer of Don and I think it’s also related to build rate synergy between the consumer and the commercial bank and we will continue to look at those opportunities as well.
Bruce Van Saun: Great
Scott Valentin: Thanks very much.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay.
Operator: And there are no further questions in queue at this time. I'll turn it back over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Well, thanks again everyone for dialing in today. We really appreciate your interest. As I said in the press release, I think we're really firing well on all cylinders. I remain very confident in our full-year outlook. Thanks again, and have a good day.
Operator: And that concludes today's conference call. Thanks for participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q4  (2017-01-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad, and I'll be your operator on today's call. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we'll conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen A. Taylor: Thanks so much, Brad, and hello everyone. We really appreciate you joining us on our call today. Our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and our Interim CFO, John Fawcett will begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year results and then we will open up the call for questions. We're also real proud to have here in the room with us today Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking. I'd like to remind you all that in addition to today's press release we have also provided presentation and financial supplement and these materials are available at investor.citizensbank.com. And of course our comments today will include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. And we provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from the expectations in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K we filed today. We also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide important information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and in our earnings material. And with that, I will hand it over to you Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Great. Thanks Ellen and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We are pleased to repeat another quarter of strong and improving results and a great finish to a year of significant progress and good execution. We continue to run the bank better every day, we are taking good care of our customers, and we enter 2017 with some nice momentum. The highlights of the quarter from my perspective was the continued delivery of good top line growth with 11% year-on-year revenue growth and robust positive operating leverage at 6% while for the full year revenue growth was 8% and the operating leverage was 4.2% on an adjusted basis. The commitment to positive operating leverage has powered improvement in our key metrics. Our ROTCE hit 8.4% in Q4 and our efficiency ratio improved to 62%. We continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives and we're making progress on our customer, colleague and community stakeholder objectives doing better for all of these key stakeholders. We also announced an increase in our Q1 dividend of 17% or $0.02 to $0.14 and we repurchased 180 million in common shares during Q4. As we look at 2017 we expect our agenda to be largely consistent with 2016. We have a great playbook and we're going to continue to execute against that playbook. We're hopeful that the macroeconomic environment may deliver some tailwinds but we will stay focused on execution and what we can control. I'm going to turn it over to John Fawcett, our interim CFO to review fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. I’ll then come back to discuss the outlook for 2017. First I'd like to personally thank John for shelving his vacation plans to step back in and cover the CFO duties for a couple of months as we transition CFOs. It's very much appreciated by me and by your colleagues John and it's great to have you back with us during this period.
John Fawcett: Thanks Bruce and good morning everyone. Since Bruce hit the highlights let me direct you to a few pages in our slide deck with some color on our financial results. On slide 6 on a GAAP basis we generated net income available to common stock holders of $282 million and EPS of $0.55 per share which was up 31% year-over-year driven by strong revenue growth of $131 million or 11% year-over-year. Our net interest margin increased 13 basis points while the efficiency ratio improved 3.5% from the fourth quarter of 2015 to 62%. On slide 7 we present the results on an adjusted basis. As a reminder third quarter results included $19 million of after-tax notable items that benefited our EPS by $0.04 in the third quarter. We grew EPS on an adjusted basis by 6% linked quarter and 31% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The strong focus on operating leverage delivered revenue growth of 11% year-over-year with expenses up just 5%. We improve the efficiency ratio by over 1% versus the prior quarter and 3.5% year-over-year. Our results also reflect $180 million in share repurchases. On slide 10 and 11, you can see the continued benefit of our efforts to grow our balance sheet and expand our net interest margin. We grew average loans 2% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year reflecting growth across commercial and in mortgage unsecured retail and student on the consumer side. Net interest margin was up 6 basis points in the quarter and 13 basis points year-over-year reflecting improved loan yields partially offset by higher deposit costs. We've got a nice job of improving our loan yields given our balance sheet optimization efforts, a loan with greater discipline on pricing. We also benefited from higher LIBOR during the quarter as the market anticipated the tightening by the Fed. On the funding side we held our cost flat to linked quarter despite a 1 basis point increase in deposit costs as we benefited from the runoff of paid fixed swaps. On a year-over-year basis deposit cost were up slightly and net borrowing costs relatively flat. We remain well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment with asset sensitivity to a gradual rise in rates at 5.9% as of quarter end. Next on slide 12 we cover non-interest income which on an adjusted basis was up $9 million in the quarter. Service charges and fees were slightly up and mortgage banking fees were up $3 million reflecting improved mortgage servicing rights valuation, partially offset by lower sales gains. Security gains were $3 million tied to portfolio adjustments. FX and letter of credit fees improved $2 million largely reflecting increased customer hedging activity given U.S. dollar volatility. Capital markets fees were strong and in line with record 3Q 2016 levels given continued good loan syndication activity. Let's take a closer look at expenses on slide 13. On an adjusted basis non-interest expense was up $16 million linked quarter reflecting higher vendor contract license and maintenance costs, outside services tied to consumer loan origination and servicing, and an increase in fraud legal and regulatory costs. Salaries and employee benefits expense remained stable on an adjusted basis as higher revenue based incentives were largely offset by a reduction in benefits. Our headcount is down 75 year-over-year reflecting the impact of our efficiency initiatives which more than offset sales force and strategic hiring. We grew loans 8% annualized with nice performance in both consumer and commercial during the fourth quarter which you can see in more detail on pages 15 and 16. In consumer growth was led by continued expansion in residential mortgages, student and other unsecured retail loans which was driven by our partnership with Apple and our new personal unsecured product. We have recently announced a new partnership with Vivint, a major security alarm company and expect to announce another program soon. We continue to do a nice job of re-pointing our growth to higher return categories as the yields in consumer expanded 5 basis points in the quarter. We also saw a nice growth in commercial where we continued to execute well in mid-corporate and industry verticals and commercial real estate, which helped to offset the effect of $1.2 billion in loans and leases transferred to non-core. U.S. was up 11 basis points reflecting higher short-term LIBOR rates. Next let's move over to slide 18 and cover credit. Overall credit quality continued to improve reflecting our focus on growing high quality, lower risk retail loans compared with growth in the larger company segment of our commercial book which tends to be higher credit quality. Our non-performing loan ratio improved to 97 basis points of loans from 105 driven by a reduction in consumer real estate secured. The net charge off rate increased to 39 basis points. Our commercial net charge offs decreased $3 million from last quarter while retail net charge offs increased $24 million driven by lower recoveries in home equity from relatively high third quarter levels. We also saw a $7 million increase in the auto portfolio related to a one time methodology change. Provision for credit losses of $102 million increased $16 million driven by a $14 million reduction in recoveries of prior period charge offs from relatively high third quarter levels. As we continue to grow at a higher quality retail portfolios and one of our non-core portfolio our allowance to loans and leases ratio has moved down modestly to 1.15%. On slide 19 you can see that we continue to maintain strong capital liquidity positions. This quarter as part of our 2016 CCAR Plan we have repurchased $180 million in stock at an average price of $28.71 and returned $241 million to shareholders including dividends. As Bruce mentioned we announced a 17% increase in the dividend. We ended the quarter with a common equity Tier One ratio of 11.2%. As a reminder our CCAR capital plan targets, the repurchase of up to $260 million dollars in shares throughout the first half of 2017. On slide 20 we show our progress against our strategic initiatives. We believe it's important to assess our progress against these initiatives each quarter. Importantly we continued to drive attractive loan growth across a number of areas. We have considerably made good progress over the past few quarters in mortgage ending the year with 538 loan officers ahead of our target. We fine tune our auto programs to enhance returns and we've seen really strong growth in our education refinance loan product which has attractive risk adjusted returns. In wealth we've had some near term revenue headwinds as our sales mix is shifting towards more fee based business. But we have continued to add FCs and overall transaction volumes are up. Overall we are pleased with our results in commercial this year and we expect to continue to build on this strength. We launched our broker dealer this year which allows us to expand our capabilities and deepen relationships with existing customers. We've experienced strong growth in our mid corporate and industry verticals with particular success in healthcare and technology. We look for continued growth in our capital and global markets business given our strong loan syndication capabilities and enhanced interest rate product offerings. Moving on to slide 21, the Top programs have successfully delivered efficiencies that have allowed us to sell fund investments to improve our platforms and product offerings. In 2016 our Top 2 program delivered $105 million in annual pretax benefits across our revenue and expense initiatives. Our Top 3 program launched in mid 2016 is on track to deliver $100 million to $115 million in 2017 benefits. We will keep working towards delivering greater benefits given our mindset of continuous improvement. Slide 22 can be read at your leisure. Suffice it to say that we made good progress across consumer and commercial in terms of customer experience, market share, and product capabilities. On slide 23, you can see the steady progress we're making against our stated financial targets. Our adjusted return on tangible common equity of 8.43% improved 168 basis points year-over-year. Also our adjusted efficiency ratio improved 113 basis points linked quarter and 358 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2015 and now stands at 62%. And EPS continues on a nice trajectory. And with that let me turn it back to Bruce, thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks John. On slide 24 we identify the key to a successful 2017. Achieving good loan and deposit growth, expanding the NIM, progress on our fee businesses, strong expense discipline, and further capital normalization are key objectives very similar to 2016. On slide 25 we detail the ambitious guidance that we gave last January for 2016 on the left side of the page and on the right side we show what we actually achieved. The good news here is that notwithstanding an adverse interest rate and GDP backdrop, we hit just about all of our targets. Very proud of the 4.2% positive operating leverage which is near best in peer group. Only miss was on fee growth which is taking somewhat longer than expected but, we feel we are on the right track. On slide 26 and 27 we detail our guidance for 2017. Quite similar you’ll see to 2016 with good top line growth, 3% to 5% positive operating leverage target, further efficiency ratio improvement, and capital normalization. A few points of color, first slightly slower loan growth in commercial given higher rates which is offset by higher securities portfolio growth. So, overall earning asset growth about the same. Strong NIM improvement largely due to yield curve benefit that’ll be slightly less self-help benefit then in 2016. The provision continues to gradually normalize largely due to reserve bill tied to loan growth. Credit quality is expected to remain very strong, and LDR is projected at 98%, CET1 ratio at 10.7 to 10.9 with solid growth in our dividends. Slide 28 provides some additional color on the NIM. We expect continued good discipline on how and where we play in the loan book and in raising deposits cost effectively. The rate curve as of December 31st delivers a benefit of slightly over a 100 million to 2017 NIM assuming two hikes in 2017 and continued steepness in the yield curve. This obviously will move around on us. So we'll see how things will actually play out. On slide 29 you can see the NII walk, top of the page is 2016 bottom of the page is the 2017 target. We expect slightly lower earning asset growth and slightly lower NIM expansion as deposit betas and borrowing costs rise but overall a very strong 8% to 9% growth outlook for 2017. On slide 30, we show the same format for expenses. The story again is very consistent from 2016 to 2017. Underlying expense growth of around 5% which includes merit and inflation increases as well as business growth spend supporting our strategic initiatives. This is partially offset by top efficiency initiatives of almost 2% bringing the net expense growth to around 3% to 3.5%. On slide 31, we provide our guidance for Q1 relative to Q4. This is typically a seasonally softer quarter for us given several factors including day count, seasonal activity levels, and the FICA taxes associated with incentive compensation. We also pay our preferred stock dividends in Q1 and Q3 of each year. That said we feel good about the year-on-year comparison relative to 2016. So to sum up on slide 32 we feel that we've delivered strong results in Q4 and for the full year of 2016. We will maintain our mindset of continuous improvement in 2017 and we will look to drive even more top program benefits. We also feel our balance sheet and capital and our credit position remained rock solid. So there's also lots of good stuff in the appendix in the supplemental materials which you can review at your convenience. So with that operator Brad, we're ready to open up for some Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will go to the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Matt O'Connor: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi.
Matt O'Connor: If I could just follow up on the loan growth, obviously you guys have had very strong loan growth and still solid outlook, a little bit less now than you've seen and you mentioned less commercial loan growth given higher rates. Maybe you can just elaborate on that and in the consumer side as we think about the drivers of growth there and maybe less drag from home equity, just walk us through what you think on the consumer side?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes sure, I'll start and then Don and Brad can chime in with some color. But I think we really hit the ball out of the park with loan growth this year and pleased with what we were able to accomplish on both sides on commercial and consumer. I think a fair amount of the activity that you've seen on the commercial side has been companies that are taking advantage of lower rates doing some refinancing, doing some recaps, taking out dividends and doing -- putting some leverage back into their companies. And you've seen commercial real estate very, very robust and so I think as rates move up a little bit you'll see a little less of that activity. Although I do think if you see that the growth come through that the market is expecting that hopefully is made up with loan demand that really is in support of a faster growing real economy. So we'll wait and see how that plays out. I think we're just marking it down a little bit. But having said that I think we have the same coverage force out there taking market share, winning on the battlefield with good ideas. So we'll continue to follow that playbook and then maybe we'll see some upside there. On the consumer side I think there's also some rates impact that we would anticipate particularly around the mortgage areas or mortgage refi product. Obviously the opportunities there will be somewhat limited. Our hope is that with the bigger sales force that we've assembled that we can certainly make up for some of that and that the purchase market will stay strong during the year. We should also see a little bit of a shift towards more conforming products which also could crimp the mortgage growth on the balance sheet a little bit. But I think that's probably the main impact of the higher rates on the consumer side. There might be a little impact on Ed refi market but I still think many of the borrowers who are refinancing will still see it worthwhile to do that. And then I think on a personal unsecured product generally people are coming off of very high cost revolving credit card debt into something quite a bit less from an interest rate standpoint. So I think that will be very modest if any impacts on that. So in general I think we will be looking to follow the playbook that we followed this year and should see very strong growth in the same areas that we saw this year. But we're being I think just appropriately a little cautious given the higher rates. I don't know guys, Don.
Donald H. McCree: No, I think mark down is the right word. And we saw a little bit of deceleration on the commercial side as we got to the back end of the year for exactly the reasons that we have cited. We're hopeful if the economy starts to take off that that we will see good loan demand but we're just not seeing it in the pipelines yet. The other thing that’s happening in some portions the portfolio is we're getting a little disintermediation as people hit the capital markets with the expectation that rates are going to go up. That's helping our fee lines a little bit so capturing…
Bruce Van Saun: Pipelines for fees Don.
Donald H. McCree: Pipeline for fees, so we're seeing a toggle between NII and the fee line a little bit, I think you characterized it correctly.
Brad L. Conner: Bruce, I think you cover it very well and the consumer side. The only thing I would add to it is we probably will see slowing growth in auto because we’re intentionally taping the brakes on auto. So and we've talked about this in previous quarters which is the pressure continues to be there in terms of the margin returns on that business. So that the growth we’re getting in the other asset classes in a little bit better risk adjusted returns were intentionally going back on the growth in auto. Okay.
Matt O'Connor: Okay, that’s good color. Thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question will come from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Scott Siefers: Good morning guys. Obviously a pretty good margin performance this quarter and the outlook with of course benefit from high rates just curious Bruce what are you guys thinking about deposit cost as we sort of lean into a higher rate environment, I guess, the only thing that might be a little different about you guys as you start with a higher loan to deposit ratio but I am just curious what your overall thoughts are -- what you're seeing and what you would anticipate going forward?
Bruce Van Saun: I’ll start off and anybody here can chime in again but I think we have done a very good job of getting better at raising deposits costs effectively. And so one of the things that we -- as we were in the shrink mode in RBS is we've pretty much shooed away deposits on the commercial side and they were higher cost. And we I think on the consumer side had a fair amount of term and time which we had moved back out as well. So as we've kind of been growing the balance sheet, we've kind of I'd say growing our loan book at about 2X of our peers. We have to grow deposits 2X our peers given the relatively high LDR after the Chicago region sale. It's been really important that we get that muscle back in terms of going out to commercial with strategies to raise deposits, to have balance in the industries that we're banking so that we have the chance and the opportunity to get some cash rich companies to put deposits with us. And on the consumer side to actually get much better at segmenting the customer base and making very targeted offers to different segments of the base that are appealing and just being sharper and not just posting one rate that everybody benefits from and then your whole back book re-prices. So I think we've done we've made real strides in that regard. And so if you look at the overall borrowing costs this year. They're pretty flat deposit costs that inched up a little bit but you know I think on the other borrowing costs we did some retirement of higher costs sub debt and replaced it with senior debt in term FHLB borrowings. And so, I think we've done a pretty good job of managing the cost of borrowings overall. That game plan has to continue so, again if we're looking to grow loans at a good clip in 2017 we have to keep staying really sharp on the strategies, we have to grow those deposits cost effectively, and I think we can do that. So anyway, John, Don, Brad any color on that.
John Fawcett: I think in the short time I've been here and since the first time we did the road show with the public offering it's always been very clear that we're going to fund loan growth with customer deposits from the time that I have been back it's very obvious that there are dedicated programs and disciplines in place to make sure that continues to happen. I think it happened this year with 9% loan growth. That was a steep hill to climb and I think it was achieved in my sense is in the first quarter. We are doing just as well and deposit gathering is job won, so feels good.
Scott Siefers: Okay, perfect, I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay Scott.
Operator: And the next question will come from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Erika Najarian: Yes, good morning. You mentioned earlier that there's slightly going to be a toggle between fee growth this year versus NII and I am wondering if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of your confidence in hitting that 3% to 5% non-interest income growth target for the year and sort of what line should we look forward to in terms of more contribution for this year?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. So I say one of the things you can look at there Erika is in the in the Q4 results. We were up 4% on a year-on-year basis. So I think as the year has gone on we see some very strong performance on the commercial side capital markets as we've grown the overall relationships of the bank. We have more swings with the bat and we have really good capabilities in capital markets particularly our loan syndications area. And we're adding additional capabilities over time. So that is broadening out things like the bond to economics that we can now get with our broker dealer in place. So I feel very good about that. I think our -- what we call global markets, the interest rate and FX risk management products, we've separated from RBS and we have put our own platform in place and it allows us to do a lot more frankly than we could when we had to back to back everything with RBS. So I think we're poised and positioned to continue growing there and we've been helped out a little bit by the environment with the volatility after Brexit and after the administration change in Washington. And hopefully I don't wish a lot of volatility on 2017 but I think we can anticipate some so that also feels pretty good. And also the cash management side we've got some great product capabilities, we keep working to strengthen our core capabilities but things around our card products and payables are all very strong and have nice growth associated with them. So I think we're doing very well on the commercial side. The challenge has been more on the consumer side and there I think the -- it's -- we are seeing some good momentum in mortgage and the hiring, I think gives us confidence that we can put up some good numbers again in 2017. Wealth we've had the hiring but we've had a mixed shift towards more fee based product sales which is great I think for the long-term but in the short-term it's replacing transaction oriented sales. And it hurts your revenues in the near-term. So we've had a little headwind on that. I think the lines cross at some point and again with the bigger sales force we should be able to see some growth in wealth next year. And I think just generally in service charges on deposit accounts we will continue to see some modest levels of growth if we keep that in the low single-digit range that helps because that is such a big category overall. So those are the areas that I would see and I think you can see a little bit of progress there on the Q4 year-over-year numbers.
Erika Najarian: Got it and my second question is speaking of volatility, if we do get some form of regulatory relief this year or next year, specifically as it relates to the definition of SIRI, a domestic SIRI in United States, how would you approach capital returns differently if at all and what is your view on the potential trajectory of regulatory related expenses over the next year or two?
John Fawcett: Sure, I think we have to wait and see how things play out. Our life pass down in terms of managing our capital position to peer levels has been I think well thought out and well telegraphed and so we've been coming down 40 or 50 basis points a year. We've pretty much been able to have our cake and eat it too, that we are funding very robust loan growth at almost 100% returns of capital to shareholders. And what we're trying to do obviously is get the ROTCE up to levels that are self-sustaining so we can do that in balance as opposed to meeting the draw down on that surplus capital account. I'm comfortable with that. I don't think that the being de-designated as a SIRI as the level goes up to 250. Obviously we will see what the peers are doing and whether they move down. We certainly are trying to move towards the peer so there might be some potential there. But I feel quite comfortable with the strategy that we've laid out and that we're executing against. With respect to cost there could be potentially a little bit of a dividend there depending on whether you can do things I guess with a little less exactitude and the robustness that goes into the current requirements. I think a lot of the whole process is very worthwhile and we'll continue to do that. So I think there might be a small dividend but I wouldn't put it as something that really should move estimates to a material degree.
Erika Najarian: Got it, thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Vivek Juneja: Hi, couple of things. Tax rate, Bruce you’ll give an outlook of 32% I know in Top 3 that’s one that you're working on, given that does that 32% in corporate debt benefit and if so why no change from 2016 to 2017?
Bruce Van Saun: Well we're growing income as you can see so, this year we grew our net income around 20% and we have again some very robust if you look at the midrange of the guidance you have very robust net income growth again. And so if the statutory rate stays high where it is for 2017 which I think most people anticipate, some of the credit program investments that we're making, the low income housing, or the wind farms and things like that you're doing those things just to kind of keep the rates where it is with the growth in income. So we'll keep looking for opportunities. I think the big event on the horizon would be corporate tax reform because clearly if something gets done this year and it's effective in 2018 with our tax rate at 32%, we could have a real meaningful benefit overall to the bottom line and to EPS and the growth fee. So we'll keep our eye on that. We'll keep working on this but, anyway I think that's probably reasonable guidance given the strong net income performance that we anticipate.
Vivek Juneja: Different question, capital account, you obviously had a nice jump in 2016 CCAR. At what point can we start to think about accelerating that to over 100% capital return?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah well I think I just answered that in the last question. And we'll keep our eye on kind of where the peer group is going from an absolute level and where we think the requests of our couple banks that went over 100 in this last cycle but broadly speaking we like our derived path as we're still improving our growth fee in demonstrating that we are running the bank better and better. I think that gives us more confidence just to keep bringing it down but I think we’ll take that under advisement and see what's happening with the peers.
Vivek Juneja: Okay, thanks, sorry I missed that one, just lots of earnings today.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I got you.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Matthew Burnell: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Bruce I just want to dive into a couple of the comments that you've already made. One is on slide 20 with sort of the where you stand relative to most of your efforts across the bank to drive better performance. I guess I'm just curious in terms of the commercial of the mid-market businesses that signaled as being not quite fully where you wanted to be. Given the position of the bank as being a mid market bank, what do you need to do to fully color in that slide I guess for lack of a better phrase in 2017?
Bruce Van Saun: I'm going to start and John obviously can offer his thoughts on this. But I think that what we've seen in the middle market is --- and really that just for definitional purposes that companies with revenues up to about 500 million. So call it 25 million to 500 million that those companies have not grown much over the over the past few years. They've been cautious, they haven't been quite the level of loan demand that we're seeing with bigger companies. We've had some very nice growth in what we call mid corporate which is companies from 500 million to 2.5 billion. And so I think one of the things that we're hopeful of is that and we're hearing this from these investors is that with the change in administration and focus more on growth that maybe the animal spirits kick in and we see more loan demand coming from that sector. I do think we've done a good job of strengthening the client relationships we have in middle market. We're seeing some modest growth in market share. We've closed the back door and so we -- I think we're doing a good job of keeping clients happy and in the house. And we're doing a good job of getting a bigger share of wallet and being able to offer some of our capital markets and risk management products. So there are some things that we like but there's also I think a backdrop that that part of the market hasn't been seeing robust growth. So, John why don’t you take it from there.
John Fawcett: Yes, so I think that's exactly right. It's been all about loan demand in the middle market and I think particularly the regulatory environment over the last several years has been very constraining in terms of mid market companies just engaging in any kind of expansion or M&A activity. We have had very strong fee growth and very strong deposit growth in our middle market business. And I think as Bruce said, as we turn into 2017 we begin to get some expansion in the economy. The early indicators coming out of the management teams and the Boards of the middle market companies is much more bullish in terms of where they want to take their businesses. One of the results of the slack on demand in the middle market has been incredible in terms of competition and very, very, very tough pricing environment. So we've been disciplined in terms of where we do want to play and we've seen a little bit of a downward calibration of loan growth because of that. The other thing we're doing and I think people may have seen it is we've hired a team down in the Southeast to expand our business. Geographically it will be aimed slightly higher than the middle market at the outset because we're focused on credit quality as we move into a new region. But we are anticipating significant client account growth as we go into 2017 and the years beyond. So we are more optimistic than we were this time last year in terms of the environment that we are operating in and we are confident that our products and services are resonating well with our clients.
Matthew Burnell: Okay, and then for the second question I am just curious, you mentioned the higher rates potentially affecting demand on the commercial side for loan growth, looking on the consumer side presumably the consumer would be a little bit less affected by a 25 or 50 basis point increase in rates over the next year or so. But at what level of rates do you think consumers might begin to rethink the incremental dollar of debt that they put on to their balance sheet are we ways away from that or perhaps not so much?
Brad L. Conner: This is Brad. I think that really depends on the asset class is the answer. I think you're close to that point in mortgage because there's been a lot of momentum taken out of the mortgage refi market over the last year or so. So you are probably close to that point in mortgage. I think there's quite a bit of runway left on the education refi loan now. Certainly there will tranches to that. Most of what we refinanced in education loans were refi people out of fixed rate loans. So you kind of look at tranche over that but there's an enormous untapped market. So I think we're still quite a ways away from taking a significant piece of the market away. But those are really the two areas with mortgage refinance and student refinance where we see we might see some dampening as rates rise.
Bruce Van Saun: And I would also add to that, that in terms of credit card debt, I would say that is more a function of how people -- what people's outlook is than actually sensitivity to the interest rates there. So if in fact people feel that we have a little bit higher growth rate to look forward to for the next couple of years, that unemployment is at low levels and will continue to fall then I think the confidence of individuals to go out and buy things and sometimes finance on revolving debt is higher notwithstanding if the overall cost of debt is moving around.
Brad L. Conner: I completely agree with Bruce and by the way I would say that same thing holds true in the small business space. So we have seen very limited demand for small business loans over the last year mainly from a confidence perspective and if that comes back they are probably less sensitive to interest rate and we might see some loan demand that comes from this improved confidence.
Matthew Burnell: Thanks for the color.
Operator: And our next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.
John Pancari: Good morning
Bruce Van Saun: Hi.
John Pancari: I am sorry if I missed the comment on this at all earlier in the call but when it comes to the tax reform that could be coming under the Trump regime can you just give us your thoughts on how much you think could ultimately accrete to the bottom line at Citizens whether it be through any tax benefit or tax advantage investments that go away or if you're going to spend any of that potential benefit? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: I think most of it falls through actually John, we're operating with the Federal rate of 35 and if you got to something like 25 or 20 that would be a meaningful benefit to I think the whole regional banking group since we're all hovered around maybe 28 to 32 as our tax rate. There's little global allocation of resources that we have going on. So what we're left with is really investing in Federal tax credit programs or State tax planning and it really doesn't move the needle down that far from the Federal rates. So the big benefit is to get that Federal rate lower and I don't think the Federal credit programs since they're generally seen to promote investing in something's that are socially good such as alternative energy or low income housing. I'm not sure they're going to be negatively impacted but we'll have to wait and see how that plays out.
John Pancari: Okay, got it, thanks Bruce and related to that though, I feel like a broken record asking this on lot of these calls but it's important to get your take. Do you think that in that benefit that you do expect to accrete to the bottom line ends up getting competed away by the industry at all?
Bruce Van Saun: I don't know I mean John I’ll ask your view on this but I have seen some folks say that if you went into a credit relationship for example with a corporate you would try to get an after tax rate of return. If the tax rate goes down then you can offer the credit at lower spreads. I don't think that's the way the world works because I think the credit right now is offered very thin in terms of returns and the only way you can justify extending the credit is by having an overall broader relationship where you’re getting a cash management or you're getting to participate in their capital market needs or other needs. And so I think the industry would hopefully hold their discipline there and say gosh, this is good. We're going to see an overall improvement on the return on these relationships. John?
John Fawcett: I think that's exactly right and as we compete on the credit side every day we're competing in the public market the non-bank and other banks and as Bruce said I think pricing is very thin in terms of where margins hit today. So I don't think you’re going to see any kind of tax effective change in the returns we generated.
John Pancari: Got it, thank you. If I could just ask one more I know you commented on your deposit pricing and your efforts around that, can you just remind us what has been the data that you've seen so far from the recent Fed hike and then your expectation how that could play out if we see incremental hikes this year?
Bruce Van Saun: And we've had extremely low betas which you would expect early on with particularly the December 15th hike. They were close to zero. I think hike that just occurred is probably maybe 15% to 20%. It is probably a little lower on the consumer side and a little more than that on the commercial side but kind of blending out to those levels. And I think you'll see a very gradual retracement up towards a beta that kind of overall is probably 55% to 60% as you go back to a normalized natural rate. But I think you'll still see if there's a June hike beta that maybe 30 or 35 or something like that and just kind of inching your way back towards that kind of through the rate hike cycle overall level.
John Pancari: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Kenneth Zerbe: Hey, thanks, good morning. You guys had actually some pretty good growth in commercial real estate just wondered, are you able to tell that you're actually seeing a benefit from some of the increased regulatory scrutiny on some of the smaller weaker SIRI lenders I mean is that a factor in driving your SIRI growth or is it just not really relevant for you?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, I don't think that's palpable and I'll let Don throw some color here. But I think as I said before when we were owned by RBS we really stopped doing new lending and started to run our book down. And then as we embarked on our journey to independence we said boy, we're way underweight where peers are in commercial real estate and we turned the shop closed sign to shop open. We turned it around and went back to many of our long standing relationships and said hey, we're playing again and we want to develop the relationship and we're here to stay. And so a lot of this growth that we've experienced has been on the back of both strong growth in the market but then also regaining some of that lost market share. So I say that's really why we've been able to come in kind of mid to high teens for two years in a row. When I look out the next year I think we will probably be closer to 10% at those levels but we still think that there's interesting projects to do. The money might be a little more circumspect with the higher rates but we still see good fundamental demand and we've rebuilt those relationships with developers and added some new ones to boot. So Don you…
Donald H. McCree: Like I said the only thing I will add to it is we have hired some key people which we've been able to build the franchise again. I think and the other thing I'd say is we have maintained a really high level of discipline about what we would do in terms of pricing structures. So we've actually seen returns in the real estate business creep up as we've grown. So we've been very disciplined in terms of what we've been targeting. And I would say that the only thing with the margin in terms of competitive environment we stay pretty consistent through the year and we grew our book pretty straight line through the year. We saw some people kind of pull away a little bit from the market as they filled up their real estate baskets towards the end of the year. So we might have benefited slightly at the margin at the end of the year. But as Bruce said it's really about reinvigorating the franchise, doing some key hires, and then being consistent in the marketplace.
Kenneth Zerbe: Alright, perfect, thank you very much.
Operator: And the next question will come from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffrey. Please go ahead.
Kevin Barker: Good morning, you guys mentioned that you had a couple rate hikes in your outlook for NIM going forward but you also made a mention that you assume the continued steepness of the yield curve, are your assuming that the yield curve stays where it is or it continues to steepen from current levels?
Bruce Van Saun: Well if you look at the guidance page that we showed, we showed that kind of ten year in a 250 to 275 range. So, I think there would likely be a parallel shift if we have a mid-year hike. But it could just be kind of stay where it is. But that's kind of NIM here. We break out on one of the slides what the impact is of having the curve move up so that the ten years in a 240 to 250 range and we would anticipate that it's likely to stay there and then potentially drift up. So we didn't see that happen in 2016. We actually saw, ten year plummet all the way down to 150 to 160 which created some real headwinds. But at this point with the ten years where it is and the curve where it is, one of the nice things we have going on is that as mortgage cash flow comes in off the securities portfolio we're putting it back out at rates that are either neutral or slightly accretive to what's coming off the books. And so that's a real help. So, that is baked into our forecast and let's hope that that's what we see.
Kevin Barker: And then also on the auto portfolio I understand net charge offs were up roughly 27 basis points on a year-over-year basis and you mentioned about 70 basis points was normalized last quarter. Do you have a new view on a normalized level given the changes in your methodology on assessing auto credit?
Bruce Van Saun: You are talking about the new charge off rate. Charge off rate yes, should be in the low 50's would be our expectation. I don't -- I think we had this one time change in terms of how we were accounting for the repossessions which is now behind us and I think we are anticipating stability in the auto charge off rate going forward.
Ellen A. Taylor: Yeah, Kevin I will just add, if you look at our NPLs as a forward indicator of sort of charge off levels going forward, we think they're at normalized level this quarter.
Kevin Barker: So absent the methodology change where would the charge off level come in?
Ellen A. Taylor: In auto that would have been roughly -- to our total charge.
Bruce Van Saun: Are you talking auto Kevin…
Kevin Barker: In auto portfolio in particular.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes auto, yeah I think to this quarter it would have been in the neighborhood of 10 to 12 basis points for auto.
Kevin Barker: Okay.
Operator: And our next question will come from David Eads with UBS.
David Eads: Hi, good morning. I think you talked about expanding some of these consumer lending programs, the dividends and I think you're going to announce another one obviously the other one seems to be going pretty well. Can you just give a little more color on kind of the trajectory for that, whether it continues growing at where some of the levels where it is growing now and how large you kind of like that portfolio to total kind of secured consumer portfolio to get?
Bruce Van Saun: I’ll start and pass to Brad but I think we've had a two pronged strategy here. So one is the partnership model where we're aligning ourselves with partners and helping them offer the installment credit to their customers. So Apple driven are two of the examples of that and had very nice growth with the Apple balances and I think they're -- they feel that we're doing a good job in terms of the customer experience. So that's been a great relationship and we've kind of wedded the whistle here and said there's another one coming soon. So you will just pay attention but we have another one in the works, but that's one factor. The other factor has been on just the personal unsecured direct product that we're offering through the branches and direct mail largely to the footprint and it's targeting folks who have high revolving debt balances who can have a debt consolidation opportunity into a personal unsecured loan that offers a more attractive interest rate. And we've seen really good take up on that and I think again there we’re being very selective, one of the things that's consistent across these programs is a very strong credit discipline trying to keep the FICA scores well ahead of 750. And so I think the risk adjusted returns look pretty good for both sides of the equation. But they're still running room so I think you'll see similar growth to what we've seen this year again next year. We're not bumping up against any limits. One of the things that we have that we wish we didn't have is a relatively smallish credit card portfolio. So when you look at that straight unsecured this is another way to play that game and to get in that game and do it in a way that is more accretive more quickly than if we were trying to build up the card book. So Brad…
Brad L. Conner: Bruce I think you covered it extremely well. I think we would expect new growth rates to be somewhere in the range of what we've seen in the last few quarters. The organic demand for the Apple like programs continues to be there when I say organic we have retailers coming to us wanting to talk about the program. We do expect to add another program very soon and I would say there's a pipeline building of people that are interested. So the opportunity is there, we're being incredibly disciplined to just monitor the overall credit results. So far they look great. It is a very high prime customer base that we're dealing with so continued good opportunity.
David Eads: Alright, great Then maybe one quick follow up, on deposit beta, looking at the NII outlooks supplied on slide 29 where you have your loan yield and then a higher deposit cost is about half of that, is that implying that you have kind of baked in something like a 50% deposit beta in the NII outlooks slide and could that be conservative or how do those dynamics play out?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, I think that there could be some conservatism built into that. I think it's not just the deposit beta there is also the fact that we're growing the loan and deposit base 2X versus client. So it's hard to kind of discern is it just from the yield curve impact versus the fact that we are growing deposits a bit faster than peers. But I think that's what's in that and the good news there is that the NIM should still expand in a fairly robust fashion
David Eads: Thanks for the color.
Operator: And we’ll go to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Kenneth Usdin: Thanks, good morning. Hey, Bruce with the really good progress you're now you're making on ROE and your medium term goal of 10%. Given your expectation for rate hikes to happen just wondering if you could give us any color in terms of do you have a line of sight now on when you think 10% is doable now that we're kind of getting in ear shot of it?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, I've been fairly consistent that I'm not -- I don't want to get pinned on this because there's been a lot of anticipation of rate hikes or yield curve movement that hasn't happened. But I guess just as background if you look at the trajectory we are on, we've added about 4% over three years to the ROTCE with very little of any rate benefit. And year-on-year the ROTCE was up to eight four in the fourth quarter and that's up 1.7% from where it was in the fourth quarter of 2015. And we've had really no rate hike benefit in that. So it's clearly possible that we're in striking distance of the 10% ROTCE if we continue to execute well and we get some hikes that help provide a little bit of tailwind. But again I'm not going to put a line in the sand and chase it. I just think if we keep doing what we're doing, we keep executing well the ROTCE is moving in the right direction and we'll get there hopefully reasonably soon.
Kenneth Usdin: Okay, and then second question just on credit which just continues to be really good and I know I heard the comments about expecting some normalization but where at all would you even see normalization. It seems like you could still have it done with the way that the underlying trends are going where would you even expect any changes to be happening underneath on the credit side?
Bruce Van Saun: I would, the normalization to me is probably more in the provision line than it is in charge offs. So we saw a little bit of movement in the commercial side this year from basically nothing to maybe 10 basis points that cannot move into a 10 to 15 basis point level in 2017 sure. But I still think it's -- we don't see any big migrations or anything but you've been living on the good side of life for a long time so you should expect I think a little move higher. On the consumer side we've basically had less good assets from a credit quality standpoint like our non-core and service by others running off. And we are replacing it with really high prime and super prime Ed refi and some of this unsecured which I think is helping to also improve the overall credit quality on the consumer side. But we had at those kind of clean ups have occurred and those run down have occurred, we've benefited from that in terms of having offset to the normal provision bill that you would expect as you're growing the loan book the way we are growing the loan books. So when we give our outlook for next year I think there might be a little bit of that -- less of that back book clean up effect that means that you could see more of a reserve build. But I really don't see tremendous movement at all in the charge off rates.
Kenneth Usdin: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of I have Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Geoffrey Elliott: Hello, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. On the partnerships that adding Apple being one but I know there are a few offers, what are you watching there to make sure that you don't run into credit issues down the line, what are the kind of early indicators that you can focus on to make sure if you do one of those partnerships and it doesn't work out, you pay it back pretty quickly?
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah, I think the answer to that is the traditional credit measures metrics, right. So, the first is through the door of credit quality so we were at that income ratio, the FICO score through the credit metrics which look extraordinary and then we are incredibly diligent around looking at the early loss emergence curves. So, what these early stage delinquencies look like if any we have the early loss emergence curves look like, we can get a feel for the loss emergence current versus what we priced for then in three to four months of the origination and I would say we just feel very good about that up until this point in time. We've got over a year under our belt now with the Apple program. So we are starting to get a really good feel for how these things, how these things mature and develop over time and they are relatively short term assets. So you get a pretty good feel really on.
John Fawcett: Yeah and I would just add some color that it seems hard that you can achieve this. But we're achieving it. It's almost what I would refer to as the hat trick for two years. But we are you know focused on improving our asset yields, improving the risk adjusted returns on these portfolios, and actually seeing if our stress losses picture can improve and we've actually achieved that. And it's partly because we've run off some of the higher risk stuff and we’re replacing it with better quality stuff. And so that’s been really impactful on the consumer side to be able to achieve that.
Brad L. Conner: Just one more thing to add to Bruce our standard model calls for risks sharing with our partner as well so there's a vested interest in our partner in and through the quality which is a big factor in these programs.
Geoffrey Elliott: And just to follow up on that, there is only one Apple and there are lots of banks out there. So when you're competing for this sort of partnership, what is it that sets you apart, there must be something that you are doing different or better or pitching better that means they want to partner with you rather than somebody else so...?
Bruce Van Saun: On the -- I think this sounds very basic but I know it’s true which is being able to provide extraordinary customer experience. Apple in particular of all the partners that we are working with and expecting this to be a value add program and expect us to be able to provide a customer service level that's consistent with the brand and that their own expectation and I think we've been able to do that. We are getting very good feedback from our partners that we are doing that well and I think that's the key. And obviously understanding the credit risk as well.
John Fawcett: I think it how we do business, how we look to partner in line with the customer objectives has been good. And I think we’re of the size that we can -- these are very big important relations to us and so we put a lot into making sure that we're doing a good job.
Geoffrey Elliott: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Scott Valentin with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Scott Valentin: Thanks my questions have been asked and answered. Thank you.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay.
Operator: And no further questions at this time.
Bruce Van Saun: So, great. Very much appreciate everybody dialing in today. We do appreciate your interest and we look forward to another year of focused execution. So, have a great day.
Operator: And that concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-10-21 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Daniel, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And following the presentation, we'll conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor: Thanks so much, Daniel, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today on the call. We're going to begin things with our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and Eric Aboaf providing overview of our third quarter results. And then we're going to open the call up for questions. We're really pleased to have Brad Conner, our Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking with us this morning. I'd like to remind you that you can find our earnings materials on the website at investor.citizensbank.com. There is a presentation there that we're going to walk through. The lawyers have asked me to also remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risk and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those expectations in our SEC filings, including the 8-K that we filed today. We also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and the reconciliations of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and in the earnings release material. And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Bruce.
Bruce Saun: Okay. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for dialing into our call this morning. We reported some very strong results today as we continued to execute well on our turnaround strategy for Citizens. Eric will take you through all the key numbers and color in a moment, but let me call out some of the highlights. EPS for the quarter was $0.56, but that included $0.04 of what we refer to as notable items, the TDR sale gain, partially offset by several charges and write-downs. The underlying adjusted result of $0.52 per share was up 13% linked quarter and 30% year-on-year, really terrific. The good momentum we had in Q2 continued into Q3, and the environment broke our way with good capital markets and global markets activity levels, a bump in LIBOR rates, and a lessening drag from the long end of the curve. Our team is executing very well. We continue to run the bank better for all of our stakeholders. We remain very focused on delivering a differentiated superior customer experience as the key to our long-term success. It is nice to see ROTCE reach 8%. We've delivered the controllable part of our original ROTCE block. It's the lower for longer rates environment that has held us back from even better results. But rest assured, we are not waiting around for rates to rise. We are focused on continuous improvement. We delivered 450 basis points of positive operating leverage year-on-year, adjusted basis, and our efficiency ratio has improved by 3% to 63%. We're getting some lift in fees, as the investments that we've patiently making are starting to show some traction. Capital markets and mortgage in particular had strong quarters. We did a good job on net recruiting. We added 47 mortgage LOs in Q3 and 11 financial consultants in wealth. It will be important to stay focused and to continue to execute well in Q4 and in 2017. We can't expect these types of sequential EPS jumps every quarter, but it's pleasing to see the hard work is paying off. With that, let me turn it over to Eric.
Eric Aboaf: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results highlight strong progress, as we continued to grow our balance sheet, deliver robust positive operating leverage, and smartly manage our capital base. Our key metrics continue to improve nicely: EPS growth, efficiency ratio, and ROTCE, and this marks the ninth straight quarter that we delivered positive operating leverage. Our earnings of $0.56 on a GAAP basis includes some notable items that we've detailed on page four of the earnings presentation. As previously announced, as part of our focus on optimizing the balance sheet, we completed the sale of $310 million of home equity and mortgage loans classified as Troubled Debt Restructuring at a pre-tax gain of $72 million. As part of that work, what we did in conjunction with the TDR Transaction, we conducted a broad technology and operational review related to the home equity business. We ended up writing off some software and adjusting some legacy processes to enhance customer experience and outcomes. The cost of these items was $8 million, which resulted in a remaining benefit from the gain of $64 million. A further balance sheet optimization initiative resulted in a charge of $16 million, as we completed a deep-dive review of our Asset Finance business and elected to put certain single-product leasing-only client relationships into runoff that were tied for our legacy RBS business model. These relationships don't fit our target client profiles and return hurdles. In connection with this type of decision, our experience is that clients are less likely to work with us to resolve issues regarding the value of the collateral. And this fact coupled with the recent decline in several aircraft valuations resulted in impairment write-downs of $16 million on the residual values on the leases. And lastly, we incurred a $17 million expense associated with our TOP III expense initiatives related to severance and consultants. So, with that, let's take a closer look at our third quarter 2016 earnings presentation starting with page five. These GAAP results include the notable items in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we generated net income to common stockholders of $290 million and EPS of $0.56 per share, which was up 19% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. On page six, you can see the highlights of our third quarter adjusted financial results, which exclude the impact of notable items. We believe this view provides the best picture of underlying momentum. Net income to common of $271 million is up 12% sequentially and 27% year-over-year. We grew net interest income $22 million or 2% linked quarter as we continued to deliver solid loan growth and held them stable. The NIM performance was better than expected as we saw a better an anticipated lift from LIBOR and continued strong results in shifting portfolio mix. We also continued to make progress on fee income front with adjusted non-interest income up 4% sequentially, driven by strength in mortgage banking and service charges and fees. At the same time, we held expenses relatively stable linked quarter despite our continued investments in frontline personnel. And credit continues to be benign as provision expense was down $4 million. So, on a linked quarter basis, adjusted EPS increased $0.06 or 13%. Compared to adjusted third quarter 2015 results, net income to common stockholders increased $58 million or 27% with earnings per share up 30%. We grew NII 10%, reflecting strong loan growth and an 8 basis point improvement to NIM. Given higher loan yields and short-term rates, ROTCE was 8.6% in the quarter and adjusted ROTCE hit 8% for the quarter, up 1.4 percentage points from a year ago. On pages seven and eight, you can see the drivers of our NIM performance this quarter. With one month LIBOR increasing and the continuing mix shift within the retail loan book to more attractive categories, we picked up 3 basis points on loan yields. However, we gave up 1 basis point of spread in the investment portfolio and deposit cost increased 2 basis points, largely tied to the commercial book. Year-over-year, we picked up 12 basis points on asset yield, reflecting pricing initiatives and improved portfolio mix along with the impact of an increase in interest rates. Additionally, our term funding costs rose by 3 basis points tied to the higher rates and more term debt issuance. The strong performance over the past year, in spite of much lower long rates and a flatter yield curve, is a testament to how effectively we are executing on our optimization strategies. Our asset sensitivity ended the quarter at 5.8% and a 200 basis points gradual rise scenario compared with 6.8% as of June 30. We have reduced our asset sensitivity modestly and expect it continue to be at the low end of the 6% to 7% range given the likelihood of the pace of Fed tightening will be slower than past cycles. Turning to non-interest income on slide nine, you can see we continued to make progress. On a reported basis due to the impact of notable items, we grew non-interest income 23% from third quarter 2015. Excluding this impact, non-interest income was up 4% year-over-year. Note that the prior-year quarter had $60 million in benefits from a branch-sale gain and the card accounting change. Results were okay by another strong capital markets quarter where we continue to see nice traction in loan syndication as well as the impact of establishing our own broker/dealer post RBS separation. We're also regaining ground in mortgage banking. This quarter's results reflect continued improvement in our conforming application mix as well as a decrease in pipeline turn times, all of which helped lead to higher loan sale gains and improved spreads on higher refinance volumes. You can also see continued improvement in service charges and fees with progress in both consumer and commercial, which were up 3% and 5%, respectively, with a benefit from higher volumes and improved pricing. Our card fees were down year-over-year due to the card reward accounting change. Trust and investment services fees were down slightly. Investment sales were up 14% year-over-year, in line with higher FC count. But as we continue to focus our wealth management efforts on achieving a better mix of transaction and fee-based recurring revenue, our commission revenue is lighter. Other income increased $73 million, almost entirely due to the impact of the TDR Transaction pre-tax gain. Let's take a closer look at expenses on slide 10. GAAP non-interest expense increased $40 million or 5% linked quarter, including $36 million of notable items largely in salaries and benefits and outside services. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expense increased $4 million, roughly flat with the previous quarter. Salaries and employee benefits expense were down by $11 million. 2Q 2016 included higher payroll taxes and benefits associated with incentive payments. In addition, we brought our head count down by 200, driven by our TOP efficiency initiatives. Offsetting the reductions in salaries and benefit, our outside services expense was up from relatively low second quarter levels, largely related to higher technology outsourcing and consumer loan product origination costs. As expected, we also saw some more modest increases in equipment and software amortization, given our infrastructure investments as well as a $4 million increase in FDIC insurance costs. In effect, the puts and takes offset each other and we were left with a cost of the FDIC increase. On a year-over-year basis, our non-interest expense increased $69 million or 9% driven by the notable items. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expense was up 4%, salaries and benefits are up $17 million, largely related to growth initiatives as well as higher revenue related incentive costs. Our head count is down by almost 200 year-over-year, which reflects our efficiency initiatives more than offset an increase in the Consumer Banking sales force, largely in mortgage and wealth. In third quarter 2016, we continue to make progress against our goals, enhancing the bank's efficiency, even as we continue to reinvest in the business to generate future growth. Our efficiency ratio of 63% improved by 3 percentage points year-over-year on an adjusted basis and 5% over the last two years, as we continue to consistently deliver positive operating leverage. If we look at our balance sheet on page 11, average earning assets were up $8.7 billion year-over-year or 7%. We generated 10% commercial loan growth and retail loans were up 5% across multiple product lines. Average deposits increased 6%, reflecting our ability to grow lower cost core deposits. And you can see that our borrowed funds increased $2.4 billion, which reflects growth in long-term senior debt and long-term FHLD borrowings, which replace retail and short-term FHLD borrowings as we continue to strengthen our funding profile. Let's move to page 12 where you can see that Consumer Banking contributed 7% loan growth year-over-year and improved yields 22 basis points. Loan growth was driven by education finance, mortgage and other unsecured retail. Consumer loan yields have increased each quarter this year, reflecting our team's initiatives to improve risk-adjusted returns and the benefit of higher interest rates. On slide 13, you can see that Commercial Banking experienced another strong quarter. Commercial loans increased 11% year-over-year, with continued momentum in Mid-corporate and Industry Verticals, Commercial Real Estate and Franchise Finance. Our commercial team has improved loan yields by 25 basis points, which reflect an increase in LIBOR as well as the more attractive mix. Slide 14, deposit costs were up 3 basis points linked quarter, driven by strong commercial deposit growth and rising short-term interest rates, and we are comfortable with this increase. We will continue to find opportunities to balance our desire to grow deposit with the need to defend our margins. On a year-over-year basis, deposit costs increased 2 basis points as our continued pricing discipline largely offset higher short-term rates. Next, let's move over to slide 15 and cover credit. Overall credit quality remained broadly stable during the quarter despite a rise in commercial charge-offs and non-performing loans tied to energy and commodity-related borrowers. We feel good about our reserve levels in the energy portfolio, but expect to see some modest migration to charge-offs and NPL notwithstanding higher oil and gas prices. The remainder of the commercial and retail portfolios continue to demonstrate broad stability and the outlook for credit performance in 4Q remains positive. The allowance to loans ratio of 1.18% was relatively stable with the prior quarter. Our allowance to NPL coverage decreased to 112%, given the bump in NPLs, which have already been incorporated into our reserves. On slide 16, you can see that we continue to have strong capital and liquidity position. This quarter as part of our 2016 CCAR plan, we purchased $250 million of shares from the market at an average cost of $22.60, returning $313 million to shareholders including dividend. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.3%, which reflects our efforts to bring our capital structure more in line with peers. As a reminder, our CCAR plan includes the ability to repurchase up to $690 million of shares during the CCAR horizon, so more to follow. On slide 17, we provide an update on our key initiatives tied to our turnaround plan. We believe it's important to assess our progress against these initiatives each quarter. We're continuing to deliver [indiscernible] balance sheet growth across the platform. In consumer, we continue to engage with customers across multiple channels and we are regaining momentum in mortgage and wealth, although we still have room to improve. In commercial, we are seeing a lift in capital markets, benefiting from the establishment of our broker/dealer and this quarter we took steps to refocus our efforts in Asset Finance. All-in-all, good execution across these initiatives is driving our strong momentum. On slide 18, our TOP programs continue to deliver important benefits. As a reminder, the company launched Tapping our Potential in 2013 with a companywide bottoms-up focus and we estimate it to continuing to harvest ideas to deliver improving revenue and expense trends every year. These programs have been key to our continued momentum in operating leverage and enabled us to reduce staff in non-revenue areas and streamlined end-to-end processes, while ensuring that we continue to generate good revenue growth, notwithstanding the low rate environment. With TOP II, we're nearing completion of the program with roughly $50 million in expense base as well as providing nearly $50 million in revenue benefits on an annualized basis for year-end 2016. We kicked off TOP III this summer and have already made good progress across all the initiatives. In commercial, we completed the end-to-end portfolio management and processes work and are focused on leveraging data to improve customer retention. In consumer, we are particularly pleased with our unsecured lending initiatives and we're also digging in on the brand strategy, and we're ahead of plan on taxes, some of which you see this quarter. Bottom line, we are well on our way to delivering on the $90 million to $100 million we are targeting by the end of 2017. Let's turn to our fourth quarter outlook on slide 19. We expect to continue to drive attractive balance sheet growth and are targeting average loan growth of roughly 1.5% to 2% over the third quarter. We also expect net interest margin to be relatively stable. We expect some continued improvement in LIBOR, along with a benefit from continued shift in asset mix and the benefit of pay-fixed swap runoff to drive these results. On the fee income front, we expect puts and takes to result in a relatively stable trends from our adjusted third quarter base of $368 million. We expect capital markets to continue to post strong results while mortgage fees should be down somewhat from exceptional third quarter levels. Additionally, we may generate some relatively modest securities gains to reposition the portfolio for next year. We plan to continue our discipline on expenses and expect a modest increase given seasonality. Overall, we remain committed to generating strong positive operating leverage, which has been the key to our improvement in EPS and ROTCE. We expect underlying credit to remain favorable, but expect to see a modest build in the quarter for loan growth. And finally, as we continue to grow loans and return capital to shareholders through both dividends and repurchases, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to around 11.2%. Overall, we're pleased that we remain broadly on track for our 2016 full year operating earnings guidance we provided back in January. A strong balance sheet growth and in performance, good expense discipline and favorable credit has more than offset lower than projected fee income and the lack of Fed funds hike. Overall, this is a reflection of strong execution and our mindset of continuous improvement. So, with that, let me turn it back to Bruce.
Bruce Saun: Well, thanks, Eric. Let me just close by acknowledging the good work that Eric has done during his 18 months with us at Citizens. This will be his last earnings call for us, but he'll work through mid-December, staying focused on the 2017 budget and contributing to our initiatives. We're pleased to welcome back former CFO, John Fawcett, from retirement, who step in as interim CFO and help through the year-end work. I'm very confident that we'll be able to attract a high quality permanent successor and Eric, I'm confident that you'll make a very positive impact over at State Street. So, with that, Daniel, let's open it up to questions.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ken Zerbe: Great. Thank you. Good morning.
Bruce Saun: Hi, there.
Ken Zerbe: I guess, a question on the net interest margin. Obviously, I heard you say that it benefited from the higher LIBOR this quarter. I think I heard your expectations with the LIBOR is going to continue to increase. So, from a planning perspective or forecast perspective, if LIBOR does start to tick lower for whatever reason, does that also implies there is a direct correlation to NIM or is there any way to lock-in those gains? Or because I think you also – or Eric may have also mentioned like reducing asset sensitivity, was that part of this? Just want to make sure I'm clear on if there's anything you can do to protect that NIM?
Eric Aboaf: Ken, it's Eric. I think the NIM for fourth quarter we expect to be relatively stable. I think LIBOR will clearly be in a tight range. It may float up a little bit in anticipation of the Fed rate rise. But I think there is little movement that we expect beyond that that I think you or others should be concerned about. I think what we have is we consider the fourth quarter guidance that we gave is we might get a little bit of uptick from the frontend LIBOR, which helps reprice our – with the pricing on our commercial loan book, right. We have some old swaps rolling off, so that will be a tailwind. And against that, we just have the backend long-term rates continuing to flow through the securities and the fixed rate product portfolio. And so, net-net, there's kind of offset between those, and so we expect a roughly flattish fourth quarter.
Bruce Saun: Yeah. I would add the other positive tailwind is our efforts to just keep shifting the mix towards better risk-adjusted return portfolio. So, we're not really that sensitive to LIBOR. Ken, I feel pretty confident in that outlook for the fourth quarter.
Ken Zerbe: Got it. Okay. That's pretty clear. Okay. So it's just sensible even without LIBOR expectations changing, okay. And then the other question I had just maybe more of a broader question on the TOP III expenses. Obviously, you took some cost this quarter. I am aware that your expense guidance includes the underlying TOP III cost, but just maybe help us get a sense like what does it cost to implement, say, the TOP III program ex the one-timers this quarter?
Eric Aboaf: Ken, I think the way I would describe it is, there are really two types of costs that we incur as we prepare for expense efficiency work, right. The first is that we do a lot of legwork both internally and with some amount of external consulting support to determine what kind of opportunities that we have in which areas of businesses and functions and which processes and which parts of our business. And so, there is some kind of preparatory work and you saw that come through, and I think we called that out in the expenses, the higher expense in this quarter, which cost about $6 million, right. In addition, once we do that preparatory work, we need to take severance and reserve effectively for the anticipated head count actions. And then, as those actions take place, those costs bang up against the reserve and you won't see the impacts of that in the forward period. So, bottom line is you'll see most of the expense preparation and severance this quarter, that's what we've called out. We don't expect that to be significant going forward, but you'll start to see the benefit build over the coming months, as we actually effectuate some of those head count actions in particular, which will benefit starting in the fourth quarter and more and more into the coming year.
Bruce Saun: Yeah. I would just add to that, Ken, if you look at slide 18 where we detailed the TOP III program and break it out into revenues, expenses and taxes, you've got pretty much those costs associated with the bottom two with expenses and the tax work already reflected. On the revenue initiatives, the one that we'll have some costs that go with that is the unsecured lending initiatives. So, as we seek to build that portfolio, we'll have some marketing costs that go with that. But that will just flow into the run rate, and those benefits that we're showing are net benefits. So, I think to Eric's point, we've reflected most of those costs at this point.
Ken Zerbe: All right. Perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.
John Pancari: Good morning.
Bruce Saun: Hi.
John Pancari: On the margin, just a couple of quick things there. Kind of back to the yields question around loans. Barring any incremental move on LIBOR and barring any move by the Fed, generally what is your expectation for the trend in underlying loan yields? Is it still up because of the tailwind on swaps, on the roll-off, or is the downside pressure still there as new money yields are coming in below portfolio yield? Thanks.
Eric Aboaf: John, it's Eric. Let me give you the color. I think we expect loan yields to continue to inch upwards. The biggest driver of that has been, over the last couple of quarters, our mix shift in particular in consumer. And earlier in the year, it was the uptick in LIBOR, which helped the commercial loan yield. So, as we think about fourth quarter, right, we think we can continue to drive that mix shift, which is worth a couple basis points of yield on our book. And then we'll just have to see whether LIBOR floats up or not. I think all you have to consider is that as we grow the balance sheet, we also incur some deposit cost and, at this rate of growth, those inch up a little bit as well. We're, obviously, actively managing that. But between the two of those effects, I think we expect to be roughly constant into the fourth quarter.
John Pancari: Okay. Yeah, thank you, Eric. And that does dovetail right into my related question on that was the deposit costs, they did inch up this quarter. And again, is that – that's just given the overall growth and the fact that you don't have a ton of extra room there on your loan to deposit ratio?
Eric Aboaf: Yeah. I think the way I would describe that is that if you're growing deposits at 3%, 4% at market rates, which many other banks are doing, then you don't expect much growth in deposit cost because it's kind of BAU going forward. I think we are growing our balance sheet at closer to 7% on the loan side. We need to fund that with deposits. We found – we've made a conscious choice to increase deposit balances on the commercial side. We found that there are lower costs there than retail in aggregate and on the margin. And so what you'll find this quarter, for example, we added north of $2.5 billion of deposits quarter-on-quarter, even more year-on-year. When you're growing on a year-on-year basis of commercial deposits in 10% to 15% range, what ends up happening is you end up paying a little more on some of the new money that you're bringing in. Is it manageable? I think we've demonstrated that it is. But it will trickle through the deposit costs and we'll just continue to be careful as we bring in those funds.
John Pancari: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.
Geoffrey Elliott: Hello. Thank you for taking the question. You've clearly had quite a lot of growth in the other retail category and, I guess, some of that's down to things like the iPhone Upgrade product. Can you give us a sense of what you think the destination looks like in terms of mix? How much further do you shift towards that other retail category?
Bruce Saun: I'll start and then I'll ask Brad to augment. We think that this is a good important element of our mix shift that we were kind of underweight higher yielding portfolios in credit card and in personal unsecured. So we have really a two-pronged effort here. One is the partner financing, which we have with Apple, which may be able to be extended to other partners. And then, we have a direct unsecured effort largely in our footprint, where we think we can also – largely for our credit card consolidation offers get – offer good usable product to our customer. So those initiatives are helping to grow that. I think in the quarter we've grown that about $150 million, which is nice to see, and that's helping to adjust our overall yields favorably. So, Brad, maybe you want to add to that?
Brad Conner: I think that's right, Bruce. And we think there's some opportunity in the other partnership area. The other highlight that I would make in terms of sort of other consumer categories that's been helping fly up the margins on our loan portfolios and student lending, we'll continue to have a lot of good progress there. Our education refi product, there's a lot of demand. Third quarter product because that's seasonally high period for loan demand. So, I think good opportunity in both the student loan space and in the other unsecured space.
Bruce Saun: Yeah.
Geoffrey Elliott: And then, I guess, at the other end of the spectrum on shifting around the loan mix, the aircraft leasing portfolio that you placed into runoff mode. What was the background there? What was behind the decision to move that into the runoff category?
Bruce Saun: Yeah. Maybe I'll start and, Don, you can augment that. But we took a hard look at the overall Asset Finance portfolio. And a lot of the business that we had on the books was sourced by RBS. They were the credit provider to large companies, investment-grade companies, and which was a cross-sell that was actually brought to Citizens as we were part of the same family. And when we stepped back and looked at the book, we said, we've got these large aircraft leases which are usually the sole product we have with those borrowers and we aren't going to really be relevant to those borrowers going forward. So they weren't penciling out from a hurdle rate standpoint and we decided and so on a B III basis, the returns were not very attractive. So we put those into runoff, we'll shrink that book and start to focus more on using leasing as a cross-sell into the middle market and into our Mid-corporate customer base. So, it's really an overall strategic shift and it's basically cleaning up some of the things that are a part of our legacy and our history. But Don, you can maybe add.
Donald McCree: Bruce, I think that's right. And I think it's the last step in the cleanup as we become a public company. Asset Finance is something we've been looking at for the last year, year-and-a-half, and we're really targeting the business completely differently than we have been in the past. And I think it was the one business where we had a very significant mix of non-core Citizens franchise exposures, and this is a cleanup to move those away from the ongoing business.
Bruce Saun: You might, Don, just take the opportunity to talk about some of the other separation initiatives in commercial from RBS because we've made real progress this year in terms of setting up a broker/dealer so we can offer underwriting on our own without RBS, and then also doing a great job of getting a new platform in, in global markets, so we can offer FX and risk management products on our own away from RBS.
Donald McCree: Yeah. And I think I talked about this at the conference about half-a-year ago, which is we were losing portions of our profitability in the commercial bank just because we were paying away good offer spread in the trading rooms and we were paying away portions of our fees on the capital markets side. So, actually completing the infrastructure growth across our dealing runs and also across the growth that you're seeing it come through in the results already and we're highly optimistic as we move forward. So I'd say we're finished in terms of the investment putting away, save a couple of minor items, and we're operating fully independently. Right now, we should be able to capture the full profitability.
Bruce Saun: Great.
Geoffrey Elliott: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Erika Najarian: Hi. Good morning.
Bruce Saun: Hi.
Erika Najarian: I was hoping you could help us think through, if the Fed had raised rates in December, what the impact would be on first quarter net interest margin, based on how your balance sheet is positioned today?
Eric Aboaf: Yeah, Erika. Let me start with that and I think you could go back for broad context as to how this affected us last year because if you remember it was a literally 11 months ago, right?
Erika Najarian: Yeah.
Eric Aboaf: And so, soon we'll be to another December month, where the Fed raise rates to 25 basis points and I think you saw some good performance starting into the first quarter. I think mechanically what happens is the Fed rates is raised and then what will tend to play through is that those rates flowed up on a LIBOR basis, the LIBOR rates then are tied to our commercial lending book, 85% of our commercial lending book reprice this. They tend to reprice in arrears, so there will be part of the book will be priced starting at January and other part in February. But we'll get a nice bump into the first quarter as a result. I think what we've previously said is the value of 25 basis points at the front-end of the curve is worth about $65 million. The challenge is, and we've learned that the hard way, I'd say this past year is that as the backend of the curve moves up, down, sideways or twists, that can have some other effects, including some headwinds, and we obviously had good sized headwinds like other banks had on that this year. So I think the question will obviously be, will the Fed raise rates, there's a lot of anticipation there, but there has been anticipation before. And then the question is, what will happen to the rest of the curve.
Bruce Saun: If my memory serves me, Erika, I think our sequential improvement in NIM from Q4 last year to Q1 was about 9 basis points and we attributed about half of that to the Fed bump and about the other half to our own initiatives in terms of asset mix and controlling deposit costs. So, just for reference sake.
Erika Najarian: That's good. Thank you. And just a follow-up to that. To your point, if the Fed raises rates, but there is no change in any other part of the curve, is there enough left on the balance sheet optimization initiatives that you could keep your net interest margin stable at that level for the rest of 2017?
Eric Aboaf: Erika, we're still going through our 2017 planning. As Bruce mentioned, we're spending a good bit of time here with Brad and Don and our Treasurer to do that, and we'll give more fulsome guidance in January when it comes to NIM. What I would say is that a boost in the frontend should be a positive, right, an uptick should help – help with an uptick to NIM. Our loan mix initiative should continue that Brad's been shepherding, so we expect that to be a positive. The challenges on NIM will continue to be intense competition on the commercial side, which Don's team has been navigating through quite well. A little bit of a deposit cost will float up as well if LIBOR comes through and as we grow deposits a bit more quickly than the market. And then it will largely depend on what happens with the backend of the curve. Does the 10-year stay at where it is today, which is certainly a possibility, right, because it flowed back up to where it was – remember, where it was a year ago. It was quite nice when it was at the 2.20% level, not only 2%, but 2.20%. Where is it today where we are or does it move in another direction? I think that's the big open item that I think, to be honest, we'll see more of that develop through December and early January and that will help us give you some good guidance into 2017.
Erika Najarian: Okay. Thank you.
Eric Aboaf: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Ken Usdin: Thanks. Good morning, guys. If I can ask a question on credit, which has stayed very good for you guys and for everybody else. There's a couple of things kind of going on inside the provision. It looks like you still had some of the energy cleanup coming through and then – but also it looks you had high recoveries this quarter and a pretty sizeable commercial side release. And so, I'm just kind of wondering there's a lot of moving parts in there, could you help us understand the kind of magnitude of the delta and provision we could expect going forward and how that ties into the fact that you guys are still growing loans at a really great upper single-digit pace?
Bruce Saun: Look, I think the credit cost, if you look at it across the year has been relatively stable. So, there is some underlying shifts. We had a lower charge-off quarter. Last quarter, we kind of moved back to the levels we were at in the first quarter. We've had inside the – we've had loan growth, which is adding to the provision, so we've had back book cleanup in terms of credit quality, particularly on the consumer side, which has provided an offset to that. So, we've been tracking in a kind of mid-80%s to 90% range. And I think that's a reasonable expectation. We've guided here to very slightly increased provision in Q4 because of the anticipation that we're going to grow loans in the 1.5% to 2% range. But I don't see anything that's troubling or concerning at this point on the credit front.
Ken Usdin: And so, Bruce, as a follow-up, and it just seems like you still have some of that back book improvement that can carry forward as well, where you might be able to still fund the loan growth build with the cleanup on the home equity and some of the legacy stuff that you referred to?
Bruce Saun: Yeah. I think – and we've been reasonably surprised because just when we think that the covered is clean as can be, we still see some things break our way. So, again, to Eric's point, we haven't given yet guidance yet on 2017 and we will see whether – how long we can sustain that into 2017. But I think certainly into Q4 we think that we can have an offset to the loan growth.
Ken Usdin: Understood. Okay. And then just one quick one. As far as the loan growth is concerned, anything changing as far as what you're seeing in terms of the mix of new production and where you want to see the book continue to grow as you look ahead?
Bruce Saun: Well, I think that the shift that you're seeing is all intentional. So, over in the consumer side, we're seeing good growth in our education refinance product, and we're seeing purposeful growth in the personal unsecured side. We've seen I think some very good growth in mortgages, which is helping to offset a little bit of the pay-downs on the HELOC area. And then on the commercial side, we've had some very steady growers throughout the year that kind of larger end of our customer base, the Mid-corporate and Industry Verticals have been growing nicely. Our Franchise Finance business has been growing nicely and Commercial Real Estate has been having steady growth as well. So, I don't think we'll see much change there in terms of the mix and the drivers of that growth, but we're fortunate that we've been able to consistently achieve good loan growth, which has outpaced our peers and we think we can continue that. I don't know, Brad or Don, if want to add to that?
Brad Conner: Not really. I think you covered it well. The only thing that I might add to that is the one area of our portfolio which is somewhat intentional that's not growing is the auto business. We're comfortable with the size, it's a very tight margin business right now, and we're sort of holding that a little flat and the growth is coming in the other areas.
Bruce Saun: Right. Don, anything?
Donald McCree: I think you've got it. I think the place we'd like to see a little stronger growth is our middle market, but it is just very sluggish loan demand in that sector and cleaning it up with other sectors.
Bruce Saun: Yeah. And then leasing, given the repositioning, that's likely going to be a...
Donald McCree: Flattish.
Bruce Saun: ...stable portfolio as well.
Ken Usdin: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Bruce Saun: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Eads with UBS.
David Eads: Hi. Good morning.
Bruce Saun: Hi, David.
David Eads: I know it's fairly early in the process, but I'm curious if you make comments and reactions to the potential changes to CCAR process, taking out the positive test and basically does that change the way you think about how you might – the pace initially bringing down capital ratios and getting more in line with your average?
Bruce Saun: Yeah. I'll start and Eric, I don't know, if you'd chime in. But look, we're pleased to see Governor Tarullo's remarks and an acknowledgement that banks under $250 billion in size don't have to go through some of the same rigor as the larger banks. I think there were a lot of – having said that, there were a lot of advances in terms of approach and risk management that we'll continue. And I think the supervisors would expect us to continue a fair amount of that. But being out of the drama of whether you have a qualitative pass or fail, as they might think in and of itself, it will just go back in the supervisory process. I think our philosophy on gliding down that capital surplus has been found. We're a relatively new company separated from our parent, and so we're still demonstrating our capabilities as an independent bank. We have been in a fortunate position where I'd like to say we could have our cake and eat it too, so we've got very robust loan growth. We have very robust returns of capital to shareholders. And having that capital cushion behind us allows us to continue that, which is really helping to drive these very favorable results. It's important that we get our ROE to higher level so that we can sustain that kind of an approach on a standalone basis once the cushion is gone. So we're really just calibrating how fast to glide that down with what the potential we see out in the marketplace to continue to execute our strategy. Eric, any further remarks?
Eric Aboaf: Yeah. I would just add, in the near term, the focus on putting capital to work in the right places and recycling it from other areas is kind of paramount now and that we can do and we control and I think you've seen evidence of that. I think you've seen how that has actually helped our ROTCE write-off. ROTCE has been driven by operating leverage, but also by this redeployment of capital. And over time, you've seen us slow down on our CET1 ratios, but we're not in a rush and we want to make sure that we run a safe and sound institution. But I think you have seen a trajectory there of about 50 basis points over the past year and that gives you at least some indication for the time being.
David Eads: All right. That's helpful. And then following up on the lease business and the Asset Finance, I noticed that on your strategic initiatives slide, that's still highlighted in yellow. But it sounds like the message is that you're done with carving out any portfolios and now it's just a function of growing the middle market, leasing franchise and kind of growing the revenue opportunities from here, is that correct?
Bruce Saun: Yeah. And so if you think about that portfolio, we had about $6 billion of assets broadly. We've moved about $1 billion of these aircraft leases into non-core and put them into runoff. We have another of our own low yielding book of leases that we're just going to manage down. So I think the steady state portfolio is going to be around low for us, $4 billion to $4.25 billion. And over time, the duration on that portfolio is about four years. We'll continue to turn that and target that towards our existing Citizens customer base. A lot of that was from us, from RBS and we need to actually integrate this into our offerings with our customers. And so, I'd say we call it yellow because we're kind of at the last stage of the thought process to restructure it, and now we have to reorient the business and get the calling in place and the coverage bankers to really be understand the product and kind of have a targeted plan where we can expand the product into that customer base. But I think you should start to see that move towards green, now that we've really figured out what we want to do with it. Don, anything further?
Donald McCree: No. I think that's right. The only other comment I'd make is, one of the reasons we like the leasing business is it's a relatively quick engagement with our clients, particularly where we're dealing with prospects we can begin to do business with them much more quickly than we can, for example, with a revolving credit or a term loan, which tends to take six to 12 months to establish that relationship. So, we think it's a quick turn product, which allows to make some progress on our growth of the client base also.
Bruce Saun: Yeah. Good.
David Eads: All right. Thanks so much.
Bruce Saun: Okay.
Operator: And your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
Vivek Juneja: Hi. Thanks. Great job in moving from 6% ROTCE to 8% very quickly in two quarters. Bruce and Eric, I want to follow up a couple of things. Capital return, what is your thinking now about going above 100%, as you got pretty close this year in the CCAR 2016?
Bruce Saun: Well, we just answered some perspective on that. But again, we'll wait till we get to the next year. I think we've been on a reasonably good glide path in terms of high return to shareholder and also funding robust loan growth and we'll see. We'll see if there is opportunities, I guess, it's less of a litmus test and a barrier than it was in the past, but I think what we've been doing in terms of gliding that CET1 ratio down 50 basis points or 60 basis points a year for the last two years has served us well. And we certainly still have more room to go on that with that strategy, given that kind of the peer average is in the low 10%s and we're in the low 11%s at this point.
Vivek Juneja: Right. And where do you think, just based on 2016 now, where do you expect – if you could just remind us where do you think your B III fully phased in CET1 will end up by next June?
Bruce Saun: Well, I don't think we've guided that yet, Vivek. We have offered 11.2% as of the year-end. And if you look at the strategies that we've employed is we've been going down, let's call it, 50 basis points or 60 basis points. If you ran that out another six months and it's assumed more of the same, that would get you down to something like 10.9% or something, which would have a 10% handle instead of an 11% handle.
Vivek Juneja: All right, okay. A question on the Consumer Banking fee income side. If I look year-on-year, put aside mortgage banking, which is obviously up very nicely, with the volumes, cards, Consumer Banking fee income is still dull. Can you talk a little bit about what you need to do there to get that going in the direction you've been trying to?
Bruce Saun: I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
Vivek Juneja: Consumer Banking fee income. When you look at the consumer segment and look at the noninterest income year-on-year?
Bruce Saun: Yeah. Look, I'll start and Brad, I want you to chime in. But part of this is the card accounting change, Vivek. So, I think you have to really – you better serve to focus on the individual line items, and where we've had some growth in service charges, we've had very strong growth in mortgage. Probably the one disappointing area to-date is on the wealth fee line. Having said that, we feel quite positive about what's happening in our wealth business, so we have a strong new leader for that business and we've had very consistent success now in growing our financial consulting force, we added another 11 this quarter. We've revamped our product set and reoriented the customer targeting more towards mass affluent and affluent, and so we're really focused a bit more on fee-based products than traditional commission products. And that is reflecting a little bit of a drag because you make more money right upfront off your commission products and you build a book on your fee-based products. I'd say proof in the pudding here, our investment sales year-on-year were up 15% versus a year ago, so the sales effort is tracking to the growth in FCs and the better penetration of the customer base, but there is a mix change in the product, which is holding back revenues a little bit for the short term. But in the long run, it's a good thing. Brad?
Brad Conner: Yeah. Listen, on the wealth side, there's just not a lot more to add there. I think you said it exactly right. We feel very good about the underlying drivers. We were adding financial consultants, they are high producing financial consultants, and their sales were strong. As you said, it's just a matter of changing the mix. And then in the long run, that's a good thing. So I think we are little behind what we originally thought. I think we're building the right foundation for us to move forward. The only other comment I'd make on the consumer fees is that the question sort of dismissed the growth that we've had in mortgage and, to some degree, like we saw everybody seeing strong mortgage refinance activity. But I don't want to quickly dismiss that because there is a really strong underwriting trend, we've said it for a few quarters that we had to slow down on our hiring because we had to get our operations where it needed to be. And we feel like we've accomplished that and we've had two really strong quarters of hiring mortgage loan officers. So we do believe even after the mortgage refinance slows a little bit that we'd be able to see pretty strong mortgage deals into the future. So, I think there's some good underlying trends in mortgage as well.
Bruce Saun: Yeah.
Vivek Juneja: Okay. Brad, we'll have to hold you to that next couple of quarters. Thanks.
Bruce Saun: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jesus Bueno with Compass Point.
Manuel Bueno: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Quickly, obviously, it's a seasonally strong quarter for student, but looks like you had a – it looks like you had very good growth there. And you had an emphasis on your in-house product, but if you could just give us an update on how your organic originations were and also on the SoFi purchases for the quarter?
Bruce Saun: Yeah. Brad, do you want to take that? So, student – obviously, ed refi has been really the focus, but the seasonal in Q3. And then also the SoFi relationship where we're continuing our flow agreement with SoFi.
Brad Conner: Yeah. Actually really strong across all three dynamics. So, we talked about it earlier on, which is a really very strong seasonal quarter for in-school. So, we saw a nice pick-up in in-school activity. [indiscernible] it's just a product that it's a matter of continuing to inform consumers about the opportunity and it continues to show good growth and we think there is a lot of opportunities to continue to market that product. And there is a little bit more awareness in the marketplace around...
Bruce Saun: Interestingly, SoFi is helping [indiscernible] which has the halo effect for us.
Brad Conner: That's exactly right. And then, as you said, we did do another SoFi purchase in the third quarter and we continue our relationship with SoFi. So we continue to expect to see good growth in student into the future.
Eric Aboaf: It's Eric. I'd just add that the organic mix is almost 95% organic at this point. So what's happening is while we saw the flow [indiscernible] SoFi across the bank and it's quite high in consumer itself because we have purchases from past years that are starting to mature and roll off, those are just getting replenished with [indiscernible].
Brad Conner: Yeah. As an example, our SCUSA portfolio is really just replenishing runoff and we were 91% – our mix of originations was 91% organic, 9% purchase. So it's a strong organic mix.
Manuel Bueno: Excellent. Thanks for the color there. And just quickly on iUp program. You've had the program there now for a year. I know this quarter we only had a couple weeks of kind of the new iPhone launch sales. But, I guess, how credit-wise, how has that – now that you're a year in, how has that portfolio performed relative to your original expectations? And if you could possibly update us on the kind of breakout of the balances for this quarter and your expectations as we move into the fourth quarter, which is generally heavier drive on sales.
Bruce Saun: I guess, the credit experience has been as expected, so there's nothing noteworthy to report on there. In terms of the breakout, we are really not breaking that out. I think it's fine to just leave that as a category because ultimately we'll have potentially more partners. And then, our direct personal unsecured has very similar yield characteristics. So, we will report that as a group. I'd say, though, that we would expect that iPhone could be a real driver as we head into Q4 here that there should be some good momentum behind that. But there is also a momentum in our personal mailing campaign that we have underway as well. So, we see good momentum across both fronts.
Eric Aboaf: The category itself, all the unsecured was up about 30% in the quarter, so it's a good quarter.
Manuel Bueno: Okay. And if I could squeeze one more just on the tax rate. I appreciate the guidance for 4Q that you put in there. But in terms of what to expect kind of as we move into 2017, would you say this is closer to a run rate, tax rate that we should expect?
Eric Aboaf: Yeah. It's Eric. Let me give you a little bit of perspective on tax rate. We started to work on taxes I think in an industrious way in the spring time and folded it into our TOP III initiatives and you're seeing some of the early returns on that. And I think we're doing what the other regional banks are doing. There is nothing special here. We're availing ourselves of Federal R&D tax credit, state investment tax credit. And so, what you saw this quarter was a little bit of a catch-up activity from the prior years. I think going forward what you'll see is kind of the annual version of those tax credit programs, plus the standard tax benefit that comes from the LIHTC, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, we do a modest amount of wind farms and some other tax advantage investing. And we'll continue to do that. So, I think we had a particularly strong quarter this time around. I think you saw that we guided to 31.5% for next quarter, so down now 150 basis points from that 33% area that we were running at. And if you think about it, it's just part of the benchmarking and review of how do you optimize the regional bank and improve ROTCE, right. Part of that is operating leverage, part of that is fee income growth, and part of that is operating with an attractive tax rate. And so it's part of that continued effort. I think in terms of next year, we'll give a little more guidance in January as we pull together our plan, but I think clearly we're on a nice path here.
Bruce Saun: Yeah. We're on the trajectory that we want to have sustainable. So all those things Eric mentioned, getting our NIM back to the pack and getting our capital ratios back to the pack, getting our tax rates back to the pack, those things all contribute to getting our ROTCE where we want to take it.
Manuel Bueno: That's great. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.
Gerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning. Bruce, you mentioned in the sales, the TDRs just over $300 billion. If I recall correctly and just over $880 billion or so at the end of the second quarter, should we expect additional sales of TDRs in the next couple of quarters?
Eric Aboaf: It's Eric. I think we – as you think about TDRs, we, like other banks, you go back over the historic portfolio, you do primarily a one-time review and you package a nice sized sale. And the bigger the sale, the better execution you tend to get. So I think this is more one-time than otherwise. It doesn't mean that a year or two from now, there may not be a little bit of follow-on, but I think, you think about those as small and just more as an episodic event or positive episodic event, but one on the left.
Gerard Cassidy: Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Sticking with the sales theme. Obviously, you moved some of these aircraft leases into runoff portfolio. In view of CIT's recent sale of their airline leasing – aircraft leasing business, would you guys considerer selling off that portfolio at some point in the future, or are you just going to leave it and runoff?
Bruce Saun: Yeah. It's a very different ball game. The CIT was commercial aircraft – with the commercial airliners and these are private planes for large companies, and they're pretty bespoken there in their one-off. So, I think what should just end up doing is you work d them through with lessees. So, I don't think this would lend itself to a transaction.
Gerard Cassidy: Thank you. Appreciate the color.
Bruce Saun: Yeah.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Matthew O’Connor: Good morning.
Bruce Saun: Hi.
Matthew O’Connor: Just to follow up on the commercial loan growth. Obviously, again, a bit stronger than the industry, and some of it is the investments that you've made in some of the verticals and [indiscernible]. But just how sustainable do you think the above-average growth is? Because there seems to be some pricing issue at some places, less demand in some areas, and a number of folks seem to be pulling back for one reason or another or just having weaker growth.
Bruce Saun: Let me start and then Eric or Don, feel free to chime in. But I think if you look at maybe the last several quarters, going back 10, 12 quarters, we've had consistent levels of growth and we've largely been tracking the Fed HA data. So, we're growing consistent with the overall market and part of that has been getting back on offense, part of it has been hiring more coverage bankers and building out these Industry Verticals and bringing relationships to us, and just being very selective about where we're playing, building real power allies of strength, and then going out and taking on the business. So, I'd say we feel that we're well situated to continue that strategy. We saw a bit of a seasonal slowdown in Q3. We are looking for a bit of a bounce back in Q4. I think there is a little bit of election uncertainty that's maybe holding some companies back, which might resolve itself, as we get through the quarter. But anyway, I'll stop there. Don, anything?
Donald McCree: I think you should expect to see us grow with the industry and we are getting some production out of people that we've hired over the last couple of years, as they've done and engage with the clients. I'd say the other thing is, it's deal-by-deal, company-by-company, and it's very aggressive out there, and we're being careful to balance credit, terms and conditions, pricing and loan growth. So, we manage it on a multi-variable equation obviously and we want to protect the NIM while also growing the loan business. So, it will be a balance as we go forward. I agree with, Bruce, what you said.
Matthew O’Connor: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.
Bruce Saun: Kevin?
Ellen Taylor: Kevin?
Operator: Kevin Barker, your line is open.
Kevin Barker: Sorry. I was on mute. Good morning.
Ellen Taylor: Hi.
Kevin Barker: Auto net charge-offs increase was about 30% year-over-year to running about 69 basis points versus 50 basis points last year. It seems like there is a little acceleration in the charge-offs on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Is there any particular trends you want to point to, was this related to the Santander portfolio or is this related to your overall organic...?
Eric Aboaf: Kevin, it's Eric. Just to start, I think we had an unusual low second quarter performance in auto. We had done some catch-up on some recoveries the way they – and repossessions the way they flow through. So, I think if you just look at the trends broadly over the five quarters that you have here, you got to adjust the second quarter 2016 upwards. I think, other than that, we've been running in kind of $20 million to $25 million of charge-offs per quarter. There's a little bit of seasoning going through the portfolio, right, because as we don't add net new loans, you don't have that natural drift down of the charge-off that offsets the seasoning of the backlog. So, you're just seeing a little bit of that. But I think it's well controlled. We feel like we're in a good place with auto. We'll obviously see the usual seasonality in fourth quarter, but I think it's a good shape.
Brad Conner: Yeah. I think you said it exactly right. It's a low seasonal quarter. In the second quarter, we saw a little bit of pickup from that. Of course, a year or so ago, we started to expand our credit parameters that's seasoning through the book. But overall, the credit trends are exactly as we would have expected them to be.
Bruce Saun: And SCUSA is performing as expected.
Brad Conner: SCUSA performing as expected. And you'll recall, we actually changed our credit parameters with SCUSA few quarters back and we're actually now beyond the peak of the SCUSA portfolio loss, so that's beginning to come down.
Bruce Saun: Yeah, good.
Kevin Barker: So the macro environment stays relatively benign from where it is right now. Where do you think the normalized credit losses will be on that auto portfolio on an annualized basis?
Bruce Saun: Roughly in the same range.
Brad Conner: Relatively in the range where we are.
Eric Aboaf: Yeah. If you think about the charge-off rate that you see in the materials other than the low quarter is you see some prints in the 60 basis point range, 70 basis point range. I think that's where we expect it to level out, I'd say, in the 70 basis point range, more or less. And then we'll obviously have the quarterly seasonality because, remember, that's quite a factor in the auto business and we think [indiscernible] like through modest economic times as well.
Kevin Barker: Okay. And then a quick follow-up on Jesus' comments about the tax rate over a long period of time. At what point do you expect to reach peer levels for your tax rate? How long do you expect that to take?
Eric Aboaf: That's a good question because I think tax is one of those things that you work on over time and you get better at and is something that we have every intention of doing. And as I've said, some of it is tax credit, sort of availing themselves of tax credit fits into very little bit state by state, but there's a Federal credit and then part of it just the tax advantage investments and there are three or four categories of those. There's low income tax credit, there is historic real estate commercial tax credit, there are some wind farms, all of which that we have begun to do some more of. We'll do those in line with what other banks do. We'll obviously keep an eye out and not do anything that's a little more on the edge because that's not the kind of bank that we are. I think the question is, how much can you bring the tax rate down? I mean, you see where the peers are, they are in the high 20% range, but it takes time, and I think we're actually quite pleased with the performance so far. We were at 33% for a number of years when tax rate management wasn't a big important item under the RBS umbrella because of the Global Bank structure. Now that it is, you've seen us go from 33% to [indiscernible].
Bruce Saun: Our income is growing very quickly, so that income comes through at the marginal rate, and so you're also – some of your tax planning has to offset that higher levels of income. So.
Eric Aboaf: I think what we will do is in January we'll give a little more guidance as to what we expect in 2017 and obviously, some of what you've seen is a down payment on that, and we'll continue that. Hard to estimate long term, but I think you can estimate some improvements over time.
Bruce Saun: Okay. Thank you.
Kevin Barker: Thank you.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Matthew Burnell: Thanks for taking my question Eric, maybe a question for you. The securities portfolio was up about 4% quarter-over-quarter. I presume that's mostly just being driven by deposit growth exceeding your loan growth, but can you confirm that there really hasn't been much of a change and how you are thinking about managing that portfolio?
Eric Aboaf: Yeah. Matt, it's Eric. I think securities portfolio is in a good state right now, it's right-sized for this bank, it's primarily deposits funded, which is the way we like it. You saw us temp down a little bit on the asset sensitivity as we saw some nice rate levels in the late August, early September time period. And we'll continue to position a bit around the curve as that portfolio throws off some good income. I think we've got a very strong treasury team that's got the capability to manage that in a proper way. But I think it's properly sized for the bank. I think it's got a nice mix of MBS portfolio, it's got some swaps layered in, which provides some more clean duration, so that we also manage the convexity characteristics. And then I think over time, we've got some ability to do more with the portfolio as well.
Matthew Burnell: Okay. Thanks very much. And then just a question on the CFO search. Have you said how long you expect that to take? I realize there is no specific date, but do you have a sense as to how long you think that might take?
Bruce Saun: Well, obviously, we've begun. And my experience on these things is they take a few months to identify the right candidate and then list them and get them situated. But I think we'd be targeting to have the person in certainly by no later than the end of the first quarter.
Matthew Burnell: Great. Thank you very much.
Bruce Saun: Okay.
Ellen Taylor: Thanks, Matt.
Bruce Saun: Okay. I think that's it for the questions. And I'd like to thank everyone again for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest. All in all, we feel that we had a really terrific quarter that we're firing on all cylinders and feel good about our outlook. So, thanks again and have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our call today. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-07-22 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kerry and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]. Now I will turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor: Thanks, Kerry. Good morning to you all. Thanks so much for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. I know it's a really busy day, so just briefly our Chairman and CEO Bruce Van Saun and our CFO Eric Aboaf are going to provide some opening remarks and then we will open the call up for questions. Of course, also in the room with us today are Brad Conner, our Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, who is our Head of our Commercial Banking segment. I would like to remind you that in addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation and financial supplement and those materials are available at investor.citizensbank.com. Of course, our comments today will include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and we provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K which was filed this morning. We also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and earnings release material. And with that, I will hand it over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, Ellen and good morning, everyone. Thanks for dialing in today. We feel very good about the results that we announced today. We're executing our plan well and the financial results continue to show steady and notable progress, particularly given the environment. We delivered a completely clean $0.46 quarter with 15% year-on-year EPS growth, positive operating leverage of over 3% and a 70-basis-point improvement in ROTCE versus adjusted 2015. Our revenue growth of 7% was paced by loan growth of 7%. Our NIM was relatively stable as are our credit costs. We continue to be very disciplined on expenses. We're delivering on efficiency initiatives that allow us to self-fund growth investments, particularly in our fee-based businesses. I call out the outline of our TOP III program in today's materials. Recall that our TOP programs. TOP means tapping our TOP programs derive from our mindset of continuous improvement. This program should deliver approximately $100 million in benefits next year which is similar to TOP II's impact on 2016. It is also worth commenting on the successful execution of our TDR sale which was announced earlier this week. We expect a gain of approximately $70 million, a portion of which will be utilized to cover restructuring costs associated with TOP III. We were pleased that we came through the CCAR process well this year and we will pursue both strong loan growth and shareholder return of capital as we continue to normalize our CET1 and total capital ratios. Our colleagues are putting customers first and are doing a great job in executing our plans. I would like to recognize them for their excellent effort that continues to propel us forward. With that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the details of the quarter.
Eric Aboaf: Thanks, Bruce and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we continued to deliver on our growth, efficiency and balance sheet initiatives. We delivered strong operating leverage, controlling costs through our expense initiatives and improving efficiency. Earnings were up nicely, both linked quarter and year-over-year along with our returns. Let's take a closer look at the details in our second quarter earnings presentation. On page 4, we provide our GAAP results which include net income of $243 million and EPS of $0.46 per share. Up 5% sequentially and $0.11 year-over-year, those second quarter 2015 results included $40 million of restructuring charges and special expense items. On page 5, you will find the highlights of our adjusted results. Our net income came in at $243 million, up 9% linked quarter on revenue growth of 4%, with increases in both NII and non-interest income. We grew fees 8% percent on a linked quarter basis driven by strong growth in capital markets and good volumes in mortgage banking and higher service charges. Expenses were up 2% reflecting higher operating expenses, as well as higher salaries and employee benefits. Provision for credit losses remained relatively stable as lower net charge-offs were more than offset by reserve build tied to loan growth. So on a linked quarter basis, EPS increased $0.05 or 12%. Compared to adjusted second quarter 2015 results, net income increased $28 million or 13% and earnings per share was up 15%. We grew revenue by $78 million or 7% with a 10% increase in net interest income as we grew loans 7%, improved loan yields and mix and held deposit costs stable. Non-interest income decreased $5 million from the second quarter of 2015 which did not include the impact of a reclass of $7 million of card reward costs now reflected as a contra-revenue item. Excluding this impact, non-interest income was up $2 million or 1% year-over-year. Non-interest expense was up $26 million or 3% driven by salaries and employee benefits expense and a change in timing of our merit and bonus payments. On the credit side, our provision was up $13 million on a modest reserve build tied to loan growth. In second quarter 2016, we continued to make demonstrable progress against our goals enhancing our efficiencies while reinvesting in the franchise. Our adjusted efficiency ratio of 65% improved 1% on a linked quarter basis and improved 2% relative to a year ago, as we saw the continuing benefits of TOP II. Additionally, we reduced our share count by 2%, positively impacting EPS. And finally, as of June 30, 2016, our tangible book value per share totaled $25.72, a 2% improvement on a linked quarter basis. Let's move on to net interest income on page 6. We grew NII $19 million or 2% linked quarter as we continued to generate loan growth with improving yields and portfolio mix while holding deposit costs flat. This underlying momentum was offset by pressure from the long end of the curve that played out in higher premium amortization and continued lower reinvestment opportunities in the securities portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased $83 million or 10% and the NIM expanded 12 basis points. Now on page 7, our net interest margin which was down 2 basis points linked quarter, reflects higher loan yields and a better mix which were more than offset by the impact on our securities portfolio of a reduction in long term interest rates and higher borrowing costs associated with the issuance of senior debt. We continued to exercise good discipline with deposit costs which were flat for the quarter. Year-over-year, our NIM expanded 12 basis points reflecting improving retail and commercial loan yields and portfolio mix, along with the impact of the December Fed rate rise. We're pleased with the positive results of our loan pricing and mix initiatives and our taxable actions to hold deposit costs flat. Our asset sensitivity ended the quarter at 6.8% in a gradual rise scenario, relatively unchanged from the first quarter of 2016. Next up let's take a closer look at our non-interest income. We grew non-interest income $25 million or 8% from the first quarter with strength in nearly every category. We saw volume growth in service charges and fees [indiscernible] seasonally lower levels in the first quarter and also benefited from improved pricing. Card fees and investment services fees were up slightly, while mortgage banking fees increased $7 million as we improved our origination volume 42% with higher loan sale volumes and spread. Capital market fees improved $13 million reflecting the continued broadening of our capabilities in cross-sell, as well as a strong increase in deal volume from lower first quarter 2016 levels. Securities gains were modest and down $5 million. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest income declined $5 million or 1% from the second quarter of 2015 levels which did not include the impact of a reclass of $7 million of card reward costs as a contra revenue item. Excluding this item, underlying non-interest income was up $2 million or 1%. We drove improved pricing and volumes in service charges and fees which increased $11 million with improvement in both consumer and commercial. In wealth, we continued to add to our advisor head count which will propel higher revenues going forward, notwithstanding a shift to more fee-based product sales. Mortgage banking fees decreased $5 million as the benefit of higher application volume and sale volume and spread was more than offset by reduction in the prior-year MSR valuation increase. Capital markets fees increased $5 million reflecting a record quarter and a continued broadening of our capabilities. Turning to expenses on slide 9, we continue to manage our costs effectively while also redeploying cost saves prudently to invest in products, infrastructure and talent to support the long term growth of the franchise. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense increased $16 million or 2%. Salaries and employee benefits were up $7 million linked quarter and $27 million year-over-year largely related to a change in the timing of merit increases and incentive payments which were paid in the first quarter last year. This led to higher payroll taxes and 401(a) matching contributions this quarter than we had last year. Other expense was up $13 million from first quarter as we experienced higher regulatory fraud in insurance costs. Otherwise, we continue to make progress in controlling costs. You can see that headcount was down by 74 linked quarter and also down year-over-year. We continue to take actions to redeploy expense dollars out of less productive uses into areas that will drive future top line and bottom line benefits. If we look at our balance sheet on page 10, year-over-year average earning assets were up $6.3 billion or 5%. We generated 10% commercial loan growth and 5% retail loan growth. Average deposits increased $5.4 billion or 6% with strength in low cost core deposits. Let's move to page 11 where Consumer Banking continues to make good progress in growing the loan portfolio while shifting the portfolio mix with more attractive opportunities. Loan growth was 7% year-over-year driven by student lending, particularly our refinancing product and mortgage lending. Consumer loan yields increased 4 basis points reflecting continued improvement in mix. Next on slide 12, Commercial Banking delivered another strong showing. Commercial loans increased 5% linked quarter and 11% year-over-year with continued momentum in the more attractive return areas. On a year-over-year basis, we continued to generate growth across our targeted areas, corporate and industry verticals, commercial real estate, franchise finance and corporate finance. Commercial loan yields increased 5 basis points linked quarter and 24 basis points year-over-year which reflected higher rates, pricing discipline and improved mix. Let's take a quick look at the liability side of the balance sheet and our funding costs on slide 13. This quarter continued to see the benefit from the strategies and tactics to fund continued loan growth in a more cost effective manner. Our focus in growing low cost core deposits helped drive a $1.7 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposits, up 2% linked quarter with particular strength in checking. We held our deposit costs stable for a third consecutive quarter reflecting continued disciplined pricing strategies and tactics in Consumer Banking. We also continue to replace our wholesale funding mix to align more closely with peers and are reducing our reliance on short term borrowing and issuing senior debt. Next let's cover credit. On slide 14, we saw broad-based improvement in our commercial and retail portfolios. Linked quarter NPLs were down $35 million, reflecting a $23 million improvement in Commercial largely tied to the oil and gas portfolio and a $12 million decrease in retail. Correspondingly, net charge-offs were down $18 million or 8 basis points to 25 basis points in loans. Provision expense in the quarter was relatively stable at $90 million as we built reserves by $25 million, largely tied to the continued loan growth. The allowance to loans ratio of 1.2% was stable with the prior quarter and our allowance NPL coverage increased to 119%. Overall, we're pleased with the continued favorable trend in our credit metrics and we expect credit costs to remain favorable this year. On slide 15, you can see our strong capital and liquidity ratios. We had significant progress in our capital management this quarter as we received a non-objection to our capital plan which include strong loan growth, $690 million of share repurchases over the next four quarters and an ability to increase our dividend by 17% next year. We're very pleased with the results as it will enhance our returns to shareholders. On slide 16, we have laid our key initiatives that support the balance sheet and fee growth in our turnaround plan. As you know, we have augmented the plan with incremental initiatives and assess our progress against these initiatives each quarter. We're continuing to lay strong foundations and gain momentum across most of these areas. Where we had challenges, like in mortgages, we're making good progress improving cycle times which improves the customer experience and allows us to resume growth in our sales force. On slide 17, you can see tangible evidence that our strategic initiatives are bearing fruit. We continue to deliver positive operating leverage consistently ahead of our peers. We've been able to generate good revenue growth notwithstanding the modest economic growth and a lower for longer rate environment. Our disciplined approach to expense management reflects the importance of self-funding our growth initiatives by actively managing our expense base and driving efficiencies throughout the organization. On slide 18, you can see that our biggest gap with peers has been revenue capture, particularly in our fee businesses which outlines the opportunity set that will allow us to enhance our returns for shareholders. We're addressing this opportunity through growth investments in our wealth management, capital markets, Treasury solution businesses, among others. Additionally, we're making progress towards improving our returns by addressing other drags on ROTCE, such as our excess capital position and a relatively high tax rate. We have improved ROTCE by almost 3 percentage points inside of three years and we'll continue to focus on execution to drive further progress. As you look at slide 19, our top two initiatives have delivered well against our revenue and expense goals. In 2016, we were on track to realize $95 million to $100 million in total benefits from revenue initiatives and expense savings. We continue to foster a mindset of continuous improvement running the bank better every day. On slide 20, we outline our plan to build and improve upon these efforts. Our TOP III initiative which is taking shape, places a greater emphasis on expenses. We're reducing our headcount in non-revenue areas and driving further efficiencies in the distribution network, as well as streamlining end-to-end loan processes. We're actively reaching out to customers to protect our share of wallet and conducting a thorough assessment of opportunities to improve our tax rate to align more closely with peers. We will leverage our success with previous TOP programs to help ensure that TOP III improves the bank's overall efficiency and effectiveness, while at the same time allowing us to self-fund investments and drive future growth. Slide 21. Given our focus on efficiency in TOP III, we remain committed to continuing to deliver positive operating leverage. The rate scenario will move around based on events. Currently, the forward curve projects a low probability of a Fed rate increase during 2016 and 2017. Additionally, the curve has flattened with the long end significantly lower. While this scenario lessens the prospect of a hoped for tailwind, we have been delivering strong operating, solid operating leverage, EPS growth and ROTCE improvement during the last two years with no net rate benefit as the one move in the Fed fund's rate has been more than offset by the impact of a flattening yield curve. In any case, it is starting to look like the rate reaction in the wake of Brexit may have been a bit overdone. But we will see. We believe the key is to focus on what we can control and to continue to execute on our plan to build a top performing bank that delivers well for all our stakeholders. In the back half of 2016, initial TOP III savings will help to offset some costs that were unforeseen at the beginning of the year. These include higher FDIC assessment costs, higher separation costs from RBS related to new vendor contract, as well as a temporary increase in outsourcing costs. In 2017, our TOP III benefit will be deployed towards containing expense growth and generating positive operating leverage and EPS growth. This roughly $100 million impact will also help us self-fund the investments we need to drive top line growth, particularly in fees, while still showing strong discipline on expenses. In addition to the efforts we have outlined here, we're working additional efficiencies in areas like optimizing our branch network to reduce occupancy costs. Also note that we expect to utilize roughly 30% to 40% of the approximately $70 million TDR gain to fund costs associated with TOP III efficiencies and the continued optimization of the balance sheet. Turning now to slide 22 and our recent CCAR submission DFAST outcome. We received a non-objection to the capital plan we submitted as part of the 2016 CCAR process. Our strong capital position permits strong loan growth and shareholder return of capital while maintaining a robust common equity Tier 1 ratio. We will continue to allocate our capital prudently given our need for higher earnings and ROTCE improvement. All-in, we have made great progress in improving the qualitative aspects of our framework. On slide 23, we provide a high level outline of the TDR transaction. Earlier this week, we sold $310 million of troubled debt restructuring loans and we will look for a third quarter of 2016 gain of approximately $70 million on the sale through other income. Benefits of this transaction include an improvement in the bank's asset quality, the ability to improve risk adjusted returns, the reduction in our CCAR stress loss levels and a modest reduction in FDIC insurance expenses. Let's turn to our third quarter outlook on slide 24. We expect to produce linked quarter loan growth of roughly 1.5%. We also expect net interest margins to be down slightly given the current curve. With the curve at these levels, this poses some challenges, but we will tightly manage our deposit costs and continue to optimize our loan portfolio mix. We're focused on what we can control and continue to investigate additional opportunities to optimize our balance sheet. We expect to keep expenses broadly stable in the third quarter as efficiency initiatives will offset continued investment spend. We expect to continue to generate strong positive operating leverage, thereby improving our efficiency ratio, profitability and returns. We expect underlying credit metrics to remain favorable which will lead to relatively stable provision in the third quarter. And finally, we expect to manage our CET1 ratio to 11.3% given that we have resumed buying back stock and we will manage the LDR to around 99%. Note that this guidance does not reflect a gain on the TDR Transaction of approximate $70 million or any restructuring costs. In summary, slide 25, our strong results this quarter demonstrate our ability to continue to improve how we run the bank. We have delivered well against our strategic initiatives that help us drive underlying revenue growth and carefully manage our expense base. We remain committed to being prudent capital allocators and enhancing our returns for shareholders. In the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on execution and making progress for all our stakeholders. With that, let me turn it back to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, thanks, Eric. A really strong quarter as we continue to run the bank better and better each and every day. With that, Kerry, can we open it up for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Matt O'Connor: Just following up on the outlook for the third quarter and I guess more broadly speaking as we think about net interest income dollars. Do you think you can still see some increase in the absolute amount of dollars as you think about the modest loan growth and the slight decline in NIM and the liquidity and securities book, when you put that all together do the revenue dollars go up from here?
Eric Aboaf: Matt, it is Eric. I think that's exactly what our outlook indicates. We're expecting solid loan growth. A little bit of potentially a slight decline in NIM, but a couple basis points, we will see. But we think the low growth will outrun that slight NIM compression in the third quarter and provide a good uptick in NII. I think we also see some tailwinds into the fourth quarter. We've got some old legacy swaps running off and so we actually see some flatness in NIM between third quarter and fourth quarter which when you add back in the loan growth, should help with a second NII uptick at the end of the year.
Matt O'Connor: Okay and then just separately on asset quality, the charge-off dollars came in a lot lower than I was looking for. It seemed like the auto book, after having some seasoning in recent quarters, you actually saw a good improvement there, but anything kind of unusual on the credit side or maybe what is just driving the drop in the charge-offs and specifically in auto it has been some negative industry headlines?
Eric Aboaf: Couple of factors there. I think you are right, auto has typically seasonally declined, but we also, I think, had a particularly strong recovery quarter in auto which was nice to see. That doesn't always repeat, but it was nice to see. I do think we saw some relatively systemic improvements in home equity generally and even a touch of mortgages as housing prices continued to float upwards. And we expect some of those improvements to stick in the coming quarters. And that will provide, I think, some real stability in the provision or maybe even a touch downwards. We will see.
Bruce Van Saun: I think the credit outlook stays very positive both on the consumer side and in commercial, away from energy. It's been pretty quiet. So we will continue to monitor the energy portfolio, but with the recent increase in energy prices, we're feeling okay about that.
Brad Conner: Bruce, just one more comment on the auto book. First of all, we did make some operational improvements that we think is having an impact, but then also we've talked a lot about the SCUSA book which has reached beyond the peak of its loss curve. So we're starting to see those SCUSA losses trimmed down at this point. Of course, our purchases are a little smaller there, so that's contributing, as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Erica Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Erika Najarian: I just wanted to understand how we should think about the impact of the $73 million to $90 million of PP&R enhancements that you mentioned for your TOP III initiative. You touched upon 3% operating leverage growth or rather, operating leverage being achieved and I'm wondering whether or not TOP III is going to continue to accelerate this operating leverage or it will support this level of operating leverage going into 2017?
Bruce Van Saun: I think the good news here is that we've identified another roughly $100 million as we did last year. So to us we now got to go get it, but we have very well-formed plans as to how we're going to do that. And it's really money in the bank, is the way I think about it. So the first objective we have is to make sure that we're managing the expense rate of growth wisely and in line with the environment that we operate in. And underneath that, we want to make sure that we're using some of the benefits that we find to continue to invest in areas that are going to deliver medium term growth. So building up our fee-based businesses, for example and capturing that revenue opportunity. So it's really, I think we will get some immediate benefits in the second half of the year that will cover things like higher FDIC assessment. And then we will run that out next year when we do the budget process. We will see what kind of revenue environment we're in and we will manage the overall pace of expense growth based on that revenue environment while we're protecting the things we need to invest in for the future.
Erika Najarian: And my second question is on the ROT improvement from here. Clearly, excess capital, as you mentioned, is weighing on it. And, Bruce and, Eric, I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit of insight, in as much as you can, on how Citizens has improved in the DFAST and CCAR process in 2016 versus 2015 and whether as you look out into the future that gives you confidence, as well as some of the results of some of your peers, to continue to be aggressive in terms of your ASK.
Bruce Van Saun: I'll start and, Eric, you can chime in. But, look, I think in terms of the CCAR process, we're very pleased, obviously, that we have upped our game and we're making it through the qualitative side of it well. I think when you go back to think about how we were berthed from RBS one of the good things is we were berthed with a very high capital ratio which it has allowed us a lot of flexibility in terms of improving the bank and improving returns. So we're kind of in a rich man's position now where we can have relatively strong loan growth, so we can use that capital position to grow the balance sheet, bring new customers into the bank and also at the same time we can have very strong distributions of capital back to shareholders. And that's been bringing the capital ratio down at around 50 basis points or so for the past two years, that strategy of having aggressive loan growth and strong returns to shareholders. I think we're calling out kind of a low 11% type ending point this year, down from maybe 11.8% when we started the year. So, say, call it 60-basis-point reduction. And I think we could do that again, clearly, we have to go through the process, but the potential exists to do that again given that our peer capital ratios the median is probably around 10%. So we could do that maybe once, maybe twice again. But, obviously, we've got to keep running the bank better and we have to get our ROTCE up. We want to get to a sustainable position where sources of capital equal uses because eventually that excess that we have will dissipate. So that's how we think about it. Eric, maybe you can chime in.
Eric Aboaf: Yes. I think on CCAR what gives us the confidence there is that the investments we've made in the qualitative factors. There are seven major qualitative factors. We have reinvested and upped our game, as we've said and I think we feel like we really understand where the bar is. We know how to make sure we stay above the bar, if the bar flows up in either credit modeling or PP&R or controls or data. Our view is we need to stay ahead and be ahead and we know what it takes to do that. I think what's also constructive in our CCAR results is if you look at the stress tests that are done. The credit stress that we see in our book and that the Fed sees in our book tends to be a little lighter than some of the other regional banks. And so that higher quality of underwriting of credit and of mix, I think, bodes well for us because we have less, a slightly lower CCAR draw down on capital and that gives us some confidence that the payouts that we have put forward this year and what we might recommend next year make a lot of sense.
Operator: And our next question will go to the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill Partners. Your line is open.
Scott Siefers: Eric, I was wondering if you could speak to some of the potential additional balance sheet optimization opportunities you might see? I feel like in many ways you guys have already done such a considerable amount, so just curious, your thoughts? And then just given the presumably more likely dynamic for lower for longer, any thought to altering the Company's rate sensitivity at all?
Eric Aboaf: Yes, fair question. I think the first thing I'd share with you is I think our initiatives in the businesses, whether I describe them as pricing or mix on the loan side continue to bear fruit. I think this quarter in particular you saw 2% uptick in yields, you saw it both in Consumer and Commercial. Some of that was the mix improvement that we continue to drive and I think we continue to do that. Some of it actually just came from outright targeting and we had some improvements in yields as we really gave benchmarking tools to our bankers in Commercial to make sure that they got the yields that we deserve. And some of it came from pricing in Consumer. We actually wanted to slow down a little lending. One of the natural ways to do that is to take price up, you've got to do that carefully. But had about 15 basis points better origin pricing in auto on an apples-to-apples basis. So we think those initiatives will continue and we think there is potential to continue to drive those forward. And I think the same thing is true in deposits. We have to do both the tactics in deposits and we're also rolling out new product programs. We've got a great new product for [indiscernible] in deposits on the Consumer side and I think those kinds of initiatives will bear fruit. I think more broadly on the balance sheet management and investment portfolio side, we're not uncomfortable with this level of asset sensitivity, though we do want to position around the curve. Post-Brexit you saw rates that 10-year at 1.35% and I'm sure the folks are clamoring why not just close down the asset sensitive position? Well, rates are at 1.6%, right, over the last day. And you'd say, hey, good treasurers and smart managers of a Treasury portfolio will look for rates in a range and choose how to position. I think you've also seen mortgage basis widen out over the last couple months. The provides an opportunity because we earn money in Treasury both on the duration position and on the mortgage basis and we can adjust which one we emphasize which ones we deemphasize. And then I think you will continue to see us do work around optimizing the liability side of the balance sheet, right, with an upcoming sub-debt redemption that we've planned, that we have previously announced, $500 million. And I think actions like that should help and help offset some of the lower for longer headwinds.
Bruce Van Saun: I would just add to that when you think about where we're playing, what we're trying to do is be very, very disciplined in how and where we play, particularly on the Commercial side. And so we're kind of making sure that we can get good yield, so good risk adjusted returns. But more than that, also making sure that we're playing on the basis where we can take in deposits and we can get the fee cross-sell. And so that's one of the things that we're constantly looking at trying to rotate is if there is an area, for example, the leasing business that we have is a bit light on fees and light on deposits and it had been a referral business that we were really dependent on RBS for large ticket referrals. We're refashioning that business into something that's more focused as a cross-sell product into middle market customers so we can make it part of this whole relationship. So that is some of the continuing work that is taking place.
Operator: And next we will go to the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Ken Zerbe: So I thought slide 12 was actually really interesting, that you are getting meaningfully higher loan yields on Commercial. When we look out for the net interest margin into 2017, right, I know you mentioned, Bruce, I thought you said that fourth quarter is going to possibly remain stable given the swaps running off, but how should we think about margin into 2017? Just given where rates are now, is it fair to assume that we should see a couple basis points of additional pressure per quarter or are there other offsetting factors that make keep it a little more stable?
Bruce Van Saun: I think, Ken, it's a little early to call out any guidance on 2017, but if you look at the trends that we've had, the focus on shifting the mix, being disciplined on pricing, disciplined on deposit side has served us well. So we have, I think, probably when you think about any rate benefit this year, we had some lift from the initial Fed action in December and a lot of that is given back from the flattening of the curve as you go through the year and the thing that has propelled the NIM higher has been some of these self-help actions and this discipline we have had. So when we think about 2017, that's what the game plan is to continue with that as we go into next year. It certainly would be helpful if the Fed starts to move again. It's interesting that right after Brexit it looked like that was completely off the table for a couple of years and now that markets are saying well maybe not so fast on that one. So, anyway, we can't control that, but we want continue to influence the things that we can control.
Ken Zerbe: And then just really quick, on commercial real estate, obviously, strong growth this quarter, given some of the discussion or debate around commercial real estate, competition, pricing terms, does that sort of seri competition change the way that you view growing seri near term?
Bruce Van Saun: I'll start with this and let Don pick up. I think partly the reason we have had the good growth in commercial real estate is, I like to say that we had the shop closed line on the storefront as part of RBS's downsizing of its commercial real estate exposure globally. And we've been able, as we've gone independent, just to turn that sign around, if you will and say store is open. And so the folks that we basically put and do business with for a while that we've now welcomed back and they are happy to have us back in the rotation giving us swings at the bat. So I think we've had a good opportunity to kind of reestablish that we're in the game and we've taken advantage of that. Having said that, we have been very disciplined in terms of T&Cs and there is hot sectors of the market, if we think they are too hot, we just pull back from. But, anyway, Don, why don't you give some more color?
Don McCree: Yes, I think that's exactly right, Bruce. We've been going quite rapidly over the last couple years in real estate and we continue to see just huge opportunities in that market. As Bruce said, we're definitely being more selective in areas like multi-family and that's allowing us to get better terms, better pricing and continue to grow the book. But I think you'll see a growth slightly slower than it has in the past couple of years, but we're seeing interesting opportunities. And with some people pulling back, we're able to do transactions which are attractive to us and we're being very disciplined on it.
Operator: And our next question will go to the line of Jason Harbes with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Jason Harbes: Just wanted to drill in a little bit on the fees. It looks like you had a record quarter in capital markets, so just wondering how sustainable that is and then within the context of the low-single-digit improvement that you expect in the third quarter which areas would you expect to see that improvement coming from?
Bruce Van Saun: Don, why don't you take the first part of that and then we'll go to Eric.
Don McCree: So we did have strong and broad performance in capital markets and in interest rates on the back of the Brexit event, so we feel very good about the ability to capture the opportunity which exists in our franchise which has been the strategy for the last couple of years to position for these opportunities. It's hard to see out long term in capital markets, but we feel like the capabilities are extremely strong and our pipelines are looking quite good for the third quarter. So we think it continues at least for the next quarter.
Bruce Van Saun: I would just add that is not just market. So the market, obviously, helps and the market had for kind of leverage credits in particular and the smaller deals had dried up in Q4 and for a good part [indiscernible] opened back up and that helps. But I think the bigger point here, as Don mentioned, is we've been broadening our capabilities and adding talent and we're in the position, really, to go out and gain market share, so that's been, I think, a key aspect to this.
Eric Aboaf: And then more broadly, Jason, on fee growth into the third quarter. I think we expect it to be reasonably broad base. Usually, there is a small tick up in service charges, just as volume slowed and household growth and business activity happens. Same in cars, third quarter typically a little stronger than second quarter. I think we expect continued building in the investments area. You saw $1 of sequential growth, we expect that to continue, potentially at a slightly higher pace. I think foreign exchange, interest rate products, we will just have to see how the markets play out and capital markets in particular, whether we can sustain this pace or those come back a little bit. I think mortgages, we're seeing a bit of a refinance boom lately. You saw our applications up almost 40% quarter-over quarter. We expect some higher level of that given rate already in, the locks are coming through and that should bode well for mortgages. I think you'll see some broad-based improvement into the third quarter here as we look forward.
Operator: And our next will go to the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.
John Pancari: Back to expenses, I just want to see if you can help us a little bit with how this all comes together in terms of the efficiencies that you're targeting out of the remainder of the TOP II and then the TOP III. I guess, first, how can we think about the growth rate for 2016, that 2.5% to 3% range you had previously provided? And then, secondly, how can we think about the -- what the positive operating leverage goal means for your efficiency ratio? In other words, what's a way to think about where the efficiency could come out by the end of 2017 when you dial in the TOP III, particularly given that you're reinvesting a good portion of it? Thanks.
Eric Aboaf: John, let me take that. On the expense growth, you saw we had an uptick primarily due to timing and merit increases this quarter. We expect expenses to be reasonably flat into third quarter and fourth quarter. And so, part of what will drive that is you don't have the 401(k) match and some of the payroll taxes coming through again in third quarter, offset by just the natural uptick as we hire loan officers or capital market specialists or some of our investment headcount that draws the revenue growth. I think when it comes down to it, we had 1% up in expenses first quarter year-on-year, 3% up expenses second quarter year-on-year. We're at 2% first half growth rate and, obviously, we're trying to stick as close to that as we can, but it's hard work. I think what we want to do is make sure that we control expenses on one hand, we reinvest on the other and really balance that and that's what we've been trying to--
Bruce Van Saun: And I think the net result of all that is you can see the year-on-year numbers we're 6.5% top line growth and 3% expense growth in the quarter. That's pretty darn good. And so we're trying to make sure that we're growing the bank, growing the top line and then making those investments and keeping a big spread. The result of that also and you mentioned efficiency ratio, is we've had year-on-year the efficiency ratio drop by 2% from 67% down to 65%. And if we can keep that up, if we can keep delivering that operating leverage and keep investing in the avenues to grow that top line, that will be terrific and that efficiency ratio should continue to move down to the low 60%'s. That's where we want to get it.
Eric Aboaf: And the pace that you get that out is you think about how you model, right. You get 3% operating leverage just on a year-over-year basis. Effectively creates 2 percentage points increase in efficiency on a year-over-year basis. So that's kind of the -- how it calibrates and so, obviously, focus on operating leverage will continue and try to match this pace as best we can.
John Pancari: And then, my follow-up is just around the solid commercial growth, I know you mentioned it's the mid-corporate as well as some of the verticals. I just want to get a little bit more specific color around what's driving it and how much it is really in the some of the sustainable areas versus anything that's transactional in nature and may not be as sustainable going into 2017? Thanks.
Don McCree: I think, obviously, we're focused on cross-sell which is partly transactional, but the franchise is growing nicely. We've targeted the verticals that we've we called out, we've targeted mid-corporate, we've targeted the franchise finance area and they're all experiencing double-digit growth in terms of loan growth. And as Bruce called out before, our process is very disciplined as we grow our client base. We're focused on growing loans but growing loans at an acceptable NIM, at acceptable terms and conditions and where we see reasonably near term cross-sell. And there's plenty of opportunity out there as other banks adjust their books of business and particularly some of the larger banks back away from some of the clients that they been banking. And we have, I think, the more opportunity than we actually want to bank at this point and we're basically balancing our growth levels with our return levels and we're doing it pretty successfully. So I think it can continue at a healthy pace into the balance of this year and into next year.
Operator: And next we will go to the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Vivek Juneja: So, Bruce, Eric, could you remind us, ROTCE trajectory now? You had a nice quarter, you went above 7% and how should we -- what do you expect on that front?
Bruce Van Saun: I think we're continuing to make progress. It was nice to see the big jump this quarter and we want to keep propelling higher. You get, you cross over 7%, you get to the mid-7%'s and you're next goal is you want to get to 8%. But we're still focused on that 10%. We won't get there in the original timeline we thought, largely because of rates, but I think the goal is to just deliver that positive operating leverage, deliver solid EPS growth and the ROTCE will move up with that.
Vivek Juneja: Student loans, you had good growth there. The outlook on that, do you expect that to continue at this pace? Can you talk a little bit about that?
Bruce Van Saun: Brad?
Brad Conner: We feel optimistic about continued outlook for growth in student lending. Strong demand for the refi product. We will, obviously, see a little bit of a bump in student loan originations in third and fourth quarter when we hit the seasonal peak for in-school, but all signs point to continued strong demand in the refi area and we expect that momentum to continue.
Vivek Juneja: And you're still [indiscernible] with the same credit focus metrics that you're seeing on that, Brad?
Brad Conner: Yes. Very strong. All signs are very strong with the credit indicators on both sides, in-school and the refi product in student.
Eric Aboaf: And, Vivek, remember, it's a very high quality credit focus. We're talking about 750 on one of the portfolios, 780 on the other. We're talking about undergraduates to colleges that you and others and we all went to, MBA graduate degrees, doctors, lawyers, business degrees, that kind of thing. So it's a very high quality book and it is part of, I think, of the economy where we're really making a benefit for consumers. Actually, when we get fan letters, right, because we cut their payments by $135 a month which is a real benefit to them and we provide a real service and earn good return. So it's a real nice product for us and I think for the time being, for the next couple years we see it as attractive, attractive returns, not a lot of competition and whenever someone comes in we actually feel like that actually rings [indiscernible] to the market, as Brad said and we get even more--
Bruce Van Saun: Bring attractive new customers into the mix.
Eric Aboaf: Exactly.
Operator: And our next question will go to the line of David Eads with UBS. Your line is open.
David Eads: Maybe following up on some of the loan growth, comments you guys made. I'm just curious if you guys are seeing any changes in the dynamic or maybe opportunities related to some of the transactions that are in your footprint? It seems like there's a lot going on in your area. So, just curious what you're seeing on that front?
Don McCree: On the Commercial side, the market has been dominated so far, at least for the last 18 months by refinancing. And what we're waiting to see and what we hope to see with some economic growth is some new money financings and growth in borrowings by clients in our footprint and when I talk about that, I'm talking about our middle-market client base. So if you look at our middle-market client base, underneath our loan growth, that has been relatively flat for about a year now. So we're holding our clients, but they are just not growing their demand for credit. So most of our growth has come in our verticals and in our national businesses and upside in the future could be economically driven loan growth within our middle market. But we're not seeing that right now.
David Eads: Sorry, I guess I was meaning the opportunities to get additional clients from dislocations at other competitors due to some of the M&A transactions going on.
Eric Aboaf: Yes, it is very competitive out there. We're seeing opportunities to bid new business. We have added some new clients. I think our client count from the beginning of the year is up about 100, ballpark. So it's not a massive addition of clients, but at the margin we're adding new clients. I think it takes a while for clients to switch. So some of the M&A that's been announced, while we may be talking to some of those opportunities, they're not going to switch their business overnight. It generally revolves around a maturity of a loan facility or something else going on with their coverage. And we haven't seen that materialize in size yet. But we're hopeful. We're actually talking to those clients about joining the Citizens family.
Brad Conner: Yes and that is certainly the same on the Consumer side. There's opportunity there for new customer acquisition and we're focusing on those areas in terms of some of our marketing efforts and even opportunities to hire great colleagues in those markets, we're focusing on that, as well. So definitely opportunity we've seen.
David Eads: And then, you guys called out the, somewhere around $25 million of reinvesting of the gains in 3Q for the implementing of TOP III. Are there going to be other implementation costs that come down over the next few quarters from that?
Bruce Van Saun: No, look, I think one of the things we're pleased by is that we've been able to generate the TOP improvement programs without a lot of restructuring. So without the need to burden capital with big charges. And we're self-funding this actually by creating the gain on the TDRs, if we need to use 20% to 30% of it which is $20 million to $30 million. I think that will pretty much cover it. There is a more heavy expense element to TOP III, but there's also revenue ideas which really just require people investment or changes in processes. So there's no big investment that goes with that. And then the tax strategies we have are largely around tax credit programs which will throw off a little bit of headwind on the non-interest income line, but certainly benefit your tax line and give a net benefit. So, in any case, I think that's the extent of it. What we said we earmarked the gain, a portion of the gain to cover.
Operator: And our next question will go to the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Go ahead, your line is open.
Kevin Barker: I noticed that auto loans increased by roughly $200 million this quarter despite the pullback on the SCUSA purchases. You mentioned some strength there, some of that might be seasonality and you also noted some better pricing on your auto loans. Could you just give additional color on what you're seeing there on why that's growing in particular?
Brad Conner: Yes. Actually, I want to be really clear. Went Eric talk about better pricing what he means by that is better yield and better margin for us, not more aggressive pricing. We made a conscious decision to slow our growth there and look for opportunities to improve spreads and margins and we've done that but the demand remains remained quite strong. So I would attribute most of it to demand in the marketplace. We're expecting to see that growth taper down a little bit, maybe be more flattish in the third quarter, but just very strong marketplace demand is what I would attribute it to.
Bruce Van Saun: At a portfolio level, just to refresh the thinking, is that we've basically and I like this pun, you tried to put the brakes on auto and keep it relatively flat and go for the margin. And then we're allocating more capital to areas like the ed refinance loan and student, some of our unsecured products like Apple IF program or some new pilots on unsecured lending. So we're focused on yield maximization and I think you can't always hit the nail on the head, you try to keep auto flat, but as Brad said, it's robust in the market and we're just playing in the prime and super prime spaces, we're not playing in sub-prime. But there's still good activity there and good loan demand there.
Kevin Barker: And then in regards to your -- the balance between organic growth and the loans that you're purchasing, where do you think you will stand by the end of 2016 on the percentage growth that you can see organically versus purchases?
Bruce Van Saun: We have been moving that, migrating that well over 80% now and I think the only -- we've got -- I guess the SCUSA is really net neutral or winding down on the charge level of purchases. And SoFi on the student loans is the only thing where we're really acquiring at this point. But it's a relatively modest portion of overall growth because we're seeing such good organic growth.
Brad Conner: We were 90%, on the Consumer side we were 90% organic and 10% purchase for the quarter. So it certainly coming from organic--
Bruce Van Saun: The bigger loan growth and they are 100% organic. So it's relatively modest at this point.
Eric Aboaf: And the trends are, as you would expect, it was 80% organic in first quarter, well into the 90% second quarter and we like it in that area.
Kevin Barker: And then just, housekeeping, what was the ending balance of the upgrade program with Apple?
Bruce Van Saun: It's over $350 million.
Eric Aboaf: Yes, $360 million ending, $350 million average.
Operator: And next we will go to the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital. Your line is now open.
Gerard Cassidy: You guys show up pretty low when you look at how you are addressing your expenses to average assets to a peer group. Fee revenue or non-interest income still is not as strong as some of your peers. Have you given some thought about making acquisitions in the fee revenue area, not necessarily the depository, but companies that could help you boost your fee revenue as a percentage of total revenue?
Bruce Van Saun: I think, Gerard, we have been very focused on just running the bank better and putting the right foundations in place to really capture the opportunity we see right in front of us in terms of organic growth. I think when we feel that we've got that right, we certainly have the capital capacity to go out and look at some bolt-on acquisitions that could accelerate the lift off in fee revenues, but I think that's still a bit of the ways into the future.
Gerard Cassidy: And then second, if rates don't really move much over the next 18 months, you're making progress in the consumer banking profitability, as evidenced by this quarter's return on tangible common equity breaking 7%. How long will it take you to get to that number, bringing it close to the 10%, if you don't get any rate relief in doing it for the consumer bank?
Bruce Van Saun: I guess we're not calling out the milestones beyond this year. We're just giving our -- focusing our guidance on this year. If you kind of can use almost the past as a projection for the future if you say, as Eric said in his prepared remarks, we've lifted the overall Company ROTCE over 3% or approximately 3%, in under three years. And we haven't had any rate benefit to do that and so the formula of putting our capital to work wisely, growing the balance sheet, getting the top line to move, building up the fee businesses and being very disciplined on expenses, that's the formula. We're going to keep going with that formula and hopefully it will continue to propel us higher.
Operator: And next we will go to the line of Jesus Bueno with Compass Point. Your line is now open.
Jesus Bueno: Very quickly on the share repurchase, obviously, a great result out of CCAR this year. Just in terms of the share repurchases and the pace of them throughout this cycle, last cycle you seem to front load them and, of course, here you are below tangible book. I guess, in terms of pace, do you have any guidance on that of what to expect there?
Bruce Van Saun: One thing I would say is, the reason we front loaded them last year was we were helping RBS exit their position. So we were buying their stock back and we were still issuing their stock to the market, so we had no buyback program to the market. And we got them out of the stock in October which left us basically with no buy capacity from October through June 30 of this year. The good news is, now that we have authorization to buy $690 million, we're not going to repeat that. Obviously, we're going to try to spread that out so we have some buying capacity in the whole, each of the four quarters. But, clearly, when there's events, when the stock gets washed out, like it did, when the market goes to risk offload we will step up and buy more. That's what any prudent treasurer would be doing.
Jesus Bueno: And just going back to the loan purchases, could you break out, what were the originations on the refi product for student? And, I guess, separately, what were the SoFi purchases during the quarter?
Brad Conner: Yes I do. The refi originations were $340 million for the quarter and SoFi purchases were also about $300 million, I believe.
Jesus Bueno: I just have one more, just on the provision. I guess, based on the 3Q guidance, you are actually running even below your guidance that you had initially put up for the year, so I guess, so how do you feel about your original guidance? Do you think we could actually come in below that for the year on provision?
Bruce Van Saun: It's a little early to say. I would just say that we've been pleasantly surprised. We were pleasantly surprised last year and the credit metrics remain very solid. So we will see how it plays out. At this point, we're just guiding one quarter at a time and we're calling for provisions to be broadly stable, but the skew could be more to the positive new side than the negative at this point absent any unforeseen changes in the economy or any SCUD missiles that could always hit you at any time.
Jesus Bueno: Fair enough. Thank you very much for taking my questions.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. I think we're at the top of the hour here. Actually, we ran over by five minutes or so. But, again, I want to thank everybody for dialing in today and listening to our presentation and asking good questions and have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-04-22 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning everyone. And welcome to the Citizens Financial Group’s First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad and I’ll be your operator on the call today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor: Thanks Brad. Good morning everyone. We really appreciate you joining us. We know it's a busy day. We’re going to kick things off with our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and CFO, Eric Aboaf reviewing our first quarter results and then we’ll open the call for questions. We’ve also got in the room with us today Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking. I need to remind everyone that in addition to today’s press release, we have also provided presentation and supplement, and those materials are available at investor.citizensbank.com. And of course our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from those expectations in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K we filed today, and we also utilize non-GAAP financial measures, and provide information and reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and earnings material. And with that, I’m going to hand it over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks Ellen. Good morning everyone and thanks for dialing in. Q1 was another good quarter for Citizens. Let me briefly cover a few of the highlights. We were pleased that we continue to achieve good loan growth. We’re bringing new customers into the Bank. We’re doing a good job of delivering better risk adjusted loan yields and in managing our deposit costs. As a result, our net interest margin was up 9 basis points versus Q4 with half the benefit resulting from the Fed December rate hike and half coming from our own actions. This strength in net interest income was partly offset by weakness in fee categories, which is partly the result of seasonality, partly market conditions, and partly some challenges in getting full traction on a couple of initiatives. That said, we’re addressing the underlying challenges and we’re hopeful that market conditions are improving as the year goes on. Our discipline around expenses remains excellent. We have a mindset of continuous improvement, and we recycle savings to fund investments from our growth initiatives. I was pleased that our tangible book value per share grew by 2% sequentially to $25.21. And then we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.12 per share. Our CET 1 capital ratio remains very robust at 11.6%. Our credits metrics remained strong and stable. An increase in NPAs and reserves related to the SNC review of oil and gas loans was largely offset by improvements in retail loans, including a planned TDR sale that Eric will fill you in on in a minute. We feel our oil and gas exposure is modest and it's well reserved. We continue to focus on delivering well for all our stakeholder groups, including customers, colleagues and communities. I continue to see good progress across the board. In addition, we are focused on improving our risk and regulatory capabilities, and feel we put forth a strong effort on our CCAR/DFAST submission. With that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through our financials in more detail. Eric?
Eric Aboaf: Thank you Bruce, and good morning everyone. In the first quarter we continue to make progress around our growth, efficiency and balance sheet initiatives. We are managing the balance sheet to generate attractive loan and deposit growth and actively managing NIM. We continue to control costs and deliver strong operating leverage. And once again credit costs are well behaved as we navigate through the current economic environment. My comments this morning refer to our first quarter 2016 earnings presentation which you can find at citizensbank.com. Let's start on Page 4, with our first quarter financial summary, where we provide our GAAP results of $223 million and $0.41 a share. On Page 5,on a linked quarter basis, GAAP net income of $223 million was flat to the fourth quarter on strong NII, seasonally light fees, flat expenses and stable provision. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, net income increased $8 million or 4% to diluted EPS growth of 5%, driven by positive operating leverage of 3%. On a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue by $51 million or 4%. Net interest income of $904 million increased 8%, reflecting strong average loan growth. Non-interest income declined $17 million or 5%, as growth in service charges and fees were more than offset by lower mortgage banking fees and the impact of the card reward accounting change. Year-over-year we continue to make measurable progress against our goal of enhancing our efficiency, while reinvesting in the franchise. Expenses were up only 1%. Our efficiency ratio of 66% improved 2% relative to the first quarter of last year. Provision was up $32 million on a year-over-year basis, but first quarter 2015 included the benefit of large commercial recoveries of $22 million.Importantly credit cost also remained stable linked quarter as commercial credit began to normalize and we saw improving trends in our retail book. Note that tangible book value per share is now $25.21, up 2% relative to year end 2015. Let's move on to Page 6. We saw a nice lift in net interest income this quarter, which was up $34 million or 4% from fourth quarter on the back of 9 basis points of NIM expansion. We continue to generate attractive average loan growth of 2% with strength in commercial, student and mortgages. On a year-over-year basis, net interest increased $68 million or 8% due to strong average loan growth of 7%. These results also reflect our improving net interest margin. So as you can see on Page 7, our net interest margin increased 9 basis points linked quarter, as our loan yields expanded, given the benefit of the December Fed rate increase and we continue to shift our mix to higher yielding asset classes. We were also able to hold deposit costs flat notwithstanding the Fed rate increase on average across our businesses. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of a lower federal reserve stock dividend. The margin expansion this quarter came in a bit stronger than we had anticipated. While loan yields rose in sync with high LIBOR and Prime rate, our deposit cost remained low. Specifically, we consciously lowered pricing of consumer interest bearing deposits down 4 basis points as we saw good DDA growth. Commercial deposit cost did move up in response to the fed tightening quite a bit less than expected. Now we do expect deposits to creep up in the future and betas [ph] to normalize, we were quite pleased with the results we produced this quarter. We'll provide some more color on our NIM expectations for the second quarter shortly as we are also keeping a close watch on the long end of the yield curve. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, net interest margin also expanded 9 basis points, benefited by improved loan yields and mix and a more efficient investment portfolio, partially offset by higher volume costs. We maintained a stable asset sensitive position, and ended the quarter at 6.9% compared with fourth quarter 2015 at approximately 6.1%. On Slide 8, let's take a closer look at non-interest income. Our linked quarter results reflectboth the impact of normal seasonality and service charges in cardfees as well as some continued pressure from the market volatility, investment services, interest rate products and foreign exchange. This actually maps a rebound in our capital market fees. I need to remind you that our results also reflect a $7 million decrease in cards fee related to the rewards expense accounting change we discussed last quarter. Without this change, card fees would have been down $3 million linked quarter but up $5 million year-over-year or up 8%. On a year-over-year basis, we posted 7% growth in service charges and fees, driven by both continued household growth, as well as our treasury solutions pricing initiatives in both commercial and business banking. Investment service fees were up year-over-year, notwithstanding the recent market volatility and we’ve now seen two strong quarters of that FC [ph] hiring, which should help drive future growth. In mortgage banking, we continue to see higher applications quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year, but the lower consuming mix and MSR valuations are impacting fee revenues. In the first quarter of 2015, our results benefited from higher gains on loan sales. Turning to expenses on Slide 9, we’re continuing to do a great job of self-funding our investment initiatives as expenses were stable linked quarter and up only 1% on an adjusted basis year-over-year. Linked quarter salaries and benefits were seasonally higher by $16 million as payroll taxes and incentives increased, while occupancy costswere slightly higher. We offset this increase by spending less on outside services as well as lower other expense, which included the impact of the cards reward accounting change. On a year-on-year basis, salaries and employee benefits were up, modestly reflecting continued investments in growth initiatives to help drive top line revenue, partially offset by our efficiency programs. Let's jump over to Page 11. In consumer, we continue to grow balances at a nice pace, up 2% linked quarter and 7% year-over-year, driven by effective opportunities, predominantly in student mortgage. We’re also seeing a nice uptick in our unsecured retail loans, which include the iPhone product. Consumer loan yields increased 11 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher prime rate as well as continued improvement in mix. On Slide 12, commercial loan demand was strong this quarter. Commercial loans increased 3% linked quarter and 9% year-over-year as we continue to build momentum in more attractive return areas. On both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis, we generated growth across most of our target areas; commercial real-estate, corporate finance, franchise finance, mid-corporate and industry verticals. Slide 13 focuses on the liability side of the balance sheet and our funding cost. Average interest bearing deposits grew $613 million or 1% linked quarter with particular strength in checking and savings and money markets. Our deposit costs remain stable this quarter, reflecting disciplined balanced pricing actions in consumer banking as I mentioned earlier. On Slide 14, I’ll hit the highlights on credit quality metrics, which remain relatively stable with the fourth quarter in aggregate. Our NPLs were essentially flat at $1.1 billion notwithstanding a $210 million increase in oil and gas non-performing loans following the March make review and revised regulatory guidance related to multi-tiered structures. This increase was largely offset by improvement in retail from several items of roughly $100 million reduction in retail non-performing loans due in part to the TDR transaction I’ll cover on the next page, a benefit from reclassifying a pool that [indiscernible] didn’t make energy loans and a broad overall improvement in retail credit. Provision expense in the quarter was stable at $91 million. During the quarter, we increased reserves on oil and gas portfolio by $30 million to $61 million, which included a $17 million overlay. On Slide 27 in the appendix we provide more detail on the oil and gas portfolio with reserves now at 6% for the more price sensitive portfolios. This reserve build was partially offset by a release of roughly 60 million reserves tied to moving the TDR portfolio to held for sale along with favorable trends in retail performance.Our allowance to loan ratio came in at 1.21% while our allowance to NPL ratio was 113%, both of which are relatively flat to the fourth quarter. Overall, we feel good about credit quality and reserving levels. So we will continue closely monitor the oil and gas portfolio. On Slide 15, we provide more details on our TDR transaction. As we’ve continued to focus on optimizing the balance sheet and generating more attractive returns on capital, we’ve work to identify additional areas like portfolio sales and securitizations where we can drive benefits. During the first quarter, we identified a $373 million portfolio of consumer real-estate TDR loans that we plan to sell late in the second quarter or early third quarter. We transferred these loans to held for sale which lowered our NPL by $97 million. Once the transaction closes, given current home values, we expect to realize a moderate gain as well as benefit on risk weighted assets and provide a partial offset to third quarter formulate increase in FDIC assessment cost. On a net basis, these assessment costs are expected to have a very modest impact on second half 2016 expenses and no impact on our previous full year guidance. On Slide 16, you see our strong capital and liquidity ratios. You also see that we executed a sub-debt buyback of $125 million in March outside of the traditional CCAR process. On Slide 17 we’ve laid out the key initiatives that support balance sheet and fee growth in our turnaround plan, as well as incremental initiatives and assess progress during the quarter. We’ll continue to lay strong foundations and gain momentum across most of these initiatives, and are intensely addressing some of our challenges in mortgage while making solid progress in wealth and asset finance. Turning to Slide 18, let me summarize some of what you can expect next quarter, but all in the context of the full year 2015 outlook that we previously provided and that we broadly reaffirm today. So compared to the first quarter of 2016 we expect to produce linked quarter loan growth of roughly 2%. We also expect net interest margin to be relatively stable, based on the curve as of March 2016, which reflects some pressure from the long end as I mentioned earlier. We are tightly depending [ph] the margin and believe there's more we can do organically to control our deposit cost and improve our loan yield. We still anticipate the Fed moving price this year, but we'll stay focused on what we can control. We do expect mid-single digit fee growth without any 2Q security gains. We expect modest expense growth in Q2 as efficiency initiatives provide a partial offset to continued investment spend. We would expect to continue to generate strong positive operating leverage, thereby improving our efficiency ratio, profitability and returns. We expect underlying credit metrics to remain largely stable with a modest increase in provision in 2Q driven by volume growth. And finally we expect to see our CET 1 ratio come in at 11.6% and we will manage the LDR to around 98%. With that let me turn it back to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks Eric. In short, another solid quarter in executing against our turnaround plans. The key takeaways are shown on Slide 19. So with that Brad, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you, [Operator Instructions] and we'll go to the line of David Eads with UBS.Please go ahead.
David Eads: Can we start on the fee side, and maybe on the mortgage hiring, you talked about, seems like the production is still a little bit strong on the jumbo side? Is there anything you guys are working to do to improve some of -- to broaden and improve conforming originations.
Bruce Van Saun: Why don't I start and flip it over to Brad?One of the challenges we've had is that we put in a new system. I think we said on the last call around the time that the [indiscernible] came in and we had to originate TRID compliant loans, so that took some work ultimately to bed down that system and get back to good operational metrics. That has slowed down our net hiring both in Q4 and Q1. So we're treading water a bit, but we expect that now I think we've got that under control, and the operating metrics continue to improve.So we should now be able to move towards positive net recruiting throughout the rest of the year. Part of that effort is to really focus on markets and producers that can deliver a greater mix of conforming originations compared to what we've currently which is roughly been about 60% non-conforming and 40% conforming. So I think part of it is selection, part of it is market geographic focus, and then also having that operational excellence because those conforming oriented producers need to make sure that they can get their mortgages through the pipeline relatively quickly. So I'll turn it over to Brad.
Brad Conner: Bruce you said it extremely well. The only couple of things I would add to that is as you mentioned, we implemented our new loan originations system in conjunction with TRID. One of the additional challenges that that created for us in terms of conforming production as in order to get that system in, some of the product development work that we needed to do to get the right conforming and FAJ product in place, we had to put on hold. So we are working really hard to get some new products in that will be more attractive to conforming loan offers. And so I -- and Bruce you made the point exactly right, which is we did have some operational stress and operational challenges and I think that's a little more painful in terms of attracting conforming loan officers than the non-conforming loan officers. So we're working very, very hard and we really feel like we're turning the corner in terms of the operations. We did add capacity in terms of operations headcount. We had a good turn of the pipeline particularly in March, a good strong closing month in March. So we feel like we're turning the corner and maybe able to start hiring and getting the traction of the more conforming loan officers.
David Eads: Thanks, and then maybe, just a little on the increase in the dividend this quarter and I realize there's not a whole lot you can talk about the next PCAR, but if there's any color you could give on how that might influence -- how you guys think about the trade-offs between dividend and buyback going forward.
Bruce Van Saun: Well I think we want to maintain a strong and healthy dividend that grows. And so this is a step in that direction. We'd like to be in a payout ratio of 25% to 30%. So taking care of the dividend is kind of job one. I think the next thing when we think about capital management, we want to make sure we're funding loan growth. So where we have attractive opportunities to grow the loan book, bring new customers into the bank, we want to make sure were doing that. And then we also want to be shareholder friendly and buyback our stocks with the most of most that we can do. I think we're in the kind of strong position at this point, given that the relatively high capital ratios to peers that we can do it all for the time being. So we are able to raise the dividend. We can fund reasonably aggressive loan growth and we can be I think reasonably aggressive at this point in time in terms of the buyback that we've been able to effect over the past couple of cycles and we'll wait and see what we're doing in this cycle. Eric do you want to add anything to that?
Eric Aboaf: I'll just add that last year we obviously had our first non-objectionablepass for CCAR. This year we were committed and gave as much work as we did a year ago. So we've kept up the internal pace of all the improvement and remediation and making sure that we're leading the pack as opposed to just barely there on the requirements. And I think that gives us some confidence to put in for an appropriate return of capital to the shareholder, while balancing the strength of the franchise. But as Bruce said, we have very, very strong capital ratios, top of the leaderboard and so that gives us some confidence.
Operator: And will go to the next question, that will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
Vivek Juneja: A couple of questions, thanks. On the dividend increase, Bruce, Eric, do you all have to -- it seems like this was a little off cycle. Did you have to go get a special approval from the board or from the Fed or can you walk through the process a little bit.
Bruce Van Saun: Go ahead, Eric
Eric Aboaf: Let me just take that. This was part of our annual CCAR app a year ago. We had paced it [ph], why? Because we wanted to pay dividend levels with income growth. you've seen us deliver on that income growth quarter after quarter after quarter, driven by the positive operating leverage and the performance of the franchise. This is a natural time during that plan to raise the dividend and given we deliver on the income; we had done the app a year ago. We and the board went ahead with that increase. We didn't need to have ask anything special from the regulators. The only place we did do that was on the sub-debt buyback which we did back in the February/March time period, and I think as I mentioned in my opening comments, that was a special ask over and above the annual CCAR.
Vivek Juneja: I know that you can't tell me about CCAR. Can you talk a little bit about how you're feeling, given the very strong capital position you are still in? Either of you?
Bruce Van Saun: I think it's a little hard for us to comment at this point with the submission just filed. But I do think we continue to invest in our capital planning and management capabilities. I think we really keep upping our game. We know what we need to do to get strong in this area. So we feel good about the effort that we put forth and the progress that we are making. And on the quantitative side, as we said, we've got relatively strong capital ratios relative to peers. And so I think you would expect us to be kind of in sync with where we've been historically.
Vivek Juneja: One more, nice job on the NIM. Just, can you talk a little bit about efficiency ratio and anything that we should think about as we look out, in terms of where you're all expecting that to go?
Bruce Van Saun: Let me take it and Eric, I will flip to you. But we are targeting ultimately to bring that down around 60%. And the key to doing that is positive operating levels. So the holy grail here, if you will, the mantra is that we got to grow our revenues faster than our expenses. We've done that for a number of quarters in a row. You can see again, this quarter year-on-year basis, 3% positive operating leverage. If we keep doing that, that efficiency ratio is going to improve. It is 2% better than it was last year, and I think you can see those kind of moves provided we continue to execute our plan. Eric?
Eric Aboaf: I'll just add that we're going to keep chipping away at this quarter after quarter, 200 basis points year, 0.5 point a quarter. You can do the math. The NII growth will help. Some of the seasonal rebound we expect from fees will help. And then we've got to be extremely disciplined on our expenses. You saw them up 1% year over year, flat sequentially. We've got to find a way to come in at the low-end of our expense guide and we've got to find a way to come in at a strong operating leverage and we have every intention to meter out and to carefully invest but only behind revenues, as opposed to the other way around.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.
John Pancari: I just wanted to see if you can give us your updated thoughts on your ROE walk for the full year? What your updated expectations are in terms of what you're targeting for end of the year ROE and what are the main drivers there?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I think we gave very detailed guidance at the January call. And we left the ROTCE calculation to you. So I think what we've said today, as Eric went over the guidance is that we're broadly comfortable with that full-year guidance. I think there will be some puts and takes. There is a little bit of headwinds starting out of the gate in fee revenue, not just for us but for the whole industry, frankly. And we've got to try to make up ground there. If we end up a little light on the fees relative to that guidance, the places that we trying compensate, one would be trying to end up in the higher end of the range on net interest income, which I think we're off to a great start on net interest income. And to grind down on expenses a little bit which we're -- you can count on us to be thinking of ways to do that on a regular basis. So of you average out those puts and takes, we think we are tracking to our expectations for the year. I think the credit outlook, notwithstanding some issues in the oil patch, we're still comfortable with that initial guidance we gave for the full year. So you can do the math on that. I do think that ROTCE will start to move higher as we deliver that positive operating leverage, as we get some bigger EPS jumps as the year goes along and as we start buying back our stock when we get to the next CCAR cycle. Eric, do you want to add to that?
Eric Aboaf: Let me just add that this is a marathon, not a sprint. We do it every quarter and trying to build on the last assessment about we've got to get the efficiency ratio improved quarter after quarter. And we think as we do that, and then manage the mix of the top line and expenses, we can make some headway on it. Clearly we want to get out of the 6%, the high 6% range to the high 7% and we will figure how to get to the next step. It's going to be quarter after quarter, inch by inch.
John Pancari: And on that note is it fair to say that when looking at that full-year guidance, if you do achieve that, that you're in that 7% to 7.5% ROTCE range?
Bruce Van Saun: At this point there's -- you can do the modeling. I think that is what the modeling of the guidance suggests, that we gave back in January. And as we've said in the opening, we're broadly affirming that guidance and that includes the range that I think you just quoted.
John Pancari: Thanks, Eric, and one thing on energy. What do you include in the non-price sensitive portfolios for energy?
Eric Aboaf: I think you've just got the standard downstream retail, that sort of thing. So I think if you -- we've been pretty standard with the others in the industry.
Bruce Van Saun: Midstream, downstream.
Eric Aboaf: Midstream, downstream and some of the integrated players.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Matt O'Connor: Just a couple of NIM questions. Can you talk about much more, call it organic opportunity there is to drive NIM higher over time, whether it's the mix shift or managing liabilities like you benefit from those quarters? How much left is there of that?
Eric Aboaf: I think it's a never ending battle with rates where they are today. We've got a really night nice lift from the Fed hike that came through on the yield side both in consumer and commercial. There's a little bit left of that because some of that came in in January, February for a couple of their portfolios, given how they're contractually repricing. So we have a little bit of a tailwind there. On the other side of the ledger, the long end is a lot lower than it was before. So that creates a bit of a headwind that we have to work through. So given that, it means we have to keep being intensely focused on our deposit cost kind of management and we've got to build balances and do them in a disciplined way. I think commercial clients will always be asking for a little more rate because their loans were priced. So we've got to address that and we have to find a way to navigate that carefully. And then I think on the loan yields mix side, I think that is an area of tailwind that we have confidence in to continue. So I think we said broadly stable into the second quarter, up or down a basis point or thereabouts. So kind of in that range. I think the second half of the year will kind of depend on where the Fed goes and also where market expectations are, where the back end of the curve bounces around to.
Matt O'Connor: And as we think about eventually further increases in Fed funds, at least hopefully; do you expect similar leverage to the next one or two increases? Like how do you think about how linear leverages this. So quarter, you got 4 or 5 basis points to benefit, it seems like, from the Fed? Is that a good starting point for the next 25 or do you start having pressure on the deposit rates?
Bruce Van Saun: When we gave you that guidance in January, the forward curve at the time presumed a -- I think it was June --
Eric Aboaf: Yes.
Bruce Van Saun: -- increase and then a December increase. Which still looks reasonable to us. And I'm not sure the market thinks that but I think the economic data and the kind of anecdotes we have from what's going on with our customers, would indicate that that would be a good course of action for the Fed to take. But when we gave you that guidance, we said there would be about a $35 million benefit this year from the June increase and $5 million ish benefit from the one in December, which only has a small impact on 2016 but obviously would benefit 2017. I think the -- there's still a good benefit from that, but I think as Eric's pointed out, you've had the curve flattened at the back end, which is something to contend with.
Eric Aboaf: I think the next increase will be nicely beneficial. Maybe not worth the $50 million a year that the first one was but something in that -- near that. What that would also do is put us in a position where you can't down shift as easily as we did, for example taking our deposit cost down. We took them down 4 basis points this quarter. That's not the kind of thing we can repeat two quarters in a row. But let me tell you, we are looking at every part of the pricing structure. Every way we acquire our clients and every way we manage that book and are trying to squeak out opportunities.
Brad Conner: Yes. If you look at our yields relative to the peers, now we've closed the gap almost all the way from. Where we used to have a fairly significant gap and where we still have a remaining gap is in our cost of funds. So we know we still have work to do there.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Gerard Cassidy: Can you guys give us some color -- your capital is so strong and laid out very well in your presentation relative to the minimum requirements. What do you think it would take for you to be able to give back more than 100% of earnings? Will the Fed actually have to come out and give all of you and your peers that can do it, actual guidance? Or is it you got to read the body language and then take a chance and -- I'm not suggesting you do that this year, but in the future take a chance and ask for more than 100% of earnings.
Eric Aboaf: I don't know, you certainly -- I don't think you want to go first. I would just say that we are comfortable with the glide path that we have been on. So when we were separated -- when the plan was announced to separate Citizens from RBS, the good news is that we started with an almost 14% CET 1 ratio. And over the past 2.5-3 years, we have been gliding down to 11.6% through paying the dividends. And we did our conversion transactions which is effectively a buyback and then very strong loan growth in the 8% range. And I think that still feels good to us. We have just continued to glide this down. We're a relatively new company and I think our earnings are below where we'd would like them to be in the longer term. So we need to get our sources of capital up, but it's good that we have the capital strength behind us that we can continue to take advantage of that. And we can grow loans aggressively, we can put in reasonably aggressive asks in the CCAR process. And I don't really think it benefits us dramatically to think about going over 100 at this point.
Gerard Cassidy: In terms of the ideal capital level, at some point, we presume Citizens and your peers will get there? In your view, what is the ideal Tier 1 common ratio that you think you can run the company at? I'm assuming the current level's too high.
Bruce Van Saun: Well, I would say if you look at peers, probably the peer average or median is around 10%-ish. And so most peers profess that they feel a little fat at 10% and they'd like to get to something between 9% and 10%. And I think from our standpoint, we're at 11.6%, and we must keep executing our plan, getting our earnings up, bringing that capital ratio down gradually. I don't see any reason that we should be -- have that kind of new guide premium forever. There's nothing in our business model, or nothing in our stress test results that says that we need a premium relative to where the peer group goes. So I think it's really just as simple as you watch where the pack is going and we're trying to close in on the pack and ultimately we'll get there over time.
Gerard Cassidy: Great. And then, just finally, your loan to deposit ratio obviously is in the high 90s. Where do you target that? Are you comfortable where you are now or would you be comfortable going over 100% loan to deposits? What's your guy's view on your loan to deposit ratio?
Eric Aboaf: Gerard, its Eric. I think for the time being, we're quite comfortable with the 98%, 99% that we've been running at. It's a healthy way to run a regional bank. And we want to do it in a meat and potatoes way and just having the right set of deposits against loans is helpful. I think we tend to run a little more -- a little higher in LCRs, but that's because we have a larger retail deposit base. That gives us the confidence run closer to that 99% than the 90% that others are at. I think over time what you'll find is that the regulatory guidelines, whether it's LCR or an FFR, get baked in. And right now we are at that kind of 90% LCR requirement, and we're well over that. We've said we are well over the 100% level. Once the NCSFR comes of age, I think at that point we'll see if it makes sense to recalibrate a little bit. But for the time being we're quite comfortable at the level we are at.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.
Ken Zerbe: First question, it looks like student lending continues to grow really well. Are you guys seeing any noticeable increase in competition in the student lending market from other banks?
Bruce Van Saun: I will turn it over to Brad.
Brad Conner: Yes. I would say we are definitely seeing some competition in the refi loan space. So we haven't seen a lot of new players in the in-school space. We've seen players like SoFi and Darian and others in the refi area. But I would say at this point, margins are holding nicely. There is still good strong demand, so we feel good about the opportunity. But yes, there is some competition in the refi space.
Eric Aboaf: But it's not bad competition, right, because it creates awareness among borrowers. You see TV ads out there so we don't have to spend on the TV. But it allows us for direct marketing and online channels to close loans.
Bruce Van Saun: I think it's very good point, Eric. There's a lot more awareness among consumers about the ability to refinance student debt. I think you're absolutely right on that point.
Ken Zerbe: Does that level of competition or increase -- ultimately change the pace of growth in student lending in the next few quarters?
Brad Conner: Our view is, no. There is still an enormous opportunity in the marketplace in terms of consumers who are eligible for student loan refinancing, and so demand will remain strong for the foreseeable future.
Eric Aboaf: I think that the thing that we think about is as you maintain this growth rate, you come to, what's the theoretical asset allocation you want to that asset class. And so I think this is a juggernaut that can continue to grow on our balance sheet and then do we want to have options to move some of those assets off the balance sheet through sales or securitization. So I think it's a rich man's problem at this point.
Ken Zerbe: Fair enough. And Just the other question I have in terms of the capital markets business, can you just remind us how your business may differ from other banks? I know the first quarter is a very difficult quarter, but it looks like your capital markets revenue held up pretty well?
Bruce Van Saun: Don?
Don McCree: There's a lot of syndicated finance in our capital markets and a lot of bank content versus institutional content. So fourth quarter's obviously a tough quarter as the whole market basically shut down on the volatility of the high-yield market and the institutional market. We actually came through quite clean versus a lot of the competition, and we're able to take advantage of a few very attractive opportunities that were available in the first quarter. And that's really what drove the first-quarter revenue. As we move into the second quarter we see continued progress in that. The breadth of opportunity is growing and as we are getting a little bit of thaw in the broader capital markets, we're seeing transaction flow increasing. It will be a little market dependent around actually how we close all of those and where they fall over the next few quarters, but we are quite encouraged about the breadth of activity here.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, if you look at, historically, the second quarter has been a relatively strong quarter for capital markets fees, and I would say that at this point our pipeline is tracking with those historic builds for Q2.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.
Kevin Barker: It seems like you obviously have a capital problem yet obviously need to grow revenue. You're attempting to do that. So why not look at potentially acquiring non-bank in order to accelerate the fee income growth and utilize your capital base?
Eric Aboaf: Yes, I think at this point what we're focused on is just the organic opportunities that we have right in front of us. So in our turnaround plan I think we can get good organic growth. And we have to demonstrate that we can build our capabilities and run the bank better, which I think we're doing. I do think, to your question though, there is a point where we will feel that it is appropriate to look for opportunities to deploy some of that excess capital into acquisitions. And I think fee-based businesses would be of interest. Having said that, I think you have to be careful there, because they typically are going to trade at premium valuations. And a lot of times their businesses -- if they're a business like a wealth business or a capital markets business where the assets go out the elevator every night. So you need to be careful about how you structure those deals. I still think that's a bit down the road. I don't see us looking to do any acquisitions in 2016. But as we continue to improve how we are running, I think we'll start to look, potentially in 2017 or 2018.
Kevin Barker: Is that decision being made -- is that primarily because of regulatory constraints, or due to your own decision to shore up the core operations as they stand now?
Bruce Van Saun: I think it's our decision. But I do think you have to bring all of your stakeholders along when you start to move in that direction. I think shareholders want to see us running the bank better and we have said that there is a lot we can do in that regard. So they want to see us deliver against that before we start getting distracted with doing more. I think regulators as well, have seen us make progress on things like CCAR and moving to heightened standards and some of the other things where the bar is going up and you have to stay focused on that agenda as well. So I think you just need to demonstrate that you're running things well and I think all the stakeholders will say, yes, you have earned the right to go out and do some more. But I don't think we're quite at that point, at this point.
Kevin Barker: And then, on auto lending, you've pulled back from the market and reduced the amount of capital you allocated to auto done well with charge-offs and delinquency rates have increased significantly through 2015. Could you just give us a feel for what you're seeing in the market right now, and your expectations through 2016 and into 2017 regarding that market?
Bruce Van Saun: I will start and Brad and even Eric can chime in. But I think that we made conscious decisions to move into the prime lending space from super prime. So the increase in charge-offs tracks higher yields as well. So the returns in the business have gone up over this period. And I would say from Q4 to Q1, we have actually seen an improvement in terms of delinquencies and other measures around credit. So I think we've stayed very disciplined. So we've expanded our risk appetite a bit. We're disciplined in terms of terms and conditions and in terms of the different markets not playing in sub-prime. But we needed to do that because the reality was that in super prime, you couldn't make a good return on capital. So that's really what's behind that but I'll let Brad provide some color.
Brad Conner: Bruce, I think you said it extremely well. And to your point, 30-day delinquencies were down for us, 90-day delinquencies were down for us, charge-offs were down, the portfolios' performance are tracking right in line. We're made a conscious decision to grow our assets in other areas with a little bit higher risk adjusted returns, like student, like we talked about. But we are actually quite comfortable with where we're at right now in auto, and feel very good about our credit performance.
Eric Aboaf: What I've add is that tapping the brakes a little bit on our originations and slowing down growth gave us the opportunity to adjust pricing. Guidance that falls right to the bottom line. We might do that again at some point or this is a classic asset class. It doesn't have as high returns as you would like, it actually has good stable credit dynamics, but not as high returns as you would like. And we'll be looking at pricing, we will look at securitization, we'll look at all the things you can do to essentially optimize this more over time.
Bruce Van Saun: And you could expect that as a percentage of our total loan assets, this will decline over time as we seek other opportunities to deploy our capital into better risk adjusted return areas.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Jason Harris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jason Harris: Question on fees. So you I think affirmed the guidance this year for fee income growth in the 2% to 3% range. But if I look at the guidance for Q2 and the Q1 result, it looks like fees are trending down kind of low to mid-single digits for the first half. So I'm trying to understand where some of the improvement will come from in the back half.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, Eric, why don't you pick that one up.
Eric Aboaf: Yes, let me start. I think that the anchor on fees, as we said, was service charges, right? And that -- given that, that is 40% of our book. I think, as you just work the numbers though, just remember the original guidance of 5% to 7% was kind of the old accounting basis but card fees actually impacts the reported results by 2 to 3 percentage points. So keep that in mind as you compare and contrast. That said, I think the real uptakes need to come on the investment side. And I thought it was actually nice that we did. We were up 3% year-on-year notwithstanding the ugly markets we saw in January and February. You remember with those felt like. Mortgages, as we shift to conforming activity and we talked through that earlier in the call, gives us a very natural lift. You could keep a pipeline coming and the originations coming, and if you could shift that mix by 5 percentage points or, at some point, 10 percentage points, that's very powerful. And so a number of initiatives underway to do that. That takes time, but that will come. And then I think there is a question on capital markets and a strong second quarter and a good second half of economic activity. You saw the economic signs out there, are quite positive now. Sharp contrast to what everyone felt like in January and February. And so that one can certainly pick up. Every one of those has work to be done. But we feel like we need to keep finding ways to get there.
Brad Conner: Eric, if I can chime in very quickly, I think you hit it well. You mentioned it in your opening comments, we have had two very good recruiting quarters in a row with financial consultants. Difficult quarter, just because of the market volatility but we feel very good about the underlying trends both in hiring and sales results in investments. So I think we feel quite optimistic about the opportunity in wealth and investments. One other quick thing to highlight, first quarter is a seasonally low quarter for deposit fees. So that's something to consider as well.
Bruce Van Saun: The other thing that I would just chime in -- it's Bruce again is in my earlier remarks I said there will probably be some puts and takes on the year. And we might end up a tad late on fees. We have to make up for it with better net interest income or better performance on expenses. So we broadly reaffirmed our overall guidance, but there will probably be some puts and takes. So don't forget that comment. And then In the second quarter, that guidance to mid-single digits, as Eric pointed out, that's assuming a zero securities gain and we typically have some securities gains. If you put the same kind of security gains we had in Q1, that would push that up into a high single digit number. So just wanted to make that point clear as well.
Jason Harris: If I could, just as a follow-up, drill down specifically into the card segment, which I know has been a key growth initiative for you. It looks like you saw nice improvement in the average yield in that portfolio this quarter. With was that primarily a function of the higher prime rate this quarter? Or did you also see some improved revolve rates? And also any commentary around penetration would be helpful as well.
Eric Aboaf: Let me hit the financials first, and then Brad will describe a little more of the business activity under the surface. The yields tend to do well in the first quarter, probably was exactly as you describe. Primary came up and so the book repriced and that gained a very nice lift. Probably you just had pay down activity on some of the book. You roll through some of the acquisition fees that you may have seen in the third and fourth quarter, and so you end up with more fully priced balances which gives you a second tick up. So those were the two on the financial side.
Brad Conner: I think you hit it well. We launched a new card product last year, as a much improved value proposition which has improved revolve rates and card activation and usage pretty significantly, but it's also given us the ability to move away from the promotional rate. So that's been an influencer as well.
Bruce Van Saun: Great. Brad, is there anyone else on the line? Do we have any more calls on queue?
Operator: Currently no further questions in queue.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, great. Well, thank you everybody for dialing in today. Really appreciate your interest and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude our conference today. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q4  (2016-01-22 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning everyone. And welcome to the Citizens Financial Group’s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad and I’ll be your operator for today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I’ll turn the conference over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor: Thanks, Brad and good morning everybody. Thanks so much for being with us today. We’re going to start the morning off with our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and our CFO, Eric Aboaf reviewing our fourth quarter and full year results and then we’re going to open up the call for questions. With us today are also Brad Conner, our Head of Consumer Bank, and Don McCree, our Head of Commercial Bank. I’d like to remind you all that in addition to the press release, we’ve also provided a presentation and financial supplement, and you can find all those materials on our Web site at investor.citizensbank.com. And of course I need to remind you that during the call, we make some forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. And the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Additionally, any information about any non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures may be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement that are available on our Web site. And with that, I’m going to hand it over to our CEO, Bruce Van Saun.
Bruce Van Saun: Well hi and good morning everyone, I appreciate you’re dialing in. 2015 was the year of significant progress for Citizens. We completed our separation from RBS becoming fully independent in late October. Our financial progress was in line with expectations and guidance in spite of a lower rate environment than anticipated. We achieved good loan and deposit growth we delivered positive operating leverage and savings from our efficiency initiative kept expenses flat notwithstanding significant investments in growth areas and in technology. We made strides in improving our product offerings and service quality and customer satisfaction is trending upwards. We hired some great talent including Eric and Don right here with me and we have some great new initiatives on the colleague front like leadership development and carrier mapping. Our risk management capabilities continue to strengthen, we have had a good result on CCAR and we’re working hard to achieve the regulators tightened standards. And we continue to deliver enhanced technology capabilities including a new backup datacenter, a new mortgage platform and expanded online and mobile capabilities, so all-in-all, solid performance on all dimensions, backing well against our turnaround plan. We ended the year with a good fourth quarter and we feel good about our trajectory as we had into 2016. In Q4, we achieved good loan growth, as well as good NII and fee growth. We had expected to do even better but the leverage credit markets became challenged during Q4 disrupting some of our capital markets pipeline. Hopefully that market will come back later in Q1. Expenses increased modestly given technology related spend and 6 million of costs largely associated with our growth and efficiency initiatives. Additionally, our credit provision grew by 15 million versus Q3 due to a reserve build. Earlier this year, we have seen back book improvements offset our reserve build tied to loan growth, but the back book is now so clean and we don’t expect to see much of that continuing. The balance sheet remains robust with excellent capital liquidity and funding position and strong ratios and metrics. For the full year, highlights include 13% adjusted EPS growth, positive operating leverage of 3%, 8% average loan growth and tangible book value per share growth of 5%. All of which I might add compare very favorably with peers. So now I’d like to turn it over to Eric to give a little more color on the financials. Eric?
Eric Aboaf: Thanks, Bruce and good morning everyone. Since Bruce hit some of the highlights I’ll probably let me direct you to a few pages in our slide deck for some color on Q4. On Slide 6 on an adjusted basis, we grew EPS by 5% in the quarter and 8% from the fourth quarter of 2014. This included good operating leverage with revenues up 4% and expenses up by 2%. We improved the efficiency ratio 135 basis points year-over-year. On Slide 9, you can see our NIM was up 1 basis point in the quarter. We’ve done a good job in growing our loan yield by adjusting our mix and risk appetite and being disciplined on pricing. We were also -- we have got to bring interest bearing deposits costs down by 1 basis point this quarter this is a real progress as we sharpened our offerings and pricing strategies. We did lose 1 basis point given higher cash balances tied to some of the long-term funding we raised in the quarter and the effect of those borrowing costs. Now on Slide 10, noninterest income was up 9 million in the quarter with momentum in both consumer and commercial service charges and fees driven by progress in our treasury solutions initiative and some seasonality. Capital markets fees were lower than expected given the fixed income market destruction during the quarter. Securities gains picked up a bit to offset this prolonged with lower other income. Recall that the third quarter included an $8 million brand scale gain. Now on Slide 11, as expected, our adjusted expenses were up linked-quarter given an increase in technology expense. This was driven by the impact of our new back up datacenter coming online along with the implementation of various technology and operations initiatives to improve offerings and drive future revenue growth. Outside of this growth, we helped salaries and benefit cost flat. And we achieved good loan growth in both consumer and commercial during the fourth quarter, which you can see on Pages 13 and 14. In consumer, growth was paced by continued expansion in mortgage and student and we also grew the other retail category, which includes our unsecured iPhone financed products which generated $220 million in balances by yearend. We continue to do a nice job of re-pointing our growth to the higher return category and the yield in consumer expanded accordingly 4 basis points in the quarter. We also saw nice growth in commercial, where we grew commercial real estate loans as client relationships added earlier in the year have to align. We also continue to execute well in the corporate franchise finance and corporate finance, which helped mitigate some of the reductions in middle market as borrowers there continue to reduce line utilization. And in all our balance sheet measures on the next couple of pages, we have stronger than suggested results which you can see. Next I'd like to take you to Slide 18. Here we show how Citizens performed against guidance we gave back in January of 2015. Overall, the results were largely in line, balance sheet growth targets were achieved and while revenue growth was a bit lower than expected largely due to first half and in compression, we were able to offset that with additional efforts on expenses and favorable credit. On Slide 19, we saw a progress against our strategic initiative. Most of this is tracking well, but let me call out a few of the challenges and tell you what we are doing about them. In mortgage our new Head Chris Morris has a clear plan focused on our gaining operational excellence following our introduction of a new hedge fund so what is implied origination platforms in Q4 last year, which caused a slowdown in our throughput and impacted net recruited. We believe execution of this plan will position us for a stronger 2016 in hiring, retention and productivity. In wealth, under the new leadership of John Bahnken we had a strong rebound in recruiting this quarter and we see good higher momentum as we enter 2016. We will continue to migrate forward some more fee-based models, and in asset finance we are repositioning this as a cost of products for our corporate customers in the light of a loss for the RBS customer referral. We saw some good progress in Q4. So all-in-all we posted solid results again in the quarter and for the year and we continue to make good progress against our strategic initiative, efficiency efforts and balance sheet repositioning. We are positioned well as we move into 2016. Back to you, Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks Eric. I'd like to elevate a little starting on Slide 20, to focus on our goals in turning around Citizens. We aspire to be a top performing bank that delivers well for its stakeholders with serving customers well at the heart of our culture. On Slide 21, we show some of the objectives we have within our plan. We made good progress in 2015, pretty much across the board well there is still more to do, we are a work in progress. On Slide 22, you can see the financial targets that we laid out and the steady progress we are making in improving our results. So with that as a backdrop let's shift to our outlook on 2016. Slide 23, the markets are off to a rough start so far but our planning assumption is still for steady U.S. GDP growth, solid loan demand and say one to two more rate hikes coming in July and possibly December. To deliver strong performance, we have a few key objectives. We need to sustain robust loan growth and we need to keep NIM stable to trending up on an underlying basis. Rate hikes if they come will deliver additional benefit. We need to drive our key initiatives and we need to deliver better fee growth. And we will need to keep finding ways to constrain expense growth given our plans and necessary investments in growth initiatives. As we do that well we will again deliver meaningful positive operating leverage. That will cover a normalization of provision and it will drive good growth in earnings. And of course we want to continue to work down our capital surplus through loan growth, a higher dividend and share repurchases. So let's move on to Slide 25. And our guidance, Eric back to you.
Eric Aboaf: Here you can see fairly detailed ranges played out for all key balance sheet and income statement growth measure. A few key items I call out. Loan growth of 6% to 8% and II growth of 7% to 10% with NIM improvement of 6 to 12 bps, the forward curve assumes rate hike in July and December, which would help us get to the high and robust range if they occur. Fee growth of 5% to 7%, expense growth of 2.5% to 3.5% as our efficiency measures provided a greater OpEx investment spending in 2015, well in 2016. Provision normalization to a $375 million to $425 million range, and CET 1 ratio of 11.2% to 11.5%, as an overall comment, we expect we could achieve a better level of revenue growth in 2016 than 2015, due to better performance on demand and on fees this will cover a slightly higher expense growth and a modest comp from 4Q provision levels. We have laid out some useful details behind these growth rates on Slide 38 to 40 in the appendix too. Please take a look at your leisure on Slide 39 for example we detailed the impact to NII of the December 2015 rate hike which is worth 40 million to 50 million and the potential impact is too more in 2016 for the forward curve that we used at the time when we concluded our plan which would be worth 30 million to 40 million. The bulk of this additional benefit is from the July 2016 hike as well as minimal impact from the December '16 hike in the forthcoming year. If we don’t get in more hikes we will have to pull harder on our other NII levers and to view expenses to find offsets. Also note that the current dividend on the Fed stock decreases NII by 17 million and cost us $0.02 a share. We should also highlight that on Slide 41 there was an accounting change for cards reward that we make prospectively in 2016 which you will need to factor into your models. Our outlook for Q1 is shown on Slide 26, fairly straightforward overall to some typical seasonal impacts to consider. So let me turn it back to Bruce to wrap-up.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay thanks Eric. So just in term of good plans to improve its performance, we are building things the right way to be sustainable for the long-term while being mindful of our need to show improvement in our financials in the near-term. We consider 2015 to have been a successful year on all fronts. And we will continue to stay focused on execution in 2016 in order to deliver another successful year. So with that let’s open up for some questions. Brad?
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instruction] And we will go to line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.
Ken Zerbe: Just starting because the energy is such an important topic, I know your energy portfolio is very small, but can you comment on any potential weakness or anything we have seen in that portfolio when you reserve build do you have last quarter?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I would say the portfolios that would be most impacted by change in price levels would be two, the reserve base lending portfolio and oilfield services portfolio. Their combined level of outstandings in those portfolios is about 700 million so it's not very big in the loan book it is over 100 billion. And I would say we have relatively good diversifications so there is good granularity in terms of the supply to those credits and there is a little bit of migration going into classified but it is nothing that we are seeing increase in NPAs or anything that we have really boost our reserve levels meaningfully at this point.
Ken Zerbe: Okay it is perfect. And then just another question on expenses, the expense guidance obviously this quarter had higher outside services fees and tax spending, is that the same main driver of expense growth going forward or does that come down and other areas kind of increase a little bit just trying understand the trajectory there?
Bruce Van Saun: There is a few moving parts there and I will let Eric augment my comments but, one of the same that we are doing is we are at engaging in an outsourcing effort for our infrastructure support with IBM and so you are seeing that line go up a bit and you see other expenses within offset and salaries benefits as can offset. So until that is fully migrated which should be complete by the end of the first quarter, there will be a little geography there. But in the long run that is designed to save us money that’s part of our top initiative and I think the migration is going reasonably well. There is also a little bit of seasonality there in outside services to try and get some projects across the line, we have had a little bit of spike there. So I would say that was really the driver Ken. Eric I don’t know if you want to add anything else?
Eric Aboaf: Yes I’d just add that the equipment expenses probably as a result of some of the spending that we have done to drive some of the revenue growth that you have seen whether it's on mobile, whether it's on some of the other functionality in treasury solutions and cash management, as well as some of the infrastructure, so you got datacenter expenses come through. And those are right at this level maybe up a little more and that’s part of why, we need to keep finding offsets overtime and why we have been very focused for example on headcount which is actually down this quarter and salaries and benefits generally.
Operator: And our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt O'Connor: Can you give us an update on maybe your near and longer term ROE targets?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, sure. So we are still putting that goalpost out there that the medium term target is 10%. I think we will continue to make progress towards that in 2016 we’ve given you fairly comprehensive guidance and you can work through and see that there will be progress. The exit rate tends to be about 1% higher than the full year rate it is the earlier analysis that we had shown you, I think that still holds. So any way we’re make meaningful progress in ’16 and we’ll wait and see how 2017 plays out before we give any firmer guidance on that.
Matt O'Connor: And then just separately what’s the appetite for acquisitions as you think maybe the near-term and then if there is not interest in the near-term. What might be of interest longer term and what are you waiting for?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes sure. So I think right now we’re still a work in progress as I said. So there is plenty of opportunity for us to run the bank better and capitalize on areas where we see good revenue growth potential organically. And so that’s what we’re really focused on and I think it would be a mistake to get distracted and start running off and to do deals. So I wouldn’t see us looking harder things in 2016. I think once the bank is running better and we’ve achieved some of that potential organically then we could start to look at the possibility of some things, I think you’d likely want to dip your toe in the water gradually before you went out did anything big. So maybe some bolt ons in some of our fee based activities or maybe some little feel ins in terms of smaller banks where we think it’d fit nicely into our overall franchise. But I think that is still a ways out now.
Operator: And the next question will come from Joe Hsu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Joe Hsu: I just had a quick question related to the revenue guidance your NIM expectations for 2016 are up 6 to 12 basis points assuming two more rate hikes. Can you just talk about the revenue expectations and NII guidance if rates don’t go higher from here?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I guess what you should do is look back to Page 39 in the slide deck, because it’s laid out pretty explicitly there. And Eric I’ll turn it over to you, but I would say that we’re not that reliant on rate hikes in 2016. So when we finish the plan, we’ve had used the forward curve which had one in July and one in December. The one in December doesn’t really help ’16 it’s going to help ’17. So if the one in July happens, it’s good for us. If it doesn’t happen we have a range there that we were counting on $30 million to $40 million of benefit and that’s a manageable number, I mean that -- we’ll have to pull the levers harder on either earning asset growth or you can see right there or loan mix and yields or go back and look at expenses. And so anyway, it would be a tailwind if it happens it puts us closer to the higher end of the range and makes it easier and maybe gives us 1% of it happens I have to make up that 1% somewhere else. Eric?
Eric Aboaf: Yes. What I had is the client just envisions the continuation of what he really saw last year with regard to loan growth right on average is there any asset growth. And then the stability we saw in NIM in the second half of the year. You actually saw that pick up a couple of basis points from 2Q to 3Q another basis points from 3Q to 4Q. And so the plan is pretty straight forward, we continue to grow loans, we continue to grow average earning assets and we holding NIM flattish to up a bit as we leg into some of that mix shift as you see us doing in particular on consumer. And then what I’d say this past December hike right. The one that was just short while ago literally a month ago actually gives us 3 to 5 basis points. Why because LIBOR pulled it up commercial loans have started to re-price already and that gives us a little bit of a tailwind. So we have confident that while there is good work to do, real work to do that to continue on the kind of the pricing efforts, the mix and management efforts and the discipline that the loan growth coupled with the NIM kind of guard rails that we’re on plus a little bit of tailwind from that December hike, we should be able to continue to deliver good progress on NII growth in the coming year.
Bruce Van Saun: And you can see also Joe on the prior page we find of lay out, how we -- what our growth rates were in ’15 compared to ’14 and then what we’re assuming in the ’16 compared to ’15 and literally there is no real spreadsheets in there. I think we have demonstrated that we haven’t able to grow our earning assets as Eric said. We have in the second half of the year started to expand the NIM. And so we think, those are things that we can continue. And we had, when you strip out all noise in Chicago, we have had maybe 4% fee growth and we are thinking that we should be able to move that up pump that up to 5 to 7 given the investments that we’ve been making in the product quality and service in our commercial offerings and for example cash management and capital markets in total markets and then over in consumer the additional salesforce that we are hiring in mortgage and wealth in particular. So anyway there is no moon chops here this is just really continuing to drive the execution that we've been so good at in 2015.
Joe Hsu: And then perhaps just turning to credit quality can we just talk about the increase in the commercial non performer this quarter and then perhaps more broadly, can you just talk about what you are seeing in terms of credit quality on both the commercial and the retail side. Just starting from variable levels here but can you just talk about your expectations about reserve those off from here particularly given your strong loan growth expectations?
Bruce Van Saun: Well let me start and then I'll go first to Don to talk about commercial matter and then Eric can chime in as well but our guidance range of 375 to 425 if you consider that we were at 91 in Q4 that would annualize to roughly 365 and what happened in Q4 is that we continued with a steady level of NCOs around 31 bps and then we started to build the provision type of loan growth and earlier in the year we had back book clean up so we were effectively having credits come through to offset that need to build the reserve and so it was less pronounced earlier in the year. We think that has pretty much run its course so now what you would expect to see is very-very modest migration on the NCOs, but they need keep building the reserve because we are going to have deepened level of loan growth so that we’re calling out here so that's really what's driving that overall range we don’t see anything from not at shifting in the consumer portfolio is maybe a little higher because our risk appetite has shifted, in commercial we’re keeping our eye as we said on energy but nothing that is rattling us at this point and nothing really broadly across the portfolio is migrating so again we feel quite good about this range that we are offering, Don do you want to talk about.
Don McCree: Yes I would eco everything that Bruce said I think as I look across the entire portfolio we continue to feel very good about it and it's highly diversified we have got our eyes on oil and gas and then describe that the quite picking non formers in the fourth quarter was one real estate situation which we've had our eyes on for several years it just slipped into a nonperforming status so it is something we've been aware of it's been reserved and really has no overall impact on the credit quality of the broad book.
Bruce Van Saun: Eric, anything?
Eric Aboaf: So overall NCOs where relatively steady in the range 1.60 billion this quarter up from 1.35 billion so just up 25 million and kind of within the range of what we've seen so clearly a place for us to be watchful and careful but it is been in line with our expectations.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Scott Siefers: I think maybe just sort of a follow-up on the prior question about levers to pull if the rate outlook becomes for us I guess more flattish and I think specifically what I’d do with that is the volume is about at 540 where you have got the 1% to 1.5% efficiency or variable so I guess that Eric if you can just talk about what kind of stuff is already baked in and I imagine that's sort of top two related stuff in that 1% to 1.5% and then it should be rate outlook not 10 out of the 4 the coverage you suggested where maybe some places that you would have additional leverage on the cost side that you would be thinking about these initially?
Eric Aboaf: Yes there is always opportunity I mean just to share the big picture right we are continuing to invest in a discipline way on expenses on headcount at the frontend kind of the frontend sale and we continue to spend some on technology and you see that coming through so this past year we had that real effect of the top one program and part of the top two program coming through and that shows you on Page 40. A real sizeable efficiency pay I think as you look through next year right what we’re starting to see is that continuation of the top two savings I think we mapped that out in quite a bit of detail this past summer and there is at least a percentage point of savings that will come from that incremental to 2015 and so we have high confidence there. I think beyond that we are obviously disciplined as we go so over decide transforming the operations and working on procurement right there is always the long list of opportunities that we focus on we have done de-layering in the past but that doesn’t mean that we don’t go back and make sure that our headcount expansion is very disciplined on the frontend sale and continue to look at some of the middle office and back office personnel so well they have to do that and I think the easy part of that a down graph over and above up to is that if revenues don’t come in, in certain areas where it could be more to give for example then you are not paying out commissions so that naturally falls to the bottom-line. Beyond that, that we are going to have to work hard and find the areas to address and you could imagine we don’t put a budget like this together without having a list of 3, 4, 5, 6 items that we are already working on in contingency that we can pull if we don’t see the economic activity that we would have anticipated.
Bruce Van Saun: I would just add Scott, it's Bruce that, Top II was a little different in its composition than the first top program so we said that maybe 60% of the benefit was going to come from revenues and 40% on expenses. And so one of the reasons that we feel confident in our higher revenue outlook is that things like our checkup program and pricing initiatives and alike are giving us some momentum on the revenue comps. So you are going to see that and that’s a little bit of the difference. We do have a commitment to continue its improvement and so if there was a Top I and there was a Top II you can speculate that there might be a Top III coming down the road. But that’s the way we want to operate this place is to constantly look to make sure we are running the bank better and that we are maximizing the utility at every expense and investment dollar that we have. And the last thing I would say is that if the rate hikes don’t happen it's not just an expense lever that we would look to as I said in the answer to Joe. There is also the other things back on Page 39 in terms of can we drive a little more asset growth, can we focus a little more on the mix to try to get the yield up. So I think there is some embedded offset potentially raising NII to compensate to that but yes you are right. Expenses were clearly at the stock market is saying -- what they are saying we don’t know it's not always a great leading indicator but if revenue growth was a little hard to come by, we have certainly have to go back and look at your expenses again.
Operator: And next question will come from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Kevin Barker: Within your guidance you have 6% to 8% loan growth next year, could you speak to the drivers of that loan growth between whether it's portfolio of purchases or organic growth? And then what mix of assets do you expect to drive most in that growth?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes sure, I’ll start but in 2015 I think we were roughly 80% own originated and maybe 20% or so was purchased and that’s really on the consumer side. And it started out being more purchase of auto and as we have ramped up our own capabilities in prime auto origination we have scaled back the auto purchases. We still like the student space and we struck a relationship with SoFi and so we now are purchasing some student loans and fewer auto loans. So I would expect to broadly see that and overtime we will be just be opportunistic on purchases and as we keep putting offense and putting more originators out there we may be able to fully lit our appetite on own originations. But for now we think we are getting some very high quality assets that really fit the profile of what we can do on our own and augment the growth rate a little bit. So maybe I could -- and I’d say the other thing is that we are pretty balanced in terms of the growth coming between consumer and commercial you can see that in Q4, there is good balance between the opportunities in commercial and consumer. So we are growing on both sides but maybe I will flip it to Brad and then Don just to quickly offer where they see the opportunities in the aspect of booked.
Brad Conner: Yes Bruce I mean I think you did a very nice job of letting it out. I think one of the areas that we have seen a lot of growth in 2015 has been the student OEM and we are still very optimistic about that there is good momentum assuming and I think that will be a driver of organic growth for us. You talked about it we had slowed down the purchase of this skews to offset but that’s really more of a maintenance mode as opposed to growing but we like the relationship with SoFi which will supplement the loan growth in student. We expect to see some continued growth in mortgage. We have actually been in position where our home equity portfolio has been going down a little bit of time in 2015. But we are reaching that point now not abstaining meet back into the growth mode, so we have a very-very strong application and closing quarter in the fourth quarter in home equity and we will probably see. It would be modest I think you can probably see some growth in home equity. But the nice thing about build asset classes that we are talking about during your growth is you are contributing to our improving yield to non-proving margins.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, exactly and not to mention the afterlife back end which has very attractive merging.
Brad Conner: Exactly.
Bruce Van Saun: Don?
Don McCree: And on the commercial side, we were very pleased with what we saw last year. Our growth areas which were real estate, industry verticals, mid-corporate and franchise finance, so we saw solid double-digit growth in all of those verticals while also keeping a good pricing discipline and a good credit discipline which I think is the balancing access we will continue to focus on in 2016. And in '16 we expect to see some more growth in the middle market, we did quite a lot of hiring across our middle market since last year and it's taking a little while for those new bankers to begin to ramp and begin to get traction, so we expect to continue to see good growth what we saw in '15 and get a little bit of incremental growth out of our mid market channel. So overall we're expecting to grow slightly lower than 10% in terms of loan and interest growth. And the other thing we think we will see in '16 is even more acceleration in the fee lines as we begin to take advantage of some of the investments that we've made around capital markets and treasury services in particular.
Bruce Van Saun: Great. Eric, anything to add?
Eric Aboaf: No, that's a wrap.
Kevin Barker: You mentioned the Apple program driving some growth. Could you speak to you where you expect that to go, over the next couple of quarters given that you had $220 million on your balance sheet as of the fourth quarter and then what your expectations are for a mix of yield compared to your other portfolio off of that programming?
Brad Conner: Yes this is Brad, as and may be Eric had mentioned in his comments we ended the year at $220 million in balances and we would expect we continue to see that to grow. I would tell you it's a little hard to pin down exactly where we see it going for a couple of reasons. We're actually somewhat limited in the scope of that initiative to-date in that it's available only in the Apple store and it's only available for the current model. So there will be a few drivers that dictate where that program goes, do you expand that beyond just the Apple store, do you later launch new product do you extend the program beyond just the current model following and so forth. So I guess the way I would sum that up is we would certainly expect to see volume in one quarter in a row we're one quarter in and we generated $220 million so you're certainly going to see growth. There is some questions to how fast that growth will be given some of those parameters. We're very pleased with the program we think we provided a very good customer experience. Can't speak for Apple but I think they would say the same. They're very pleased with how the program is going so far. So we’re optimistic it is a nice program and there are nice assets for us in terms of yield and more jobs, so very attractive return for us.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. To summarize that I think the wildcards are when do they open the online offering, beyond just the stores, which we’re working through with them and then when do they launch their new phones which you'd have to ask them not us. Those are the things that could really spur an uptick. And then the thing we like about this too is these loans generally have a relatively high yield and so not too dissimilar from credit card balances, and they don’t have the same acquisition costs to us as credit card balances and growing a credit card book so, it's a relatively efficient way for us to increase a nice higher yielding asset class.
Operator: And your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore, please go ahead.
John Pancari: I wanted to just dig in a little bit more into the commercial real estate portfolio you put up some pretty good growth in the fourth quarter. Wanted to see if you can give us little bit, around your thoughts on your ability to continue to grow that I know that's still a notably undersized portfolio for you at Citizens and also I know the spreads in that business are getting incredibly thin, so where do you see the opportunities within commercial real estate to grow?
Bruce Van Saun: I'll have Don answer that one.
Don McCree: So you know we've had a portfolio historically which has been largely the REIT portfolio which has generally been lower margin than our overall real estate book right now. A couple of years ago we began to move into the construction lending business which is higher margin, so we have seen our margins in real estate on a blended basis go up and we expect to continue to see that. As I think Eric mentioned we took down a lot of business over the last two or three years with very targeted sponsors and very targeted NSAs on the construction side and we’ve only just started to fund a lot of that. So there's some embedded growth in the book that we expect to see just as private mature and we begin to fund up commitments that we've made already. We think we can grow the construction businesses at between a little over 10% as we move into 2016 we're seeing you know good flows. I expect the weak business to stay roughly flattish and that's the lower margin business so I think you'll see blended growth of slightly under 10% and margin uptick as we roll through '16. And I think as you mentioned margin, we are cognizant of where we might be in the real estate cycle it’s been a very-very strong market for the last several years. We're not saying that in positive dynamics are changing we don’t really see the terms changing but we're keeping an eye on that as we go into '16 and we will be disciplined based on what we see the marketplace doing.
John Pancari: Okay, that's helpful. And I guess on that same general point can you help us with the and give us the average new loan yield that you're seeing on new production in some of your main portfolios including commercial real estate but as well as in your other loan portfolios in commercial and consumer?
Eric Aboaf: Yes. Let me give you that kind of directionally, but it’s -- the loans yields on new production actually move around quite a bit quarter-by-quarter so let me just kind of give you some directional information. If you think about some of the core portfolios that we have, I think we have said previously and I’ll reemphasize that as we’ve grown in industry verticals middle market and franchise finance. We tend to put yields on that are higher than the portfolio to the tune of 30 to 40 basis points it moved around quite a bit by quarter, but you get good benefit there that are actually average of your yields. And that has been part of the reason why we’ve been able to hold yields steady in commercial. You also get a bit of an uptick in asset finance that is where it is kind of 10 basis points over the average portfolio. And then the areas where you get a little less commercial real estate, you get a little less 10 basis points, but I think we for the right risks of term, we feel like there is good economics there. And something like in the corporate, which we’ve not emphasized as much, because it tends to be higher grade clients you get it to narrative of 30 to 40 basis points in your mortgage originations, but more of a cross sell and bigger wallet into the cross sell. So there is kind of a mix of facts and that’s in a way the texture that we used as the management team we got where do we want to emphasize, how much we want invest in these different areas. Don mentioned some of the hiring in middle market quite an obvious place for us to hire and to continue strengthen because of that 30 to 40 basis point lift that we get and across all that comes with that whether it is deposits or cash management. And that’s kind of part of the, I guess the tool set and the specificity at which we’re carefully driving growth, margin and getting the NIM to where we like it to be.
Bruce Van Saun: And Brad just on the consumer side, the kind of rough gross yields, roughly 5% on student kind of run though for the kind of a couple of those relationships?
Brad Conner: Yes, you bet. So we’re about a 50-50 mix on student between fixed and variable and our variable yields on student would be somewhere in the 4 to 5 range, of course it’s first day price on fixed size would be somewhere in 6 to 8 range it is a little higher on initial program as opposed to the refi program because that’s a little bit higher quality asset. So more like 605 more like 8 on the initial program, so that’s what should lead to those yield improvement for us as we grow the student business, really being the mid-30s in auto. And it’s a variable rate product obviously that you thought would be in the low-30s.
Operator: We’ll go to line of Vivek Junenja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Vivek Junenja: Number one, just couple of shorter term, and near-term ones, the terms under consumer agreement on auto loans are you still buying loans for them and just reduce shopping and we have better stand? Any color on that?
Bruce Van Saun: I’ll start and Brad if you want to call out. But we’re buying at a rate of around 750 would be our target for 2016. And that deal runs a little bit into the first half of 2017. So that’s what we’re at.
Brad Conner: Yes I think that’s right we did 200 million of purchases in the fourth quarter which was down from the third quarter again probably didn’t arrange that well, deal a very good one.
Vivek Junenja: And certainly with the near-term, does deposit cost given the December rate hikes, have you seen any change in the rates that you are seeing from your competitors or your year-end flow?
Eric Aboaf: Yes, Vivek, it’s Eric. Let me take that. As expected, right the first hike has not result in a lot of movement in rate. So that was the speculation everyone had which is the Fed moved and there is a call for a big shift. So let me kind of decompose for you, on the retail side there has literally been no movement. They have actually been up to down fixed in a few geographies and obviously we look at everything, we look at every geography, every city, we are looking at the online players and we’re looking at the community banks. And it’s actually been very-very quite there. And so that gives us some confidence, that the betas that we’ve been talking about are sound and as you recall the betas are kind of over the cycle betas. So the data on retail is going to be quite low for the first rate hike for a couple of quarters. So that I think bodes well for us. On the commercial side, there is always the job volume, because commercial clients have done a lot out there their loans re-pricing a LIBOR and some of them comeback on deposits and obviously that’s the business we’re in, I think there wasn’t much change in December with what you saw a little bit in January. And I think as you see the months stay through February and March, we’ll have some amount of uptick and so it could be a little bit, but you’re talking a handful of basis points on that side. And so as you look at it, we actually have some confidence we’ll deliver good, deposit pricing in the first quarter, today it is some nice corresponding uptick on loan yield, because those on the commercial side [Multiple Speakers] and that's a big driver for the 5 basis point higher NIM guidance in the first quarter.
Vivek Junenja: Okay, great and perfect. I have a longer question looking at your guidance. Your noninterest income guidance I want you to clarify the rates that you have given that 5% to 7% rate does it just based on reported noninterest income, which include securities gains and secondly very strong quarter on the net interest income and the fourth quarter given that on the 5% to 7% growth are you assuming still soft capital markets, is that's what's keeping it low. Could you talk or give a little more color on that on those two?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Look I first off in the phase I think there is an element of securities gains, which I think will continue, so I think we will from time-to-time be making repositioning decisions in the portfolio and as we kind of cross up $5 million or $10 million here and there that's I think ongoing income, so as you would expect to see, so yes so the noninterest end guidance covers the whole category. When you strip out some of those like one timers like the impact of Chicago, we think we grew about 4% last year and the 5% to 7% growth guidance is really where you get the uptick, I think if you would look for the uptick with the rebound in capital markets hopefully that market stabilizes, and the leverage credit markets and that won't be a drag away like it was in Q4 and were building at our product capability, so as we've moved away from RBS, we've had to add our own capabilities and we were sharing some of those dollars with RBS and that was dollars 400% to us when we get our broker dealer stead off and when we move off on to our own FX and derivatives platform there is additional revenue opportunities that come from that. We've invested in the cash management business and are doing a better job across selling, we've gone out and hired more sales resources to get better penetration, as our whole product is set, so we some good upside on the commercial side, and similarly on consumer, if we can get the mortgage business going in the let's say we took a little pause here in the fourth quarter, as we had to move and be focused on our system and the rest curtailer compliance I think that goes well and will provide some lift and then well we are very under penetrated as well and I think we had a great recruiting quarter in Q4, we've got in 12 FCs best quarter we've had in the long-long time coincidently or not we have had a new competitive well, we have high hopes for so in both mortgage and loans we have new leadership and I think both have hit the ground running. So I think it's a bit across the board and yes you are right it's the great if we could exceed 5 to 7 but I think fees in general in the industry have been a little sluggish in the environment and so I think we're just being measured and hopefully that's a range that we can step up from 4 and get into that 5 to 7, Eric do you want to add anything.
Eric Aboaf: And I’d just add that the anchor on fees is the first one right sort of charges and fees which is cash management as well as certain charge on deposits overdraft and cart fees and so forth so it is the core of what we do that sort of start in key line is over 40% of our total fees that was up 2% for the year, but up 8% year-over-year this quarter why because some of those fees or increases that we've talked about as product cost to our time of place really and so I think we have some confidence that that can an anchor the fee growth of 5% to 7% and then given that that 40% of the fee line and then some of the other areas that we've covered, I think all the areas where we’re really driving hard on and will update as we go during the year.
Operator: And our next question will come from David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Eads: On the last point on the service fees, can you just talk obviously a pretty good progress there, can you talk about how much of that was related to commercial fees versus retail and then maybe kind of what you think you are and how much more opportunities there is from the re-pricing and reselling of the contracts on the commercial deposit side?
Eric Aboaf: Yes. Let me start there and there is some textures that I'd like to weight in. I think the way to look at that is that there is probably order management around the 5 million to 6 million of increase so we saw there from the fee re-pricing and the cash management and that covers that's nice on the commercial stock, as well as some of what we do in cash management on the consumer side. Followed by just some a little bit of uptick in seasonality that will get in 4Q, so that's the kind of the anchor point that caused a $6 million drop. Now that wasn’t there in the first three quarters of this year but should grow through consistently for four quarters next year and that's the basis, gives it a little more in that fee increase that caused to $5 million to $6 million just trying a little more but I think we've seen the both of this and now we are coming back at parity levels of fees right we are not planning to fee we’re just trying to catch up for not having re-pricing four or five years and we feel like we’re at a good point with our clients and with the value that we offer.
Don McCree: And Eric the only thing I would add, it's Don, is we’ve seen with some of the sales hires that we made, particularly on the transaction banking side, good momentum and actually incremental business away from price increases. The challenge there is, its long lead-times in terms of clients are moving their business from one bank to another due to technology. And then it's a question of rate of ramp of actual utilization. So I’d say our momentum on winning business is ahead of the revenue progression. And that will be incremental for 2016 to just I am sure as to exactly the speed of it.
Bruce Van Saun: And so I think commercial is a real opportunities because we have said we are under penetrated in terms of the products set in extent of cross-sell that we have. Brad in Europe we’re trying to grow household. And so that’s going to create a little bit of tailwind. And then also better penetration in business liking, I guess would be the other area.
Eric Aboaf: And we will get some of the benefit of the price increases in business plans as well. And we’re driving some of it to improve cash flow, which is up about 2%.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes.
David Eads: Great, thanks for all that color. And then maybe Eric if you could touch a little bit more into deposit environment. What's in the efforts you guys have done and where you think the opportunities are to grow deposits, also within eye to keeping pricing as flat as possible?
Eric Aboaf: Yes, let me describe deposits at these rates, because there is working on the retail side, working on the commercial side, and there is in-depth in each one. I think in retail -- let me actually do the top of the half. I think we’ve actually had a focus on increasing over the last couple of months and quarters waiting with non-price driven offer. And really focusing on that core DDA and what we call checking of interest, which is really checking on the low amount of interest. And we have been doing that on the commercial side, on the consumer side, for the cash management product, which is the low EPR. And that’s actually been growing nicely. If you actually look at this take for DDA and checking with inventory from the balance sheet, those are up 2% quarter-on-quarter, 6% year-on -year. And you can actually go back and you can see DDAs and after the last three quarters in a row, certainly with interest, the last four quarters in a row. So we are seeing the engagement with clients that are non-price driven way that we’d like. Now, we need to keep doing that and that need to be an ongoing focus. And part of what you heard about the tax management investments, it's functionality, part of what we continue to on consumers will allow revise and improve value propositions to really draw clients. And that’s what I would call the heart of what we do on deposits. I think that the other part of deposit question, so there is always a little bit of slight forward again in deposits out there. And we like any bank take those logs, because they are from our clients, and our clients are only funding with us. The issue is how you do that in a disciplined way. And so in commercial with Don arriving, we have gone back to some of the large pools of deposit that we put on close to Chicago divestiture a year ago. Those were specialty promotional deposits. And back in September after the Fed didn’t go, I remember in September the Fed didn’t, that’s the national construct and the trade goes off of those old promotional rates. And then obviously, we managed to a little bit of attrition, but then we reset and can grow-off a comfortable level. And that’s what we’ve really done in commercial. And then emphasize the work, the step works needs to do on our cost out basis in that segment goes in a mirrored away that prior too long to describe here. On the retail side, we do something similar. We’re quite disciplined, region-by-region. And the Brad’s team where they are thinking about where there are opportunities to continue what was on money market. But you’re going see we pull back on CDs much like those the less of the industry does, and has been doing. And I think that’s been fruitful. So all told I think the real nice performance across the front on interest bearing deposits down a bit, which is great to see we’d obviously will keep pushing on that front.
Bruce Van Saun: Brad, do you want to add some color.
Brad Conner: Just one point I was going to add, which is I think one of the biggest opportunities we have on the consumer side is in real estate. So, we talk a lot about our investment in growing that, growing our fee business, which it will. And if you look other opportunities on the deposit side, probably [missed] opportunities, penetration of low interest or non-interest bearing deposits with our wealth customers. And we are working on a new value proposition and new deposit checking product for our wealth customers that will be growing out maybe and we think that’s a very good opportunity for us.
David Eads: Just out of curiosity, do you have means for wealth management deposits at this point or is that a new opportunity?
Eric Aboaf: I would say, we do have obviously, we have wealth deposits. So I would say yes our peers were under penetrated and there is an opportunity that we can capitalize on.
Operator: And our next question in queue will come from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Erika Najarian: Just one follow-up question, I understand that we don’t have the CCAR parameters yet. But given where your stock is trading relative to tangible book, Bruce, what is your appetite in terms of maximizing your ask relative to what you think your earnings power is going to be over the next year or two?
Bruce Van Saun: So, we’ll go through the process. And I think our guidance of an 11.2 to 11.5 says that we're still going to be, I’d say, moderate in our appetite as opposed to all out aggressive. And part of that reason is having a capital surplus that we’re using to fund loan growth that was not our ROE today is not high enough to fund that level of loan growth. I want to make sure that we're taking full advantage of the opportunity to add customers and grow the franchise. And it's good to have a little bit of cushion there in the overall capital ratio and that helps feed the ROE, it’s kind of a circle. So we’ll get our ROE up then we don't need as much of a surplus. So I would say over-time we're clearly looking to get back to the pack. And so if our peers are running at 10 or 10.5, there's no reason we shouldn't run where the peers are running. Once we're fully operating, the way we want to operate in our returns or where we want them to be, it is, I think we do look at the opportunity to buyback the stock and where it's trading. And it is attractive here, we think. And so that will be factored into our thinking. But I just wanted to give you the guardrails were coming down on a gradual glide path, and it's somewhat also dictated by how fast we can get the ROE up, and generate more capital and then we don't need that cushion.
Erika Najarian: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go to the line of David Durst with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
David Durst: Good morning. I think you've covered everything. But just what would be some of the areas of concern that you could have this year, and where you had pull-back here and leads you to low end of your loan growth guidance.
Bruce Van Saun: I guess at this point, we don’t see, I think good demand in housing, there'll be a little less refi than last year, but the purchase market seems pretty firm. Auto seems to be doing very strong and there's certainly a need for student debt refinancing. So, I think the drivers on the consumer side look pretty solid to us. And the one wildcard I guess is what happens with Apple iPhone upgrade, we could get a wildcard there. But hopefully is a positive surprise because I think we're being moderate in terms of how we're looking at that. And then on the commercial side, really, there'd be more cyclicality would be the concern, it's just stock market is presaging concern over a slowdown and therefore corporate CEOs and CFOs decide to pull back a little bit on investing, or on line utilization, and that could have an impact. But maybe, Don, you want to add a little…
Don McCree: I think that's right. I think for me the loan growth is, it’s all about the economy. And we still continue to think the U.S. economy looks pretty good, jobs looks good. So are anticipating a decent year in terms of growth. And I think it really comes down to loan demand based on commodity levels and economic activity. So, I don't think that there'd be any other variable that would cause us to say we would pull back.
Bruce Van Saun: I think the one thing, if you look at that NII walk, obviously, we don’t know if the two rate hikes happened, and it's not a huge impact. I feel quite good about our ability to deliver the earning assets growth unless somehow the economy really falls out of that. But so far, it doesn’t, that's not our view. We don't think that's going to happen. So, that column feels very solid. The thing that's been our challenge and we've spent a lot of time on this call talking about it is how can we make sure that we’re improving our asset yields and then growing deposit costs effectively. And I think it took us a little while to really establish a rhythm on that. But the good news is if you look at the second half for the last year, in 2015, we actually moved them up by 5 basis points. So, I think we're doing a better job at that, some of that I’ll see it, because the credits of the guy on my right here Eric who’re really driving that and spearheading that. But that's the thing that we really have to focus on. We can’t have any leakage. So, last year, if we grew loans to 7 and we grew NII at 4, we have to, if we grow loans at 7, I want to grow NII at 7 plus. And if we can do that, I think that's really powerful in terms of the operating leverage that will deliver.
David Durst: Great, okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next call will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Matt Burnell: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, just a couple of very quick follow-ups. You've mentioned your exposure to energy or at least specific to the higher risk areas of energy. I just want to confirm as you said in the past the total energy portfolio remains below 1% of your loan book.
Bruce Van Saun: The total energy portfolio, I think, it's about $1.6 billion in terms of outstanding. So it’s below 2%.
Matt Burnell: And then just following-up on the last set of questions, you mentioned that corporate confidence is really the big risk in your outlook for commercial lending. But it also sounds as if you've not heard that from your conversations with your borrowers, at this point. So that the downturn in the markets over the past couple of weeks really hasn't filtered through to your borrowers’ sense of confidence, at this point, correct.
Eric Aboaf: I think that's correct, obviously anybody who’s depending upon the high yield market or the institutional loan market is on the guidelines right now, because they’re effectively close. One of the things we have heard and we just published our Fifth Annual M&A survey for mid-market companies is an expectation across our client base that M&A activity could be quite interesting in this year and the next year, just as people struggle a little bit with top-line growth and look to supplement their businesses. So, there is a desire to grow and a desire to transact out there. So, we’re hearing a solid message of expansion among our clients. And that impact needed to be through combination or it could be through organic growth.
Matt Burnell: And just combining those two questions, how much of the capital markets revenue activity is energy related? I guess the question is, is there a potential for further headwind in the capital markets business coming from $25 or rather than what it averaged over 2015?
Eric Aboaf: We have very-very little in our historical pipeline around energy; most of our energy activity is in regular label lending, asset-based lending, and the like.
Matt Burnell: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: And our next question will come from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Geoffrey Elliott: Maybe one, it makes for Don to say. When you getting through commercial credit cycles in the past, what are the early indicators that you’ve seen which is started through flash back before you grow the portfolios start to deteriorate? And how are those performing this time around?
Don McCree: So I think the right answer that is, we go through, in my past and certainly now, we go through rigorous review of our portfolios on a continuous basis with our portfolio management teams. And relate those credit based on financial performance, covenant compliance, and a whole verity of different things. And we obviously did that through’15 and that’s been very modest deterioration in credit grades. So, that’s usually early signal that you start to see people missing covenants and people having financial deterioration. The other thing in my past has been what really tends to per institutions is concentration. And we do have a very rigorous concentration management system. I think one of the interesting things that I see at Citizens is just core diversification in the portfolio given that it's a mid-market lending activity predominantly is very-very great, both on a geographic basis, on an industry basis, on an individual credit basis. So, I think there is a little bit of a hedge in the overall portfolio also. So, we would look for credit deterioration in the terms of credit grades, we would look at any concentrations in industries that are troubled as things that we would flash really to us, so we’re not seeing them to any extent at this moment.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Brad, I think given the time here, we probably have time for one more question.
Operator: Okay. We’ll go to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Ken Usdin: Just two quick ones, first of all, on the expense guide for the year. Does the growth contemplate this assessment? And if it does, can you just help us understand how much that is as a part of it?
Bruce Van Saun: On what assessment, I’m sorry Ken.
Ken Usdin: The deposit issuance assessment…
Bruce Van Saun: We have a base care in our forecast. And we haven’t, I don’t think it settled out yet as to what the amount the big banks will pay and the timing on that. So, yes, we are working off the base case.
Ken Usdin: So it’s in the base case, so you have it in your expense outlook?
Bruce Van Saun: We’re operating on a continuum of where we’ve been historically without an increase at this point, because it’s not certain the timing and the amount of that increase.
Ken Usdin: So if you were to get formalize, you would then have to add that to your forecast?
Bruce Van Saun: That’s correct.
Ken Usdin: Second question, Eric you’ve done some good work with restructuring some of the long-term debt. And I just wanted to ask you what opportunities do you continue to have there? And also in the original debt for stock swap, preferred for stock swap, what are your plans this year as you look ahead to that original 250? So in aggregate, what opportunities you still have to lower the wholesale funding cost side?
Eric Aboaf: I think on wholesale funding, we’ve done some substitute adjustments actually over the last year and half two years really when it comes to swap portfolio that I think what you’ve seen in the announcement was sub-debt repurchase, which is anticipated in this summer, obviously allocated on the CCAR ask, the $500 million of the old RBS on sub-debt would be retire. And that one would obviously help with our funding costs. And then I think that is actually the rest of the program. Obviously need to right into a little bit of senior debt where we finished with mix of fix and flowed and three year and five year. But that would be modest in size. And then I think the last part of that place and which is really one out of our treasury area is how do you continue to position the first carefully around rates and take advantage when rates pop-up a little bit, and manage around the curve and we’ll keep doing that.
Bruce Van Saun: So Ken I’d say the thing that presents an opportunity if you have this right to repurchase 500 of RBS and stop that. And depending on where rates are at the time, as we can refinance that with senior, which still be a spread differential to stop that versus the senior. And if we can choose it down, the amount of it that we have in the stacks. So obviously there is a full coupon saving on that. So we are working on that. We’re studying that we have to consider that in our CCAR request. But there is I think some potential upside there relative to our outlook and our guidance.
Ken Usdin: Okay, so that's not contemplated in your guidance either. Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator: Please go ahead sir.
Bruce Van Saun: Thank you all for dialing in today and for participating in the call. And we feel that we finished the year strong, and we feel we’re well positioned as we look out into 2016. So, thank you and have a good day.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude our conference for the day. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-10-23 10:00:00) =====

Additionally, any information about any non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP, may be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement that are available on our website And with that, I'll hand it over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thanks, Ellen, and good morning. It's a pleasure to have the chance to review our earnings release today. In addition to being joined by Eric, Brad, and Ellen on the call, as usual, I would like to extend a warm welcome to Don McCree, who is now heading our commercial business. I'd also like to publicly thank Steve Woods and Bob Rubino for the terrific job that they did in leading the commercial business on an interim basis. So let me offer a few comments on the quarter before I hand it over to Eric to take you through some of the financial details. We're very pleased with our continued ability to drive positive operating leverage in a challenging environment. We're executing well on our strategic initiatives. We're delivering good loan and deposit growth, while investing in our fee-based businesses. We continue to find efficiencies in our cost base that allow us to self fund investments that we're making growth, in technology, and in risk and compliance. Positive operating leverage was 4% revenue growth over 1% expense growth for 3% on a year-over-year basis. It was 1% over zero expense growth for 1% on a sequential quarter basis. This is driving our efficiency ratio and our profitability improvement. We also are pleased with the efforts to arrest the NIM decline, quote unquote, as we grew our NIM by 4 basis points in Q3. We're focused on boosting asset yield through mix, risk appetite, and pricing adjustments, and on halting the growth in the cost of our deposit growth. Eric has been very intensely focused on this with our business heads and we're making good traction on that front. A few other items to note. First off, our top two initiatives are on track. Second, our asset sensitivity continues to be stable with the second quarter. As we know, the Fed will eventually move rates, and in the meantime, we have profitability levers to pull. And thirdly, our balance sheet metrics all remain strong across capital, liquidity, funding, and credit. A real highlight for us in the quarter is that we continue to attract great talent into leadership positions at the company. Besides Don, we've brought in new heads of wealth, mortgage and retail distribution over the past several weeks and we've added a distinguished Fed alumnus to our Board. This is an important byproduct of our separation from RBS and our journey to independence. So with that, let me turn it over to Eric.
Eric Aboaf: Thank you, Bruce. And good morning, everyone. Overall, I feel good about the progress we are making in delivering our growth and efficiency initiatives. We are actively managing the balance sheet to deliver attractively priced loan and deposit growth, and we continue to demonstrate strong expense discipline in the face with challenging industry landscape. In my comments today, I'll refer to our third quarter earnings presentation, which you can find at citizensbank.com. Let's start on page 3, with our third quarter financials. On a reported basis, we generated GAAP net income of $220 million, which was up $30 million, or 16%, from the second quarter, and up $31 million, or 16%, from the third quarter 2014. Diluted earnings per share were $0.40, up $0.05 from the second quarter and up $0.06 from third quarter 2014. Linked-quarter results reflect revenue growth and lower non-interest expense, driven by a $40 million decrease in restructuring charges and special items. We also recorded $7 million in preferred dividends this quarter associated with our $250 million March issuance. Those dividends are accrued on a semi-annual basis. So we won't record a dividend again until the first quarter. In the second quarter, we recorded the final restructuring charges and special items associated with our efficiency initiatives, separation from RBS, and Chicago divestiture. And page 4 outlines these items. For the remainder of the slides, I'll cover our reported results in this quarter compared with prior period adjusted results to highlight our core trend. Turning to page 5, we posted solid operating results with net income of $220 million and EPS of $0.40. Net income increased $5 million, or 2% linked quarter, as the benefit of revenue growth and lower expense was partially offset by a higher tax rate. Relative to the year ago quarter, net income was up 9% and EPS was up 11%, reflecting 4% revenue growth and relatively stable expenses. These results are a nice clean quarter, with little in the way of noise, no restructuring charges, and no unusual items. We had a slight up tick in other income, offset by a slightly higher tax rate, but the P&L reflects our fundamentals. We continue to generate positive operating leverage on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis. We grew revenue by 1% linked quarter on good growth and net interest income. And on a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue 4% with traction in both net interest and non-interest income, as we made progress on our growth initiatives. We continue to focus on managing costs, and this quarter, we held expenses flat as we build efficiency improvement, while also reinvesting in the business. We continue to make measurable underlying progress against our goals of enhancing our efficiency. These efforts resulted in a 66% efficiency ratio in the quarter, down nearly a point from the second quarter and 2 points lower than prior year. Credit costs also remained credit relatively stable on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis. Our return on tangible common equity remained relatively stable at 6.6%, up slightly over last year, as we paid our first semi-annual preferred dividend and had a slightly higher tax rate. Our tangible book value per share grew 2% to $24.52. On slide 6, let's take a closer look at net interest income, which grew $16 million, or 2% linked quarter, driven by good loan growth, an additional day in the quarter, and a 4 basis point increase from the net interest margin. Compared to the third quarter of 2014, net interest income grew $36 million, or 4% over the prior year, driven by an 8% in loan growth, partially offset by a slight decrease in the net interest margin due to continued pressure from the low rat environment. Over the past 12 months, we grew earning assets by 5%, or $5.8 billion, reflecting good momentum in both commercial and consumer, as we continue to deleverage our enhanced lending platform, technology, product set, and strong capital position to serve our clients. As you know, on page 7, we are really keenly focused on defending the margin in this extended low rate environment. In this quarter, we took additional steps to further enhance the efficiency of our balance sheet. We reduced the size of our cash and short term investment portfolio, along with the associated collateralized borrowing that funded this position. This was worth 3 basis points. We also have been focused on fine tuning the mix of our loan portfolio and ensuring that we are gathering deposits in a more cost-effective manner. Consumer loan yields were up as we continued to grow attractive opportunities in student and auto. Underlying commercial yields picked up slightly. We remain highly focused on driving originations and select products that exhibit wider margins and stronger returns such as middle market and industry verticals. We did see slightly higher deposit costs, given the impact of some second quarter promotional pricing. That said, we are encouraged that we been able to slow the up tick in cost through a better product mix, target marketing, and sharper pricing discipline. We are continuing to maintain our asset sensitivity. We are at 7.1%, assuming a 200 basis point gradual rise in rates off the 12 month forward curve compared with last quarter at approximately 7.2%. This sensitivity is concentrated at the short end of the current [ph] and the first 50 point move would generate significant benefit over a flat rate scenario. On slide 8, non-interest income decreased $7 million linked quarter, as we saw good results in both capital markets and mortgage banking. In third quarter, we experienced an MSR valuation swing of $8 million and capital market fees declined in line with the overall market trends. These declines were partially offset by growth in other income and service charges and fees, while card fees, trust and investment sales, and FX fees were all stable linked quarter. The growth in other income included the impact of an $8 million gain that we recorded on the sale of two branch properties. The remainder of the growth in other merely reflects what normal puts and takes across the number of lines in this category. We also saw a $7 million decrease in securities gains this quarter compared to last quarter. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest income increased $12 million as the benefit of higher other income, card, and trust and investment service fees was offset by decreases in mortgage banking fees, FX, and capital market fees. Moving on to non-interest expense on slide 9. Given the prolonged low rate environment, it’s particularly important that we do a good job on expenses. We remain committed to our goal of generating strong operating leverage by actively managing our expense base, while continuing to invest across the franchise to both enhance our products and distribution capabilities. Third quarter expenses came in at $798 million, down slightly compared to the second quarter, reflecting lower costs across several categories. Year-over-year adjusted expense increased $9 million, or 1%, as lower salaries and benefits and amortization of software was more than offset by an increase in other expense, depreciation, and outside services. Headcount decreased modestly during the quarter and remained relatively flat compared to the third quarter 2014, even though we added roughly 430 salespeople across our consumer and commercial growth initiatives. As I mentioned earlier, we achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of 66%, which was down nearly 1 point from the second quarter and down 4 points from the prior year quarter, given the benefit a positive operating leverage. We continue to stay focused on delivering our growth and efficiency initiatives, including the Top II programs to continue this favorable trend, while it's in its early days, Top II is on track. Now turning to the consolidated average balance sheet on slide 10, because of the balance sheet repositioning that I mentioned earlier, our total earning assets of $123 billion were relatively stable with last quarter, as growth in commercial and retail loans was offset by a decrease in short-term investments. Consumer loan growth reflected continued momentum in student, mortgage and auto loans, which was partially offset by a continued decline in home equity balances and the rundown of the non-core portfolio. Commercial growth was driven by commercial real estate, franchise finance, and corporate finance. As I mentioned, we continue to refine our strategies to grow deposits any more cost effective way, and here we also continue to gain traction. Average deposits in the third quarter increased $2.5 billion, or 2%, over the second quarter and were up $9.3 billion, or 10%, over the third quarter 2014. On slide 11, consumer banking loans increased $863 million, or 2%, sequentially, driven by growth in student, mortgage and auto. Consumer loan yields increased 1 basis point, reflecting continued improvement in mix, as we focus on attractive opportunities in student and our own auto origination. On slide 12, commercial loans increased $524 million, or 1%, linked quarter, driven by growth in commercial real estate, franchise finance, and corporate finance. We're being thoughtful about how we claim commercial, given strong competition and our effort to improve risk adjusted returns and yields, and our results also reflects some normal seasonality. Slide 13 focuses on the liability side of the balance sheet and our funding costs. Average interest-bearing deposits grew $2.1 billion, or 3%, linked quarter, with particular strength in money market. We were also making progress in growing DDA accounts. While our deposit costs crept up again this quarter, the pace of growth slowed, as we began refining our retail promotional rate offerings to be more targeted than in the first few quarters following last year's Chicago divestiture. We also carefully - we calibrated some above market commercial deposit pricing. Compared to a year ago, average interest-bearing deposits increased $8.4 billion or 13%. On slide 14, we've laid out the key initiatives that support the balance sheet and fee growth in our turnaround plan, as well as our incremental top two initiatives and assessed progress during the quarter. We are continuing to lay strong foundations and gain momentum across most of these initiatives and our intensely addressing some of the challenges in mortgage and wealth. In asset finance, we need to shift our origination strategy, given RBS's retrenchment in the US, as they had been an important source of flow. On slide 15, I'll hit the highlights on credit quality, which remained benign, with net charge-offs at $75 million and provision of $76 million. Asset quality remains very, very good. Our NPLs were down $16 million, or 2% in aggregate in the quarter. Our allowance to loans remain relatively stable at 123 basis points, while our allowance to NPL ratio improved from 114% to 116%. We do not see any meaningful issues in our relatively modest sized energy portfolio. Turning to slide 16, our capital position remains robust. This quarter's CET 1 ratio was 11.8%, which was well above our peers. We're above our LCR requirement and our LDR has been relatively consistent. In August, we executed a $250 million subordinated debt issuance and repurchased shares from RBS, which on a pro-forma basis impacted our CET 1 ratio by 22 basis points, but had no impact on our total capital ratio. Turning to slide 17, let me summarize some of what you can expect next quarter, but all in the context of the full year 2015 outlook that we've previously provided and that we broadly reaffirm today. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, we expect to produce linked quarter loan growth of roughly 1.5%, broadly consistent with recent quarterly level. We also expect net interest margin to remain stable with Q3. We will continue to focus on improving asset yields and better managing the cost of deposits. We expect modest expense growth in Q4 due to technology projects coming on the stream, as well as seasonal factors. We would expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage, thereby improving our efficiency ratio, profitability and returns. We expect underlying credit metrics to remain strong and favorable, but we would expect the provision to build in Q4. Finally, we expect that our CET 1ratio will remain relatively unchanged from the Q3 11.8% and we will manage the LDR to around 97% to 98%. With that, let me turn it back over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks, Eric. And I guess, in summary, we feel pleased with our performance this quarter. We have a good plan and we're executing well against that plan. So with that, why don't, Brad, we open up the line and take some Q&A?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt O'Connor: Good morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi, Matt.
Matt O'Connor: Could you just talk about the approach to managing the balance sheet going forward with rates seemingly staying lower for longer? And even if we do get an increase, maybe it's just 1 or 2. You guys are obviously very asset-sensitive. How do you think about maintaining that asset sensitivity versus maybe bringing it down a little bit to protect the NIM going forward?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Why don't I start, Eric, you can add to it. We've consciously maintained relatively stable asset sensitivity. We do think the Fed will move, and I'd like to refer to our position as a coiled spring that will release and deliver some meaningful net interest income benefit. At this point, late in the zero cycle, zero phase, to go increase our asset duration meaningfully would potentially snatch the feat from the jaws of victory. So we will take some steps at the margin to recognize that the horizon is being pushed out and it's likely to be more gradual than initially we anticipated, the market anticipated, but I don't think we should change the position in a substantial way. Eric?
Eric Aboaf: Matt, I'd add the following. Our asset sensitivity is highly concentrated at the front end. 80% of it literally comes through in year one, 6% front-end in year two. So the opportunity cost isn't particularly large. To close down our position, it's not as if we put on a five- or 10-year duration positions. We literally have to put on one and two year swaps, and if you think about what you can earn on that, it's actually quite small. And so the payback, even based on current forward curves, and clearly they swing around, it's 3 to 4 times. So you're really in a position where we feel like there's some decent upside, even with these lower forecasted and slower forecasted rate increases once perhaps every six months. That's a better position, that's a position that we'd prefer to hold for the time being.
Matt O'Connor: Then just separate from the rate discussion, as we think about the balance sheet optimization that you made some good progress on this quarter, and obviously that helping the NIM, how much more of that is there to do from here? It's obviously good if you can grow net increased income and keep the balance sheet stable, but how much more opportunity is there to, call it, re-mix, or as you mentioned, tweak some deposit pricing, how much more and how much does that play out in the NIM over time?
Eric Aboaf: What we have is we have an opportunity to continue to defend NIM with rates in a relatively flat scenario here. We've been -- for example, in the deposit side, we've been inching up our deposit costs about 2 basis points per quarter over the last three, four quarters. We've been able to slow that down to 1 basis point and you can imagine, we're trying to slow it down even further. With Don and Brad's support, we found some good opportunities on the deposit side to do that. On loans, the worker continues. It's primarily product mix in consumer, its tactical pricing and returns and some mix in commercial, a mix of product mix there in commercial and pricing acumen and intensity. That in a way helps us defend the back book roll off which continues. So in a flat rate environment, we have an ability to keep NIM stable. We will try to tick it up a little bit, but we've got it stable, and for the time being, until we see some real rate rises, we have some confidence in being able to continue to deliver that.
Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question will come from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ken Zerbe: Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So I guess, first of all, I thought it was great that you guys were able to keep expenses down, given the further investment in the business. Could you just give us an update, though, on where you stand with Top II going forward, or at this point?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, sure. So in Top II, as you recall, Ken, there were three major categories. One was expenses, one was pricing initiatives, and then one was the broader revenue initiatives. On the expense side, we're making excellent progress around the main two thrusts there. One is what we call ops transformation, where we are stepping back and taking a look at how we're organized and making some changes, and kind of ultimately we're aiming for the hat trick, we like to call it. We want to have a better customer experience, better risk, it controls, and of course efficiencies, and we're starting to see some of those efficiencies come through. They'll come through additionally in Q4 and have a full-year effect on 2016 We also have a greater effort to work through vendor contracts, and looking for opportunities to consolidate and get better pricing from vendors. That has been part of top two and that is also flowing through as we work through that initiative. So we feel quite confident that we've already got that in motion. We are starting to see some of the benefits come through and it is on track. Pricing, similarly, a bunch of that is on the commercial side, cash management is one area. We're rolling that out in waves and so you're going to start to see that flow through here in the second half of the year. Then will get a full-year effect of that in 2016, so we see that tracking to expectations in terms of client impacts and our ability to execute that program. On the third bucket of revenues, we have a couple of major thrusts there, which are in pilot phase. That's largely on the consumer side; there's a little bit on the commercial side there, as well. So we've been running the pilot through Q3, we've expanded the pilots into Q4, and we're putting the infrastructure in place to do the full rollout early in 2016. Everything we've seen in those pilots is positive in terms of our ability to deliver the revenue potential on the full program. So, broadly speaking, I'd say, we feel good about the program taken as a whole.
Ken Zerbe: All right. That's great. Then just really quickly, on the iPhone financing, I know it's a small piece of your business, but any commentary on how that financing program has been going?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, look, I'll start, Brad, you can obviously put more depth and color to it, but I'd say we were very pleased. First off, that we were able to secure the partnership with such an iconic company like Apple, and they certainly have high expectations for their partners in terms of delivering an outstanding customer experience. What we're most pleased about is we've certainly executed the program extremely well and have really satisfied Apple as a worthy partner and the customers are getting good experiences as they come in on to this program. It is ramping about to expectations, so it's a relatively modest pilot in the stores at this point. It will move later to online, which will ramp it up to greater size, and then obviously, you get into the whole Christmas season, and through Thanksgiving to Christmas is a sprint. So we do expected to see a fairly good level of ramping up in Q4, but we're very pleased with what has occurred to this point. Brad?
Brad Conner: Bruce, you did a very good job of covering it. Also it started very much in line with what we expected. It was nominal impact on the quarter, about $60 million in balances for the quarter, so it was a nominal impact on the quarter, but it is giving us confidence that it's a very viable program for us in the long run. You said it well, we're pleased and Apple is pleased and the partnership is off to a very good start so there's strong potential for the program for the long run.
Ken Zerbe: Great. All right. Thank you very much.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay.
Operator: And our next will come from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Erika Najarian: Hi, good morning. My first question is on the efficiency ratio. You clearly have made good progress year-over-year from 68% to 66%, and given that, like Matt said investors are much more of the mindset of lower for longer. Could you take us to have much more improvement that could be in 2016 in this efficiency ratio if rates don't normalize?
Bruce Van Saun: I think the key to that is really just to stay focused on delivering positive operating leverage. Regardless of what happens to rates, we have a good capital position and an ability to grow loans, and if we do a good job on NIM, that will flow straight through and create a good continuing source of revenue momentum. We're investing in our fee-based businesses. Some of the people that we put in place have to season and that should help our fee projections going forward, and we are going to continue to hire and continue to build those business, but we will be making a spread over who we put in place and what it costs us to put those people in place. So that should be contributive to positive operating leverage. Then on the expense side, we've worked very hard to try to self-fund the investments we need to grow. So that means a continued effort to look at the zero base of expenses and go in and find places where we might be inefficient and pull -- extracted those expenses so that we can try to keep overall expenses as close to flat as possible. We were able to achieve that to quarters in a row, which is really quite something when you consider the amount we are putting into technology and the amount were putting into playing offense in our growth initiatives and some of the demands on us from an overall risk and control and regulatory standpoint. So we think it ultimately gets a little harder. We've called out in Q4 that we'll see a little bit of growth in expenses. Some of the technology depreciation and software amortization is going to come on stream in Q4. But we're committed to really staying 100% focused on delivering the positive operating leverage because that ultimately drives the improvement in the efficiency ratio and it drives the improvement in our profitability and our ROTCE. So as we go through our budget process into next year, every member of the management team has a real focus on that.
Erika Najarian: Got it. And just a follow-up question for Eric. Given that you're compliant with the LCR, should we think about the size of the securities portfolio from here relative to your loan and deposit growth?
Eric Aboaf: The securities portfolio is right-sized to be honest. We run an LCR above the requirements but not way above purposefully. So we got a good-sized balance sheet. You saw that we compressed it a bit this past quarter as we took out some collateralized borrowings that we didn't think we were particularly valuable to have and in the LCR world you don't get credit for. That had a small reduction effect on the portfolio, but the portfolio is properly sized. Over time, you'll see that we will use a mix of MBS and treasuries from that portfolio and then classic vanilla interest rate swaps to manage the duration. So it's within the range, probably go up and down a bit here and there, but within the range for now.
Erika Najarian: Okay. Thank you so much for taking my question.
Operator: Our next question will come from Vivek Junenja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Vivek Junenja: Hi, Eric. Hi, Bruce. A couple of questions. Can you update us on your plans on loan portfolio acquisitions, since that was something that you all had done more actively last year and even earlier this year? Third quarter, it doesn't seem like you had anything material, but if you could just update us on that?
Bruce Van Saun: I'd say we always do you those portfolio acquisitions as a bridge to building out our own capabilities. The SCUSA arrangement was put in place before we had really rolled out our broader platform and our ability to really penetrate the prime sector of the market. And as we have been able to scale our own capabilities up, we've been scaling back on that SCUSA flow agreement. We also opportunistically entered into an arrangement with SoFi on the student loan side. We like the overall marketplace and the product that they originate has characteristics of very high credit quality and good risk-adjusted returns like our own growth and so that allows us to accelerate our growth a little bit. That is a modest sized program. It's about $500 million over the course of the year. Other than that, at this point, we don't have much going on or much that we are looking at. But we will continue to be opportunistic. As I said, we have a very good capital position and we're putting that capital to work through our own channels and building client relationships and building our book of relationships and customers that we can cross-sell into. But again, if there are opportunities that come up, we will take a look. Brad, why don't I ask you for…
Brad Conner: Yes. You did a great job. I was just going to add one point to this, which is we did step the SCUSA portfolio purchases down from second quarter to third quarter and you can expect, we expect one more step down in the fourth quarter. So it will actually be a little bit smaller still in the fourth quarter, so we're continuing to step that down.
Vivek Junenja: Okay. And on the resi mortgage side?
Bruce Van Saun: When you look at the maps on the quarter, probably around 10% of the net loan growth was the net purchase volume, so it's quite a modest number, at this point.
Vivek Junenja: Okay, good. That means even resi mortgage, you are doing through your own originations now, more and more?
Bruce Van Saun: More and more, right.
Vivek Junenja: Yes. Okay. Brad, a question for you on mortgage. Can you give a little more color on what happened with mortgage banking? It seems like you had an MSR hedge loss. And how you're tracking on originations with all the hiring of the mortgage officers? I know you've had a change in management you just announced a couple of days ago. So you can give us some more color on that?
Brad Conner: Sure. It hit in a couple of buckets. You mentioned the MSR change. We have a $6 million recapture on our MSR asset in second quarter. We had a $1.7 million impairment this quarter. So when you look at the mortgage fees, we had about an $8 million swing from quarter to quarter, so that was an impact and a step down on mortgage revenue. We actually saw our application volume drop about 10% in the third quarter. Much of that was just market-based, that's pretty much consistent with the market. I would say, in terms of our hiring, if you look at our hiring, year-on-year, we are still progressing well. It was relatively flat quarter for net hiring in the third quarter. Some of that is extreme competition in the marketplace so we're seeing a lot of a petition for good quality loan officers. We're attracting loan officers, but there is a little bit of a hand-to-hand combat happening out in the marketplace. Then the other thing that impacted that was -- and of course, the whole industry dealt with this -- was a little bit of distraction with the [total resting] implementation, the trade implementation, which happened in early October. It really did put a lot of strain on operations capacity for us and the industry, so we actually ended up from a loan officer hiring perspective, we were up net 1 in the third quarter.
Bruce Van Saun: Yeah. All right. And the good news underlying is that we continue to increase our market share.
Brad Conner: Right.
Bruce Van Saun: So as we're going to loan officers, our market share for each of the last three quarters has continued to pick up. The originations in the quarter were up on a sequential quarter basis, so notwithstanding that apps [ph] were down a little bit. The actual originations that came through were up. On the Management change, we had a couple of our folks looking to retire at the end of the year who have been good soldiers for us, both on the wealth side and in mortgage. And we're fortunate that we are able to go out into the market and attract some real talent into the Organization.
Vivek Junenja: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Geoffrey Elliott: Hello. Thank you for taking the question. On the final exit of RBS from your shareholder structure, whenever that happens, could you talk about what impact that's going to have on you, operationally, either in terms of where you get more flexibility or where potentially there is a bit of dissynergy in that they have been helping you get some business?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Look I think the - frankly, at this point, there won't be much impact at all. Most of the overall impacts of them stepping down their ownership and shrinking their business activities across the globe and here in the US have largely played themselves out. We did call out the asset finance area was one place where we were getting referrals from their overall credits book and their relationships, which we need to figure out, though, that will over time decay and he erode and we have to figure out how we're going to replace that. We have some ideas on that, but we did color code that initiative to grow that business amber at the moment until we've sorted out, something that Don is very focused on. But more broadly, we also, in capital markets, have used their platform and jointly called in some areas and we had plans to ultimately migrate off their, for example, FX and derivatives platform, and go on to our own platform in Q1, which will actually increase our flexibility in terms of the products we offer and some of their versatility we will have in being able to face off against the market. So that's a little bit of upside actually that's coming. Then with respect to RBS' overall risk oversight responsibility as a source of strength for Citizens, we've had generally good agreement and support from them as we've moved from playing defense to offense about any changes that we've looked to make in our risk appetite. So I don't think there'd be any big change in terms of them stepping back from having those oversight responsibilities. I would say, largely, most of the impacts are baked into current results or our current forecasts.
Geoffrey Elliott: Thanks. And then, switching topics, a little bit, the step-up in commercial yields this quarter, what was behind that? Was it mix or was it pricing improving?
Bruce Van Saun: Eric, why don't you take that and then flip it to Don for color?
Eric Aboaf: The core of that is some pricing discipline. We saw origination yields across commercial tick up almost 20 basis points. There tends to be volatility from quarter to quarter, but that was a larger than typical up tick, and if you dig deep, what we've been doing is working very tactically with our bankers and helping them with benchmark data on pricing so that they can price effectively on new business. That's been quite productive, as well as about three months ago, four months ago, it would have been in the middle of the second quarter, we rolled out our updated returns calculator, which also gives them some real insight and tools. So we've been helping there and that has begun to get some nice traction and we are starting to see the results of that. Obviously, there will be some volatility from quarter-to-quarter. But we're pleased with some of those early results.
Don McCree: Eric, that's exactly right and I feel that, that's fully embedded in the commercial bank division right now. I'd point to the fact that we are doing less low-margin business, which is moving the overall book slightly up. And as Eric said, it will move a little bit quarter to quarter, but we feel like the discipline is fully embedded.
Geoffrey Elliott: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Ken Usdin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on the fee outlook. It's the one path that you guys don't talk about in the explicit guidance. Eric, I heard your point about some of the third-quarter items were certainly in line with market behavior. Can you just give us an update on your outlook for fee growth trajectory and any changes versus prior expectations, if any?
Bruce Van Saun: I would just say, Ken, we did have a clause in our outlook statement about fees, at the time where we said we anticipate fee income growth. Typically, that is not part of the outlook, but anyway I would say in general the fourth quarter has some seasonality to it. So when we look at some of the activities on the consumer side, we typically see a nice little seasonal updraft there. We had, on the commercial side a relatively quiet third quarter and there's often seasonality there, as well. We typically engineer a few leasing transactions in the fourth quarter. So there is some optimism around our ability to move the chains both on the consumer side, as well as on the commercial side. Eric, you want to add to that?
Eric Aboaf: No, that covers it well.
Ken Usdin: Thank you, Bruce. Stand corrected. I see it on the deck. Second question, on CCAR, when you got your original approvals for the three years, it included the $250 million for next year. I know we haven't even gotten scenarios yet for next year, but my question is just do you think you'll even be able to contemplate a different ask than that original $250 million or are we really talking about 2017 CCAR for a CCAR ask than that original $250 million you got for 2016?
Bruce Van Saun: I think, I should explain that a little bit, Ken. But that $250 million effectively was the tail of a multi-year agreement that we had worked out with the Fed around our desire to put a capital stack back in place that mirrored our peers. So ultimately, it was to $2.75 billion of buyback with a linked issuance of capital securities. We have just simply run that out and we put that last remaining $250 million out into the next CCAR submission. That really is not an indication of what we think we'll do in the next CCAR submission. We have to go through our - all sources and uses of capital and how fast do we think the balance sheet is going to grow and what do we want our dividend policy to be. So we will - and then where do we want to land in terms of continuing to chip away at the high level of capital that we have, CET 1 capital relative to peers. So, we'll dialogue with the Fed about that and we'll go through the process and we'll make some determinations. But clearly, I don't think you should take away that, that $250 million is locked in stone…
Ken Usdin: Okay. Then just one quick clarification then on that $250 million, was that $250 million just a year thing, meaning that was that $250 million, in fact, could that still even happen in the first half and not even be part of the 2016 program or is it distinctly part of the second half and beyond '16 program, whether you ask for more or not?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I'm not sure I completely follow, but I'll just try to explain. So in the four-quarter CCAR submission that we just had approval for, we've had two $250 million transactions, which we've already executed. This $250 million was indicated to be in the next submission and early in the period for the next submission. We will certainly look to do that and then potentially something additional as we work through the plan for the next submission.
Ken Usdin: Understood. Perfect. Thank you, Bruce.
Operator: Our next question in line will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Matt Burnell: Good morning, Bruce, good morning, Eric. Thanks for taking my question. My first question really relates to what looked like pretty stable balances in the commercial business, the C&I business, specifically, and pretty healthy growth in the commercial real estate portfolio. Could you give us a little more insight as to what the trends are in both those portfolios, and if that's going to be a primary driver of your growth in the fourth quarter?
Eric Aboaf: Yes, Matt, let me start, and then Don will weigh in, as well, to give you a little texture. You saw some average balance growth in C&I. In particular, you saw a little bit of small dip, EOP, on the C&I line. On the other side on the ledger, on the CRE, as you described, you had nice sequential growth of 6%, which was particularly healthy and robust. There is some movements there. Originations have been, on commercial, and in C&I, in particular, have been pretty decent all year, including this past quarter, a little less activity on draws, which tends to sometimes be seasonal. But it's a business where we continue to see some momentum, on the one hand, and on the other hand, it's intensely price competitive, and we're also being disciplined and careful about where and how we grow that.
Don McCree: Yes, I think, let me just add to that. That's exactly right. It's a tale of many cities. We're seeing really good growth in real estate, we're seeing really good growth in franchise finance, a little bit of weakness in our asset finance business, a little bit of weakness in our mid market business, the mid market business is entirely due to utilization. A suspicion there, although we haven't fully proved out, is much of that has to do with commodity prices and general economic outlook in some of our mid market areas. We just think our clients are borrowing a little bit less money at this split second, and we also see that in the opposite indicator, which is growth in our deposits. So we feel very good about where we are in terms of quality of intensity, quality of upgrades, of personnel developing pipelines, quality of calls in terms of corporate finance calls, as opposed to just lending calls. So all of the indicators we see in the franchise are excellent and we think we're setting the stage for continued growth in the business.
Matt Burnell: So Don, are you getting an elevated level of pay downs in the third quarter versus the second quarter, which we've heard from a couple of the other regional banks?
Don McCree: I haven't seen it necessarily in pay downs. We've seen it in utilization, so less draws under existing commitments. And it more than explains the entire total reduction in C&I loans so we are growing in underlying portfolios, but we are also building our pipelines and we don't see the overall commitment book decline.
Eric Aboaf: Pay downs were actually in line with the average for the last five quarters. Pay downs were actually a little lighter than in the second quarter, for that matter, so just on the utilization line this quarter, which tends to be jumpy. We have utilization, quarter-over-quarter, you see swings in utilization of $300 million, $400 million, $500 million, and so obviously carefully working through it, but not particularly out of the ordinary.
Matt Burnell: Eric, my second question is for you, in terms of the cost of the long-term debt has come down quite dramatically. The balances have increased a bit over the past year. Is there much more you can do in terms of bringing the cost of your long-term debt down as part of your NIM planning?
Eric Aboaf: Long-term debt is, like you say, it's long-term, right. There's a limit to what one can really do. We have tended to issue floating or issue swap to floating, which gives us some flexibility, and obviously, we'll manage that in the scheme of our duration position. From a perspective that we have is that over time, we have said that we'd add a little bit of senior debt to the stack just to be a little more balanced. That said, we'll do that carefully and modestly, given the rate environment. But if there are some low points in the curve, it's also a nice time to pull a little bit of that down, put it on the balance sheet, and do it at a time before the rates pop up.
Matt Burnell: Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.
Gerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning, Bruce, good morning, Eric. Can you share with us your thoughts about capital. You've touched on it already, but you guys obviously have capital levels, your common equity Tier 1 ratio is above the peers, as you pointed out. What's your comfort level in where you think that could get to and what strategies would you use to, I'm assuming bring it down?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, we've done up to now, Gerard, is a combination of actually the conversion transactions, which in effect buybacks. We've had dividend policy set at 25% to 30% and we had an ability and a desire to really grow loans and grow the loan book and growth to that strong capital position. I do think it is a bit of a loop here, as we put that excess capital to work, it helps drive revenues. It helps drive that positive operating leverage and it helps improve our returns. Then the more capital we can self-generate, then we can feel confident that we can meet all the requirements to run the business without having to have that cushion. So the calibration in terms of the timing for removing some of that surplus really is linked to some degree to how quickly we can get our returns up so that we're self-sufficient and were not hamstrung when we see good opportunities to grow loans. We don't want to be drawing down that capital for position that's below us, so that to me is the timing. It will be a combination, going forward, of probably faster than peer loan growth. Ultimately, when we're in a sustainable position to be able to do that, then we can look to increase the buybacks and bring that capital level back to where peers are. There's no reason, at the end of the day, once we're through our turnaround period, that we should have a new guy premium, if you will, quote-unquote, and a higher capital level than peers. There's nothing in the mix of our business, our risk appetite, our stress losses under CCAR, that would say there's a requirement for the medium-term or longer-term, to hold extra capital than peers. I do think we are just managing our way through this and using it as an advantage right now as we work to improve our overall performance.
Gerard Cassidy: Thank you. I agree with you about the new guy premium is not going to be needed. If we get to 2017, and I don't think the regulators will allow this in '16 CCAR. But if you all, the industry, not just Citizens, are given the opportunity to give back in excess of your estimated earnings in that CCAR. Would you guys consider doing that, where you could really bring it down to get that ROE to a higher level?
Bruce Van Saun: I think, I'd fall back on my previous answer. So I don't know if I want to be pinned down to timing. We have got a lot of things over 2016 and 2017 that we have to see play out in terms of the path for the Fed and the path for our profitability improvement. So I do think we'll certainly monitor the signals coming from the Fed and where the peer group looks likely to go, and over time, continue to try to narrow that differential.
Gerard Cassidy: Great. Then finally, shifting gears, you guys mentioned that you had a deposit program in place with higher rates, which you have started to fade away going into the third quarter. Are there any plans for 2016 for any deposit specials, where you look to grow the deposits through maybe higher rates or special products?
Eric Aboaf: It is Eric, Gerard. I think we take deposits, quarter-to-quarter from a tactical basis, right. What you've seen us do is fade a little bit of some of the more aggressive promotional campaigns we had been doing in consumer, as over the last couple of quarters, and with Brad's help and guidance of the team, also just being careful about being in line with peers as opposed to ahead, we been able to tamp down on the increases that we've seen. We have even been doing better month after month after month here, even during third quarter. That's the kind of thing we expect to continue. I said something similar on the commercial side, where we've been repricing some old balances. That will continue. As rates rise, ideally rise next year, prevailing market rate, we will likely to what you'd expect, is typically lag. We've disclosed our betas. The betas are -- there's much more of a lag in consumer than in commercial typically. What you will find us do is over and above that, there's a product question you asked, specifically is in consumer. We continue to reevaluate the product set to make sure that it's designed to encourage checking account balances, those low interest rate balances, those DDA balances. On commercial, one of the byproducts of growing the cash management business is it brings in DDA balances. So, that's where the initiatives, on one hand, that we've talked about for multiple quarters ties to some of the funding costs opportunities that we've seen.
Gerard Cassidy: Okay. Thanks, Eric.
Operator: And our next question on the line comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.
John Pancari: Morning.
Bruce Van Saun: Hi.
John Pancari: Just a quick question, back to the margin. I mean, it's good to see the pricing and the other yield initiatives that are benefiting the margin, and it sounds like that's sticky, and that the margin could hold at this level. Could you talk about the risk that it could come at the cost of loan growth as you focus on these pricing opportunities and then what that could mean for annual growth for 2016 in the total loan balances?
Eric Aboaf: John, it is Eric. Let me start, right. I think the first part of the margin, the yield enhancements that we've seen, in particular, on loans, is around product mix. So as we grow student loans, even the Apple balances, the organic auto, those are actually accretive to our yields, so literally the benefit of growing higher yielding products has a benefit. There is a similar area in commercial, as in commercial real estate, where we're becoming increasingly disciplined, for example, on our REIT business, and actually expanding other areas instead. So that mix effect is actually a natural way to defend the yields, if not to actually expand them. The next piece then is actual apples-to-apples pricing on commercial loans. That's where you're in the trenches, and with -- Don and I are conscious that you push a little too much on price and volume can adjust, and what we're trying to do is carefully find what that elasticity is and where the appropriate point to price on so that you get both -- you get good yielding loans and volume. That's what we do daily. Do you want to add to that Don?
Don McCree: I'd agree with that, Eric. I think the important thing is we're really managing this on a client by client, loan by loan basis, with a lot of senior intention to it. So we're making smart decisions on where we went to play and where we don't want to play. And I don't think our effort to be disciplined on pricing is going to have a particular effect on volume. I feel it's a competitive market out there and we're trying to stay at disciplined as we can, both on the credit side and on the pricing side, but we see lots of opportunity.
John Pancari: So given that, could this 1.5% linked quarter loan growth expectation carry through for 2016 and therefore we're looking at somewhere in the ballpark of 6% annually?
Bruce Van Saun: What we've said consistently this year is that we will give you our 2016 guidance in the January call. But what we've proven since we've been a public Company is we can shoot for something like that. We've been able to deliver it, but I really don't want to get drawn in on 2016 until January.
John Pancari: Okay, that's fine. Then one last question is on the ROTCE. As you acknowledged early in the call, it was relatively stable here around 6.6% or 6.7%. Can you just update us on your thoughts around the pace in the improvement in that ratio that you expect, barring any help from the Fed?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I think that's similar to your last question. We're very focused on delivering a positive operating leverage. We are, at the moment, building capital because we've made our share repurchases that are authorized under the CCAR, so you have a little bit of a headwind in the denominator. But the flip side of that is you are growing your book value per share, which is also a positive. But what we start to -- we will have everything working for us again in the next CCAR cycle, if we're delivering the profitability growth and we can get the buyback, back into the equation on consistently quarterly basis, then hopefully we aren't building capital at the same clip.
John Pancari: Okay. All right. Thanks, Bruce.
Operator: And our last question will come from the line of David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Eads: Hi, good morning. Maybe just one last one from me. If you could talk a little bit about the capital markets line. You dipped a little bit from a really strong second quarter. I was just curious how much of that is due to market factors versus seasonality and timing and just the general lumpiness of that business?
Eric Aboaf: I'll take that. I would point to just the volatility in the market in the third quarter. It was across high-grade, high-yield, and the syndicated lending market. It was just tremendously volatile and the market seized up really toward the back end of the summer and that was on top of what we usually see, which is a summer slowdown, in terms of the transactional business. So, I do think it was a tough comparison with the second quarter, as you said, which was a very strong quarter. We're seeing reasonable activity as we move into the fourth quarter.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, as I indicated in an earlier answer today, that we typically see a seasonal pick-up in the capital markets area in Q4, and it looks like our pipelines would give some confidence to that statement.
David Eads: All right. Thanks for the color.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay.
Bruce Van Saun: All right. Well, that's all the questions that we have for today. So thank you for dialing in and joining us this morning. And again, we feel we have another good quarter, pleased with our performance, executing well. And feel quite confident about our future outlook. So thank you and have a good day.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-07-21 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning everyone. And welcome to the Citizens Financial Group's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad and I’ll be your operator for today's one hour call. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor: Thanks so much Brad. Good morning everyone. We really appreciate you joining us this morning for our call, particularly on such a busy morning. We're going to start things off with our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and our CFO, Eric Aboaf reviewing our second quarter results and then we’ll open the call up for questions. Also joining us on this call today is Brad Conner, our Head of Consumer Banking. We’d like to remind everyone that in addition to today’s press release, we’ve also provided a presentation and financial supplement. And these materials are available at investor.citizensbank.com. I also need to remind you that during the call, we may make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed containing our earnings release and quarterly supplements. Additionally, any information about any non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, may also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our Web site. And with no further ado, I’ll hand it over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thank you Ellen and good morning everyone. We are pleased with the progress that we've made in the second quarter as we are executing well against our strategic priorities. We continue to achieve good loan and deposit growth. We are doing a great job in controlling expenses. We see some lift in fee revenue this quarter. We continue to deliver annualized positive operating leverage of over 5% which is really the key to improving our profitability. Our credit provision was up in the quarter towards more normalized levels. In prior quarters where we show the comparisons, we had large commercial recoveries but with our portfolio so clean it's now unlikely we'll continue to see such meaningful recoveries. In sight of absorbing the higher level of credit provisioning in this quarter, we still showed EPS growth versus linked and prior quarter given our good operating performance. And the credit strengths remain very favorable as NPLs declined 86 million or 8% versus last quarter. We feel we are making good progress in delivering for our stakeholders, investors, customers, colleagues, community and regulators. We have adjusted the timeframe for some of our initiatives given market conditions and we've developed some new ones which we'll describe in more detail in a few minutes. This morning we filed two S-1s, one covering RBS' intent to continue their sell down and the other covering our planned issuance of 250 million in subordinated debt with proceeds to be used likely to buy back stock from RBS through their participation in our next stock offering. Our capital plans are progressing well and we continue to have a very strong solid and clean balance sheet. With that, let me turn it over to Eric to give more color on our financial results. Eric?
Eric Aboaf: Thank you Bruce and good morning everyone. We are pleased with our overall performance in the quarter as we continue to drive positive operating leverage and good loan and deposit growth and strong execution of our initiatives. As I take you through some of the details of our financials I will refer to slides in our investor presentation that you can find on our Web site. Let me start on Page 3, with our second quarter financials which demonstrate our strong progress in executing on our strategy. Our second quarter GAAP net income of 190 million was down 19 million or 9% from the first quarter and down a 123 million or 39% from the second quarter 2014. Diluted earnings per share was $0.35 down $0.03 from the first quarter and down $0.21 from the second quarter 2014. Linked quarter results reflect revenue growth offset by a $30 million increase in restructuring charges and special items and $19 million increase in provisions. Prior year quarter results reflect the previous year's gain from the Chicago divestiture. Page 4 summarizes restructuring and other special items for this quarter associated with the productivity initiatives that we plan as well as the separation costs from RBS. We recorded 40 million in pre-tax charges this quarter -- in line with our expectations for the first half of the year of 45 million to 50 million in total. I will focus the rest of my comments this morning on our adjusted results which exclude the impact of these items. Turning to Page 5 we posted strong operating results with net income of 215 million, EPS of $0.40. Net income was stable linked quarter was roughly 10 million reduction in share accounts EPS was up a penny. Relative to a year ago, net income was up 5% and EPS was up 8% as PPNR growth of 13% was partially offset by $28 million provision increase from very low levels a year ago. Operating leverage continues to be strong at 1.3% linked quarter and 5% year-over-year. Revenue was up 17 million linked quarter on growth in both net interest and non-interest income and also up year-over-year as we more than replaced the foregone revenues from the Chicago branches sold last year. Expenses were flat on a linked quarter basis demonstrating good discipline that we drove a second fee savings while also reinvesting in a business. In credit cost from prior period which have benefited from strong recovery in commercial but remained at the ['09] level. We continue to make measurable progress with our goals with a 67% efficiency ratio and 6.7% return on tangible common equity both improved since the prior year. On Slide 6, we analyze net interest income which grew 7 million or 1% over the prior year but that was needed by the Chicago Divestiture which impacted NII by 13 million or 2.5% in effect. Over the course of the year we also grew earning assets by 6% or 7.2 billion driven by strong performance in both commercial and consumer as we continue to put our strong capital position to work to serve our customers. Compared to the first quarter net interest income was up slightly as the impact of 2% loan growth and an additional day was needed by the continued impact of the low rate environment. Turning to Slide 7. Our net interest margin this quarter was impacted by several factors including yield compression on loan, higher premium amortization cost in the securities portfolio and slightly higher deposit costs. Commercial yield picked up modestly this quarter as we continue to see back to front office yield that were higher than the origination. Consumer yields were down as the mix of all higher credit quality products and prepayments worked against us this quarter. Given that market interest rates were below where we had expected them to be we've taken some additional steps to defend the market and we believe that we have likely reached a bottom from in. Specifically on the asset side we’re actively emphasizing originations in the selected products that exhibit wider margins and stronger returns, such as student lending and middle market and industry verticals. And on the liabilities we’re actively managing deposit rating strategy across our businesses and products to slowly increasing cost we've seen lately. We also continue to be highly asset sensitive, the impact of the 200 basis points gradual rise in rates of the forward curve is consistent with the last quarter and approximately 6.8% in the first year. This is driven primarily by the short-end of the curve. On Slide 8, we generated a $13 million increase in linked quarter non-interest income which was driven by a strong uptick in capital syndications, card fees, trust and investment fees, and service charges. Year-over-year non-interest income increased 8 million from second quarter 2014 in spite of the drag from the Chicago Divestiture of 12 million. And on an underlying basis we've generated non-interest income growth of approximately 6% with particular momentum in mortgage banking and capital market. Taking a moment to talk on the key drivers of year-on-year growth, you can clearly see the progress of our mortgage initiatives we've increased our frontline origination capability with mortgage off up 23% year-over-year and improved the origination by 68% as the market is firming and we continue to gain market share. In capital markets our continued efforts to build out the platform and enhance our loan syndication efforts are paying dividend as we grew fees in this category by 15% year-over-year. Early left and joint lead writer ranger transactions were up 18% for the first half of this year versus first half last year. Moving on to non-interest expense on Slide 9. We’re intensely focused on driving continued improvement and the efficiency of the franchise our goal is to generate strong operating leverage by actively managing our expense base while continuing to invest across the franchise enhance of the products and distribution capabilities. Our adjusted operating expenses of 801 million this quarter was relatively stable as a decrease in salaries and employee benefits and occupancy spend was offset by increased outside services equipment and software amortization. Year-over-year adjusted expense was down 32 million or 4% largely due to the $21 million Chicago impact created aided by our efficiency initiative which more than offset the important investments to drive growth and effectiveness and we've kept headcount flat too. As I mentioned we achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of 67% which was down 95 basis points from the first quarter and down 353 basis points from the prior year quarter. And we’re pleased with our progress we’ll continue to focus on new initiatives improve our efficiency and drive revenue growth while controlling our cost savings. Now turning to the consolidated average balance sheet on Slide 10. Our total earning assets of 123.2 billion were up 2% from last quarter and 6% from the second quarter 2014 driven by the benefit of our growth initiative. In consumer we generated strong growth in auto, mortgage, and students over the prior year. Commercial growth has been broad based with growth in commercial real estate, industrial verticals, mid corporate, franchise finance and corporate finance. We continue to improve our deposit gathering capabilities with average deposits from the second quarter increasing by 2.9 billion or 3% over the first quarter. Over the last year organic deposit growth was approximately 10.9 billion or 12% more than offsetting the $4.5 billion impact of the Chicago divestiture. On Slide 11, consumer banking loans decreased 680 million or 1.4% sequentially as you see the results for the growth initiatives and we continue to ramp our own organic origination in auto, mortgage and students. Because of the success and our focus on enhancing our return so far we have chosen to tactically reduce our SCUSA arrangement by more than half for around 200 million per quarter with an annualized target of 750 million going forward. Last quarter we made a tuck-in acquisition in other portfolio. In this quarter in addition to closing on a purchase of a $200 million high quality to do portfolio facility we agree to purchase another 300 million over the next three quarters. These purchases represent a transition out of auto to more attractive risk adjusted return category. And these actions come out with balance sheet review that I have been involved with the joint. We will continue to make refinements for our strategy in order to improve the underlying mix of portfolio in order to boost deals and offset the impact of low rates. On Slide 12 commercial loans increased 1.2 billion or 3% linked quarter and you see the result from the tax flow adjustments that we've made. Middle market continues to rebound as we emphasize growth in this bread and butter business since late last year. Asset finance results were flattish as we shifted towards an originated model which should deliver better return. Our commercial real-estate teams have been in surprised volume and earnings per share deals in the market and we continue to gain momentum in franchise finance. The commercial market is highly competitive and this scenario where even maintained yield acquires both strong client relationship and strong discipline, we've recently added additional pricing analytics to help our bankers take advantage of the price diversion and what can be an opaque market. And with the reinforcement risk for the roll out of enhance return calculator over the last few months. Slide 13 focuses on the liability side of balance sheet and are funding cost. We grew the combination of net interest, money market and savings and term and time by approximately 17% this year were 10.5 billion despite the impact of the Chicago divesture. We implemented this growth with the mix of demand deposit or supplemented this growth for the mix of demand deposit at FHLB borrowings and senior debt to further diversify our funding sources. On Slide 14 we played our key initiative that support the balance sheet and fee growth in our turnaround plan and assess progress during the quarter. We continue to believe that we are broadly on track overall and we are actively adjusting these initiatives to improve execution or adapt to market conditions. Heighten watch barriers continue to be the initiative when we are hiring in the significant numbers. We have expanded the timeline to hit our targeted coverage force in both mortgages and wealth by about a year given experience today. Bruce will comment on several of these in his closing remarks today. On Slide 15 you can see that our credit quality continues to be very strong on a relative basis. With net charge-offs at 78 million and provision at 77 million. I will remind you that first quarter results included 15 million commercial real-estate recovery while this quarter's results reflect to return to more normalized level. More generally we continue to see relatively low levels of growth charge-off across the book despite continued loan growth. We also continue to benefit from the run-off in the non-core book. This was down nearly 200 million in the quarter to a balance of 2.7 billion. Asset quality remains very, very good. Our NPLs were down 86 million or 8% in the quarter and the allowance to NPL ratio improved from 106% to 114%. With our opinion in neutral issues in a relatively modest size synergy portfolio. Turning to Slide 16 our capital position remains robust this quarter CET1 ratio was 11.8% which is well above our regional peers. We are above our FBR requirement and our LDR has been relatively consistent in early April we exited a 250 million preferred issuance and repurchase share from RBS. So from a pro forma basis impacted our CET1 ratio by 23 basis points but had no impact on our tier 1 ratio. On Slide 17 we summarized our accomplishments in delivering for a various stakeholders with sustain progress against our plans to reach. And now turning to Slide 18, let me summarize some of what you can expect next quarter. But all on the context the full year 2015 outlook that we previously provided and that we broadly reaffirm today. Compared to the second quarter of 2015 we expect to produce linked quarter loan growth of roughly 1.5%, this includes a little seasonality in the commercial book and we expect that Q4 will be seasonally stronger. We also expect net interest margins remains broadly stable from this quarter. We are hopeful that we have reached the bottom of NIM compression with will require active management until rates are higher. We would expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage thereby improving our efficiency ratio and profitability. We expect modest expense growth in Q3 from investments tied to our growth initiatives, we do not expect any additional restructuring cost in 2015. We expect credit to continue to be strong overall and with an expectation. And finally we expect that our CET1 ratio will remain relatively unchanged from around 11.75% and we will hold LDR at around 97% to 98%. And with that let me turn it back to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Thanks Eric. On Slide 19 we've mentioned for some time we've been working on further revenue and expense initiatives and we lay these out here. When we first launched our plan before going public we indicated that our initiatives would be managed dynamically given that the environment and our ability to execute would differ over time with our plans. We have a mindset of continuous improvement and we have worked hard to finalize and launch several additional initiatives that are larger and more complex than those in our first lead program that we called Top I. These new initiatives referring to as Top II cover efficiencies, pricing and revenue enhancements, overall they tilt slightly to revenue. The biggest initiative overall is ops transformation which is underway and will deliver some benefits in the second half and a meaningful benefit for 2016. We can see that overall we target a 2016 P&L benefit of approximately 90 million to 115 million. Now turning to Slide 20 we talk about how to think about these benefits in the context of our forward forecast. First off we are affirming 2015 guidance provided early this year with some swings and roundabouts, otherwise called puts and takes. We have seen lower than expected revenues offset by favorability on expenses and credits and as Eric mentioned this should continue in the second half. We expect the Top II initiatives to deliver around 25 million or so in the second half benefits offsetting other pressures and thereby protecting our outlook. For 2016 roughly 100 million in targeted Top II benefits we'll also undergird our ability to deliver the self improvement part of our plan. This is needed to offset some of the environmental pressure on NIM and a slower build on some of our fee based businesses. We will continue to look to add to these initiatives as we go forward and that's what you should expect of us. While we won't provide 2016 guidance until January 2016, it now appears highly likely that it will take longer to hit our 10% Q4 2016 gross fee target given the current forward said Fed Funds curve. Nonetheless we feel good about the progress we are making in running the bank better and about our ability to continue a steady upwards financial trajectory. So to sum up, Page 21, we are executing well on our overall agenda and we feel that we have good momentum in both the consumer and the commercial business. Our new initiatives are designed to continue our upwards financial trajectory. We have maintained a stable level of asset sensitivity and we'll pick up a nice tailwind once the Fed starts to lift grades. And our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong and our credit quality is excellent. So with that, let's open it up for some questions. Brad?
Operator: Thank you Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Eads: May be if we could just kind of start off on the initiatives you announced for the second wave. Can you just kind of talk about what you are doing different and then kind of what approaches are incremental to what you guys talked about previously?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, sure. So David each of these initiatives really is completely incremental to what we have done in the prior initiatives, although they help to support and reinforce what we are trying to achieve. If I look at the categorization, you have some dealing with the cost side of the equation and efficiency. We see some pricing opportunities where we can sharpen pricing strategies. And then lastly, broad revenue enhancement. And if you want I will just run through those briefly. But operations transformation we've looked at how we're organized across what's in the central service unit and distributed across in our businesses and I think some of that just grows up from a historical legacy standpoint. So we have taken a step back to figure out how can we better organize and distribute that work and find some efficiency. So that's been quite an undertaking. It's taken us a while to kind of asses that and come up with a plan but we are in the process of implementing that plan. And as I mentioned we'll already start to get some immediate benefits from that project in the second half. Procurement is pretty self explanatory. So we are working on I guess in general looking to consolidate vendors and then have tighter standards and compliance. With contracts there's more opportunity there. We did some of that in the first Top program but I think there was more to do than we've been able to fair that out. In pricing most of this is on the commercial side than the cash management business. We have been able to segment customers look at competitive pricing and we seek some opportunities to tighten pricing. A two down below on revenue enhancement, one is there is opportunities for us to better use our distribution channels on the consumer side deep in relationships with customers understand their needs better and then deliver the products that really are suitable for their needs and so I think we can just sharpen again as sharpening our gain and then on a commercial and consumer second initiative what we’re trying to do there is really just hold on for that customers and reduce attrition. So make sure that we have proper segmentation strategies and we’re really smothering those customers with lots of attention and right product capabilities. So we've plans against each and just like you saw in our Top I we assigned accountability out to people so people know where the ownership resides across the bank and we have regular meetings to make sure that we’re delivering and that we’re staying on track.
David Eads: So it sounds, these are all kind of business as usual type process, is just kind of getting better at each of these, the incoming opportunities is to get better there?
Bruce Van Saun: I think that’s right. It’s not anything that’s out of the box it's just continuing to sharpen how we’re running the bank would be a distinct way of categorizing the whole program.
David Eads: And then you talked a little bit about acquiring loan portfolios. Can you talk at what you are looking for in those acquisitions and would you consider doing something a little bit bigger I think that’s a pretty good opportunity for you guys.
Bruce Van Saun: Why don't I turn it over to Brad and perhaps driving on points of those acquisitions both with auto and now to shift into over into student Brad?
Brad Conner: I would say the acquisition that we did looks a lot like our education refinance product, we really like that segment a student lending is very high quality, you are dealing with customers that have proven track record of repayment they have a job so what we really like that segment and this segment that we acquired looks very much like our organic origination. Same in terms of about our opportunities we like the student loan segment so we wouldn't back away from future acquisitions but we don't have any -- I would specific designs around that at this point.
Bruce Van Saun: And I would say look we have very good own organic originations right now capabilities. So I think we can be very selective in terms of what we do as evidenced by our dialing back on the SCUSA arrangement our own auto originations has ramped up and we’re now able to originate more prime paper thereby there is less need for that. So I think the good news here is we’re getting very solid organic originations and we can be opportunistic when we see attractive portfolios.
Operator: And our next question will come from Scott Cyphers with Sandler O'Neill and Partners. Please go ahead.
Scott Cyphers: I guess Eric maybe for you. So you alluded to some of the things that you'd done sort of that balance sheet maximization that you have been looking at. Are those all just so I understand that correctly are those all included in the Top II initiative or are those mutually exclusive?
Bruce Van Saun: No I say they are part of the BAU process for running the bank and then few of them are in Top II. The initiatives are as we talked about around product mix we've very strong origination and strength in all of our businesses so we can tactically shift a little more from one business to another. I think I highlighted a couple of those already, student loans come in at a 110 basis points better yield and a couple of 100 basis points that are returned than some of our other opportunities and we’re emphasizing that’s an example and similarly there are areas like that on the commercial side. And because we have the ability to originate and grow the balance sheet as this kind of 7% to 8% per year we really have an opportunity to emphasize a little more and accelerate in some areas and actually curtail actively curtail on others that we find a little less remunerative as time moves on.
Scott Cyphers: I guess either Eric or Bruce I am just trying to square the revenue walk that you guys had given originally with what would be implied in the updated numbers and is it a fare characterization to just look at it as the $90 million to $115 million you disclosed today that basically captures what might have been a shortfall on the revenue side and then the only need to extend the revenue walk is based on the way the forward curve has softened relative to when you guys were initially doing the IPO roughly a year or so ago or 10 months or so?
Bruce Van Saun: I will and Eric you can chime in, but I would say where we had pressure on the initial revenue walk principally it's been in building up our fee based businesses and so the pace at which we can attract the quality and depth on both the mortgage loan office reports and the wealth advisor force it's been a little tougher and we still are making great progress and we still think we’ll get there but it’s probably going to take us another year and we slowdown a little bit in business banking hiring as well. So there is a little bit of headwind on the fee trajectory, there is a little headwind on kind of net interest income related to NIM and some of the pressure on the back book rolling off into kind of a lower rate environment and what we had anticipated. So we've done everything we thought we do and more on expenses but we've been a little late on revenues. So that’s really what we're trying to protect as to make sure overall that these initiatives allow us to deliver what we said it was something to deliver, if there is a little left over to partly offset the kind of said moving later and more languidly than expected, great. But that’s potentially a sizable impacted that is hard to fully offset. So really that’s the thing were you still have that close trends when the rates go up we'll start to benefit from that and if takes a little longer it will push out realization a bit and we'll just stay on top of that.
Eric Aboaf: And we'll see those initiatives right to start 60, 40 revenue to expand while we know the expense is quite we have a lot of confidence there revenue is always…
Bruce Van Saun: Pricing side of the revenue is also pretty foreseeable. So it's really the revenue enhancement we have to really work hard to execute against.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alan Strauss with Schroders. Go ahead.
Alan Strauss: Just a quick question. Your outside services are there ability to kind of lot of expenses there?
Bruce Van Saun: Let me take that, I think that is an ongoing area where there is all visibility to do more. So every third party vendor whether it's marketing, advertising firm, whether it's paper and pencil, whether it's equipment whether it's technology consulting. Right there is a wide range areas there and one thing the capacity and disciple in bidding out every time things come off and also finding ways to simplify what we buy. And that’s the part of how we do business and we're going to continue to actively manage those spending area.
Alan Strauss: Are there a lot of consulting expenses in that.
Eric Aboaf: Yes I think going through the period of change and all the various initiative and separating from our RBS and getting up from CCAR. We have used consultants more heavily then we have in the past. And they are also helping to guide us to some extent on some of these new initiatives. So I'd say we're probably at a higher run rate then we were historically and that should come down with time.
Operator: And our next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.
John Pancari: Couples of quick questions just regarding the ROTCE expectations. What is your updated Fed assumption that’s baked into the 10% ROTCE push back? And also what are you now expecting? And then separately what type of timing do you think is now more appropriate for that 10%, is it in the first half of 2017 or is it by the end of the year.
Bruce Van Saun: What we do in terms of forward forecasting is we just use the forward rate curve. So I think the Fed Funds in the rate curve we used when we put the plan together was about 175 basis points at the end of '16. Today is about 110 basis points when we had the original rate curves the Fed was moving as of June. So you get accumulative benefit from having already moved for a longer period of time. And now it looks like initial rate move would be kind of late in Q4. So if you just kind of run that forward you probably lose about half of the benefit versus the 300 million that we had initially assumed when we did the road to walk. We are not giving guidance on 2016 so with respect to your second question I think it's safe to say that we're just saying at this point it's hard to cover that much of an impact having said that the curve does move around and you could see a snap back and maybe the Fed if the economy is trucking along has the confidence to go a little faster or in bigger increments. But in any case we'll just monitor that and our policy is we'll give guidance in for the current year and January of that year and that’s when we'll tell you our views and we'll have I think are more fresh view on kind of level of interest rates in the potential impact from that.
John Pancari: Alright and my second question is just around expenses. Given your Top II initiatives that they both expenses as well as revenue, comes along this. But cab you just update us what your thoughts are around your long-term efficiency ratio where do you think Citizens ends up normalizing borrowing a major change in your rate outlook or anything? Where do you think it normalized in terms of [attrition]?
Bruce Van Saun: I think when we've shown our target of getting to the 10% we had a series of other numbers underneath that that are all consistent with getting to 10%. We had a 1% ROA and we had an efficiency ratio down in the low 60s, near 60%. So we are making progress here. So one of the good news again if you look at last several quarters we continue to generate positive operating leverage which is moving our efficiency ratio down. So this past quarter it went down by 95 basis points. So we need to continue that positive operating leverage. I think it will be an accelerant when rates start to go up that's almost free money, that's revenues that are going to flow through the bottom-line without needing to add any expenses. So that's an accelerant to positive operating leverage which will fly that efficiency ratio faster towards where it needs to get to.
Operator: And our next question will come from Kevin Barker with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Kevin Barker: On the student loan side, when you said you acquired a series of loans from SoFi which you also originated a bunch of your own refi loans during the quarter. Could you expand upon some of your comments that you made earlier about your overall strategy here on whether you are going to focus on refis as the primary originations or maybe look at acquiring additional loans from SoFi or other sources?
Bruce Van Saun: Well I'll start and then Brad or Eric you can chime in on this. But we feel good about how we are positioned in the student market. We have been achieving good organic growth both on, one our underlying bread and butter products which is the basic student loans we call it TrueFit and then our ed-refi product was fairly innovative but we were first to market with that in Q4 of last year and we've been originating somewhere between 300 million and 350 million in the last two quarters. So we are growing the portfolio well organically. But when we look out there we had opportunity to engage with SoFi who really I think targets the highest end of the market as super prime quality borrower and we think the paper that we can buy from them from a risk adjusted return standpoint is very attractive. So we didn’t need to do that because we are growing well organically but since we were originating auto paper from SCUSA get a comparison is that hey you know what the SoFi paper here is an emerging company that needs some financing partners and we could step in and we can do an initial transaction of 200 million and then we're committed to buy 100 million for each of the next three quarters. So that's what we've signed up to. At the same time, we've had some flexibility arrangements with SCUSA and so we are able to adjust that one down. So it's really that straight forward. We are not on the trial for lots of other flow agreements. What we've found in the past is in the low spread low rate environment, there's not enough for two people to eat at the same trough if you will and it's hard to have these deals actually work for two parties. But occasionally you can find that and you have to be opportunistic. The nice thing that we have is we have a lot of capital flexibility. We have an ability to use our balance sheet to grow loans and put good assets on the books and change that mix to the better. And so we will continue to seek opportunities to do that. I don’t know if Brad or Eric want to add?
Eric Aboaf: I am not sure there's lot, much to add. I think you said that well, I mean the core strategies organic origination we have been very pleased with the demand in the marketplace for the refi products. We have been, it's a product that hits the market well, this was an opportunistic opportunity and I think the core strategy is organic originations.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, good.
Kevin Barker: So when you think about your, the economics of a refi versus buying those loans, do you feel that you can achieve higher yields on your own refis versus what you are going to get buying or providing financing for so far other participants in the market?
Bruce Van Saun: It's about the same, so if you look at the net yield after the servicing cost in the SoFi arrangement it's about the same yield that we're making on the ed-fi originations when we load in our cost to originate those loans.
Eric Aboaf: But because we compare those yields and those returns across the bank right -- across all the consumer businesses and commercial businesses, if you look at the flow arrangements we are looking for an uptick something a little wider in spread and a little higher in return and won't do them just if they come at net average.
Kevin Barker: And then just quick question. We are seeing a lot of your competitors put on commercial loan swaps in order to extend duration given the outlook for rates right now. Have you considered doing that or is that something you would consider doing given the top-line headwinds you are facing right now?
Eric Aboaf: I think right now we like the position that we run where the asset sensitivity is primarily at the front end of the curve, right the very front end which is the one, two, three months, just because we have that option to not raise the deposit rate as the Fed starts to move. The data is particularly in our favor, I think we'd rather and we don't want to have a rate discussion here but typically rather liking for some terms structure whether it's five year, seven year, three year it's somewhat slightly higher rates than where we’re today and we’ll do that over time, we’ll do that as when we think are good level it's kind of hard to convince yourself that you want to long right now.
Bruce Van Saun: So our asset sensitivity one of the things Eric mentioned in the prepared remarks we kept for that 200 basis points gradual ramp in the Fed Funds rate our benefits over the first year have been fairly consistent at around 7%. And our view is that we’ll keep that so called spring coiled and benefit once rates starts move hopefully we’re getting closer to that day.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Matt O'Connor: Could you talk about the deposit pricing in your markets some competitors and some of your markets have started to increase ahead of Fed rate increases seems to give away inconsistence strategy out there in terms of some raising rates and some actually still cutting a little bit?
Eric Aboaf: Primarily what we see is we see some of the smaller community banks out there with some lead money market rates, some CD promotions I think they don't have the task that we do and a large banks do and so they are out there and sometimes when we need to do is match that prices to the depend market-by-market but you can imagine we’re trying to be quite disciplined in pricing and I think that we’re quite confident that the deposits pricing will lag for the first move or two as rate trend upwards.
Matt O'Connor: And just from a high level point of view can you remind us why you think your deposit base might be a little bit stickier in terms of mix or geography or size?
Eric Aboaf: It's really that I don't know if stickier I think it's about average data in the industry I think we quoted out 60% I think the range is 50% to 70%. I think we've confidence in that because we’re being a bit more conserved than we than what we saw in the last cycle on one hand and on the other we have real healthy mix of retail deposits, lot more retail than versus commercials than peers we have it in both city centers but also in more suburban areas and there we think we’ll do reasonably well.
Operator: And our next question will come from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Geoffrey Elliott: If I look at the revenue initiatives in particular maybe starting with pricing can you give us more concrete examples of where you think there is scope build your customers and ask for more than you have been historically where is the room there and what are the examples?
Bruce Van Saun: Let me give you one example, so in our cash management area we haven't raised prices in more than five years, we also have a series of waivers that are granted based on committed volumes and we haven't done a great job of compliance to make sure that the volumes are there, and so the waivers have continued in place. So what we've done is we've stepped back and we've looked at what’s going on in that space in terms of competitive pricing actions and in fact many of our peers if not most have continued to take annual price adjustments and they are also I think much sharper in staying on top of some of these waivers. So we developed I think market segmentation approach to categorize customers into different buckets and then go back and look for opportunities where we can tighten them and in some cases we basically say we’re going to raise your prices unless you start to go back to meet that committed volume but you are multibank and you have directed some of the volume away direct more back to us and then you can avoid the price increase and we win either way. So it's really opportunities like that, where I think we’re being just very disciplined very systematic in terms of our approach and we don't really see much of a risk of customer pushback because frankly they've been getting a good deal for too long. I don’t know Eric if you want to add to anything there?
Eric Aboaf: I will just add in particular, there are literally 600 different fees and services that you price and so many have done in the details and if you actually go through that you can benchmark that you can benchmark it against peers and you could benchmark it for clients size. And so there is a rich data set by which really determine what’s fair pricings and you can play that back to clients and just on a fair price and say look here is the range and here is where the averages are, and here is where you are and so we had some good early successes and that will be part of the we do on a disciplined way over time.
Geoffrey Elliott: And then to follow up same question around the 30 million to 40 million of revenue enhancements?
Bruce Van Saun: Sure Brad maybe you could briefly describe the distribution channel effectiveness which again is I think doing a better job of marshalling the resources we have in the branches and in the contact center to reach out to customers and engage with them whether it's physical meeting in the branches or phone conversation to some of our specialist to make sure we're doing all that we can to satisfy their needs.
Brad Conner: The key really on that particular initiative is customer behaviors have been changing over the last few years. And people are using alternatives in efforts for making deposits that are not coming in the branches as much we're using online mobile. And one of the things that we know your heights conversion rate in terms of sales conversions with customer if you can get face to face for your customers. So this initiative really is about having conversations with our customers inviting them into the branches and doing over a half conversation with them about what are their financial needs in the face to face way. So the initiative at this stage is just reaching out to our customers inviting them into the branches and then being able to measure and see the effect of that and we've had some very good early success with that, we're actually piloting in the couple of markets and we're seeing some good success. We're just learning as we go and expecting to continue to roll that out across the broader distribution network.
Bruce Van Saun: And that’s one that I would say again we've had some help from consultant and setting up the program and they've seen this approach work effectively at other banks. So combined with those insights and then our own piloting efforts we think that these revenues are pretty good estimate of what we should be able to achieve. And then on the return program I think I don't know if I should through that back to you again or just some that funds to commercial as well.
Brad Conner: It is, I can talk a little bit about the consumer side similar to this commercial. The real issue on retention is just making sure that every point of interaction with our customers we understand what the satisfiers and the dis-satisfiers are and breaking down those dis-satisfiers in a way that we include overall customer satisfaction or repaying our customer. So there is a very systematic approach to understanding when all those points of just said to satisfy our arm breaking them down. And we are seeing some good early signs if you look at particularly in checking we're seeing steady improvement quarter-on-quarter in terms of our retention rates of our customers and now we're taking that across all of our products.
Bruce Van Saun: And I think on commercial some of it is really surveilling the back log and looking for situations where we think the company might want to refinance. And we can go classically to refinance that company to make sure they stay with us. So there is a number of initiatives on the commercial side as well. But again similar to the first one I just mentioned we have had outside helping us design this program, we've seen the effectiveness that other institutions and so we have a reasonable degree of confidence that these are attainable numbers.
Operator: And our next question comes from Beck Nanja with JP Morgan.
Beck Nanja: Hi couple of questions Bruce and Eric. Firstly a quick one the SoFi loans that you purchased. What percentage of those are guaranteed in the apparent guarantee that you all normally get.
Eric Aboaf: Yes relatively small close signing we have about 45%.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes most of these have back since these folks are typically graduate programs. And they have hiring from a good job, there is less need for the guarantor than in a straight student loan. But having said that the FICO scores on this portfolio I think are 70 to 80 plus some of brought by 2. But it's quite attractive.
Beck Nanja: Bruce another question you'd mentioned earlier. Last year you were spending a lot on regulatory stuff as you were building out your systems and making sure you got through a CCAR which obviously worked. Are you seeing any opportunity reduce those up front expense or has that already begun?
Bruce Van Saun: I think we've got in our run rate what we need to continue to make progress on our regulatory agenda. We did last year to get caught up on some of the models to really do a good job with CCAR we kind of expense some of that and consider that more one-time in nature. But we mentioned that we needed to hire about 70 to 80 people. And by year-end we probably had 60 people in health and so by now that kind of the turn that middle of the year we've got all that in our run rate. So I don’t really see any opportunity for "piece dividend" anytime soon. I think there is still a sustainable amount of work to do if the regulators push the bar higher we need to keep pace. And so I'd say where I'd put it is that we've got the right amount of resources. We're working hard. We are making progress but it's still going to take us some time to get fully where we need to be.
Operator: And our next question will come from Matt Brown with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Matt Brown: Eric maybe a follow up for you in terms of a comment you made I think earlier today about the re-pricing initiatives on a commercial side. You said that your customers have gotten a good deal for too long. You haven’t really moved prices in that business across several products for about five years. Can you give us some color as to so what kind of customer attrition you are thinking about? I would think in this environment a bank coming to a customer looking for higher fees might think about what other options there may be and other banks are certainly beefing up their cash management businesses. So could you just provide a little color around how you are thinking about that?
Bruce Van Saun: Actually, it's Bruce, and I was one who made those remarks. But I think the amount of attrition that we built a little bit I think it's a low single-digit number into our overall estimates and that's been formed by again having some consultants working with us who have seen in other institutions. But if you look at the kind of uplift from the pricing up and very small subtraction for people frankly who aren’t paying us what they should for those services that see much, much more in favor up going ahead and taking those price actions. So I think I would categorize is it as a fairly miniscule level of attrition and really which is bringing the book back to kind of fair and average market pricing relative to peers.
Matt Brown: And Bruce just in terms of your outlook for rates. It sounds perhaps reading between the lines a little bit that you are maybe as a result may be a little more sanguine on the credit side of things. Is that a fair characterization?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I think what we've seen clearly over the last six to eight quarters is the flip side of having lower rates for longer is there's less stress on borrowers. So where ever you look in our book whether any of the consumer portfolios or any of the commercial portfolios, borrowers are doing well. And delinquent loans are very manageable and trending in the right direction. So I think hopefully we can continue to sustain that good credit performance. There is still probably a little normalization to go because we have on the commercial side some significant recoveries which once you book gets completely clean, there's not much more that you can recover. So we might see kind of little bit of increase and we're growing the portfolio which potentially creates little bit of increase. But in terms of, if you look at the charge-off rate as a percentage of loan, we have been hanging around kind of a low 30 and are through the cycle average is probably 45-ish and I think it's hard to see how you're going to approach that through the cycle average any time soon. Hopefully not same as last words, you can always get hit with a Scud missile. But we don’t see anything really in the book at this point that gives us any great concerns that we're going to go up meaningfully from where we are.
Operator: And there are no further questions in the queue. With that I will turn it over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, great. Well thanks everybody. I appreciate you dialing in today. Again we feel very good about the progress that we're making. We continue to execute against our key strategic priorities and look forward to the next time. Thanks and have a good day.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference call. Thanks for participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-04-22 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning everyone. And welcome to the Citizens Financial Group First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad and I’ll be your operator today's one hour call. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor: Thanks Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us today. We’ll kick things off this morning with a review of our first quarter results from our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and our newly elected CFO, Eric Aboaf. And then we’ll open the call up for questions. Also joining us on this call today is Brad Conner, our Head of Consumer Banking. I’d like to remind everyone that in addition to today’s press release, we’ve also provided a presentation and financial supplement. And these materials are available at investor.citizensbank.com. I need to remind you that during the call, we may make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplements. Additionally, any information about any non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, may also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. And with that I’ll hand it over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Well, thanks, Ellen. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off by offering a tip of the cap to John Fawcett who retires at the end of the month after serving us well for many years. And I welcome to Eric Aboaf, our new CFO who joined us for his first earnings call after being here for two and half weeks. Good news is Eric is quick study and I don't think will miss a beat. Turning to the quarter, we are off to a good start. I'd highlight the following. So we had solid financial results. We had a successful CCAR submission. We've recruited some terrific top team members. Eric is CFO and Don McCree, formerly of JPMorgan as our new Head of Commercial. We supported the successful follow on offering of RBS own stock, RBS' ownership is now down to 40.8%. And we are navigating through the challenges posed by the environment, and we are executing well against our strategic turnaround initiatives. So all in all as I said a good start. While we have a ways to go on a number of fronts to get the bank operating better, I am pleased overall with the steady and consistent progress that we are making. Our people are working hard, they are taking good care of our customers and they are executing well on our plans. I'll let Eric cover the financials in detail but I would offer first a few high level comments. First off, we are pleased that we delivered positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. This is the key to delivering improved results and we are committed to that. We are doing a good job of intelligently growing our balance sheet, though in a sustained low rate environment, it has been a challenge to keep our NIM broadly flat. In order to do that, we are very focused on adjusting our business mix and risk appetite modestly over time to raise our asset yields. In the first quarter, we saw a strong loan growth in commercial, in prime auto, in mortgages and in student lending particularly with our new refi product. We expect favorable trends here to continue over the course of the year. We've continued to benefit from favorable credit costs; we are doing a good job of shifting expenses to more productive uses, keeping overall levels broadly flat. Our investments in getting our fee based businesses to scale are advancing steadily. That said the benefits from these initiatives will play out gradually over time. Mortgage and cash management made good progress in the first quarter, while wealth had a little bit of tougher time. Lastly, I'd highlight that our balance sheet remains strong. We completed a $250 million buyback early in the second quarter and we have the capital and funding strategies in place to continue to grow loans at a good clip. With that let me turn it over to Eric.
Eric Aboaf: Thank you, Bruce. And good morning, everyone. I am excited to join Bruce and Citizens' team to help deliver on the strategy and plan that have been laid out over the last few months. Citizens is fortunate to operate in attractive and growing markets, where it can play an important role in serving both consumer and commercial client. Of course execution is what really matters in banking. And my focus will be to help drive the business initiatives that will help accomplish our goals. Throughout my remarks, I'll refer to the slides in our investor presentation that you can find on our website. To begin let me take you through our first quarter financial on Page 3, which demonstrate a solid start to 2015. Our first quarter GAAP net income of $209 million was up $12 million, or 6% from the fourth quarter. And up $43 million, or $26% from the first quarter of 2014. Diluted earnings per share were $0.38, up $0.02 from the fourth quarter and $0.08 higher than first quarter of 2014. This was driven by our effort to drive revenue growth while actively managing expenses as well as by the continued favorable credit environment. Page 4 summarizes restructuring and other special items for this quarter associated with productivity initiatives that we launched as well as the separation cost from RBS. We recorded $10 million pretax charges this quarter. And while this came in lower than we originally expected. That really just reflects a bit of shift in timing out of the first quarter and into the second quarter. We still expect the same level of restructuring expense for the first half at $45 million to $50 million in total. I'll focus the rest of my comments this morning on the adjusted results, which exclude the impact of these items. Turning to Page 5, we posted strong operating results with net income of $215 million and EPS of $0.39, both of which were stable link quarter and up 30% from the previous year. I am going to cover number of items highlighted on this slide throughout my presentation. But let me mention three important themes. First, revenue was relatively stable linked quarter in-spite of the expected seasonal weakness. And they were up year-over-year as we more than replaced the foregone revenues from the Chicago branch sold last year. Second, expenses were flattish demonstrating the company's discipline as we drove efficiency saving while also reinvesting in a business. And third, credit was benign and was further benefited by a large recovery this quarter. We continue to make strives towards our goal with 10% return on tangible common equity as we generated a strong return on an adjusted basis of 6.7%, which was up nicely from the prior year. On Slide 6, we dive a little deeper into the results for the quarter. On a headline basis, we grew net interest income $28 million, or 3% over the prior year. But that was muted by the Chicago divesture which impacted NII by $30 million. So an underlying basis we grew NII by 5% which was driven by attractive earnings asset growth with improving mix and our continued efforts to defend the margin despite the impact on a low rate environment on our asset sensitive balance sheet. Over the course of the year we also grew earnings asset by 8%, or nearly $9 billion driven by strong performance in both consumer and commercial as we continue to better leverage our capital position and reenergize organic growth. Compared to the fourth quarter, net interest income was down as the impact of two fewer days and slightly higher funding cost was partially offset by continued loan growth and reduction in paid fixed swap cost. Our net interest margin this quarter held up relatively well particularly given the decrease in rate from year end. We saw a three basis point debt to 2.77% in comparison to the fourth quarter on a reported basis. As John Fawcett mentioned on last quarter's call, the fourth quarter margin include a two basis points of non-recurring items. We held loan yields flat on a linked quarter basis through a combination of pricing and mix which I will describe in more detail later. We've defended the margin recently well given the rates are below where we had expected them to be. In our outlook statement, we indicate that this defending the NIM objective will continue until we see rates rise hopefully soon. We did see a full quarter impact to prior borrowing cost so we continue to diverse by our funding base across multiple deposit category than client segment and added a full quarter of senior debt cost given that our issuance came in late in December. We continue to maintain a highly asset sensitive interest rate position, the impact of an actual rise in rate is consistent in the last quarter at approximately 7% in the first year. This is driven primarily by the short end of the curve. During the quarter, we modestly extended the duration on the securities portfolio as we sold 15 year agency pass through to purchase 20 year agency similar to our late third quarter transaction. Even with this trade, the average duration of the securities portfolio fell to 3.1 year at the end of March, down from 3.5 years at year end given the prepayment impact of the drop in long rates. This duration expansion trade resulted in a modest gain of $8 million. On Slide 7, we will cover noninterest income which is an important area of focus for us as we are determined to shift our revenue profile over time. We generated $8 million increase linked quarter in noninterest income which was driven by gains related to the sales conforming mortgages and the previously mentioned repositioning of our securities portfolio, which offset the seasonally lower results and other service charges and fee categories. Year-over-year noninterest income decreased $11 million from the first quarter of 2014. So this reflected the drag from the Chicago divesture of $12 million in fee income. We also posted a $17 million reduction in securities gain, so on an underlying basis we generated noninterest income growth of approximately 5%, with particular momentum in mortgage banking service charges and capital market. Let me take you through each of the fee areas and describe what we are seeing on a year-over-year basis and how our initiatives are gaining some traction. The largest area is service charges where we are seeing approximately 2% year-over-year increase in charges and fees once we have done for the Chicago sale as our new checking product helps drive increase account and household growth. Card fees were relatively stable after accounting for Chicago but we are in the midst of some new card launches that we expect to help drive usage through a more attractive rewards program. Trust and investment services fees was somewhat muted but we continue to grow license bankers and add to our wealth advisors as part of our initiatives. On the mortgage banking front we generated $33 million revenue this quarter including a $10 million gain on sales of conforming mortgage which were previously held in portfolio. Outside of the gain, we were pleased with our mortgage results. We generated nearly 60% underlying increase in our mortgage banking revenue from first quarter of last year as origination volumes were up 87%. We also continue to gain market share. In capital markets, our continued efforts to build out the platform and enhance our loan syndication efforts are paying dividend as we grew fees in this category by 22%. And similarly FX and interest rate products which are often tied to new loans and loans syndications were 5% year-over-year. Moving on to noninterest expense on Slide 8. We are intensely focused on driving continued improvement in the efficiency of franchise. Our goal is to generate strong operating leverage by actively managing our expense base while continuing to invest across the franchise to enhance both our distribution and product capabilities, as well as fund our important regulatory work. Our adjusted operating expenses of $800 million this quarter reflected seasonally higher payroll taxes and increased incentive expense which drove salary and employee benefits up from the fourth quarter. We also saw a decline in outside services which were down from elevated fourth quarter level and included benefit from our efficiency initiatives. Year-over-year, adjusted expense was down slightly due to the $21 million Chicago impact, a variety of other expense initiatives that impacted multiple areas, occupancy, equipment, outside services and so forth, offset by active investment in a number of revenue focused initiatives. So net-net on a year-over-year basis we kept our operating expenses flat despite increased investments to grow our sales force and invest in products and technology. We achieve an adjusted efficiency ratio of 68% which was relatively stable with first quarter of 2014, but improved from the same period last year. Obviously, this will continue to be an area of focus for us. Now turning to the consolidated average balance sheet on Slide 9. Our total earnings assets of $121.3 billion were up 2% from last quarter and 8% from the first quarter of 2014, driven by the benefit of our growth initiatives. In consumer, we generated strong growth in auto, mortgage and student over the prior year. Commercial growth has been broad based with virtually all of our businesses posting solid growth. And the profit continues to grow with average deposits in the first quarter increasing by $800 million, or 1% over the fourth quarter. Over the last year organic deposit growth was worth approximately $9.3 billion or 11%, more than offsetting the impact of the Chicago divesture which was worth $5.2 billion. As one of my first areas of focus as CFO, I plan to dig into loan, deposits and the NIM equation. On first look, we are managing this well but I want to say we can do even better. On Page 10, compared to the previous quarter, consumer banking loan increased nearly $900 million, or 2% as we continue to ramp our own organic origination in auto, mortgage and student. The growth in mortgage is net of the conforming portfolio sale which I mentioned earlier. We also continue to focus on improving the underlying mix of the consumer portfolio in order to boost yields and offset the impact of low rate. This quarter we continued to be satisfied with the good growth in our auto business as we've been able to drive both balance and yield upward in our organic book. As a result, we've decided to target SCUSA volume at about $1.5 billion for 2015. We believe that strong demand for our student loan refinance product and our own auto origination will offset the lower purchases. We also made a tuck-in student loan portfolio acquisition in Q1 for the effective yield and return characteristic. On Slide 11, commercial loan increased by $1.3 billion, or 3% sequentially on strength in industry vertical, middle market, mid corporate and commercial real estate not withstanding continued aggressive competition. Yield cut down a few bits and is obviously an area where we are trying to balance pricing fees and returns. Slide 12 focuses on the liability side of the balance sheet and our funding cost. We grew the combination of checking, savings and money market balances which comprise the bottom two categories by approximately 10% this year or $5.5 billion despite the impact of the Chicago divesture. We supplemented this growth with some term deposits as well as a mix of FHLB and senior debt to further diversify our funding sources. On Slide 13, you can see that our credit quality continues to be strong with net charge-off at $4 million. Our provision expense came in lower this quarter at $58 million. This includes $15 million recovery from a single large commercial real estate credit. But even outside that we continue to see relatively lower levels of gross charge-offs across rest of the book despite continued loan growth. We also continue to benefit from the run-off in the non-core book. This was down nearly$200 million in the quarter to a balance of $1.9 billion. Turning to Slide 14, our capital position remains robust. This quarter we began reporting on our Basel III basis this part of the new regulatory capital rules for bank our size with the CET1 ratio of 12.2% which is well above our regional peers. We are above our LCR requirement and our LDR have been relatively consistent. Post the quarter end in early April, we executed a $250 million preferred issuance and repurchase shares from RBS which on a pro forma basis would impact our CET1 ratio by 23 bip. On Slide 15, we summarize many of our accomplishments and reemphasize our objective of becoming a top performing regional bank. On Slide 16, we played out the key initiatives in our turnaround plan and have progressed during the quarter. And what the outlook holds for the remainder of 2015. We feel the program remains broadly on track. Heightened watch areas continued to be the initiatives where we are hiring in significant numbers or growing market share. We will continue to monitor and report on this for you and we can obviously discuss the more in detail during the Q&A. On Page 17, we summarize some of our key financial target and our progress year-over-year. Our end 2016 target are predicated on a rising rate. That said we continue to develop additional revenue and expense initiatives to help offset any lag that may occur. We may have more color on this by next quarter's call. Now turning to Slide 20, let me summarize some of what you can expect next quarter. But all in the context for the full year outlook that we previously provided. We expect to have linked quarter loan growth that is consistent with the prior two quarters. So 1.5% to 2% with a net interest margin that remains relatively stable from this quarter, so we expect to see continued pressure from low rate, visible needs to defend against. We would expect to generate positive operating leverage of a seasonally weak first quarter thereby improving our efficiency ratio. We expect credit to continue to be strong overall but don't expect to see the same level of commercial recovery that we saw this quarter. So provision expense should return to prior quarter level which is roughly a quarter of low end of our annual guidance range. We are nearing completion of our restructuring and separation activities. So in the second quarter we plan to record $35 million to $40 million in restructuring expense as we do things like rebrand the charter one franchise. And finally we expect that our CET1 ratio will remain relatively unchanged on a pro forma level of around 12% and we will hold the LDR at around 98% to 99%. So with that let me turn it back over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, Eric. So in short a solid start to the year. With that Brad, why don't we open it up for some Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question on line will come from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ken Zerbe: Hi, thank you. I guess first question just in terms of student lending. We've seen a number of banks exit this business due to various reasons. And I know you guys are aggressively pushing into student lending. What is the difference? What makes you guys comfortable with the quality of student lending versus presumably the reason why people, other banks are trying to get out of the business. Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Well, maybe I'll start and then Brad you can amplify my comments. But fundamentally you have to understand the difference in the private market and overall government backed market. And so a lot of the noise about whether this is a poorly underwritten credit really relates to the government side. The private side has been I think had good risk adjusted return characteristics. For some of the big players people like Chase it just may not be a big enough pond to play in since the government has 93% of the market and the private side only had 7%. For someone like our self the fact that some of the big folks are exiting creates more running room for us. I think we have very good technology. We have a good footprint with good university system in our footprint. We've been very innovative in terms of designing products that really work for customers and benefit customers. Our Ad refi loan is the latest example of that where a student borrower can refinance both government and private loan kind of unique product offering out there in the market place which is taking the market by storm. So when we look at the credit quality, the yield we get related to the risk we are taking, we like it a lot. It also potentially brings in fresh customers to us here demographic is aging that if you can get someone who has now a job and has a good credit score and can consolidate their debt and save themselves money on average our loan save about $150 a month. So the people who refinance that person can grow with us and bring over their checking accounts and as they go through their life phases, they can borrow money on a mortgage and accumulate assets and we can manage their wealth as it grow. So all-in-all we think it fits our strategy quite well. Why don't I turn it over to Brad?
Brad Conner: Yes. Bruce, I think you said it extremely well. And the only thing I would probably add is there is -- we've seen a big untapped need in the market place. So you talked about it I think our refinance product really hits the need in the market place as a lot of other folks have exited. That need was out there and we don't really think like a traditional student loan product. These are borrowers who are out of school. They are in their early 30s. The profile of the customer that we are getting in sort of the 785 FICO score, someone in their early 30. They have established themselves so they are really great customer for the bank. And just very few people playing in the space, very attractive customers, and very attractive returns. So just a good market place opportunity.
Ken Zerbe: Okay. Now that's great and helpful. Second question just on expenses. Looks like very well controlled expenses versus our expectations. When we look at $800 million extra restructuring, is that -- because presumably I am trying to think how sustainable that Bruce because presumably you are going to have less on the salary side just going for -- seasonality, but do you expect to rebound some of the other line items or is $800 million minus the seasonality is kind of good starting point for second quarter.
Bruce Van Saun: Well, I think what you will ultimately see is -- there is a benefit obviously from the seasonality. But then we are also making offensive investments in some of the areas we are trying to build origination capability. So we are still adding commercial lenders, we are still adding mortgage loan officers, wealth advisors and so our broad guidance for the year was that we are going to try to keep expenses as close to flat as possible. We are trying to have that as a quarterly and annual objective. And that's what we are working hard to accomplish. So I like to think of it is study that zero base take out constantly look for ways to take out expenses that you are not making a good return on those expense dollars. And use that to in turn fund the things that are going to allow you to filled up to your scale in the fee businesses and play offense.
Operator: And our next question will come from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Matt Burnell: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Bruce, could you give just a little more color on sort of your -- the outlook slide that you provided. I guess specifically in terms of maybe the comments related to wealth management where you are seeing challenges there. You mentioned in the slide that hiring maybe is a little bit slower than you had originally thought. And I guess I am also curious about your middle market outlook as well. You mentioned that business is exceptionally competitive. We've heard that from other banks. Is there anyway that you guys can sort of breakthrough that competitive environment or is it just sort of hand-to-hand combat?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, sure. Both good areas to focus on. I would guess firstly on wealth and Brad can augment my comments again. But we have effectively a pyramid distribution strategy to match the pyramid of consumers that we have in the bank. So we have tier called licensed bankers kind of at the bottom that handles the mass. Then we have another tier called premier bankers who have full licensing to sell multiple products. Then we have tier dedicated financial consultants who simply sell the wealth products with full licensing and then we have the very tipi top of the pyramid is our private banking office. And in three of those tiers we I think made decent progress in the first quarter. So we hired up, we probably grew license bankers about 10%, we grew premier bankers around 10% and we grew private banking team at tipi top from 9 to 12. So we are making some traction. The place that we really did not make traction at all in Q1 was financial consultant. So we had roughly 300 financial consultants and we ended with roughly 300 consultants at the end of the period. So it is kind of quarter where you win some you lose some. And that's I think just a sign that this is attractive area for all banks and market participants. It is not just banks. It is insurance company, it is independent broker dealers and so actually pulling those people in can be tough. We've had good success on year-over-year basis I think we are up 10% in the FCs account but I would just flag that this quarter, it seems like competitive conditions have tightened a bit at that layer of the pyramid. So we are still -- I think our strategy make sense. I think the lead generation coming from the branches is good and improving. So we still have good hopes and ambition for that business. But you are not always going to fire and go four for all on four cylinders. Do you want to add anything, Brad?
Brad Conner: Yes, Bruce. Another well said, another job well said. The only thing I would add is so part of that question was so how do you breakthrough. It has been hand-to-hand combat with the financial consultants and as you said we didn't really make a lot of progress. But the one opportunity for us to breakthrough is for us the license banker program is really a brand new program. So we are less than a year at the end of licensed banker program. And while we had difficult time getting net growth out of the financial consultants just from pointing from the outside, the view that license banker program can become a very attractive feeder program for our financial consultant as it gets more seasoned. So I think that is the opportunity going forward is that we transition --
Bruce Van Saun: You can grow from within instead of pulling in
Brad Conner: Which we have in our hand the opportunity until we build the license banker program. So I think that's the one.
Bruce Van Saun: And I just on add the license banker program we are probably somewhere around 370 today trying to get to 600. So we are maybe 65% of the way through getting that up to scale. Second point on the middle market. That is a very attractive area for commercial banks to play in. Often you can really -- it is a small -- either small syndicate or you are the sole banking relationship and so you get a fair amount of cross sale that goes with those relationships. And so what we've tried to do is focus more on account acquisition there is a huge number of middle market companies in our footprint. And I think we probably, we've been building up coverage offices, we haven't had pure kind of what we call BDO a real sales oriented calling program. And so we are putting that in place. We are hiring up about 15 people to actually pursue more new account acquisition. And then we are also making sure we are running surveillance on existing back book customers where they might have a high interest rate, might be susceptible to refinancing with us or away from us and I am trying to make sure that we have the back door closed as well. We are seeing some signs of progress on both elements of that. I think the overall originations were up in Q1. The pipeline looks good for Q2. So again I think we are shading that one Amber just because under kind of the rules of the road for kind of this color coding. If we are trying to gain market share in an area that's one that you just have to monitor more carefully but I am actually pleased with some of the steps that we've taken to combat some of the competitive forces and we are starting to show progress from those steps.
Matt Burnell: That's great color. Thank you very much and then just quickie for Eric. Eric you mentioned higher yield in both auto and student. How much of the higher yield was due to I guess an acquisition or maybe multiple portfolio acquisitions you have made in the first quarter, in those businesses? What can we expect for those yields going forward?
Eric Aboaf: Matt, good question. What is attractive about this franchise from my perspective is we have a very effective ability to drive origination through our organic channels like as you kind of highlight whether it is auto, whether student, and it gives us an ability to actually drive those a little more quickly and actually offset some of the natural compression that we get from some of the longer duration product like mortgages which invariably have yield compression. So when we are seeing is really a mix effect here that is boosting the yield. We've got mortgage yields in the portfolio roughly down about 20 basis points year-over-year for example. And we have auto on the other hand up about 30 basis points. We have student up a good bit as well. And so what we are seeing is ability to kind of average up the yield and kind of defends the NIM as we have described.
Bruce Van Saun: Brad, you want to add that I mean.
Brad Conner: Yes. I have little bit to add. And really most of the improvement in NIM is coming for the organic origination. So we have talked about this quite a bit in auto. We've gone to a more main stream prime credit spectrum as opposed to just link and super prime and what that's done is driven our origination yields are up significantly over the organic portfolio. And in student what happen is as we originate more organic production like the education refinance product, our historic student loan portfolio had some felt loan and things like that and that help to drive it up.
Bruce Van Saun: And the other thing Brad too, in auto we've now got much more sophisticated platform with many more pricing sale. I think we've gone from 160,000 or something like ridiculous multiple so we are able to actually price very precisely for the risk that we are taking and get little more yield out of that. So, Matt, the short answer to that really organic. We had SCUSA as a kind of jump start to get fastens in the prime but our organic book is migrating very quickly to the places we want to see it.
Eric Aboaf: Matt, it is Eric. The other thing that we are -- we become more intense on doing is actually tracking the organic and the acquisition mix of growth right. Because it is important that we can drive that organically our own tool processes, sales force and so forth and so if you kind of step back and look at the mix, the mix of organic growth this quarter, this quarter it was about 60:40 right. That's offer good bid from where it might have been two, three, four quarters ago. And we kind of like that mix because it gives us a little more control on the credit, a little more control yield. And I think is a kind of more reliable engine of growth for us.
Operator: And our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was wondering if you can elaborate on in terms of the comments of working on some additional revenue and expense efforts to help offset the low rate environment. I have realized you just told us that you will give us more details in 2Q but any just big picture or comments that you can elaborate on that?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, sure. So big picture, those initiatives I would say fall into three buckets. There is some additional expense initiative that we can take more around kind of the organizational design. There are some pricing initiatives in areas where we have complex price structure for example like cash management. And then there are some overall revenue initiatives that really focus on maximizing our distribution channels and retention of our best customers. Whereas our first broad program, we call that Top 1 was a number of -- a vast number of relatively modest initiatives with a few big ones thrown in. The Top 2 if we are going to call this, this new initiative Top 2 is just kind of up to maybe a dozen larger initiatives that are more complex and take more time to basically figure out and design and then project manage. We part some of these initiatives when we went through the first program just to get the first program off the ground and start to get the benefits flowing in. And so now we've gone back and we are doing the work to develop these other ideas. And so there are fewer but bigger impact ideas. For example on the expense side of equation, we are looking at what we are calling ops transformation which is kind of looking at the Ryman reasons of how we are organized to see if we can gain some efficiencies. We also think there is more opportunity in kind of vendor consolidation and vendor management which was part of Top 1 but I think there is more bites to the apple on that one. On the revenue side, I mentioned that looking at how to keep your best customers in the bank and then also how to cross sell better using all your channels fully. We've engaged some consultants who have been in another shops in our peers and had some success and I think there is no reason why some of those programs can't be very effective here as well. So that would be some of the color, Matt. But as it was on the road show when people wish I had all the answers and all the details. I didn't -- I think we are making progress and getting a clear picture on these things. But we don't really have the full details to go into today.
Matt O'Connor: And then the comment about the balance sheet being managed well on loans, NIM and deposits. But there might be more to do. Does that fall into one of these three buckets or is that an additional call it side project?
Bruce Van Saun: I think that just be a good management. I think one of the things that having Eric here now given his background as Global Treasurer of Citi, he certainly understands balance sheet quite well. And so having a fresh set of eyes is to how we are going about our deposit raising strategies, how are we pricing our assets and looking at the risk appetite in a business mix, is there more that we can do kind of squeeze out NIM improvements. I think that's good first thing for Eric to sink his teeth into.
Matt O'Connor: Okay. That something that we can look for more detail in 2Q as well.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Probably, yes.
Operator: And our next question will come from Beck Nanja [ph] JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Beck Nanja: Hi. Couple of questions, Bruce and Eric. If you look at your -- on the consumer side, you have been -- Bruce, you were talking about turning that around. We've seen some consumer growth there in the deposit side. Can you elaborate on which markets you are seeing more success?
Bruce Van Saun: Geographically or --
Beck Nanja: Yes, geographically, yes.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Look I think we are pretty strong, pretty evenly distributed in terms of our success. I would say in the first quarter the North East was probably hit the hardest with some of the weather concerns. I don't want to use the weather as an excuse but I think factoring into that seasonality we probably lost two or three productive days in the branches and kind of the New England region. And not so much in the Mid Atlantic and in the Mid West. New England was hit pretty hard but we do a very comprehensive evaluation of the entire, all the branches in the system and looking at in the footprint, and we force rank and see how things are doing and I think we have -- there is no kind of big variances from the mean. I think the New England and Mid Atlantic and the kind of upper Mid West regions that we have are all kind of pretty tightly punched. I don't know Brad if you want to add anything.
Brad Conner: No. You said exactly right, Bruce. I mean little bit of slowness in New England from the weather but other than that no real trends geographically that stand now, yes.
Beck Nanja: And Bruce shifting to commercial deposits. They were down a little bit this quarter. You had shown some nice progress last quarter. Can you just comment on what's going on there?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. And Eric you can add to this. But I think that's just really seasonality. So we brought in some deposits at year end and some of that went out there is tax payments, and if you look at kind of the period end we saw that pickup again by the end of March. So that will move a round a little bit. But I feel very confident that we are developing good strategies to grow the commercial deposits. If you look at our LDR and the commercial side, we are probably up in the mid 180s which one we look at our peers they are probably 140 to 160. I think partly that's just result of -- we didn't need the funding because we were shrinking the balance sheet for years. And so we had, I like to say go back in the gym and get some muscle back in terms of having good deposit raising strategies and a good focus and a good game plan to do that. And you can see that year-over-year growth in commercials been extremely good. So we brought the LDR and this is a one point, it was like 230, so we are down to the mid 180s and I think we can keep growing and raising deposit cost effectively, building up the cash management business is a key element of that. We brought in talent; we spent a lot of money on technology. I think we are under punching our weight in terms of market share there. So that's a critical plank in the overall program. Eric, do you want to add to that?
Eric Aboaf: Yes. I think the commercial deposit opportunity is one that continues to be significant for us right. We are up in deposit from the commercial side 26% year-over-year largely because we never really try to grow deposit there. Right the bank, they thought they have been deposit on the consumer side. We made commercial loans that actually in a way create quite a bit opportunity. A lot of which you saw over the last year. And what we continue to do is now go down the next level of detail which is what industry segment in which geographies or either a little more credit needy and so we can try middle market or which of them are more cash rich or which of them have both, right. And that's the kind of second and third level analytic that we can put to it. I think the good news is we have a very strong sales force and banker force out there who knows their customers extremely well. And we've been able to channel that energy and one of the things I will be doing more of it just focusing which segment, which sub segment which industry verticals and continue to find more opportunities out there.
Beck Nanja: One last thing if I may, completely different topic. Restructuring charges. You all said pushed out a little more to the second quarter. Should that mean we see -- those that will be driven by -- for the head count -- should that mean we see little bigger pick up in cost savings in Q2 and later.
Bruce Van Saun: Well, some of the costs that are coming in Q2 are really around rebranding. Last stages of separation cost from RBS, the Charter One science coming down and the Citizens unified brand around Citizens. So I don't think there is any direct link to the expense forecast although what I would say is that we are working on the forward view of trying to keep expenses as slight as possible. So there is a constant stream of initiatives and efficiency initiatives that's taking place. And then to Ken's first question, there is reinvestment going back in the growth areas. So I think we are -- we still have a very positive view towards expense management, the rest of this year and the one wild card I think that are some of those extra levers that we talked about. If we can get ops transformation geared up that could create some additional benefits to the equation as well as the vendor initiatives that we are taking. So stay tuned.
Operator: And our next question will come from Scott Cyphers from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead
Scott Cyphers: Good morning, everybody. Bruce, I was wondering if you could spend just a moment talking about kind of the differentiation between growth that's coming from just the underlying organic growth within the franchise and the internal building you guys have done versus the loan you are purchasing. I only ask just because one of the -- I guess one of the criticism I hear and you guys periodically how much of the growth comes from purchase loan but if the underlying growth is stronger, does that do anything to you need or reliance on purchased growth as you got over the next year or so?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I mean that's kind of legend out there. I don't quite understand it because from the get go when we laid our plan we said that we would use loan purchases kind of in the beginning of our turnaround plan to use capacity we had on our balance sheet until we were able to build up our own capabilities. In which case we would get the origination to the levels that made sense within our strategy. And so if you look at I think where we were last year to where we are now in the current quarter, we had probably three quarters of the overall and slightly more, exactly close to the 80% of our loan growth was organic. And I think it was 22% or 23% was purchase. So the purchases that we are doing now really the SCUSA agreement are one. We purchased $2 billion in auto last year. We said in the prepared remarks that we are going to target that at $1.5 billion this year because we are seeing I think really good growth in organic auto as dealers increasingly accept us to handle the full credit spectrum including prime customer. So SCUSA was always viewed as a bridge until we were in that position. And so we are seeing the fruits of our investment there. And then also in student, we are a bit surprised to be upside about the take up on this refi product. And so we have I think we outperformed our expectations in terms of student growth as well. And occasionally there will be some portfolios that we can buy like we did a tuck-in one in Q1. But even with that tuck-in we still were predominantly organic. And I think over time you will see as we move into 2016. There is an open question as to how much SCUSA will need. But I don't really us needing to do much anywhere else.
Eric Aboaf: And Scott, Eric. Just to put that in context right. So we are at 75% or 80% organic today right quarter-over-quarter if you go a year ago it would have been 60:40, right, so we are kind of continuing move in that direction and that's part of our objective.
Scott Cyphers: Okay, that's perfect. I appreciate that. And again switch gear just for a second, I don't want to jumping on too much on the sort of your cost initiatives or anything you might have more detail on later but Bruce can you just talk for a second about the balance between funding say additional cost savings versus kind of hitting the target that you got for the most visible of the 10% return on tangible comment, , I think I just mathematically there are ways you could cut costs pretty quickly and still be comfortable to get towards your target but if it was more measured based and like you kind of put things at risk. How do you sort of way that balances as you look at things?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, I think in explaining our plan one of the things that we did initially was we benched ourselves in terms of measures to assets to scale. So if you look at our expense load to deposits or to assets, we are actually quite good relative to peers. And I think we are at the bottom at the first quartile. And if you look at revenue productivity relative on the same measure, we got revenue also. So we were making enough income of the balance sheet. Our fee businesses were not at scale. So hypothesis coming in when I came across was we think we have the right level of expenses but we probably aren't spending those expenses where we need to. So let's go attack that. That was the basis for the $200 million. And then let's self fund the investments that we need to get more originators so we can drive more asset growth. And fee businesses is like mortgage, like wealth, like capital markets, up to a scale level so that we could bring the cash register on fee opportunities that go with the size of our loan book and a size of our branch infrastructure et cetera. So that's the real objective here is to get the revenues growing at a faster clip to grow into the potential of the franchise while keeping expenses very muted. I don't think there is a different strategy; alternate of saying could you just start whacking the expense base down. And that's a way to propel yourself to the 10%. I don't think there is enough in that to actually do it. And even if you could do it, it wouldn't put in a sustainable position where you really maximizing the benefit of the franchise. So that's kind of how we set it up. And I still think that holds. Having said that we will be very vigilant and constantly looking for ways of continuous improvement. How can we be more effective and how we serve our customers and more efficient and how we do that at the same time. And that's the mindset that we are trying to instill within the company.
Operator: And our next question will come from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous. Please go ahead.
Geoffrey Elliott: Hello there. And a couple of questions on capital. Firstly on just to clarify on the share repurchase that you announced after CCAR. You told us about the $500 million through the end of 2015. But you didn't say anything about the first two quarters of next year which fall into the same CCAR horizon. So can you -- let us know if there is a possibility of repurchasing more shares. I know if you have to wait until --
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. No. We have been approved for was $500 million and what we have said is that we want to do that front loaded. So we did as part as front loaded just you can't buying back on April 1, the first $250 million. And I think in the Q3, we are planning to do kind of the next $250 million very early in July. That basically leaves us no dry powder until the next CCAR cycle. And so we have -- our dividend in place, we have asset growth in place but over this period that we were approved to do the $500 million, we will do that $500 million quickly.
Geoffrey Elliott: And then following up on that you mentioned in the presentation the time of the IPO $500 million to buyback in 2015, $250 million in 2016. Given that the capital ratios look pretty strong in the stress scenario of CCAR and that you now being through that exercise successfully. I mean is there any possibility of getting more aggressive on than the $250 million in 2016.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I guess what I would say to that is the last $250 million was really part of what we refer to as our conversion transaction. So when originally we had converted all of the capital securities to equity and now we are trying to put the leverage back in the capital structure. And the number we were targeting was $2.75 billion. With this $500 million that just been approved we've had -- that will be $2.5 billion. So that leaves $250 million. We didn't say that was all we would do. That was just kind of the tail of the overall transaction for the conversion transactions. We've targeted an 11% set one ratio by the end of 2016. And we will just have to see kind of what kind of asset growth opportunities we have. We will have to see is 11% still an appropriate number. Is there an opportunity to basically move that down if our peers are lower than that number which they are today? So there are a number of things that would come into play when we consider the next CCAR submission in terms of what we want to do in total. So I would just simply say that the $250 million is kind of lock because it completes the program. And then what else we do is depended on the future circumstances.
Operator: And our next question in queue comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Gerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Bruce, I jumped on late so I apologize if you have addressed this but in the success that you are having in the student loan program, is it more coming from that new product for the student loans for parents or is it more coming directly from the student loans to the student?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, I would say the parent launch just was very recent so there is really nothing to reflect at this point. It is the refi product has been very, very strong. So I think we are first to market on that product. And it has been take --had a very good market reception. And then there is a traditional what we call our true fit product which was the student loan for students who are going to college. And that is a seasonal product that tends to be taken down not in the first quarter. So when you look at the mix of what happened in the first quarter is really the lift in this refi product is providing the impetus. And if you then forecast out Q2 would be similar. We have a very big pipeline on that refi product as we look into Q2.
Brad Conner: And then Q3 will be a little more balanced with the true-fit because that will be the seasonal piece.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Exactly right.
Gerard Cassidy: Okay. And on the refi product, what kind of yield are you earning from the refi student loan product?
Brad Conner: Right now the yields are in the mid five.
Gerard Cassidy: Great. And in terms of 10 year fixed or --
Brad Conner: Yes. We actually offer multiple terms and it is about 60% fixed, 40% in variable but we do offer various terms on the product and --
Bruce Van Saun: And the FICO scores are quite high. They are over 780-ish [ph], correct. Very, very high quality.
Gerard Cassidy: Yes, no. I agree the student loans are for banks, it is totally different than the government of course. Moving over the automobile. Obviously, you guys have had some real good growth here as well. What the $13.2 billion of outstanding I think end of March, what percentage would you define as sub prime or lower FICO score loans?
Bruce Van Saun: Very, very little. I mean I would say none. I don't know if you could say anything on but technically none but it is certainly less than 3% or something. We are not intending to play in sub prime. We historically played in super prime. We are migrating into prime but that's still very good credit quality paper.
Gerard Cassidy: Sure. And the paper they are buying for SCUSA is prime; they are not sub prime paper?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. The average FICO score and that's probably 710, 715, somewhere in that ballpark.
Gerard Cassidy: Great. And just finally you mentioned about growing your license bankers to 600 in total. I think you are in the low 300 today. What kind of timeframe do you have to get there?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, we are actually closer to 360, 370 but we intend to get there by the end of 2016. So all the goal post in terms of getting mortgage loan officers from 350 to 700, licensed bankers from 300 to 600. Those are all targeted to deliver by the end of 2016.
Gerard Cassidy: And I guess just one follow up on that. When you are looking for the -- it sound so much licensed bankers but the wealth management area, you mentioned it is a challenge to try to find people. What is it in turn, is it a compensation challenge or is it just more people don't want to leave the established company they are with. What are you finding to be the biggest challenge to bring people in?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I think again going -- I don't know if you heard me talk about the tier strategies but it is probably easier at the lower tier because you are presenting opportunities and training for people in many cases. When you get into the FCs, a lot of those people have a comfort zone kind of where they are. And we don't want just compete on price the way some of the independent broker dealers do. So someone who moves has to move their clients with them and there will be some leakage from that. And they have to weigh that versus if they come to your branches how good is the lead generation and the opportunity to build their book with us. And so that's the calibration that goes through when people decide whether they are going to move or not.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Eaves with UBS.
David Eaves: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe following up on the question here on the advisors. Can you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of competition and availability for the mortgage officers?
Bruce Van Saun: Sure, Brad, you want to take that?
Brad Conner: Yes. I would say we've had good success hiring and you have seen your net -- we've been net growing and we had good success hiring, I would say one of the things that we-- that has happened as we have seen a little bit higher attrition rate of our loan officers than we had expected. But overall we are having good success hiring. It is competitive market place out there; application volume has been really strong for the first quarter. So we've got nice pipeline building. And again it is like lot of the other sales job family, it is just lot of competition in the market place for good talented people.
Bruce Van Saun: I think what we are successful in bringing in people overall given that we are playing offence, so we try to build the business. We have I think an ability to warehouse, we are taking jumbo mortgages on to our books. We have a fairly broad product capability, so we can do the things that folks find attractive to serve customers well. And so and we've attracted some strong sales leadership into the house. So I think those things are going well for us. And we just have to get better as Brad said in making sure that when people come they can get their production right up to the levels and they can be effective on platform and we can keep him here. So we had a little issue with attrition but I think overall we are heading in the right direction. We are kind of getting close to the kind of 450 mark and we started at 350. And we are on our way to 700. We got-- we did 42 in Q4, 29 this quarter. You kind of -- if you math outwear we need to be, we got be kind of reproducing these quarters on a consistent basis. We got be putting in 35 to 40 people per quarter for the next seven quarters to get that 700 mark.
David Eaves: Great. And then maybe if you could just touch a little bit on the -- what you are kind of saying in the commercial real estate area? It is obviously an area where he had a lot of other folks seeing really intense competition on pricing terms and do you guys have pretty good growth there. So I was just curious what you guys are seeing there?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. I think it is always fairly competitive market. We hadn't played in a while as part of our RBS and so we've just kind of put some oxygen back in the system with some higher limits and some real targeted strategies where we wanted to grow. And I think we focused more on the high end project so institutional investors who are well known, that's one area the high end office market. We've also done a good job looking after REIT and so that may not be the highest yielding portfolio but the credit quality is very good. And the cross sale for other products and services is high. And I think we have to also look at where other opportunities to play where we can pick up a better yield because we simply stay fully at that end of the market, we won't make the kind of overall yield on our commercial real estate. That something that we are looking at gradually building that up and building up a little bucket of higher yielding stuff that we still think is very safe from a credit standpoint. So that's what we are focused on.
Operator: And move to on Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Ken Usdin: Hi, good morning. Just two quick ones. First of all, prior comments on future uses of capital and your comments also about now the organic loan growth kind of taking over for the initial acquired. I am just wondering where portfolio acquisition akin to the one you did in the fourth quarter of the energy book, would be also part of that future capital consideration.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes. Ken, that was really a one off that energy book was just a clean up of RBS and Citizens separating and I think that activity should have always been in Citizens, a reserve based lending business is more of bank business and investment bank business. But RBS was there first and so as they reconsider their strategy and now they are focused, they said look this you always wanted this, this should your so we move that across. I don't really think we will do any loan acquisitions on the commercial side because we've been growing that 8% to 10% organically for a consistent period of time, four, five years. And we are on that trajectory again this year. So I wouldn't see it there. On the consumer side, we've used whole loan purchases last year before we were able to start building up our mortgage loan officers. We've also use the SCUSA as a bridge till we build up our own bigger auto capabilities in prime. And occasionally we will see a student book that we like. We bought I think $50 million one in last year. We maybe bought a $201 million in this first quarter but we also sold some we try to get rid some of the FELP exposure that we have. So net-net I think we are adding -- we haven't added any real loans net in student from a purchase standpoint. So we will be opportunistic. I think one of the things we found in a low spread environment is when we enter into these flow agreement for people who want to use a balance sheet, there is not enough vig in it to pay the servicing fees away and then also for us to make a good return. So I think again we are migrating towards having the capabilities to pro loans at the pace we want organically.
Ken Usdin: Understood. And my second one just on consumer service charges. Proportion of revenue is relatively high for you guys versus others. I am just wondering if there is anything we need to be considering as far as the future either on ordering or CAPB et cetera as far as growth potential or future drags in that part of business? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: I think we've made all of the policy changes that put a square on the side of the regulators. And good business practice. We've also made certain adjustments to kind of over drafting for small items under $5 that we don't think it is right that our customer should pay overdraft fee on that. So all of those changes are in the run rate. So the only thing that really in the comps you looked that on service charges in the first quarter last year we had Chicago in the number. So it doesn't look like we grown but we actually have grown the service charges 2% on an underlying basis. And then in Q4 going to Q1, you just have seasonality and we would expect to see that recover in Q2 quite nicely.
Operator: And due to time constraint, we will turn the call back over to Van Saun at this time.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Well, thanks everybody for dialing in today. Again, I think we are continuing to execute well against all of our initiatives and feel that we delivered another solid quarter and we look forward to keeping you apprised of our progress. Thank you and have a good day.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this conference will made available for replay after 11 O'clock today and running till Friday, May 22 at midnight.

===== 2014 Q4  (2015-01-26 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brad and I’ll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations. Ellen, you may begin.
Ellen Taylor: Thanks Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us today on Citizens’ earnings call. We’ll start with our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and CFO, John Fawcett reviewing our fourth quarter and full year results and then we’ll open the call up for questions. Joining us as well is Head of Consumer Banking, Brad Conner. I’d like to remind everyone that in addition to today’s press release, we’ve also provided presentation and financial supplement. All three are available on our Investor Relations Web site on citizensbank.com. During the call, we may make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K files containing our earnings release and quarterly supplements. Additionally, any information about any non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, may also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our Web site. And with no further ado, I’ll turn it over to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay, well thanks Ellen and good morning, everyone. Thanks for dialing-in today. Let me start-off with an overview of 2014 and then I’ll proceed to talk about the fourth quarter. But I’d say overall, we’re very pleased with what we achieved over the past year. Let me just touch on four areas. First is our financial progress, which is very pronounced. Our adjusted ROTCE for the year of 6.1% compares favorably with 5.1% last year. But even more importantly, we have good momentum. If you look at the fourth quarter ROTCE we’re now at 6.8%, close to 7%, that compares with 5.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The second area I’d comment on is we’re making very good traction on our customer agenda. We’re improving our position on both the consumer side, as well as the commercial side. And this is really how you create long-term franchise value. We’re certainly keeping our eye on that ball. I’ll give you a few details to back that up. First-off on consumer side, we launched our One Deposit Checking offering, which has reinvigorated checking account growth, that’s up 23% on a year-on-year basis. We also continued to strengthen our customer experience, evidenced by our continuous strong trajectory in the J.D. Power ratings. We’ve also further improved our important online and mobile offerings. For the second year in a row we were awarded the best mobile app by Javelin Research. Now on the commercial side, our Greenwich Survey scores on relationship managers remain best-in-class in nearly all categories. Our formula is we’ve got great people, we show up with great ideas and we add value to our clients. You can demonstrate the success there by looking at our market share, we continue to gain share. For example, we finished 8th in the National Middle-Market League Table volume, that’s up a place from 9th in 2013. The third area I’d comment on is we’ve made steady progress in improving our regulatory position. I think we’ve put in a really strong effort on CCAR and have made really demonstrable progress there. We’ll wait and see the results, but I feel very good about the progress that we’ve made. And then also in remediating our issued backlog with the regulators, we’ve had a very strong approach there and I think we’ve made good progress as well. And then lastly, I’d say another aspect to the year is that we delivered on all our milestones and major projects. So, whether it be the IPO, the sale at Chicago region, our overall expense initiative called Project Top and then our various other strategic initiatives we’re really executing very well. And this overall progress reflects well on our people, our colleagues are very engaged, they’re working very hard to make this a better run Bank. And while I mention people, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of Robert Matthews who led our commercial business. This is a real tragedy, Robert was a great guy, he had a passion for building a business focused on great customer service, really feel the loss there. But I would say that we’re fortunate to have a strong team behind him. Steve Woods and Bob Rubino, two of Robert’s key deputies are going to provide the interim leadership to make sure that we continue our momentum in that business. Now turning to the fourth quarter, we delivered a very strong performance demonstrating our ability to execute, as well as our ongoing momentum. Some of the highlights, we had good balance sheet growth and deposit growth which drove 2% sequential growth in net interest income. Our NIM was up slightly versus Q3 at 2.8%. Our underlying fees showed 5 million in growth, if you factor out the swing in MSR. Cap markets in particular had a big fourth quarter. Our expense control remains very solid, credit remains very well behaved and overall I guess one aspect I was very pleased to see was sequential positive operating leverage of 2%. We need that, that feels good to deliver it and it stacks up very well against our peer group. So we feel that we’re positioned well. We have a very straightforward playbook that we need to execute against. We have good alignment and accountability on that around the management team. Most of our initiatives are tracking okay. Loan growth is broadly at our target, 7.6 billion for the year. Our hiring is largely on-track and expense initiatives on that score we’re delivering against all our milestones. We’ve got 28% in the run rate at year-end which is a little bit better than we had anticipated. Now the outlook for 2015 calls for continued progress in executing our plan. There is a few things that we kind of remain intensely focused on. We’ve got to continue to grow the balance sheet and our customer relationships. We need to continue to deliver positive operating leverage and focus on running the Bank more efficiently. And we also expect our favorability and credit trends to continue. I am a bit concerned about rates, given our asset-sensitive position, this could be a headwind that we’ll have to manage through, but we already have some things in motion to contend with that, if we have to. So overall, we expect another very solid year. And with that, let me hand it off to John to go through a bit more detail on Q4 and 2014, as well as our outlook for 2015. John?
John Fawcett: Thank you, Bruce and good morning everyone. As Bruce indicated we rounded out 2014 with solid fourth quarter results as our underlying business performance continues to strengthen. This is reflected in our improved underlying performance across the business, robust asset quality and capital ratios, and continued momentum in our growth and efficiency initiatives. I’ll start out by focusing on our financial highlights and I’ll reference selective slides from our deck as I go along. Turning to Slide 3, our fourth quarter GAAP net income of $197 million was up $80 million or 4% from the third quarter and $45 million or 30% from the fourth quarter of 2013. Diluted earnings per share were $0.36, up $0.02 from the third quarter and $0.09 higher than fourth quarter of 2013. This was driven by our expense management initiatives, continued gain traction, allowing us to fund investment in the business to drive future asset and revenue growth. We show our adjusted fourth quarter results on Page 5, which exclude the impact of net restructuring charges and special items associated with the Chicago divestiture, efficiency affect in these programs and the separation from the Royal Bank of Scotland. On an adjusted basis for the quarter, we posted strong operating results with net income of $217 million or earnings of $0.39 per share. This is up 7% from the linked-quarter and 28% from the previous year. Our adjusted pre-provision profit of $388 million is up 4% relative to 3Q, largely driven by growth in net interest income and positive operating leverage. Furthermore, we experienced a $5 million decrease in our provision for the quarter to $72 million driven by improving credit and lower charge-offs despite continued loan growth. There has been a lot of attention on the impact of the drop in oil prices on the Bank’s loan portfolios, and I am pleased to report that our oil and gas related outstandings account for less than 1% of our total loan portfolio and we are continuing to perform reasonably well. We continue to make strides towards our goal of 10% return on tangible common equity by the end of 2016. On an adjusted basis, we generated a return on tangible common equity of 6.8% during the fourth quarter, up from 6.2% in the third quarter of 2014 and 5.2% from a year ago. This was driven by two primary items; improvement in our underlying pre-provision profit; and secondly, lower tangible common equity reflecting our objective to realign our capital structure to be more consistent with peers. Turning to the adjusted full year results on Slide 6, net income was $790 million or $1.42 per share, up 18% from 2013. Underlying revenue growth, disciplined expense management and a 33% decrease in provision expense drove the results. Diving a little deeper into the results for the quarter, on Slide 7 you will see, we grew net interest income $20 million this quarter, which included the benefit of a $1.5 billion increase in earning asset, and modestly improved asset yields. Our net interest margin this quarter was up by 3 basis points to 280 in comparison to the third quarter. This increase can largely be attributed to higher securities portfolio income related to a portfolio duration extension trade executed at the end of the third quarter, as well as broad-based loan growth. We did see some pressure from the impact of higher borrowing cost as we continued to diversify our funding base. Net interest margin was impacted adversely by increased deposit costs and growth in variable rate commercial loans, as well as lower yielding auto loans. Slide 8 details non-interest income which remained essentially flat in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, as growth in capital markets fees and other income was offset by lower mortgage banking fees. Excluding the impact of a swing in mortgage servicing rates, which moved from an impairment recovery of $5 million in the third quarter to an impairment charge of $2 million in the fourth quarter, underlying non-interest income was up $5 million sequentially. Year-over-year non-interest income decreased $40 million from the fourth quarter of 2013, largely as a result of a $24 million reduction in securities gains and other income, as well as a $24 million quarterly decrease attributed to the Chicago divestiture. Moving on to non-interest expenses on Slide 9, with our goal in mind of consistently delivering strong operating leverage, we continue to balance our focus on tightly managing our expense base, with the need to grow the business through targeted organizational and technology investments. As a result, our adjusted operating expenses of $791 million this quarter was relatively stable with the previous quarter, with the benefits of our efficiency initiatives largely offset by investment in the business. We achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of 67%, an improvement of 91 basis points from the third quarter of 2014, and 124 basis points from the same period last year. Now turning to the consolidated average balance sheet on Slide 10, our total earning assets of $118.7 billion were up 1% from last quarter and 9% from the fourth quarter of 2013 driven by robust growth in both commercial and consumer lending. Growth in our commercial loans has been broad-based with virtually all of our businesses posting solid growth. On the consumer side, our growth initiatives are firmly taking hold, as we’ve increased originations in our auto and student platforms. Deposits continue to strengthen across virtually all categories, with average deposits in the fourth quarter increasing by $3.1 billion or 3% over the third quarter. Organic growth for 2014 has more than offset the impact of the Chicago divestiture, with period-end deposit growth of $8.8 billion, compared with a divesture impact of $5.2 billion. Fourth quarter period-end total deposits increased 10% compared to December 31, 2013. On Slide 11, you will see more detail on consumer and commercial loans, where we have continued to perform well despite a persistent low rate environment. Compared to the previous quarter, consumer loans increased $1.6 billion largely due to growth in auto, mortgage and student loans. Yields are up 1 basis point reflecting the improved loan mix. Commercial loans increased by $1.1 billion driven by mid-corporate commercial real estate, asset finance, healthcare, and franchise finance. Other loans decreased as a result of continued run-off in the non-core portfolio, which decreased $200 million versus the third quarter. Slide 12 is a more in-depth look at deposits which increased across the board with growth in the money market and savings, interest, checking and DDA categories. Deposit costs increased by 2 basis points in the quarter, driven by a shift in mix to deposits with longer durations. Turning to Slide 13, our capital position remains robust with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 12.4% which generally exceeds that of our regional peers. We have already met initial LCR requirement of 90% as a modified LCR reporter and our LDR currently sits at a stable 98%. We also returned to the debt capital markets during the fourth quarter and successfully raised $1.5 billion of low cost senior debt in our first public senior offering. On Slide 14, you can see that our credit quality continues to strengthen with net charge-offs at $80 million. Additionally, our $72 million provision for credit losses was down $5 million, reflecting continued disciplined underlying and overall improvement in credit quality. Slide 15 is worth a mention. We’ve laid out the key initiatives in our turnaround plan and accessed how we did in 2014, what the market condition was surrounding each initiative in 2014 and what the outlook holds in 2015. The good news is that we’ve executed well across the initiatives in 2014 and expect that to continue. We are very focused on mortgage and wealth growth, along with combating some of the intense competition in the middle-market. That leads us nicely onto our outlook slide on Page 17. Given it’s a New Year and we’re relatively new public company, we’ve provided a comprehensive view of both our 1Q15 and full year '15 outlook. For full year, we expect 5% to 7% earning asset growth and a relatively stable margin, though the interest rate curve and competitive conditions pose some challenges. We expect adjusted expense growth to be relatively flat with mid single-digit positive operating leverage and our efficiency ratio moving to the mid-60s. We expect provision expense to be in the $350 million to $400 million range as we modestly built reserves, with broadly stable asset quality trends. We expect restructuring costs for the first half of 2015 in the $30 million to $50 million range and we’re projecting our year-end common equity Tier 1 ratio about 11.5% and an LDR of around 100%, with a focus on cost effective deposit growth. So the headline is that we have delivered well against the plan in 2014 and are focused on doing that again in 2015. We’ve made up for some challenges on revenues with excellent performances on expenses and favorable credit, which should continue. With that, let me turn it back to Bruce.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay thanks, John. To sum up, again I think we had a terrific 2014. We’ve taken decisive steps to enhance our business model and improve our performance and our results reflect our steady progress. We’re well-positioned to continue this progress in 2015 and it really all bulks down to execution. Of course a little tailwind from rates and the economies would also be most welcome. So with that Brad, I think we’re done and we’re ready to take some questions. Question-and-Answer Session
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We’re now ready for the quick Q&A portion of the call. (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Brian Nash with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Nash: Bruce, just starting-off when I think about reaching the 10% ROTCE by ’16, I think one of the key components was interest rate rising. I think since that point the forward curve has moved down and it does seem like the likelihood of rates rising at the pace we thought has become a lot lower. So, you talked about having some things in place, can you just give us a sense of what some of those things are, how much room do you think you have on the cost side if rates don’t end up rising?
Bruce Van Saun: Sure. If you recall the target of the 10% ROTCE was kind of the run rate as we leave the year in Q4. And when we did the ROTCE walk from 5% to 10% about 1.3% to 1.5% roughly related to that forward yield curve and I think the numbers that translated to was about 300 million of net interest income. That called for a 1.75 fed funds rate at the end of ’16 based on the forward curve we were using earlier in 2014. My guess is that we’ll have some increases and they’ll probably be maybe a little later than we originally anticipated and it may not go all the way to 1.75 by the end of ’16. One of the good news aspects though is that, benefit is frontend loaded so as you have the earlier rate rises, you have an ability to lag your deposits and so I think we’ll capture a good percentage of that as long as there is some movement. In terms of what can we do if it doesn’t -- if we don’t get that full benefit? Clearly what we’ve seen is that credit costs tend to also follow to some extent the path of rates. And so, if rates are a bit lower for longer than the stress on borrowers should be less, therefore we should potentially have some pickup on the credit cost of the equation, which is an unknown but I think it’s logical that that could be the case. And then on expenses, I mean working on the expense base is a way of life of us, so I think we’ve done a really good job to find a program that can deliver 200 in benefit. As you know we’re turning around and reinvesting a bunch of that in originators, and people close to customers we can drive more business volume and in technology, but basically we’ve done a pretty good job in the second half of the year, we’ve kept our expense growth reasonably flat and we’re getting that positive operating leverage. Is there more? There has to be more I mean I think we’re continuing to go farther up the tree from some of the things that we’ve put in with one of the program, but looking for ways to streamline, how we’re operating, trying to look at our vendor relationships, is there more we can squeeze out of our vendors. We have initiatives in place to keep turning over rocks and see what else that we can deliver.
Brian Nash: And then just on the outlook for the net interest margin, you’re looking stable with some risks. I’m just wondering if you could help us understand some of the puts and takes, I mean clearly the swaps’ rolling off as a benefit, but where are you in terms of loan yields rolling off relative to what’s coming on and are you planning on making any further changes to the duration of the securities book embedded in that guidance and if so what impact would that have on the rate sensitivity of the franchise? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: I’ll start-off and then maybe John wants to chime in, but just in terms of the puts and takes, yes the positives as you point out having the swaps roll off that continues to create a benefit. Our efforts to try to grow the portfolio in areas that have evidence of little higher risk appetite, not a huge amount but a little in terms of moving for example into the prime space in some of our portfolios particularly auto that should create a bit of additional yield for us in growing commercial real estate and leverage lending books, selectively that should create a bit more yield for us. So, we’re working on ways to try to improve the yield on the portfolio through either risk appetite moves or mix of asset moves. So, those are the things I think that are going to be positive and obviously if we get some rate move that clearly in the second half of ’15 that clearly would help. We’ve seen in 2014 one of the headwinds particularly on the commercial book is in this low rate environment we’ve had customers looking to refinance, we can do that. The bigger company is going to the capital markets and then others just refinancing some of their facilities. We saw a fairly good dose of that in Q3, we didn’t see that much of it in Q4, but I think you have to keep your eye on that as we go through the year and if rates continue to stay this low that could pick up again. In reinvesting, the securities portfolio clearly you’ve got a roughly four year duration, which is tightened a bit, given the lower rates and so that might be back down at 3.5 years at this point and so you’ve left with some tough decisions as to whether you want to kind of extend in the current rate environment or you want to keep some powder dry, so we’re certainly working through that and that could potentially be a little bit of headwind, but we’ll have to see. We saw last year rates came down to this level briefly and then promptly motored back to 225 to 240 range, so it’s a little hard to call that one at this point, but that could be a headwind as well. So that’s what I would think are the puts and takes. John I don’t know if you want to add anything.
John Fawcett: I think the only thing I would add and it interferes repeating the point that Bruce made is that 75% of the sensitivity is centered at the very short-end of the curve, three months. And then I think the other thing is, is that clearly the investment portfolio is something that we very closely managed. At the end of the third quarter we did the duration extension trade, which paid some dividends in the fourth quarter, so we’re always looking for opportunities to avail ourselves of that. I think if you look at sensitivity over the course of the year, it’s up to probably the highest point it has been during the year at 6.8% at the end of the year, I think in beginning here we started at 6.2 but it’s always been in that 6.2 to 6.8 range. I think the last point I would make around the investment portfolio is, is that as Bruce said at some point you wonder when you start to drag your feet in terms of reinvestment, thus far we’ve been reinvesting cash flows on a month-to-month basis. But you might expect if rates get down to around 1.75, I mean it’s something we look at a lot more carefully.
Operator: And your next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Ken Usdin: Hey John, just one follow-up on the rate comments there. Can you just help us understand then the front-end benefits that you are not building into your flat NIM forecast? So I guess if you could just help us understand what your rate forecast is within your net interest margin guidance and what would your forecast be kind of ex-rates?
John Fawcett: Well, we’re just using a forward curve at the end of December. I mean so, then that’s the forecast. I mean if you look at that it’s where we budgeted the front-end, it’s got rates moving out a little bit more back ended into the fourth quarter as opposed to rates starting to move in the first half of the year.
Bruce Van Saun: In fact I think we have Ken it’s Bruce maybe the fed funds rate the forward curve is about 65 basis points at the end of ’18. So there is some benefit in that which again provides solidity to the overall outlook. But this kind of lower for longer and kind of some payoffs on the commercial side and some of the reinvestment issues in the first half of the year I think are why you’d still have a broadly stable handle on the overall forecast.
Ken Usdin: And then Bruce second question just on the fee growth parts of the business, your box chart is an interesting one in terms of the outlook. There is a couple of comments in there about greater competition. But I believe if I do the math your outlook is still for a really strong fee growth rate this year. So I was wondering if you can talk this through growth in fee businesses and on overall what you think the business can grow this year?
Bruce Van Saun: And I’ll ask probably Brad to comment on a couple of the initiatives on the consumer side. So you are referring to Slide 15 in our slide deck. And I think the big fee initiatives here we have mortgage is one, wealth is another one on the consumer side, treasury solutions and cap markets are the biggest ones on the commercial side. And I guess also household growth, if we continue to grow households we’ll continue to gain fee income from that. We’ve scored those three to be I’d say just cautiously optimistic. I think we’ve made good traction on all three. On the household growth clearly you’re just contending with the high level of competition in the market and also less foot traffic going through the branches. So the way we go about adding the households and advertising et cetera, just needs to be flexible, I would say. So, we still feel good. We hit our goals in 2014. But I think we’re just being duly cautious there. On mortgages, similarly I think we hit the bar in terms of the gross hiring we wanted to do, we had attrition a little higher in the first half of the year and that’s come back down nicely in the fourth quarter. One of the interesting things here is if you’re in this refi boomlet that should start to drive higher levels of income coming from the mortgage business both portfolio balance sheet income, as well as fee income. But at the same time, it might be harder to lift some of the mortgage brokers to hit our longer term goal of doubling the size of the sales force because if it’s an active market people are making a good living where they are. So, I think that’s why we have it cautious. We might still have a resounding victory in 2015, but it may slow the pace in terms of actually hiring mortgage loan officers. And in wealth, I think that you’re just looking at a very competitive market. So, we’re only trying to hire in terms of financial consultants, maybe 20-25 a year. We came in pretty close to that in 2014. But it is kind of hand-to-hand combat in terms of bringing those people in the door. So we’re being a little cautious there, but we still I think overtime if you look over the last three years, we’ve had nice growth there and the market conditions have been conducive I think it’s more on the competition side, but in terms of the backdrop for making money in the wealth business is pretty attractive. Treasury solutions, on that one we’ve I think hired a great leader, Mike Cummins to run the business for us. We’ve put some money into technology and we’re out trying to get more market share here. Particularly when we leave less transactions we should always get the operating accounts and always get that cross-sell. So I think it’s more of just getting the rhythm and starting to see the benefits from some of the investments that we’ve made. And cap markets as I said we’ve done really-really well in terms of building up a quality operation that can compete with the best of them, gaining market share, of bringing good ideas to our clients and so we feel good about that one. So broadly speaking Ken I think there is good momentum on fees to match the growth in the balance sheet. But there are some areas of caution that we have to stay focused on and really execute well against. I think I have said enough Brad, I hope I didn’t steal your thunder, over to you.
Brad Conner: Well actually I think you did a pretty good job of covering up Bruce. The only think I would probably add from a mortgage perspective and we are off to a very good start in the first quarter. So, mortgage application line is very strong, which I think is probably pretty consistent across the market and it’s allowing us also to have nice margins from a mortgage perspective. So I think we feel good about the progress that we’re seeing early on in mortgage, but as you’ve said that could have an impact on recruiting over the course of the year, but I think you covered it and the most of our hiring initiatives that are on pace, the growth initiatives are in place, it’s just a very competitive marketplace.
Operator: And our next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
John Pancari: On the bond portfolio editions, just wanted to get some color on what types of securities did you add to the balance sheet and also what yields and what duration was added to the quarter?
Bruce Van Saun: I can start John you can correct me if not 100% hand grip on this one. But for the most part I think we’ve been buying Ginnie Mae securities and in terms of that duration trade that we did the extension of the duration trade. And those were 30 year agency pass throughs. I think the yield on that has been around, let me see John do you have that?
John Fawcett: Yes I mean the extension, 74 basis points of yield pick up between the 30s that we got and the 15 taskers we traded out.
John Pancari: Okay.
John Fawcett: And I guess one of the other benefits of moving into some of this Ginnie has also helped the LCR ratio a bit.
John Pancari: And then are you looking to do more? Did you imply that I think in your earlier comments?
Bruce Van Saun: I think we just have to watch it and we’ll be opportunistic in terms of in this lower rate environment, the overall duration on the portfolio came in from just about four to around 3.5, weighted average life came from 4.7 to about 4.2. And so I think we’ll -- ideally we like to run that duration at about four years, but you have to pick your spots when you go back into the market and put on that extra length.
John Pancari: And then my follow-up is on the loan growth side. Just want to get here a little bit of color around your expectations for loan growth in coming quarters. And it’s good you gave us the earning asset growth expectation, but I wanted to slice out loan growth and get your thoughts there specifically and then potentially by loan type? Thanks.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes there it’s I think the loan growth numbers are maybe in the 7% to 8% range and the securities portfolio much lower, maybe 2% or something broadly. So we want to keep the securities portfolio at a set percentage of assets, we got pretty full on that in 2014. So I see a differential between the rate of pace of growth of loans and the securities portfolio. And that’s how you kind of blend it back down to something like 5% to 7%. I think we’d expect to grow in the same areas that we grew this year, so we’ve been able to grow the commercial book probably for five years now in a 7% to 9% targeted range that I think is derived from two things. One is we keep adding people and originators as we build out commercials. So we’ve got more people with more relationships bringing in business. And we’ve also had a pretty healthy market particularly in the middle-market. So I think those things have allowed us to -- and we focused on places where we see real opportunities, in the sectors of the markets that are growing. So a combination to those things I think gives us confidence we can continue to deliver that. And then in the consumer side, we’ve got we’ve had a nice year in auto, both our own originations plus the relationship we have with SCUSA on flowing in some prime auto paper. I think we have a very solid position in student both on the underlying core product, as well as the new refinanced product we’d expect to see some very good growth there as well. And then again in mortgages as we build up the size of the force, we’ll be retaining more on balance sheet and that will help that growth, that helps to offset I would say a kind of flat or even slightly declining home equity portfolio, which you’re seeing across the industry, but I think we’re okay with that mix shift to more first mortgage on our book and maybe a little less as a percentage of the heat lock. Brad, do you want to add anything?
Brad Conner: You’ve hit it spot on Bruce. I think that’s exactly the right story.
Operator: And our next question comes from Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Matthew O'Connor: Can you talk a bit about how much you had to spend on higher regulatory compliance cost and maybe just a cost associated with splitting away from RBS and then how you think those costs trend from here?
Bruce Van Saun: Sure, we gave some disclosure that the one-time regulatory cost associated with CCAR to get really in position when we saw where the bar was, we had some catching up to do, and that was 25 million which is behind us at this point. And then the ongoing run cost to build sustainability is 8 million to 10 million and we’ve got about I’d say two-thirds of that in our run cost, it was important that we hired those resources up during the year, so when some of the consultants who helped us get in position left that we had the knowledge transferred to our own people, and so I think we’ve accomplished that fairly well. We’ve also had efforts around our kind of issued backlog in terms of making sure we could accelerate the remediation of that and so there were some costs that went along with that and I think whatever we have now is in our run rate and so there won’t be any need to tick that up. In terms of the cost to separate from RBS, I think there is also a fair amount of disclosure in our broad restructuring costs, it runs the gamut of having standalone capabilities and having our own vendor contracts, so there is a few dis-synergies of scale associated with that. We also had to change our branding in terms of moving to a unified Citizens brand without RBS in the name for the commercial side and sun setting the Charter One name and going again fully to Citizens name. Those costs are also kind of detailed in some of our earlier disclosures and they’re running on-track. So we said if there is still about $30 million to $50 million of broad cost to go some of those associated with the cost program, some associated with separation from RBS and the rebranding, but I think by the end of the first half we’ll have all of those kind of separation and the overall program cost sunset and we’ll just be back to reporting nice clean earnings with nothing below the line at that point.
Matthew O'Connor: So the adjusted expense levels that we see should be not materially impacted by either the one-time separation cost obviously or higher rate compliance…?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, those adjusted expenses with the things moved out into below the line restructuring, is probably a good base to work from. As I said the cross trends going on there is we’re investing in playing offence in people and technology, and our costs program overall is creating enough offset that you saw in the second half of the year we were able to keep expenses at a pretty contained level and pretty flat, which if you can get your revenue engine going and you can get some positive momentum on revenues and keep your expenses flat that’s certainly a prescription to drive your ROE higher.
Matthew O'Connor: And then just separately, there was a footnote about your tax rate just on accounting change related to the low income in housing credit I guess this could increase fee revenues and also increase the tax rate, are those offsetting or is there anything...?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, it’s offsetting. So it’s just a tweak guesstimate to your model to put the fee income up by that amount is in the footnote 48 million and then the expense, if you look at the tax line that takes the tax rate up to we're calling it maybe 33.5 for the next year.
Matthew O'Connor: And then lastly if I could just sneak in regarding this portfolio acquisition of I guess it’s oil and gas from RBS, obviously very small numbers I think it’s 200 million or 400 million, but also the 200 million or 400 million I guess the timing as oil prices come down sharply just any color you can add there and is there any recourse given maybe macro-conditions to change there quickly since the purchase…?
Bruce Van Saun: Look, energy is a key sector to plan if you’re going to be a commercial bank, you need to play in the energy space, and as part of separation it was clear that that was RBS turf prior to separation and RBS is rethinking also who they’re banking and the size of companies they want to bank. And so we negotiated to bring that over, I think it always was a more logical business to be done at Citizens than at RBS but they got there first, so we’ve brought that business over we brought a few people over. I’d that trade over 100 times out of a 100 if I had first of all and I could see that oil prices were going to crack I think we’ve done stress, reverse stress testing on this portfolio and you’ve had to have oil prices below, well below where they are below $50 for over five years before you have credit issues in that portfolio. So, I think the advance rate, the hedging on the part of the borrowers is all sound so we’re not worried from a credit standpoint about that portfolio.
Operator: And your next question will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
Matt Burnell: I wanted to follow-up on the cost outlook and I guess specifically around your targeted plan for efficiency savings. I think you noted that if that’s you’ll add about 28% of your targeted efficiency savings by the end of 2014, and so if I remember correctly it’s a little bit ahead of your earlier expectation and I guess I’m just asking if that potentially means that you could reach your full run rate on the efficiency savings ahead of your end of 2016 schedule?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, I think it’s a marginal ahead so it’s I think 28 John versus 25 or something?
John Fawcett: Yes.
Bruce Van Saun: So it’s a good spot that you’ve noticed that, but I think in the fixed scheme of things we’re broadly on-track. We have built a very solid ability to track all these initiatives and we have people signed up in blood with our name next to each one that they will deliver on anything below and so John’s people monitor this very closely on a monthly basis and that gives us a high degree of confidence that we’re going to hit those numbers.
Matt Burnell: And then just secondly a question on asset quality, you’d mentioned your outlook assumes relatively stable asset quality, but we did notice higher NPLs in the HELOC portfolio which is about 20% of your total loans if I exclude the HELOC service for others. Can you give us a little color as to what is going on in that portfolio and if there could be further NPL pressure in that portfolio specifically?
Bruce Van Saun: Brad, do you want to take that one?
Brad Conner: Yes, I’ll take that one. So Matt, there is a little bit of accounting noise I guess I would say in those NPLs in that about a year ago we had $550 million group of HELOCs that were on non-accrual status that moved into accrual status based on a year of positive performance, so that was actually improving our NPLs as a result of that, that has really run its course. So what you’re seeing now is really just a return to normalization, all of the underlying trends in the home equity portfolio remain on-track, their delinquency levels look good and the portfolio really appears to be strong. So we haven’t seen the underlying fundamental issues for the HELOC portfolio.
Matt Burnell: And then just finally for me John, you mentioned you’re pretty comfortable with where you sit relative to the LCR, can you give us a sense as to what kind of buffer you would think about going forward above the 90% minimum requirement?
John Fawcett: Yes, I mean right, we’re very comfortable with where we’re right now, I mean right now I think we’re at 102 and we have planked it at the end of December and I think we’d be comfortable staying right in that range, I think we want to be comfortably above the 90.
Operator: And your next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
Vivek Juneja: Brad for you, the mortgage business because that is one that you’ve been trying to grow where does that headcount in terms of adding mortgage loan offsets that I know last quarter it had slowed a little bit, where do you stand on that one?
Brad Conner: Yes, we’re actually very much right on-track so we added a net of 41 loan officers in the fourth quarter which was our best quarter to-date. We finished the year up a net 67 loan officers so I think our final year in count was 413 which was spot on the guidance that we had been giving, so very good progress there.
Vivek Juneja: And are you being able to get the production with that or is that impacting pricing given the competition?
Brad Conner: Yes, so here is what I would tell you, through 2014 as you know the mortgage business was challenged. The volume across the industry was down from projections and so we were a little bit behind, our hiring was on-track but we were a little bit behind pace in terms of origination volume. But we’ve seen as rates have come down over the last few weeks we are seeing a very strong pipeline building a lot of very good momentum in applications. So, I would say earlier into 2015 we’re a bit ahead of pace.
Bruce Van Saun: Yes I would just add it’s Bruce that, our objectives in building up the mortgage business was really strategic in nature and not tactical. So, when we said about putting together our turnaround plan, we looked at the size and scale of our mortgage business relative to peers and relative to the opportunity that we saw in the marketplace and we had 350 person operation and an origination rank of say maybe 25. And our deposit market share for traditional banks is 12 or 13. And so we said well is there an opportunity to try to get closer to our deposit market and what would it take and does our market support that. And I think the answer to that was all yes and let’s try to double the size over the three year time period and bring that up to 700. And so you end up challenged when you see the conditions we saw in ’14 is this still the right strategy, should we slow it down, our view is let’s keep our foot on the gas paddle and let’s keep going because we know the mortgage market is ultimately coming back. And the people that are coming in are still covering their nut in terms of being accretive to overall performance. So anyway I think we’re still on pace. I think our outlook for ’15 is it should be, better than ’14 and that should create a bit of tailwind in terms of the impact that comes from this hiring that we’ve been able to achieve.
Vivek Juneja: I have another question Bruce which is that the restructuring cost of 30 million to 50 million that you’re expecting in the first half, how much of that would you say is for if you had contracts versus developing, building new business areas as you’ve been looking on both sides?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, the restructuring is only related to either the pull through of our efficiency initiatives or some of the rebranding costs and we’re just kind of giving you an estimate of what that’s going to be and trying to pull that below the line. And as I said it will be sunset by the end of the first half, we will have completed all of that work and all the costs associated with those programs will have been reflected. The benefits of the efficiency program are coming through above the line in our expense base and roughly they’ve been offsetting the increase in ongoing expenses that comes from these hiring initiatives in consumer and commercial and some of our technology initiatives, the key driving and improved overall technology suite. And so that’s been the kind of challenge for us as to we know we got to play offense and we know we need continued investment. But where can we pinch down on expenses and operate more efficiently and effectively so that we can afford that and so that we can deliver the positive operating leverage. And again our outlook if we’re going to deliver the progress we need to stay on-track to get that ROTCE up towards our goal of 10%, we got to do that on a consistent basis. And I am very pleased that the last two quarters we can see that’s coming through in space we’ve kept expenses relatively flat. We’ve been able to grow the balance sheet which drives income growth and so we are getting that positive operating leverage.
Operator: And your next question will come from David Eaves with UBS.
David Eaves: Just I wanted to touch on kind of uptick in the cost of deposits. I was curious how much of that was driven by loan growth and looking to maintain a loan-to-deposit ratio versus looking to kind of lock-in funding in preparation for rates whenever that comes?
John Fawcett: So a bulk of the growth is that actually the term and time deposits. And so for a very long time we’ve been out of this business, I think we grew term and time deposits of about a 1.2 billion or 1.3 billion quarter-on-quarter. And so this is mostly 14% money. And that’s driven -- '14 money so that’s driven a bit of the uptick in costs. And I think strategically I think we’re going to continue to try and manage the loan-to-deposit ratio that’s 98 to 100 and so we’d keep a very close eye on this. Some of this is a little bit of experimenting in terms of price elasticity in particular markets and so far so good. So we’re pleased with the way we’ve been able to manage the LDR. I think it’s important to go back to one of the challenges we faced and one of the points that I made in my prepared text is, is that when we sold the Chicago franchise we gave up $5.2 billion of deposits against a $1 billion of loans. I think year-on-year we’ve actually grown deposits by 10% and so we’re reigniting this deposit engine and trying to do it with a very thoughtful way. I would expect that as we go forward on a quarter-to-quarter basis you might expect to see our cost of deposits increase 1 to 2 basis points here and there as we meet the need to sensibly fund our loan growth with raising deposits.
Bruce Van Saun: It’s Bruce I would just add that we’ve got to continue to be good at raising cost effective deposits and for a long time for the better part of the last five years we were running off deposits because we were shrinking the balance sheet as part of RBS’ shrink agenda. Now we’re kind of back in the gym getting our muscle back in terms of growing deposits cost effectively, that means getting better at making offers to our existing customers doing marketing to go out and get that and not just relying on rate, but you are right to point out that some of this also is a bit of a tactical shift in terms of securing some longer-term fixed money, when you combine that with the senior debt offering that we did I think we’re positioned now even better for rising rates as John said earlier the sensitivity to the ramp is 6.8, which is up from 6.3 at the end of the third quarter and that really reflects both the types of deposits that we’re bringing in and plus this senior debt issue that we did.
David Eaves: And I guess just kind of following up on that, do you have any update on your sense of where deposit beta’s might shake out and I am just kind of uncertain?
Bruce Van Saun: I think that the beta’s are moving up just a little bit, but I think we kind of have interest bearing deposits at around 60. John?
John Fawcett: Yes, and it’s 60 and it hasn’t changed dramatically from what we’ve presented in analyst presentations and the road shows, it’s pretty stable.
Bruce Van Saun: And total deposit is 48, yes.
John Fawcett: It’s roughly where it was.
David Eaves: And then just lastly on the Slide 15, which was really helpful. Just a quick question on the student loans, I think that you guys indicated the market conditions there are more cautious. I was curious what was driving that and I guess really how much -- if that market environment improves how much faster could the originations grow there?
Brad Conner: I think -- this is Brad, let me clarify the market condition. One of the things that we’re seeing is tremendous demand for our newly launched refinance products. So I think we believe the market conditions will be favorable there and the demand is actually stronger than we had anticipated. What we have seen is the traditional private student loan market fee is still growing, but it’s growing at a slower pace than what we had seen in the prior two to three years. So we indicated that as cautious primarily based on just a bit of slowing of the traditional private student loan market.
Bruce Van Saun: But I think it’s timely Brad that we this refi clearly on the -- and we’re pleased that it’s exceeding our expectations at this time.
Brad Conner: Correct, yes.
Operator: And your next question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ken Zerbe: Clarification question, on Page 17 on the provision expense or more specifically credit cost of 350 million to 400 million. Is that all provision expense or does that include some non-provision credit costs?
Bruce Van Saun: I think it’s all.
John Fawcett: Yes, so it’s the numbers that you’ll see on the face of our statement.
Ken Zerbe: Provision expense only?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes.
John Fawcett: [Indiscernible].
Ken Zerbe: And then the other question is just on CCAR, I know Bruce you’d mentioned that you are making good progress sort of with the check lists going into this year CCAR process. But is there any big areas that you’re still working on that you wish that you would have had complete ahead of the filing for this year’s CCAR?
Bruce Van Saun: Ken I think we made probably as much progress as was humanly possible in this time period and I think the whole process around your governance, your risk appetite, your whole frameworks for assessing risk inside a company is a continuum. And I think you’ll never be fully satisfied because there’ll be new things to think about and new ways to do things. So I think where we got to in terms of that framework is satisfactory from my standpoint here in the company. I hope the feds ultimately agrees with my take on that. But I don’t think really anyone in our peer group can say that they are the finished products that they are the finished article. I think there is tonne of that work to do, with areas to refine and improve in and so we already know the additional work that we have planned for the next cycle and we’re very transparent about that. And I think all things are when they go through that process to say this is an ongoing multi-year effort and we keep making significant progress year in and year out. And I think that’s the way you have to approach it.
Operator: And your next question will come from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Geoffrey Elliott: Just a quick question on the loan growth, there is quite a bit of acquired growth and that we’ve seen over the last couple of quarters clearly the, also an agreement that you’ve got to purchase loans there you have some acquired loan growth in mortgage in 3Q and the loans that you’d acquired in the oil and gas sector and…?
Bruce Van Saun: Geoffrey could you speak up a little bit. I am having trouble hearing you.
Geoffrey Elliott: Sure, so I am saying there has been quite a bit of acquired loan growth in 3Q and 4Q clearly some of that through the auto channel, the mortgage loans you required in the third quarter, the RBS energy loans you acquired in 4Q. Could you just help us by splitting out how much of the growth that we’re seeing come on to the balance sheet as through your own originations versus loans that you’ve acquired?
Bruce Van Saun: Sure, I guess in Q4 you had about 900 of purchased growth in consumer and about 200 in commercial, and I would say from a ongoing basis the resi mortgage purchases were pretty full on that and one of the strategies we had this year was to do those purchases to lead the buildup of our own force, so that we can do our own originations, so as we bring on these loan officers and the market is looking favorable for '15, I think we’ll do very little or much-much-much less in terms of resi purchases. On the auto side, we said we had a target to do about 500 a quarter, we did about 400 in fact in Q4 through our relationship with SCUSA, and again the effort there is to ultimately bring on more prime paper which gives us a better risk adjusted return profile than what we have in our back book, which is mainly super prime. We’re trying to orienting our own organization capabilities to do more prime and to change that mix and so ultimately I think we’ll sunset some point that relationship with SCUSA when our own capabilities are where we need it to be, but certainly for 2015, we still have this plan and we’re still planning to purchase around 500 million a quarter. And then I think the commercial side, we’ve done very little loan purchasing, this was a pretty unique opportunity for us to pickup that energy portfolio, so I would consider that a one-off.
Geoffrey Elliott: Great, so sounds like about 1.1 billion out of the 2.4 billion of average balanced growth in the quarter it was acquired?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes.
Operator: And your next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Gerard Cassidy: Bruce, you were pretty clear on the outlook on the interest rates with the forward curve by the end of 2016 where it may or may not be. In the Slide 17 where you give your 2015 outlook, what do you guys to keep the margin steady as you’re anticipating, where is the fed funds rate has to be by the end of the year under that scenario?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, we’re again using a forward curve view on that and the forward curve right now I think has the fed funds rate at 65 basis points, so there is I think a debate in the market if you will between whether there is one move or whether there is two moves over the course of '15, and that’s currently what we’re looking at. So we’ll see if that happens if rates -- if there was no rate move at all I think there is maybe 40 million to 50 million impact of a flat rate through the end of the year. So that’s a number that we can kind of put a marker next to and work on ways that we can offset that in case it looks less likely that that’s going to happen.
Gerard Cassidy: And referring to the forward curve what’s your guy’s confidence in the accuracy of the forward curve?
Bruce Van Saun: Well too hard I mean I think that’s the market speaking, so I think if you’re doing budgeting and you’re doing forecasting you’d kind of have to roll this what the market thinks at any point in time, it does move around a lot which makes it challenging when you go from one quarter to the next and you see the curve whipping around, but I think all kind of forward thinking has to be informed by the curve, the markets view of where rates are going.
Gerard Cassidy: And then shifting over to your Slide 15 when you talked about reenergizing the household growth, the reduced foot traffic, is that a seasonal or secular or cyclical, can you guys talk about what you’re seeing there at the branch level?
Bruce Van Saun: Yes, I think it’s just industry-wide, so it’s a secular trend that with the new offerings of convenience around mobile and online more customers can access their banking services that they need remotely. They still come into the branches, they still like branches and so having a branch configuration is important, but kind of the purpose for why they go into the branches I think is becoming more specific. They don’t need as much help with transactions, they may want to talk to one of our specialists et cetera, so I think that’s what we’re saying is you maybe have less swings at the back if you will of people coming through your branches so you’d have to get good at making targeted offers through other channels. Brad, I’ll flip it to you, and you could probably elaborate on that a bit.
Brad Conner: Bruce I think you did a very good job of saying that, it puts you in a position of having to be more effective when you do have the interactions with your customers and that’s what we’re focusing on is making the right offer when you do interact with your customers and setting appointments to get them to come in your branches and those kinds of things, but it is an industry-wide trend that everyone is having to adapt to.
Gerard Cassidy: I recall on the last quarter’s call if I recall correctly that you guys really didn’t have any desire to reduce the number of branches as you go forward. If this foot traffic continues to fall do you rethink that strategy or do you start reducing number of branches?
Bruce Van Saun: Well, I think the play in the medium-term is really to reconfigure your branches, make them more fit for purpose and smaller. So that’s really where we’re focused on. Is there an expense opportunity? Yes, I think it’s in kind of getting the overall square footage that we have to something that is smaller and to make sure that we’ve enough meeting space, we’ve less space designated for long teller, number of teller stations that we needed in the past and this is not something you can turn on a dime on because we have well over 75% of our branches are leased and you have to kind of time it with lease at rolls but there is a prize there and that’s what we’re focused on and in terms of consolidations, we’ve done most of the logical ones to do, there might be a few here and there, but I think that plays really around reducing square footage.
Gerard Cassidy: One final question, you mentioned that your mobile app has a very high ranking from an outside independent ranking organization. What percentages of customers today are interacting with Citizens through the mobile app?
John Fawcett: Yes, well let me answer it this way. So we’ve talked a lot about transaction migration, and customers moving to doing their transactions with us in non-traditional ways. We are up to about 8% of our deposit base, 8% of our deposit is coming through mobile deposits, about 25% in total being non-branch activity. I don’t have off to top of my head the number of the percentage of customers that interact with us on mobile, but I can tell you that it’s growing rapidly and our transaction volume happening through mobile is growing really at pace even beyond what we expected and like I said over 25% of our deposit volume now coming from non-branch activities.
Bruce Van Saun: Are there any more questions operator?
Operator: No further questions in queue.
Bruce Van Saun: Okay. Well, again it’s Bruce speaking, I’d like to just end the call by saying I think we have a very solid quarter here in the Bank and we’re optimistic as we enter 2015. Thanks everybody for dialing-in today. Have a good day.
Operator: And that does conclude today’s conference call. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-10-24 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Andrew Palmer - Head of Investor Relations Joseph Jolson - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer Raymond Jackson - Chief Financial Officer Carter Mack - President, Director Mark Lehmann - President of JMP Securities, Director
Analysts: Joel Jeffrey - KBW Joe - Barrington Research Alex Paris - Barrington Research
Operator: Welcome to JMP Group’s Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that today’s call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I’ll now turn the call over to Andrew Palmer, the Company’s Head of Investor Relations.
Andrew Palmer: Good morning. Here with me today are Joe Jolson, JMP Group’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Ray Jackson the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by Carter Mack, President in JMP Group and Mark Lehmann President in JMP Securities and Craig Johnson, our Vice Chairman. Before we get started, I will note that some of this morning’s comments may contain forward-looking statements about future events that are out of JMP’s control. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied. For a discussion of uncertainties that could affect JMP’s future performance please see the description of risk factors included in our most recent 10-K. That said I’ll turn things over to our Chairman and CEO, Joe Jolson.
Joe Jolson: Thanks Andrew. JMP Group posted another good quarter thanks to our diversified business model with operating earnings increasing 28% year-over-year to $0.15 a share, despite a slower pace in the equity capital markets environment. Excluding net investment income and corporate costs, our three operating platforms earned a record $0.66 per share for the latest twelve months, an increase of 74% from $0.38 per share for the previous twelve-month period. The strong results drove a 12% increase in our tangible book value per share to $6.32 and also allowed us to return nearly half our operating earnings to stockholders through cash dividends and share buybacks over the past year. During the third quarter, we announced the potential restructuring of JMP Group into a publically traded partnership. We launched a new hedge fund Harvest Financial Partners and closed our third CLO. I will have Ray go through a few financial highlights before I continue. Ray?
Ray Jackson: Thanks Joe. Adjusted net revenues were $40.3 million for the quarter and a record $134.9 million for the first nine month of the year, up 27%. Operating net income was $3.4 million or $0.15 per share for the quarter, an increase of 18% from the third quarter of 2013. The nine months total was $11.9 million or $0.52 per share, an increase of 18%. For the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 13.8% and for the nine months ended in September it was 14.2%. For the quarter, legal and other expenses in connection with our proposed restructuring of the publicly traded partnership were $0.4 million or $0.01 per share after tax, which was included in operating EPS of $0.15. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, [such] costs were $0.06 million or $0.01 per share after tax, which was included in operating EPS of $0.52. We have historically adjusted that compensation ratio to exclude any hiring cost related to strategic growth initiatives. In this quarter for the first time, we have further adjusted the ratio by excluding hedge fund incentive fees from both revenues and expenses. As majority of these fees is passed through to the investment teams when earned. For the quarter, this adjusted compensation ratio equal 62.8% while for the first nine months of the year, it was 64.7%. Our adjusted non-compensation ratio was 19.8% and 17.7% respectively. For a balance sheet perspective, our recourse debt with total capital ratio was 41% at September 30th. Net cash and liquid securities equaled $2.57 per share and net invested capital, which includes less liquid investments was $6.16 per share. Stockholders equity all of which is tangible was approximately $137 million or $6.32 per share, up from $6.16 at June 30th. Joe, back to you.
Joe Jolson: Thanks Ray. JMP securities is nearly completely year two of its five years strategic growth plan which was intended to double the firm’s market share through year end 2017. In its four targeted sectors, JMP Securities share of US common equity underwriting fees was [indiscernible] basis points for the trailing 12 month period, compare to 90 basis points as the base year in 2012, but also compare to just 27 basis points in 2009 nearly 5 years ago. Our market share gains combined with the resurge in equity capital market over the last 12 months led to a 65% increase in our ECMP revenues. Our strategic advisory revenues were up nearly 100% year-to-date and we could have our best year ever depending on anticipated closings in the fourth quarter. For the first nine months of the year, strategic advisory revenues compose 26% of total investment banking revenues compare to 16% for the same period last year. According to the latest data available from McGlone, our share of institutional equities commissions improved 18% from 34 basis points in 2012, the 40 basis point for the 12 month period ended in June of this year, there is a quarter lag in getting McGlone numbers. That increased market share more than offset a small shrinkage in the commissions pie in that period of time, and as a result our institutional brokerage revenues was $6.5 million for the quarter were up 12% year-over-year, and our total of $19.6 million for the first nine months of the year increase 9% from a year ago.  We are starting to see an acceleration there in year-over-year comparison. Organic growth through market shares gains especially over multiple years is very difficult. Especially in a highly contested and mature industries that we compete in. Our objective of doubling our market share in five years was never expected to be a layup. That being said we are very proud of our progress thus far.  Asset management related fee revenues jumped 86% year-over-year to $11.1 million for the quarter and we are up 82% to $32.6 million for the nine months. For the first three quarters of the year incentive fees totaled $20.4 million compared to $8.1 million a year ago. Most of these fees were related to Harvest Small Cap Partners which generated a net return of 5.8% in the quarter and for the nine months 24.4%, just having a great year this year. We provided additional discloser as Ray mentioned in the press release about the volatile impact of quarterly incentive fees on our compensation ratio in order to better illustrate the underlying trends in our business.  At an adjusted comp ratio of 62.8% our operating margin would have been north of 17% for the quarter. We believe that this added discloser provides investors with a better and more accurate picture of our core business dynamics and our excellent profitability level.  Total client AUM including sponsored fees from we -- sponsored funds from which we earn fess equal to $2.5 billion at September 30th, up from $1.8 billion a year earlier. Hedge fund client assets under management increased by 5% during the quarter to $915 million. Period end 37% of our sponsored AUM was in hedge funds, 63% in private capital strategies.  While we have been successful at building our hedge fund business at a compounded rate of nearly 20% since we went public in 2007 with $240 million AUM at the time. We are strategically focused on investing in the growth and diversification of our private capital strategies. Currently we a $1.1 billion in CLOs through JMP credit advisors. $90 million in small business credit through HCAP advisors. $114 million in late stage venture, secondary venture capital through Harvest growth capital, and $214 million in multi-family debt and equity investments through River Bank.  In our corporate credit segment we have looked to grow AUM since the CLO new issuance market reemerged in 2012. On September 30th we closed JMP credit advisor CLO-3 with $370.5 million in assets bringing the total AUM in that business as I mentioned to $1.1 billion, that compares to $782 million at the end of last year.  JMP group made $7 million investment in CLO-3 sub-nodes that was underwritten at a 15% IRR. Depending on market conditions we may look to secure new warehouse facility and begin accumulating loans for CLO-4 around year-end. Although we typically take three months to four months for that warehouse line to fully ramp.  We earned a gross return at 6.1% or 8.1% on annualized basis our capital in our hedge funds for the first nine months of 2014, which is a little below our annual budgeting target of 10% but cover the cost of the capital allocated from our 8% long-term debt.  Including principal investments our total return on invested capital was 3.4% for the quarter and 9.6% for the nine months ended in September as compared to 17.5% for last year. The decline was expected and is primarily due to a decrease in contribution from CLO-1 as it has been in repayment and to the higher cost of our long-term fixed rate debt compared to that of our short-term line of credit.  We remained patient in evaluating investment opportunities in the current near zero short term interest rate environment. We continue to believe that net investment income as we said at the beginning of the year will roughly cover corporate cost this year, as it has for the first three quarters of the year and this particular quarter third quarter covered it by $0.02 a share after tax.  In 2014 we targeted a 35% dividend payout ratio. And we have increased our dividend four times over the past 12 months to an annualized rate of $0.24 a share. That amount would represent a payout ratio of 36% on our latest 12 months operating earnings.  We have also repurchased more than $0.5 million shares in the past year at an average price of $6.51, distributing 21% of operating earnings in this manner. Our Board recently approved and increased our buyback authorization raising at the 1.5 million shares to roughly 7% of our shares outstanding, to note that’s just in the fourth quarter of this year.  On August 20th we announced that our Board of Directors had also approved their potential transaction through which JMP group would convert from a corporation into a limited liability company to be taxed as a partnership. On October 16th we filed an amended S4 proxy statement perspectives under the name of JMP GROUP LLC. That document contains complete information about the transaction including pro forma financial information and we encourage all of our shareholders to review it thoroughly. The potential restructuring is subject to a stockholder vote which is scheduled to take place on December 1st for stockholders of record as of October 28th. We believe that the potential transaction has significant merit for our shareholders and we are enthusiastic about the prospects. If the restructuring takes place, we believe our dividend payout ratio could increase materially depending on the mix of the earnings from our operating platforms which will remain fully tax corporations retaining a larger percentage of their earnings to support future growth and from that investment income at the publically traded partnership level which would be mostly pass-through to shareholders. Based on the current business mix adjusted for the restructuring transaction, we believe that the dividend payout ratio could increase to between 50% and 70% of operating earnings and if you look at the pro forma in the prospects you can see looking backwards for the first six months of this year at least the earnings would have been 25% plus higher. In closing I want to thank JMP’s employees and independent board members for their dedication and efforts, which yielded record nine months results and positioned us to continue our success in the quarters and years ahead. Operator, we’ll be happy to answer any questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And you first question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey with KBW.
Joel Jeffrey - KBW: Good morning, Just -- I wanted a follow up on little bit. The advisory business this quarter came in a bit stronger than what we had expected and I appreciate some of the commentary you gave earlier just wanted to see where you really saw the strength in that business? Was there any particular verticals or in any certain sectors and then how are you thinking about it through the end of the year and into 2015?
Joe Jolson: You know, Carter Mack here, he is the probably best person to answer that question, so I’ll just turn it over.
Carter Mack: Yes, the strength in the third quarter was in the healthcare verticals, we had a one rather large transaction for us that quarter. I would say as we look at our pipeline we’ve seen strength in the technology space and then in the healthcare space and in real estate. So it’s been pretty across the board but technology has definitely been very active on the M&A front.
Joel Jeffrey - KBW: And do you see that sort of continuing in the end of the year and into 2015 or this is this more sort of more towards that side?
Carter Mack: Yes, we feel good about the build in our M&A business. You can see it in the numbers and we have already closed one deal this quarter with a number of others that are scheduled to close others that are hopefully will announce before year end, so we feel good about the business going into next year and good about the fourth quarter.
Joe Jolson: It’s difficult to get market share numbers on the M&A business, but just when you look at our business, it’s in the -- I would say smaller CAP, under $1 billion kind of market CAP or values space and probably within that it’s closer to under $500 million. So it’s a little bit less sensitive to general market conditions because of that but its most sell-side assignments as well, which is banker or the kind of assignments that you want to get typically. And we have grown that area through selective hires in the last three years and we have had some people who progressed among the ranks internally here who are doing a really good job, who have been promoted and are coming on strong as well that’s been driving that.
Joel Jeffrey - KBW: Okay great and then just kind of lastly for me, it looks like the regulators have come out with some new capital requirements for CLO managers, can you talk a little bit about how that might impact your plans going forward?
Joe Jolson: Yes, it came out earlier this week and it hasn’t fully been written yet or known -- exactly all of the details, but from what I can gather right now you know it’s a positive surprise. The original proposal was that if you are sponsor of a CLO that until the -- during the reinvestment period until the pay downs of the notes started to occur after the reinvestment period, you weren’t allowed to getting your equity distributions that was in the original proposal. And they took that out. So that’s the most material positive, I mean, you never know about these things, but that would have been a negative game changer for all the money managers that manages CLOs if they would left that in there. And then the other thing that changed is that it’s going to go into effect two years from when they publish it in the federal registry, which hasn’t happened yet probably it will soon. But that’s late in 2016 and the original proposal was January 1st, 2016. So essentially that gives another year for people that manage third-party capital like we try to do in that business. So for instance our CLO that we closed a couple of weeks ago we put in about 13% of the capital. And that was all at the end when they wanted to upsize the deal and we had the opportunity to co-invest. So I think it’s -- I am not sure why they are focused on the CLO market in it, since there was any default of any security within and that and in most cases -- almost all cases they were returned to the sub-node holders through that period was very strong. But it somehow got kind of -- a lot of these things got taken into the [indiscernible] thing, but that being said we think its long-term positive for us. We are a public company with access to capital. And we think it’s a long-term positive for us and they don’t consolidate managers and short-term it’s positive too because they extended it by a year and made those changes. 
Joel Jeffrey - KBW:  So you don’t view the capital requirements is a negative figure business?
Joe Jolson:  If we got a crummy return on capital and we had to put the money in, then I would. But as I just mentioned even in this environment where if you talk to structured finance people, they will tell you that the kind of arbitrage if you will between the price that you can issue these node side and what you can buy the asset side isn’t very good right now. We underwrote to a 15% IRR and that’s pretty good. And under our conversion, where we convert to new structure here. 15% pretax become 15% after tax for our shareholders for those investments. Which is pretty powerful. I mean in terms of earnings accretion. 
Joel Jeffrey - KBW:  Great. Thanks for answering my questions. 
Joe Jolson:  Sure. 
Operator:  And your next question comes from the line of Alex Paris with Barrington Research.
Unidentified Analyst:  Hey guys its Alex and Joe. Just wanted to start, its Joe by the way. On the brokerage business. You guys in the quarter put a decent number of growth, overall industry volumes were down. Some of your competitors yesterday saw some significant downturns. I am just curious anything in the quarter that drove that? And then maybe second question would be, given the shorts spike we saw in October on volatility did you see trading volume rebound in a big way?
Joe Jolson:  Mark Lehmann is here. So I will let me start off to answer that question. 
Mark Lehmann:  Yeah, thanks. It was a good quarter. As Joe highlighted we did gain some market share. We made some investments about 18 months ago in our brokerage business. And I think we all know those take some time to season and having some of those people on our platform for well over a year now has I think given us the benefit of some of the relationships and some of the abilities to be more important on the buy side with some cliental. We have also fortunately seen that continue through October and the volatility certainly was [showing] that we were happy to see in some ways of the volatility up but certainly better than volatility down. I think our risk -- ability to manage risk is also been good.  So I think our upgrades that we have been talking about for several quarters are starting to bear some fruit. So we are confident that we will continue to gain market share. Obviously the volume which is been up significantly in October has helped everybody. But again I think we are on the path to gaining market share. And third quarter was demonstrating that and is continued into the fourth quarter. 
Joe Jolson:  I will just elaborate on that for a second. We would like to -- obviously you can pick out any number for your market share target. So we picked out a 1% target and maybe it takes us five years to get there instead of three years or four years. But I think it’s a reasonable target given what we do. Already you are doing as a business, it takes a while dealing with traditional and sequential investors which is the majority of our distribution which is little bit different than a lot of boutiques to get that kind of increased market share because they kind of manage that process over a multiple years.  Even though this is the business that probably isn’t a growing business, although it would be great if it was for the industry. We continue to think that we can grow this at double-digit compounded growth rate over the next five plus years. In some cases the law of small numbers works in your favor and this would be one of those cases we are hoping. 
Unidentified Analyst:  And then in investment banking. Maybe just talk about what you are seeing in Q4 any vertical? Any strength, weakness and maybe directionally the way you see it? I would happened to be on your website a few days ago and I was looking you guys are pretty good at putting your transactions up there that are pending. Pretty much they were assumed to be pretty decent volume in October. Just from a modeling perspective directionally would you expect to see that up in Q4 sequential basis?
Unidentified Analyst:  Seasonally we would expect to see investment banking related revenues go up. And I guess we are just trying to get a better idea of the pipeline going into the fourth quarter, did any deal slip from third quarter to fourth quarter? Things like that given market volatility?
Mark Lehmann: Yes, I think we had a few deals that ended up flipping to the fourth quarter and my general comment is we have seen a good level of activity so far in the fourth quarter. We did obviously with the spike in volatility for a couple of week that caused some slowdown in the IPO market, but we just priced book run at the biotech space on Tuesday night, so which has done well and we have a number deals that are out marketing and a number of deals that we expect to launch probably early November timeframe. As I said, we also feel good about some M&A deals closing and I would say the level of activity is good. And [following] a big change in the market environment I think will see good levels of activity throughout the first quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: So, Mark, you’ve said that in the M&A, this favor was healthcare, it was technology, is that the same flavor within IPO?
Mark Lehmann: Yes I would say that obviously, especially healthcare has been you know active this year. Probably the biggest year in biotech IPOs as we have seen and we continue to see activity there I would say the other thing that we are seeing is a lot of companies that we have taken public in the biotech space over the last couple of years are starting to come back to the marker with follow-on offerings and we have definitely seen some of that activity early in this quarter and we expect to see more of that as well, so we have new public market clients that are accessing the markets through follow on offerings and that’s another trend, but healthcare has been the most active. We have seen activity across all of our sectors. We have deals in the pipeline, IPOs in the pipeline across [FIG] and real estate and technology as well, but healthcare has definitely been the most the active.
Unidentified Analyst: That’s really helpful. So I just had a question for Joe. Joe, given the Board-approved transaction converting to a publicly traded limited liability corporation. I'm wondering, what feedback you're getting from the investor base? I know it was your intention to bring this company public years ago in this format, but at that point it was uncommon or it would be too unique to do. So now we are just coming full circle to what you wanted to do in the first place. It's obviously more tax efficient. Is there any pushback from the institutional community for this corporate structure?
Joe Jolson: I don’t think there is push back. There is -- it's little disruptive as you can see in our stock price because some of the shareholders that we thought could own the stock in that structure turned out within the organization where they have this stock. It wasn’t eligible to take a K1 and that’s something that was difficult to ascertain from the outside looking in. We obviously looked at who owned our stock and if they own any other publically traded partnership and they all did, but we didn’t know the source of the money within the organizations other that who the PMs were with it owned our stock and so that’s a little bit disappointing. If this was only 5% or 10% accretive once we learn that, we might have decided not to proceed, but given that it’s 30% accretive it’s pretty hugely material and it’s also that just the short term impact. You know longer term as I mentioned on our CLOs that are 15% return, in terms from a pretax number to an after tax number to grow the businesses is widely accretive in growing overtime, so absolutely I am a little bit -- I feel bad that it’s been little disruptive to some of our current shareholders. It’s one of the reasons the board increase the buyback to 1.5 million shares just for three month period here to try to help transition those shareholders that might not be able to -- are not able to take a K1. It’s really not so much a K1 that’s really more of the UBTI issue as it turns out than just getting a K1. But any case that’s kind of the feedback, I mean, everyone recognizes that it’s widely accretive, but there is a little disappointment that some of our shareholders that can’t own it in that structure.
Unidentified Analyst: Got you. It's not as unique as I was suggesting it would have been ten years ago. There's all sorts of alternative asset managers out there with this format that have reasonable amounts of institutional ownership. I'm just looking at Apollo Global with nearly 70%.
Joe Jolson: Yea that we think will find the institutions are the places within our current shareholder base that could own this stock, they don’t right now, over a some period of time it’s just short-term that I think it turned out to be a little bit more disruptive than we anticipated. 
Unidentified Analyst:  Alright. I hear you. Thank you very much. And good quarter. 
Joe Jolson:  Thank you. 
Operator:  And there are no further questions at this. 
Joe Jolson:  Great. Thanks everyone for your interest in JMP and we will look forward to following this up after we report our fourth quarter. Thank you. 
Operator:  Thank you. And this does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect your line.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-07-25 10:00:00) =====
Executives:  Andrew Palmer – Head, IR Joseph Jolson – Chairman and CEO Raymond Jackson – CFO Carter Mack – President Mark Lehmann – President, JMP Securities
Analysts:  Joel Jeffrey – KBW Alexander Paris – Barrington Research 
Operator: Welcome to JMP Group’s Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that today’s call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions). I am now turning the call over to Andrew Palmer, the company’s Head of Investor Relations.
Andrew Palmer: Good morning. Here with me today are Joe Jolson, JMP’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Ray Jackson the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by Carter Mack, President in JMP Group and Mark Lehmann President in JMP Securities. Before we get started I will note that some of this morning’s comments may contain forward-looking statements about future events that are out of JMP’s control. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied. For a discussion of uncertainties that could affect JMP’s future performance please see the description of risk factors included in our most recent 10-K. That said I’ll turn things over to our Chairman and CEO, Joe Jolson.
Joseph Jolson: Thanks Andrew. I am happy to report another solid quarter for JMP Group as JMP Securities continues to benefit from material market share gains since 2009 in combination with the research and equity capital markets environment. For the second quarter we generated record adjusted net revenues of $50.6 million and operating earnings of $0.18 a share. Excluding net investment income and corporate costs, our three operating platforms earned a record $0.65 per share for the latest 12 month period, an increase of 110% from $0.31 a share earned for the prior 12 month period. While we remain committed to active capital management, our tangible book value per share increased 13% in the past year to $6.16. In addition we returned 51% of our operating earnings in that period of time to stockholders through cash dividends and share buybacks. I am going to have Ray Jackson touch on some financial highlights and then Carter Mack will give some color on our strong investment banking results before I continue. Ray?
Raymond Jackson: Thanks Joe. Our adjusted net revenues of $50.6 million for the second quarter and $94.5 million for the first half were both record amounts, each growing more than 30% year-over-year. Our second quarter operating net income of $4.0 million or $0.18 per share and our six months total of $8.4 million or $0.37 per share both rose 22% year-over-year. For the quarter our adjusted operating margin was 12.9% and for the first half it was 15.1%. JMP Securities contributed $0.13 to operating EPS and generated an adjusted operating margin of 16.8% for the quarter. Excluding net investment income Harvest Capital Strategies and JMP Credit Advisors each contributed $0.02. Net investment income added $0.12 while corporate costs deducted $0.11. From an expense standpoint our adjusted compensation ratio excluding any strategic hiring cost was 71.8% for the quarter and was skewed upward as a result of significant incentive fees produced by Harvest Small Cap Partners. Our adjusted non-compensation expense ratio was 14.2%. From a balance sheet perspective our recourse debt-to-total capital ratio was 42% at June 30. Net cash and liquid securities equaled $1.21 per share and net invested capital, which includes less liquid investments was $5.85 per share. Stockholders equity all of which was tangible was a $134 million or $6.16 per share, up from $5.97 at March 31. Now I will turn the discussion over to Carter.
Carter Mack: Thanks Ray. JMP Securities produced excellent results in the second quarter with the investment banking group having its second best quarter in our history with $23.1 million of revenue for the quarter and $48.1 million for the first half of 2014, up 45% from the first half of 2013. JMP Securities as Joe said has benefitted from improved equity capital market conditions over the past year but has also benefited from continuing market share gains. JMP’s equity capital raising market share as measured by a percentage of total U.S. ECMPs earned were 57 basis points for the latest 12 months ended June 30, 2014 versus 44 basis points for the full year 2013. More importantly in our four targeted industry groups we grew ECMP market share to a 114 basis points in the latest 12 months versus 91 basis points for all of 2013. We continue to focus on wining a larger number of book managed transactions and increasing our economic fund co-managed transactions with the goal of achieving a 1% overall market share of all ECMPs by 2017. In the first half of 2014 we lead managed 16 public equity transactions versus 14 in the first half of 2013 and our share of lead managed transactions versus overall transactions increased to 25.4% up from 23.3% in the first half of 2013. An important factor driving these gains in JMP’s equity capital markets business has been a resurgent IPO market over the past year. We participated in 22 IPOs in the first half of 2014 versus 16 in the first half of 2013 and our current pipeline of IPOs on file is robust. JMP Securities has always benefited from a highly diverse investment banking platform, both in the industries that we cover and the range of investment banking products that we offer and that is very evident in the second quarter of 2014 and really highlights the continuing strength of our platform. In the first quarter of 2014 we benefited from the strongest life sciences equity capital markets environment that we have seen in our history. Our healthcare industry group in the first quarter accounted for 68% of total investment banking revenues and drove a record $25.1 million revenue quarter for JMP. We saw significant slowdown in this market in the first few months of the second quarter and deal activity in the biotech industry only really picked up in June. Despite this slowdown in the pace of deals in our healthcare practice we were able to produce our second best revenue quarter ever in investment banking and only $2 million off our record pace in the first quarter. These results were driven by significant pickup in our M&A business in the second quarter as well as higher revenue contributions from our real estate and technology industry groups. Our M&A revenues were $6.9 million on eight completed deals in the second quarter and $10.2 million on 11 total deals for the first quarter of 2014, almost double the $5.2 million in revenues on five transactions that we produced in the first half of 2013. Our strong M&A results were the result of our hiring efforts targeted towards productive senior M&A bankers over the past couple of years as well as an improving overall middle market M&A environment in the U.S... Overall investment banking revenues were also much more evenly distributed across our four industry practice areas in the second quarter with healthcare accounting for 32% of revenues, technology 28% of revenues, real estate 27% and financial services 13%. So despite the slowdown in the healthcare equity capital markets environment we benefited from growing contributions from other industry groups and product areas to produce a very strong revenue quarter. JMP’s investment banking platform is performing at a very high level. Our productivity per investment bankers is at the highest level in our history at $1.7 million in revenues per employee in the Group over the last 12 months versus $1.4 million per employee for the full year 2013. Revenues per Managing Director were $6.6 million in the latest 12 months versus $5.5 million for 2013, a number more comparable to productivity levels at some of our M&A focused peers. We are cautiously optimistic about the – with a robust pipeline of IPO and M&A transactions at JMP’s right across our four industry verticals and continued high levels of deal activity in the U.S. equity capital markets and an improving overall M&A environment. With that I will turn it back to Joe.
Joseph Jolson: Thanks Carter. Since early 2010 our strategic growth initiatives have been geared towards accelerating the revenue and earnings growth at our three operating platforms; JMP Securities, Harvest Capital Strategies and JMP Credit Advisors, thereby making net investment income an important but a smaller component of our total earnings. Our strategy was to grow JMP Securities market share opportunistically during the economic downturn through selected investment banking and research hires and by revamping our sales and trading distribution last year and by adding more high quality products. Our plan has been highly successful and has resulted in material revenue and earnings leverage as the capital markets normalized. In our four industry sectors, as Carter mentioned our share of common equity underwriting fees has grown from just 27 basis points in 2009 to a 114 basis points for the recent 12 month period. Also as Carter highlighted we’ve been successful at diversifying our investment banking revenues both by industry sector and by product during this period. Our share of institutional equities commissions revenues has also showed marked improvement in the past year according to the latest data available from [inaudible], increasing by 13.7% to an average of 35 basis points for trailing 12 months ended in March from an average of 31 basis points for the preceding 12 months. In asset management we’ve focused on our growing our assets under management at existing funds and selectively added new funds to the mix. Our sponsored client assets under management at Harvest Capital Strategy has grown at a compounded rate of just under 14% since the end of 2009. Asset management related fee revenues of $15.4 million for the quarter skyrocketed 277% from a year earlier largely due to a rise in hedge fund incentive fees to $11.2 million from $0.8 million a year ago. Harvest Small Cap Partners generated just a great quarter and a net return of 13.2% and it drove the majority of that amount. Total clients’ assets under management including sponsored funds from which we earn fees equaled $2.2 billion at the end of June, up from $1.8 billion a year ago. Hedge fund client assets under management, including sponsored funds increased by 9% during the quarter sequentially to $873 million. At period end 40% of our assets under management were in hedge funds and 60% were in private capital strategies. In our corporate credit segment we’ve looked to grow AUM since the CLO new issuance market reemerged in early 2012. As of June we were managing $890 million compared to $472 million at the end of 2012. We hope to be in the market with JMP CLO-3 in the coming months. If successful we would look to launch a new warehouse facility for JMP CLO-4 sometime around year end. All three of our business platforms made good progress in the second quarter combining to produce operating platform EPS of $0.17 compared to $0.19 in the previous quarter and $0.12 for the second quarter of 2013. As I mentioned earlier for trailing 12 month period operating platform EPS jumped to a record $0.65 a share versus $0.31 for the preceding 12 months. We earned an annualized gross return of 8.4% on our capital and our hedge funds for the first six months of this year which covered our average cost of the debt of around 8% but were still below our annual target of 10%. Including principal investments our total return on invested capital was 2.7% for the second quarter and 6% for the first half compared to 17.5% for the whole of 2013. As we’ve been discussing on previous earnings calls net investment income has declined over the past 12 months, primarily as JMP CLO-1 entered its repayment period and as we’ve issued long-term fixed rate debt including the issuance in January of this year with total of $94 million at a higher cost of money but we think it’s a good long-term decision. Both of these factors could remain a drag on our earnings till we deploy the resulting funds and strategic investments that meet our minimum target level of 15% IRR and then add to the growth of our core businesses. While we remain patient in evaluating opportunities in the current near zero short-term interest rate environment we continue to anticipate that net investment income will roughly cover our total corporate cost this year as it has in the first six months of this year and the trailing 12 months. In the past year as I mentioned earlier our tangible book value per share has grown by 13%, in addition to us returning 51% of operating earnings to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share buybacks. Since going public we’ve returned 70% of our operating earnings through active capital management emphasizing share buybacks. More recently we’ve looked to increase our dividend payout ratio to 35% and that’s led us to raise our dividend three times in the last year to last quarter a run rate of $0.20 a share. Due to better than expected first half earnings in 2014 that run rate represents a payout ratio of just 31% on our trailing 12 months results. We’ve also repurchased or settled nearly 620,000 shares in the past year at an average price of $6.51 a share and that amount represented 27% of our operating earnings. While the average price was above tangible book value at the time the reason these buybacks were accretive is that it was also below the price of employee stock awards granted over the last few years as those vest. We will continue to do our best to optimize alternatives for our strong free cash flow through active capital management which we believe could maximize the value for our shareholders over the longer-term. In closing I want to thank JMP’s employees and our independent Board members for their consistent focus and hard work which was best illustrated by another solid quarter and a record first half of the year for our company. Operator with that we can open the lineup for any questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey with KBW.
Joseph Jolson: Hello.
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: Yes, Joe.
Joseph Jolson: Hey Joel how are you.
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: I am doing well. How are you?
Joseph Jolson: Very good. Thanks.
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: Just wanted to ask on the incentive fees, it’s my understanding it sounds like most of those are paid out to the portfolio managers. Exactly how much of that is paid out as comp and how much does the company actually keep?
Joseph Jolson: Well we’ve never really disclosed that in part because it depends on the fund and the strategy. But I think that it’s fair to stay that our highest comp ratio at the firm by far would be incentive fees on our internally managed hedge funds. You can make your own judgment but I think if another way of looking at that might be that if our incentive fees for the same dollar amount is our principal income for a quarter the average of that would be more in line with the 60% to 65% comp ratio that we’re targeting longer-term for the company. So in a quarter like this where incentive fees were so large relative to the principal income you get a little distortion there in the overall comp ratio.
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: Yeah, because when we just run the numbers quickly it seemed like if you backed out the 11.2 form the asset management fees and from the comp, the comp ratio actually looked sort of in the 65% range which seems like it would be consistent given the strong investment banking numbers that you guys had during the quarter. Is that kind of an appropriate way to think about it?
Joseph Jolson: Yes, I think so.
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: Okay.
Joseph Jolson: We understand Joel, we understand that those OpEx are a little bit confusing and we’ve been thinking about maybe restructuring that business in a way that while it might reduce the overall revenues from a GAAP point of view and the volatility of those revenues it would lead to a similar bottom line and kind of take some of that distortion out of our numbers that is confusing to investors.
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: Okay, and then I appreciate some of the color you guys gave us on the investment side, particularly the M&A side, just wondering I know you guys have a hired a few guys over the past few years and typically these bankers come on board and take some little while to get up to speed but given your sort of productivity per MD number is as strong as they are I’m just wondering have these guys gotten traction faster than you had expected or is there still potentially more upside to come as these guys ramp up?
Joseph Jolson: I’ll Carter take that but let me just tell you kind of from a pop down point of view that the reason that our bankers are as productive as they are because the markets are strong but also because of all the different products that we’ve added to their mix over the last few years and that’s really helped I think so. I will turn it over to Carter.
Carter Mack: Yeah. I think that’s true and I think the bankers that we’ve brought on board have kind of had a normal productivity level increases. We still expect some of the more recent hires to ramp up their contribution levels. But yeah we’re definitely producing at a higher level across the platform and it’s, as Joe said I think we’re benefiting from a lot of our products being in demand in our diverse industry groups.
Joseph Jolson: I mean if you look at like in maybe as back as 2009 we really didn’t have a debt advisory business or any significant play in the convertible security side for instance and in a lot of our corporate relationships use those products. So adding those products to the relationships and calling efforts has been leveragable in that productivity number as opposed to just being more of a single product company focused on either M&A or equity capital markets.
Carter Mack: Yeah, and the latest 12 months figure that I gave for $6.6 million per MD and $1.7 million per employee, captures a really strong second half of 2013 when we had a really good year on the convertible side and then a really strong first half of 2014, in both M&A and equity capital market. So it definitely is one of our stronger 12 month period.
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: Okay and then sort of more.
Joseph Jolson: I mean Joel not to belabor that but another way of looking at that is we don’t – obviously no one in our business controls the size of the equity capital market fee pie every year. There is some cyclicality to that obviously and we are enjoying a good cycle right now. But I do think that our penetration of lead managing more deals and getting better economics on the deals that we co-manage is also benefiting those numbers and so far number of deals doesn’t change over the next five years but our penetration of that does. You could see those productivity numbers continue to move up.
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: On that point, what do you think has been the primary driver in your ability to get better economics on deals or get better positioning on some of these things. Has it been increased research coverage, has it been refusal to sort of take a co-manager role just sort of curious as to the strategy in that.
Carter Mack: It’s kind of a combination of things, it takes a lot of time and it takes, being on a lot of covers and then it takes starting to have more discipline about what you will take on. As you said I mean we have started to really push back on lower economics, turning down deals when we are not getting the economics that we think make sense for what we are delivering. But that takes time. It has been a long process and I think we are at a position now where we have been quite active in the equity capital markets. I think we proved ourselves and done well on a number of lead managed transaction and that kind of built on itself. So that’s really just a process and having discipline about what you are willing to take on, what you are willing to turn down.
Joseph Jolson: There is also just the model if you just step back of the kind of boutique model where it’s heavily focused on touches with companies away from just investment banking, with research and then corporate access and as good investment bankers that are experienced and focused on their space as opposed to product guys. That model over any period of time, if you execute on it successfully and stick with it should lead to greater market share of the wallet of the issuer.
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: And then just lastly from me the improvement in the capital raising market, I mean is this still being driven by the increased opportunities from the jobs act or is this just a better economic environment and things are just rolling along regardless.
Joseph Jolson: I will give you like kind of the really bold up answer here. Okay, is that you know the Jobs Act has benefited us by increasing the number of smaller IPOs which I think is a permanent or secular shift unless there’s lesser some regulation down the road that would change that, okay. But I do think that if you look at the high grade fixed income business, that’s for the most part has been in a very long term bull market right where you saw interest rates very high in the early 80s, late 70s inflation very high, disinflation and then essentially over a long period of time you got down to very low, at almost zero short term interest rates, very low kind of 10 years. So I mean without trying to forecast that a lot of money chased those returns and it’s sitting there in fixed income plan and there are some people – I am one of them that thinks over the next 10 years if the economy improves and inflation normalizes, you are likely to see money rotating out of these funds and back into better risk-adjusted return types of investments and so being in the equity side of the business for the most part we have had to suffer as everyone have else in our peer group to a better market essentially from a sector point of view compared to the bond side of the business and so if you want to be bullish about it longer term which we are we think there could be a long term rotation back to equities that we think we are very well positioned for it.
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: Great, thanks for taking my questions.
Joseph Jolson: No problem.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Alex Paris with Barrington Research.
Alexander Paris – Barrington Research: Congratulations on a good quarter too.
Joseph Jolson: Thank you.
Alexander Paris – Barrington Research: Hey just kind of staying with the line of thought with Joel and his previous comments just on the pipeline and I think Carter called it robust. Are you seeing may be is that kind of sector weighted towards any one particular sector, is it kind of more broad-based and as we look into the back half of the year I know it’s hard to predict given what market activity will look like. But you’re kind of comping up a pretty good 2013 number, may be expectations as we move through and is that pipe when you say robust, is it – kind of where we were last year is it bigger or smaller or may be just some color on that would be helpful, thanks.
Joseph Jolson: Yeah we don’t really give pipeline comparison numbers but just on a general tone, it’s we had an active last few weeks, I guess you could say in the IPO market with a number of deals in the market for us. We just priced a book run deal yesterday, another deal today that we were lead manager on. Now the composition currently is heavily weighted in the life sciences space and we are seeing a resurgence in the life sciences activity. So the near term pipeline, I guess you could say is more healthcare focused over the midterm, deals that we think will come out post Labor Day, I think it’s going to be much more diversified given the deals that we have – that are on file confidentially right now. And the pipeline on the M&A front we have a number of deals that are on track to close and one in particular with a fairly large fee. It feels better on the M&A front than it did mid-year last year and it feels as good or better on the IPO front. So that’s about much of a crystal ball as I can give. We were just starting to see a real resurgence in IPOs mid-year last year whereas this year we are seeing a steady level of activity from the beginning of the year.
Alexander Paris – Barrington Research: Okay and then in terms of like headcount with bankers I know you have made investments in the advisory M&A space. Outside of advisory are you still looking to add, I know you are been opportunistic but has the headcount been moving higher?
Joseph Jolson: Headcount’s been flat I think but it kind of varies because we have this mid-summer increase with corporate finance analysts and then we have some departures of analysts. But yes we are very much actively looking to add bankers. We added a few at the beginning of this year and we continue to have discussions. We would like to add people especially in technology and that’s an ongoing effort. So yeah we believe that given how we can get bankers up to the productivity levels we talked about, that’s the best way to grow our business and we think adding productive senior level bankers is going to mean meaningful revenue growth over the next few years.
Alexander Paris – Barrington Research: Okay, great and one last question and I’ll jump back in queue, on the brokerage side of the house, we have talked in the past about the turnover, the disruption that’s caused with clients, you’ve kind of gone back up to critical mass from 200 names to 400 names, you mentioned we have 500 in the coverage, how has that been translating with the clients, are they starting to re-engage directionally may be as we look in the back half of the year, would you like to see that business grow? I mean I know you would like to but I mean your expectations are that it will grow?
Joseph Jolson: Well I have Mark Lehmann here who is President at JMP Securities. So I will let him give you some color on that. But just generally speaking we are more focused on market share because we can’t really control the size of the pie and I guess what you say in the second quarter for industry, active institutional volume was a good size drop off right in terms of trading activity and we are not immune from that. I think we continue to pick up market share but when you have like a low to mid-teens drop industry wide kind of thing you know that from one quarter to the next it’s virtually impossible with an organic strategic to be able to offset that quickly. But I will turn it over to Mark.
Mark Lehmann: Yeah. I agree with what Joe said. I’d also say the majority of our changes in headcount occurred in 2013. So the benefits of that should really start to inure to our platform I think in the back half of this year or next year.
Joseph Jolson: Like in second half of 2014.
Mark Lehmann: 2014 and ‘15. I think it takes a little while for some of these people to get up to speed, account coverage changes happened and getting comfortable with your new sales person in your team. Fortunately we’ve had a lot of consistency on the research side. So we would expect those benefits to start to show. But Joe’s is right, the down double-digits in terms of overall volumes are painful to everybody but we do think our market share is heading in the right direction and will continue to because again those changes happened in 2013 and there is been some consistency. The other thing I think you will also see as Carter mentioned is when our capital market-to-market share goes up I think or just our brand goes up in front of people and the number of deals that we’re on and the number of successful deals. And life science has been a good vertical where there has not only been a lot of IPOs but there’s been a lot of M&A and a lot of great calls by our research analysts, I think we’re kind of top of mind where some of these funds were before. It just took some more time. So again I would expect that to happen in the back half of this year and next year given the fact that our personnel changes are basically over.
Joseph Jolson: The other thing I’d add is that unlike a lot of firms including most boutiques we’re much more balanced with the traditional money managers that have a vote process then one would expect for a smaller company in this space that would tend of to be over-weighted to hedge funds. And so that’s good and bad but essentially when you have a vote process there is a little bit longer lag between stepping up your game and then seeing the resulting votes six to 12 months later.
Alexander Paris – Barrington Research: Great. Thanks guys.
Joseph Jolson: Okay
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
Joseph Jolson: Hey, great. Well we appreciate you guys’ interest in JMP and we look forward to giving you updates as the quarter goes on. Thank you.
Carter Mack: Thank you.
Operator: And thank you. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). Please also note today’s event is being recorded. And at this time I'd like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Thomas Splaine, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.
Thomas Splaine : Thank you Jamey and good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. I'm Thomas Splaine, the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And we'll begin this afternoon’s call with the forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp may make some forward-looking statements with respect to our financial position, our results of operations, business and prospects. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Investors Bancorp’s control and are difficult to predict and can cause our actual results to materially differ from those expressed or forecasted in these forward-looking statements. In our press release and in our earnings release, we have included our Safe Harbor disclosure. We refer you to that statement and these documents are incorporated into this presentation. For a more complete discussion of certain risks and uncertainties affecting Investors Bancorp, please see the section entitled Risk Factors and Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in Investors Bancorp’s filings with the SEC. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Cummings; and Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Domenick Cama.
Kevin Cummings: Thanks, Tom. And good afternoon, not good morning, it’s a good afternoon, I appreciate you’re getting on the call so late in the afternoon right before the holiday. One thing I’d like say thank you to -- I appreciate that our accounting and financial group’s efforts in getting our earnings out in record time this quarter. Thank you very much. And I’d also like to say upfront that under advice of our SEC council we can now comment on the second step offering and that this call is focused just on the results of our first quarter. It continues to be a busy quarter here at Investors as we continue to grow and expand our markets in New York and New Jersey. In the first quarter, we closed the GCF transaction which added $250 million in deposits and $195 million in loans. This transaction was a mutual to MHC transaction and no shares were issued to the public and all shares were issued to the Investors MHC. This transaction along with a previous Roma transaction have greatly increased our shares outstanding at the MHC and this will hopefully enhance our second step valuation and appraisal. In March we converted the quarter operating systems of the Roma and Roma Asia franchises and it’s good to have everyone on the same operating system. We also changed all the signage and marketing materials and we did that all in one weekend in March without any major problems or issues. We’ve become quite adept at doing those things in one weekend. It was 26 branches and everything went out without issue. For the quarter net income was $34.4 million versus $27.2 million in 2013, which represents a 27% increase from the prior year. Our net interest margin was flat compared to last year at 3.26% and has dropped 5 basis points, compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Prepayment penalties were $4.1 million in 2014 versus $3.1 million in 2013 and $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. One of the big things of this quarter is our asset quality continues to improve as our non-performing loans, including performing TDR’s were at 1% of total loans and our non-accrual loans were at only 88 basis points for the first quarter. The non-accrual loans are broken down as follows. The biggest piece of that is in the residential and consumer portfolio at $79.4 million and our commercial portfolio which approximates us $7.2 billion, has only $18.3 million with 25 basis points for a total non-accruals of $97.7 million. In the commercial portfolio there is one loan for $10 million originated by Investors in March of 2008 that is well secured with an appraisal for $15 million. The remaining $8.3 million in the commercial portfolio of the non-accrual portfolio, there is $7 million of loans from prior acquisitions. These acquisitions are Marathon, American and Roma banks. And $1.3 million in six more loans originated by Investors Bank. You know we’re pretty happy with that result and are going into the second step; going into the growth period. If you look at the 380 -- in 2007 our commercial book was $380 million. That book, the Investor book has grown to $6.5 billion and we have close to only $11.3 million in non-accrual loans, which represents 17 basis points. Our allowance coverage ratio to non-accrual loans is 185%. Our allowance for total loans is 1.33 and our allowance to total loans originated by Investors is 151. So we’ve always said that at the time of the second step we’d want to have a fortress balance sheet and we’ve think we’ve accomplished that while maintaining a significant amount of growth, growing from $380 million in 2007, at the end of 2007 to almost $6.5 billion today. That’s on the commercial side. With respect to operating expenses we had a noisy quarter again as GCF expenses and some severance payments from the Roma came through which totaled $1.4 million. Plus we had about $1.3 million due to the severe winter, mainly snow removal of course. With those items out of the picture, we would have had approximately $75 million OpEx run rate for the quarter. The fact of the matter is our headcount continues to grow. We are a bigger bank that will get bigger and we have invested in our headcount. We have hired more talented employees in all areas of the bank including regulatory risk management and technology and operations. We started, we also have started to incur consulting fees with respect to our core effort conversion which approximated $300,000 in this quarter. And one thing we’d like to note is because of the timing of the Roma conversion and the timing of the GCF conversion which is scheduled for June of this year, we haven’t anticipated or we haven’t seen the anticipated cost saves on those transactions yet. On a positive note, we continue to move our ORE properties off the balance sheet as we recorded a gain in other income for the fourth consecutive quarter on the sale of residential ORE. We recorded a gain of $131,000 and we have gone four straight quarters with gains on ORE totaling 1.7 million over the last four quarters. Again, we try to be conservative in our marks and move these assets in the most economical way off our balance sheet. In addition, in other income we had a bargain purchase gain of 1.5 million relating to the GCF acquisition and our investment advisory group had an increase of 300,000 over last year as we made progress and headway in the Roma and GCF markets. These gains were offset by a decrease in mortgage banking revenue of $2.8 million, which was offset by a recovery of loans acquired in business combinations of $1.4 million. All in, it was a busy quarter for the bank as we prepare to complete our second step transaction. We believe we have demonstrated a compelling story for the bank, which has achieved its benchmarks for the second step, 10% return on equity, 8% capital ratios and payment of dividends. Going forward, we think this formula works well for us. It’s based on organic growth and when you look at our organic growth over the last -- since we’ve gone public it’s about $6 billion since 2007, smart acquisitions that do not to dilute tangible book value. We have about $4 billion in acquisitions that have come through, eight acquisitions since our first acquisition in June of 2008 and we have $77 million in goodwill on the books. We had stock buybacks where we brought approximately 30% of the public shares and then payment of dividend and finally we want to maintain a fortress balance sheet or MPAs of less than 1%. But most importantly, we continue to create an exciting and engaging culture for our employees and the management team who have embraced our core values. Last quarter, began a tradition of recognizing one of our employees that we call an unsung hero who has done an outstanding job for us and has embraced our core values of character, cooperation, commitment and community. There are so many people here at the bank working so hard, whether it’s at the KBW stock center working on mergers and integrations and driving and continuing the momentum of change to make us the best community bank in our market. This quarter’s unsung hero is Joe Valenti, our Senior Vice President and Facilities Manager. He is our go to guy to get things done and continues to maintain what we call the plumbing, literally the plumbing of this organization. His group has managed the renovation, relocation and new construction of approximately 60 branches over the last few years which included a budgeted cost of $55 million. He has managed our response to Superstorm Sandy and somehow got us through this tough winter. He has done everything we need him to do and then some. He is like a Cal Ripken, a Derek Jeter in that he’s the ultimate team player and there can no better compliment than to be known as teammate that makes other people, other players better. I call it the Jason Kidd rule. I thank Joe and all our employees for their values and their efforts to make Investors a special place to work. Hopefully, this will be our last call as an MHC. It has been a great run where we have learned a lot and hopefully improved in every aspect of this banking business. We have many opportunities ahead of us. We are in great markets and we have the team to execute on our plans to be a major regional force in this New York, New Jersey region. And that New York, New Jersey region is the best market in the world. I would like to thank all of you for your support and I thank our employees for their dedication and hard work. It is a very exciting time at the bank and I thank you all for your support and efforts. Now, I would like to open it up for questions.
Operator: At this time, we’ll begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Laurie Hunsicker from Compass Point. Please go ahead with your question.
Laurie Hunsicker - Compass Point: I just wondered if you could expand a little bit, as you’ve said you’ve done eight acquisitions as part of your three pronged strategy and you’ve done it without diluting tangible book and obviously as you get out of this MHC structure you no longer can buy mutuals and MHCs. If you could just tell us how you look at -- how you think about tangible book dilution and may be targets for how big you see yourself in two years, three years, five years? Thank you.
Kevin Cummings: Well certainly we’re going to be opportunistic as far as looking at what comes to us with this capital. We estimate we’ll be at 18% capital. Domenick and I talk about this all the time. We chatted about it this morning. We’re going to be major shareholders and protecting tangible book value is going to be very important. We can’t let our egos get in the away just to do a deal because of a certain size. If you look at the transactions, lot of them are going to be coming our way. Domenick’s getting calls all the time. We’re going to have to be disciplined and do the same things we’ve done over the past six years since 2008. If you look at our plan -- if you look at the organic growth that we have had, we started in the commercial real-estate business with half a dozen people, 10 people. Now we have a commercial division of over 100 people. So we feel that we could leverage this new capital by growing anywhere from $1.2 billion to $1.8 billion per year over the next six years, that’s almost $10 billion. So we don’t feel any pressure to do a deal just for the sake of doing a deal and we’re going to be hopefully good stewards of capital and protect our interest -- protect my own personal interest, because I don’t want to be at a shareholders meeting and have people yelling at me.
Domenick Cama: And Laurie, and if I can add, this is Domenick, we have been vocal about the immediate future beyond the second step that we don’t foresee any transactions going out 12 months to 18 months for a number of reasons. One is certainly we want to make sure that our stock is starting to mature and starts to carry a multiple that is more mature. And second is that given our strategic plan, we see a growth in the portfolio given our loan production machine of giving us enough fuel to continue to leverage the capital and grow the bank accordingly.
Operator: And our next question comes from Christopher Marinac from FIG Partners LLC. Please go ahead with your question.
Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners LLC: Kevin, I want to ask little bit about loan growth and what you are seeing in pipelines and the pace of growth we see this quarter, can that accelerate just given seasonality in Q1 versus Q2 and Q3?
Domenick Cama: Chris, this is Domenick. The pipeline is up a little bit from our last quarter. It’s just shy of $1 billion and still has a concentration of multifamily loans. Although we are changing direction a little bit in that. We’re focusing some more business in the commercial real estate sector and the C&I business. So while multifamily still comprise a majority of the pipeline, we’re starting to see some growth in our commercial real estate and C&I portfolio.
Kevin Cummings: Chris, one of the things we’ve recognized, back in 2007, 2008, the commercial portfolio was less than -- at the end of 2007 it was less than $400 million. We didn’t have to worry about prepayments and amortization of the portfolio. That’s a headwind that we recognize going forward. But we have more and better resources now than we had in 2007. So hopefully we have the machine in place. We originated on the residential and the book side over $5 billion in loans last year and hopefully on the residential side it would be difficult to maintain it but certainly on the commercial side we have the increased resources. The investments that we made while being an MHC, the investments that we’ve made in -- I’d look at the allowance for loan losses and other things like that. In 2007 our allowance was $8 million. It was 20 basis points on a total portfolio of $4 billion. Today it’s 133 basis points on a $13.5 billion portfolio. So we funded that all through this recession and went from $12 million in net income and made $34 million in this quarter.
Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners LLC: Great, and I guess Kevin just as a follow up, when is the next time that the Board would revisit the dividend? Is that later this year or do they look at it on a quarterly basis?
Kevin Cummings: Chris, we will look at it on a quarterly basis.
Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners LLC: Should we think that the payout ratio evolves more over time as the bank continues to have success?
Kevin Cummings: Chris, we have not revealed at this point what we expect to happen to the dividend, but suffice it to say that given the conversion from a mutual holding company to a full public company, obviously there’re be a lot more shares in the company. And while we have begun to do the analysis and are starting to zero in on where we want to be, we haven’t revealed it at this point. So we’re not going to discuss it on this call.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Keating from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question
Matthew Katten - Barclays Capital: So, if I heard correctly, I think you said that the core operating expense run rate this quarter was around $75 million. I think last quarter you kind of guided to, once you kind of get through the data processing conversion, obviously you got Roma done this quarter and GCF is maybe scheduled for June. But I think at that point, last time you said maybe you could get expenses down to $69 million, $70 million range. Does that still feel like an achievable target at this point? Thanks.
Kevin Cummings: No, we don’t see 70 million as being the run rate going forward. We continue to build the risk management infrastructure, credit infrastructure, bringing on new employees. And so, while our expenses for the quarter were approximately 77 million, we think that being in the $75 million range is probably the new run rate quarterly going forward.
Matthew Katten - Barclays Capital: Understood. Thanks for that clarification. And then I guess just on the tax, I know there was some noise this quarter with the change in the New York state tax code but is a 38% type run rate what your expectations are at the moment?
Thomas Splaine: Yes, for taxes what we’re looking at now with the change in the state tax rate in New York, we’re looking at somewhere probably in the neighborhood of 38.5% to 39%, somewhere in that ballpark right now as these tax laws get reviewed and hammered through but that should be a pretty good area for you guys.
Matthew Katten - Barclays Capital: Okay. And do you think you’ll have to add anymore headcount in the risk management area. I know you have made significant investments over time but I guess post the second step, do you have expectations to hire a lot more on that front or it shouldn’t really change necessarily what you’re doing on that front? Thanks.
Kevin Cummings: I wouldn’t say that it’s a lot more. We continue to be diligent in our efforts to meet all of our regulatory obligations. The regulators are in here all the time given the size of the Company and so we will continue to make some investments there but I would not say from a headcount perspective that it’s a lot more.
Operator: And everyone at this time, I’m showing no additional questions. I would like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Okay. That’s a record. I appreciate everyone’s participation. We are excited about our future prospects here and maybe I’ll just get a chance to see you once we hit the road for the second step. So everyone have a great holiday. I wish you the best and thank you for participating on the call. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today’s conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your telephone lines.

Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the ISBC Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Thomas Splaine, the company's CFO. Please go ahead.
Thomas F. Splaine: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm Thomas Splaine, the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And we'll begin this morning's call with the standard forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp may make some forward-looking statements with respect to our financial position, our results of operations, business and prospects. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Investors Bancorp’s control and are difficult to predict and can cause our actual results to materially differ from those expressed or forecasted in these forward-looking statements. In our press release and in our earnings release, we have included our Safe Harbor disclosure. We refer you to that statement, and these documents are incorporated into this presentation. For a more complete discussion of certain risks and uncertainties affecting Investors Bancorp, please see the section entitled Risk Factors and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations set forth in Investors Bancorp’s filings with the SEC. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Cummings; and Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Domenick Cama.
Kevin D. Cummings: Good morning, and thank you, Tom. To say that Investors had a busy fourth quarter would be a huge understatement. In the last 2 months, we closed 2 acquisitions, Roma and GCF, which were long anticipated. And then finally, we've made the historic announcement of our second step. At our December 18 board meeting, the Board of Directors approved to move forward with our second step transaction as we met the criteria that we had set out in our strategic plan and our strategic goals that management had set many, many years ago, and they were: a 10% return on equity; capital ratios -- tangible capital ratio down to 8% level; pay a dividend; and build a fortress balance sheet. Over the last 8-plus years as a public company, we have made great strides to transform the business plan and transform the culture of this bank. In fiscal 2007, our very first full year as a public company, our return on equity and return on tangible equity was approximately 2.5%. Our resi and consumer loans comprised 93% of our loan portfolio. The allowance was 19 basis points. Our deposits were $3.7 billion, of which only 24%, $891 million, was core deposits. Those core deposits have grown $6.4 billion since we have gone public, since the end of fiscal 2007, 6.5 years ago. Our loans, our commercial loans, are up $6.7 billion and our resi and consumer loans are up $2.8 billion. And as I said earlier, our return on tangible equity is approximately 11.4% versus the 2.5% over that period of time. The change in our company has been dynamic. In 2007, we had 46 branches and 475 employees. Today, we have 133 branches, including GCF, and over 1,500 employees. We have made significant investments in our back office, which has grown from less than 50 employees, 50 technology and back office people, to now close to 180. Our risk management area has grown to keep up with the change in our business, and we will continue to invest in our risk management and our infrastructure to ensure we maintain our growth and to protect the bank and manage the bank in a safe and prudent manner. At this time, we are well-positioned for our second step. We are cautiously optimistic that we can close the transaction in the second quarter but we are still awaiting regulatory approval. We look forward to the excitement of the capital-raising process and look forward to your continued support. Because of legal requirements, that is all we can say or will say about this long-anticipated announcement. We had a very strong year and quarter as we posted record earnings, and it was our 24th consecutive quarter of core earnings excluding merger and OTTI charges exceeding 15% or better year-over-year. Core earnings for the fourth quarter and 2013, for the year ended 12/31, were at $31.6 million in the third quarter and $116.1 million, respectively, versus approximately $97 million and $25.8 million in 2012. This reflects a 20% and 22% increase for the year and the quarter, respectively. On a return on equity and return on tangible equity basis, core earnings were 10.6% return and 11.6% for the quarter, respectively. Throughout our history as a public company, we have stuck to our principles of managing the company with the following guidelines to leverage our capital base: organic growth; thoughtful, smart acquisitions that do not to dilute tangible book value. And on that note, we always get asked the question what will we do with the second step proceeds, and one of the answers I give is that, many times over the course of the past few years, we felt like a baseball general manager who stayed during the Winter Meetings. The best trade I made this winter was the one I did not make. Keeping that discipline will help us in our post-second step environment. And then finally, stock buybacks and paying the dividend will be a strategic initiative once we get back and get approval to do stock buybacks. We believe our past performance will serve us well as we prepare the second step capital raise. But we stay focused on creating shareholder value and continue to make investments in our back office, what I call the plumbing, our risk management with respect to credit, compliance and regulatory risk. We will be well-prepared to leverage our second step proceeds. The closing of the Roma transaction and our loan and deposit growth are the highlights of this quarter. On a standalone basis, the Investors loan portfolio grew to over $12 billion, which reflects approximately 4.5% growth for the quarter and 15.4% for the year. Originations were strong for the quarter. And in January 2014, we are off to our best start in the history of the company. Just in the last few days, I've been out on calls with our loan officers with a major health care provider, a long time well-known New Jersey real estate developer and a significant national real estate capital management company. These opportunities are coming to us as we continue to build our brand and our reputation for customer service continues to grow. With the additional capital, hopefully this momentum will continue to propel us and allow us to increase market share with high-quality credits. The margin held up well for the quarter at 3.41%, a 3-basis point improvement from the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we had approximately $5.1 million in prepayment fees versus $4.1 million in the third quarter, $3.6 million in the second and $3.1 million in the first quarter of 2013. Our credit quality continues to improve, and we continue to maintain a cautious view with respect to our allowance for loan losses due to our growth and the overall credit risk to our business. The New York market, principally in Manhattan and Brooklyn, are strong, but the average worker is still struggling in this economy due to high health care costs and a slow recovery in the job market. It is a low velocity economy despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve via the low interest rate policies. Having said that, we still believe the New York-New Jersey market is the strongest in the world and our goal is to become the leading community bank headquartered in this region, one that is focused, first and foremost, on our local customers, the neighborhood not-for-profit and to be the best corporate citizen, leading the way to improve our communities through the engagement and commitment of our employees and management team. We need to lead by example. We need to be leaders that serve, not self-serving leaders. Our nonperforming assets totaled $148.5 million at year end, which includes approximately $11.3 million from the Roma transaction. Most importantly, our nonaccrual loans totaled 39 loans and totaled $26.1 million, with the largest one being a $10 million loan, which has a recent appraisal for $15 million, and the next 2 largest loans are a participation loan from an acquisition at $2.5 million and a multi-family loan for $3.1 million. The remaining commercial loan nonaccruals totaled $10.5 million, an average less than $300,000 per loan. We are currently evaluating a cleanup note sale for these and other Roma loans for the first quarter or early second quarter of this year. Our commercial NPLs, our commercial nonperforming -- or our commercial nonaccrual loans is 37 basis points at the end of the year. We are pleased to report that our provisions continue to exceed net charge-offs of $2.1 million and if you back out our acquired loans from our recent acquisitions of Brooklyn, Marathon and Roma, our allowance coverage ratio to total loans approximates 1.5%. In December, we sent our loan review teams into Roma to do a full review of the performing and nonperforming portfolio, as we've been monitoring that portfolio from a distance through the most of 2013. These reviews covered 75% of that portfolio, and we are satisfied with the quality of that portfolio at this point in time, that we have adequate credit marks against the nonperforming assets. I'm happy to report that we have approved in December and January approximately $106 million in new commercial loans in this market, in the Roma market and the Philadelphia market. And we are making great strides on both the retail and the commercial side in creating new businesses in that market since we closed the transaction in December. This Mercer County-Philadelphia market is a great opportunity for us. We have both the retail and commercial teams in place to capitalize on this market opportunity. Other than Sun National, there are no local community banks headquartered in this region over $2 billion, and we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize and partner with the Roma and GCF teams to bring the Investor customer experience to the southwest part of our state and the Philadelphia markets. On the retail side, deposits grew $2.1 billion, of which, approximately $1.3 billion came from Roma, $736 million came from organic growth, and while we maintained our cost of funds for the quarter, are relatively flat. We energized our retail team with a promotional incentive in the fourth quarter and some new promotional products, and they did a great job bringing in new customer relationships. As you know, as a regional bank over $10 billion are regulated view of liquidity from a different perspective than when were below $10 billion, and we do closely watch our loan to deposit ratio and borrowings to asset ratio as they become key metrics for the company. At this time, I'm going to start something new on our quarterly calls. I'd like to take this type of opportunity to highlight one of the unsung heroes at the bank. I will start to do this on our quarterly calls to congratulate one of our employees who has done a fantastic job and has embraced the core values of Character, Commitment, Cooperation and Community, 4 Cs. And if there were 2 other Cs, it would be -- it wouldn't be Cummings and Cama, it would be caring, because no one cares how much you know until you show them how much you care, and confidence. This person embraces all of those characteristics. And so many of our teams are working so hard that I need to tell you, our owners, what a great job and what a great team you have in place. This quarter's unsung hero is Mary Anne Wade, [ph] the Manager of Financial Reporting for the company. Mary Anne has led the team and filed our S-1 document in a record time and continues to coordinate our financial and reporting activities. In addition, during this time, she participated on a special task force, what we call project insight team, at the bank to improve employee communications, morale and to make Investors one of the best banks in the country to work for. Her team, along with our investment bankers and attorneys, are doing a great job supporting management in our strategic plan and executing on our second step opportunity. I thank Mary Anne and all our employees for their values and their efforts to make Investors a special place to work. They lead by example and understand that people do what they see, not what they hear. In summary, we continue to stay focused on the execution of our strategies and our business plan to become the premier commercial banking franchise in the New York-New Jersey metro marketplace. With GCF, we now have 130-plus branches from the suburbs of Philadelphia to the boroughs of New York and Long Island. We have leveraged our capital down to 7.9%. Our ROE is over 10% and we are paying a dividend. Our experience over the last 8 years as an MHC has positioned us to execute a successful second step transition -- transaction. We will continue to manage the company using the 3 levers: prudent organic growth, smart acquisitions that did not dilute tangible book value and stock buybacks and dividends. Our track record and history will serve us well as we move to our next phase as a 100% public company. We look forward with great excitement to the next 12 to 24 months. We have many opportunities ahead of us and we will have the capital to execute on our plans to be a major regional force in the New York-New Jersey market, the best market in the world. I'd like to thank all of you for your support and thank our employees for their dedication and hard work. It is a very exciting time at the bank, and we really appreciate the support and this opportunity. Thank you, and I'll be glad to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matthew Breese from Sterne Agee.
Matthew Breese - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Now, with the acquisitions closed, I was just curious where we can expect core expenses to settle out in 2014?
Domenick A. Cama: Matt, this is Domenick. The -- we're looking at expenses to be a run rate of about $69 million to $70 million a quarter. However, we don't expect to see that -- that won't be fully phased in until the second and third quarter of 2014. So the first quarter, you'll see highly elevated -- you'll see the expenses elevated at about $72 million and then it will start to come down as we start to realize some of the expenses.
Thomas F. Splaine: Expense saves.
Domenick A. Cama: The expense saves, the cost saves from Roma and GCF. Having said that, I want to make note that we're conservative there with our estimates because we're continuing to make investments in the business. We continue to build our infrastructure. Some of the things that we're exposed to now from a regulatory perspective, like stress testing and building up our credit risk group, are putting expenses a little bit higher than they've been running in the past. So from an efficiency ratio standpoint, we're starting to see those -- that ratio start to climb up into the 54% and 55% range.
Matthew Breese - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. But that run rate of $69 million to $70 million, that kind of bakes into -- that has baked in those expectations of some higher regulatory cost and combined cost?
Domenick A. Cama: Yes, yes. But we won't get there until, again, somewhere between the second and third quarter of 2014 because...
Kevin D. Cummings: The conversions are in schedule.
Domenick A. Cama: The conversions are in schedule. One scheduled In early March and the other one's scheduled in late June.
Matthew Breese - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then once fully integrated, how can you -- how do you assess your ability to grow loans on an annual basis? Has anything changed there?
Domenick A. Cama: Well, as Kevin said in his presentation, we've already put several teams in place to cover both the GCF -- the former GCF and the former Roma markets. We've taken our people, some of our people and actually relocated them to that market. So we expect to be able to, not only grow loans, but also to change the mix of the loans that, that franchise -- or those 2 franchises were originating. In Roma's case, about 60% of their loans were residential in nature, and we want to move them more towards commercial. And again, Kevin pointed out in his presentation that we've already closed a number of transactions in that market. So as we move forward, thinking about the business overall, we don't expect anything to change up here in New York markets and the North Jersey markets. And we anticipate changing the portfolios that we inherited from Roma and from GCF and to be a force down there on the commercial side. So we're expecting good things from that market.
Matthew Breese - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Understood. And then, as it relates to your overall allowance, where do you feel comfortable with the reserve to loan ratio?
Kevin D. Cummings: Well, I think we feel comfortable at the high end of the range. We hope we will -- we want to be a conservative bank and with the current accounting rules and the improving history of our net charge-offs, it becomes a process that is changing. And not necessarily changing, it's changed from where -- when I was on the other side of the fence, on the ordered side, it is quite different than it was 8, 10 years ago, we're post -- pre-SunTrust in the mid-90s. But it is -- we're managing it, and we're going to be a conservative bank that takes credit risk very seriously.
Domenick A. Cama: Matt, as -- certainly, our credit has improved here and there's no doubt about that. However, our portfolio continues to evolve. It's a portfolio that's changing. Even here in the legacy Investors balance sheet, we have about 48% in residential loans. That continues to change as we put on more commercial real estate, multi-family business and C&I business. Those types of loans inherently bring more risk. And so, while, again, our credit is improving, we balance that against the fact that our portfolio composition is changing and we're putting on more risky assets.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rick Weiss from Boenning.
Richard D. Weiss - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division: I have a question, I guess, in terms of the lending competition and it sounds like it's supposed to be very competitive on pricing or so, some banks are saying underwriting standards are being lowered. Is that what you're expect experiencing, too?
Domenick A. Cama: I wouldn't say that we're seeing underwriting standards being lowered. Certainly, I can say that the pricing has become more competitive. And just as an example, Rick, just before this rally into 10-year over the last week or so, we had a pretty stable 10-year. But in the wake of the 10-year being relatively flat, we saw banks lowering their 5-year multi-family rate. And what we were told was that other banks in the market were getting ready or getting their -- lowering their rates in order to get their pipelines in order for the first quarter of 2014. Now, even we here have lowered our rate on multi-family loans from 3.50% to 3.25%. And now, it seems like we're at the higher end of that range.
Richard D. Weiss - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division: At the 3.25%, what would the maturity be on that?
Domenick A. Cama: 5 years.
Richard D. Weiss - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division: For 5 years. Okay. And also, I guess, a question with respect to -- when you closed the Gateway in January -- and sometimes you see banks that include subsequent events into the December financials, but sometimes you don't. I'm kind of wondering why this wasn't included this time?
Kevin D. Cummings: Well, no, it's an immaterial transaction and it's a footnote disclosure. So...
Domenick A. Cama: That will be coming out in the 10-K.
Kevin D. Cummings: Right.
Richard D. Weiss - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division: How? As a footnote on the K?
Kevin D. Cummings: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Darst from Guggenheim Securities.
David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: I guess you've previously mentioned the potential for a balance sheet restructuring when you completed the Roma acquisition. It looks like you did use their cash to pay down your FHLB borrowings. Should we see anything else occurring in the first quarter similar to that?
Domenick A. Cama: The -- it's not only that cash, David, it was -- we sold their securities also. We sold about $370 million of their securities and used the proceeds from that transaction to pay down borrowings. And we don't expect to see anything like that in the first quarter. One of the things Kevin mentioned, the only other restructuring type of transaction, I'll call it, at this point is we're gearing up for potential sale of some delinquent loans down in that -- down from the Roma portfolio. But no other delevering, if you will, as a result. We accomplished that as soon as we closed.
David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Is the size notable from what you might be selling in the delinquent loans?
Domenick A. Cama: It's about a $30 million ARPU.
Kevin D. Cummings: Yes, and it includes some Investors cleanup sales. Some of those small nonperforming loans I referenced to in my discussion.
David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then your organic deposit growth picked up this quarter, are you changing anything with the business or positioning of rates to bring down your loan-to-deposit ratio?
Domenick A. Cama: Yes, well, Kevin mentioned the promotion that we put in place in the fourth quarter. It kicked off in October here in the North Jersey and the New York market. And it was intended to bring deposits in. Certainly, we were feeling some stress as a result of the loan growth at the company and the fact that we didn't close the Roma transaction. So we put a program in place, paid higher rates, brought in about somewhere between $550 million and $600 million in new deposits. But that promotion will be over in another 3 months. So that's the fourth quarter. Now, we also just instituted a promotion in the Roma markets that's exclusive to the markets that Roma and GCF occupied -- just the Roma markets and that's a high rate promotion that will be in place for about 1 month.
David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: Are you lowering any CD rates and trying to remix what you're doing with this promotion?
Domenick A. Cama: No. At this point, because the transaction took so long to execute, we want to try to do 2 things: one is recapture some of the market share we lost during the period of uncertainty; and two, give all of the Roma employees some energy to go out there and to have something that they can sell to bring their new customers back. So it's really to create some momentum in the market and to recapture some market share that we lost.
Operator: And our next question comes from Christopher Marinac from FIG Partners.
Christopher W. Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC, Research Division: I guess I have an extension to the last question regarding the deposit rates. Will some of those specials sort of roll off on the next quarter? Or will you continue to do that selectively throughout the footprint?
Domenick A. Cama: No, no. They will start to roll off next quarter.
Christopher W. Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC, Research Division: Okay, very good. And then, as you have a full quarter of Roma in this quarter, how does the loan yield change on a full weighted basis? And then also, I guess a similar question, in the way of -- what's the new loan yield on new commercial loans on the books?
Domenick A. Cama: Well, the yield on new commercial loans ranges anywhere from 3.75 to 4.50. So that's going from a maturity of 5 years at 3.75 to a maturity to 4.50 for 15 years. Again, Roma had primarily a residential loan portfolio, not a big commercial real estate portfolio. So we expect that what we bring in there will be right in the market of somewhere between 3.75 and 4.50.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we've reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Kevin Cummings for any closing remarks.
Kevin D. Cummings: Okay. I'd like to thank you, all, for participating on the call today. I want to thank you, all, for your support during these years as an MHC. We're making this -- we're in a time of transition. It's a time -- a very exciting time for the company and hopefully, we'll be out and meeting with many of you in the market in the early -- late -- in the late first quarter, early second quarter. So, I thank you for your support and enjoy the weekend and enjoy the Super Bowl. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your telephone lines.

===== 2013 Q3  (2013-10-23 10:00:00) =====
Executives:  Andrew Palmer – Head, IR Joe Jolson – Chairman and CEO Ray Jackson – CFO Carter Mack – President
Analysts:  Joel Jeffrey – KBW 
Operator: Welcome to the JMP Group’s Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that today’s call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions). I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Palmer, the company’s Head of Investor Relations.
Andrew Palmer: Good morning. Here with me today are Joe Jolson JMP’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Ray Jackson our Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by Carter Mack President in JMP Group and Mark Lehmann President in JMP Securities. Before we move on I’d like to point out some of this morning’s comments may contain forward looking statements with our future events that are out of JMP’s control. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied. The discussion and the uncertainties that could affect JMP’s future performance basically the description of risk factors included in our most recent 10-K. That said I’ll turn the call over to JMP’s Chairman and CEO Joe Jolson.
Joe Jolson: Thanks Andrew and thanks to everyone listening today and for your interest in JMP Group. I’m very proud to report the JMP Securities had the best third quarter in our history driven by a 57% year-on-year increase in investment banking revenues and positive operating margin leverage. The fact that productivity was broadly diversified across our four industry verticals and by product line demonstrates the rapidly growing value of our franchise. Having invested heavily to organically grow JMP Securities over the last four years we’re pleased to see such strong positive momentum. Excluding net investment income in corporate expenses JMP Group’s operating platform which would be JMP Securities and our three asset management managers are in $0.10 a share in the quarter compared to $0.03 a share a year ago. For the first nine month of the year platform earnings were $0.26 a share or more than twice last year’s level. Before I share some thoughts Ray will take you through few of the quarter’s financial highlights and Carter Mack will say some things about the current IPO environment. Ray?
Ray Jackson: Thanks Joe. Adjusted net revenues which exclude non-cash items and non-controlling interest was $36.2 million for the quarter and $106.3 for the nine months ended September 30. Operating net income was $2.7 million and $0.12 per share versus $3 million and $0.13 per share for the third quarter of 2012. For the nine months ended September 30th operating net income was $9.6 million or $0.43 per share compared to $10.6 million or $0.46 per share for the first nine months of 2012. Excluding a one-time asset expense of $0.03 per share related to the May IPO Harvest Capital Credit Corporation. Operating EPS for September 30th would have been $0.46 matching a total for the first nine months of last year. In the third quarter JMP Securities contributed $0.10 per operating EPS up from $0.03 a year earlier Harvest Capital strategies made $0.02 per share in line with its earnings for the third quarter of 2012. JMP Credit produced $0.09 of operating EPS versus $0.14 a year ago. At the corporate level net expense deducted $0.09 from operating EPS while that cost a $0.06 for the third quarter 2012. From expense stand point pro forma compensation and benefits expense which excludes on cash expense related to stock-based awards but includes any deferred compensation. As a percentage of adjusted net revenues was 69% for the third quarter and 65.8% for the first nine of the year. Our non-compensation expense ratio was 18.7% for the third quarter and 18.3% year-to-date excluding a $2.5 million one-time expense related to Harvest Capital Credit May IPO. With regards to the company’s balance sheet at September 30th JMP’s recourse cost debt-to-total capital ratio was 33.8% and our net cash and liquid securities per share was $1.80. Stockholder’s equity all of which was tangible with $123.7 million and tangible book value per share was $5.63. Adjusted tangible book value per share was $5.34 versus $4.88 a year earlier. Because of the accelerated amortization of the net liquidity discount on JMP Credit assets was completed in May, the only remaining difference between tangible and adjusted book value is due to our accelerated recognition of compensation expense, which must be deferred under GAAP. From a capital management standpoint, JMP used $1.2 million during the third quarter representing about $0.05 per share outstanding to repurchased approximately 190,000 shares of stock compared to cash dividend between $0.05 per shares. With that I’ll turn things over to Carter.
Carter Mack: Thanks Ray. Periodically under earnings calls we will discuss the line of business or a product that is experiencing to get the growth to success which we want in detail for our investors. Today we wanted to highlight JMP’s activity in the IPO marketplace which has shown dramatic improvement in 2013. U.S. market for initial public offerings has experienced a substantial turnaround in 2013 and a sustained IPO window is opened after several years of deal maker below average activity to October 18th there would be 173 U.S. IPOs surpassing the full year totals for each of the last five years. The capital market is on track to complete well over 200 IPOs in 2013 which would be more in line with the average of 250 IPOs per year seen in the 2004 to 2007 timeframe. In our view the reopening of the U.S. IPO window is due to a number of factors including a recovering economy gives overall equity market performance low market volatility as evidenced by the [ph] VIC remaining below – excuse me, remaining below 20 throughout 2013. The rotation of investor funds into equity and the passage of the JOBS Act in May – in April 2012. The JOBS Act in particular has helped small and mid-cap companies by reestablishing the IPO market as a viable means of raising growth capital. Furthermore increased transaction volume has been reinforced by strong price appreciation and sector diversity. The average U.S. IPO is up 36% this year and no one sector represents more than 25% of total IPO transaction volume so very well diversified. This performance and the diversity of offerings has led to an acceleration of IPO filings and continued good investor receptivity the new offerings. Against this backdrop JMP has driven a dramatic improvement in its IPO market position through a number of initiatives and more important being the keen focus by our bankers on identifying promising IPO candidates early and developing strong relationships with them well before the IPO process began. JMP has had a record year for IPO business on both in absolute and relative basis across all of our industry groups. Through the end of last week JMP completed 27 IPOs almost doubling our prior best full year totals in 2007 when we executed 14 IPOs. These deals been well diversified across all of our industry verticals with 10 IPOs in healthcare, eight in real estate, five in financial services and four in technology. While the overall increase in level of IPO activity has driven part of JMP’s success this year we assume our U.S. IPO market share more than double to 14.6% in the nine months ended September 30th from 6.7% for the first nine months of 2012 and our market share so far in 2013 well surpasses our previous annual record of 10% set in 2007. Further underlining the firm’s momentum JMP Securities market share grow ranks first among the top 15 under writers of U.S. IPO year-to-date with an 8% point increase in market share. While we have been pleased seeing increase in the overall number of IPOs we have also made meaningful progress in acting as a book runner this year. JMP Securities has been a book runner on five to 27 of their total 27 IPOs or 19% in 2013 today while in 2012 JMP did not book run an IPO. JMP acted as a book runner on the best performing U.S. IPO so far this year into therapeutics which is over 400% in pricing and the overall performance in the IPOs in which JMP has acted as a manager has been impressive as well. The average IPO underwritten by JMP is up 64% year-to-date compared to an average increase of 36% for U.S. IPO as a whole. JMP has underwritten six of 2013 top 15 IPOs when ranked by price performance. Aside from the keen focus of our bankers on the IPO product JMP is also benefited for the broadening of the IPO market which is lightly increased IPO activity in all four of the firm’s target vertical. In real estate we have participated in a number of home builder and other residential real estate related IPOs which have inspired by a recovering in the U.S. housing market. In financial services the consumer finance space has gained momentum with the recovering economy and just this past week JMP co-managed a successful $360 million IPO for Springleaf Financial. The technology sector which generally leads the IPO market by number transactions has been less active this year but JMP has participated in three of the sector’s top five top performing IPOs. We expect to see a greater percentage of technology deals launch this fall and then in the first part of 2014. Most active IPO sector for JMP has been the biotech medical devices space the JOBS Act has benefited these companies more than those in any other area in our view particularly as a result of the JOBS Act “test the waters” marketing provision almost all biotech companies pursuing IPO are now taking advantage of the ability to arrange “test the waters” meetings with institutional investors prior to staging formal road shows. This practice has resulted in better investor education and improved price discovery generating continued investor receptivity and exceptional after market performance for biotech IPOs which I think on average are up over 50% performance into pricing. JMP has underwritten three of this year’s top five performing life sciences IPO. The current IPO window looks like it will be sustainable well under 2014 to the view of number of large high profile IPOs this fall by companies such as Twitter, [indiscernible] and Chrysler should create excitement and focus on the IPO market assuming they perform well. The quality of the deals coming to market when being strong and the price line of deals many of which are initially filed confidentially under the JOBS Act as they increased dramatically throughout this year. JMP’s IPO pipeline is strong across all of our industry verticals with six offerings already filed publicly of which two are book run transaction and JMP is participating in a number of IPOs that are currently on file confidentially and the firm continues to win significant mandates process that are yet to file. Assuming that the IPO market remains open as we expect we anticipate a strong fourth quarter and momentum that carries into 2014.
Joe Jolson: Thanks Carter. I want to go over some third quarter highlights as well as some challenges to update everyone on our five year strategy growth plan and close with some remarks about our current stock valuation. First the positives, JMP Securities had a strong quarter, in fact as I said earlier it was our best third quarter in the firm’s history. We were relatively cautious about the prospects for JMP Securities on our last second quarter conference call given the uncertainties surrounding effect they bring and the route in the bond market that occurred combined with our expectation for a more normal seasonal slowdown. Driving the quarter’s excellent results was another better than expected performance from our investment banking group which has demonstrated overtime that it has successfully diversified not only by sector but by product. Investment banking revenues of $19.1 million for the third quarter or within 10% of the prior quarters record $21.1 million and are up 57% from a year ago. Through three quarters investment banking revenues were $52.3 million up 38%. JMP Securities is benefiting from substantial market share gains over the last four years as well as a the best equity capital markets environment since 2009 although the four industry sectors in which we participate has somewhat lagged the overall ECM surge falling from a market share of 50% of all activity last year to 44% in the latest 12 month period. Total U.S. equity underwriting fees totaled $7.1 billion for the trailing 12 months. JMP’s public equity underwriting revenues for that period made up just 46 basis points of the total. Our objective continues to be to increase the share to 1% by 2017 isolating the four industries on which we currently focus our share for the latest 12 months actually grew a 105 basis points, for 2012 that number was 104 basis points whereas in 2007 at the peak of the last equity capital market cycle it was 51 basis points and in 2009 just 31 basis points. One of the reasons we feel confident that we continue to gain market share is that we got into the equity capital markets business only 12 years ago, and diversified into healthcare and technology less than 10 years ago. we believe that we are a long way away from achieving our natural share of the market, for instance, while we had been quite successful at earning roles and large – in a large percentage of stock offerings occurring in our targeted sectors we have fallen short of our longer-term objectives to re-manage more offerings and to increase our economics when we act with the co-managers. Importantly, JMP’s investment banking business is not solely dependent on public equity underwriting fee revenues. In recent years we’ve cultivated our private capital markets’ capabilities including convertible securities and debt, and have started the advisory practice as well of adding and a number of M&A focused senior bankers to enhance our strategic advisory efforts. Through the first nine months of this year private capital markets and strategic advisory revenues represented 44% of our total investment banking revenues. Another positive from the quarter was the second consecutive year-over-year increase in our institutional brokerage revenues 7% in this case. Through the first nine months of this year brokerage revenues were up 10% versus last year’s total for the same period. We made significant personnel changes in this area thus far in 2013 and believe that for the most part we have the sales and trading team on the field that we want their from next year to be on. We continue to target a tripling of our market share to 1% by 2017 for this business and look forward to providing updates on our progress in 2014. Another positive for the quarter, was asset management related fee income of $6 million, up 27% year-over-year and 47% sequentially banks to a strong performance at Harvest Small Cap Partners our largest fund. Operating margins of Harvest Capital Strategies remained across this year since we continue to step rapid AUM growth that has been frustratingly elusive. Additionally, we agreed the way the incentive fees at H Cap Advisors were up the four quarters following a successful IPO of Harvest Capital Credit subject to the company starting to generate net investment income sufficient to cover its 9% dividend. The only real negative for the third quarter was our generating just the $0.11 per share of net investment income. Our three sector focused hedge funds was accounted for most of the company’s invested capital were challenged by a rapid shift during a quarter with macroeconomic and political headlines driving stocks collectively is an asset class again a distinct departure from the more productive stock picking environment with previous 12 months. We earned gross return of just 0.3% on our capital on the funds for the third quarter and it’s now for the nine months 4.5% which is well short of our annual goal of 10%. Third quarter was negatively impacted as well by a slower than originally forecast deployment of the cash in our newest CLO as a result of an overheated corporate loan market for much of the period. As long anticipated our original CLO continues to de-lever due to certain unscheduled prepayments in its loan book and will create a headwind for net investment income over the next 12 to 24 months. Offsetting much of the net investment income for the quarter was a corporate level loss at $0.09 which included the cost of this year’s increased strategic growth initiatives in addition to the more normal cost that we had every year of being a public company as well as our Section 16 incentive comp plan. After deducting all of these costs, net investment income added just $0.02 a share in the third quarter versus $0.04 a share last quarter and $0.10 a share a year ago. At the start of the year we developed the financial plan and committed the spending as much as to $0.20 a share this year and potentially next year to subsidize the organic growth of each of our businesses. Our five year goal is to boost our company’s top line organic growth rate to 15% to 20% per year compared to a compounded rate of 7% since our IPO in 2007. Well that 7% was less than the 10% we were targeting when we went public it’s still compares favorably and nearly every industry participant. Despite the high level of investments spending that which we have committed this year we still expect our operating margin to be around 15% providing a good balance between attractive levels of profitability and our targets to increase organic growth. Through the first nine months of the year operating margin on adjusted net revenues was 14.6% and it would have been 15% excluding some small cleanup losses on our acquired loans in our CLO 1. At JMP Securities the margin was 14.3% for the first nine months which is well above the 9% for the full year of 2012 and 7% in 2011. It’s successful with the five year growth initiatives focusing on our operating platforms will accelerate a shift in our company’s profit mix away from that net investment income which in Year 1 has already become a smaller component of earnings and has led to an expected decline in our overall operating EPS. Over the next year or two depending on whether or not attractive near-term growth opportunities continuing to exist in 2014 we expect that earnings from the operating platforms will fully replace the diminished net investment income and will ultimately drive accelerating EPS growth. We are having a much better year than initially forecasted in these businesses impart you to improve market conditions. For the 12 months ending September 30, JMP’s platform EPS which as I mentioned is JMP Securities and our three asset management businesses were $0.36 a share and that compares to just $0.12 a share on a year ago nine month period, I’m sorry, $0.10 a share on a year ago nine month period. JMP’s platform businesses require only modest capital on operating growth primarily to meet underwriting commitments and to seek new funds. At the end of the third quarter net invested capital which is a measure of liquid as well as illiquid net investments was $4.99 a share that’s up from $4.80 a share in the previous quarter whereas tangible book value was $5.63 a share. The primary difference between the two is working capital and the operating businesses and a very small investment in fixed assets. Net invested capital is the source of our net invested income, and given our highly favorable returns and consistent returns including in 2008 over more than 14 years I would suggest that these assets are not just conservatively marked on our books but also very productively deployed. If you’d allow me to put my own research analyst add back on for a moment JMP’s net invested capital represents the excess over and above the amount needed to run the operating businesses that excluding any net investment income they’ve earned $0.36 a share on a trailing 12 month basis and we expect as I mentioned a few times in my remarks that number could grow substantially going forward. JMP’s peer group now trades at over 20 times faster than for this year’s earnings. You take that multiple times $0.36 you get $7.22 a share and then adding our excess invested capital of nearly $5 gets you to a value of more than $12 a share and yesterday our stock closed at $6.39 and or we started the call that was down this morning. This is essentially why we continue to aggressively repurchase our stock. Since our IPO in 2007 we as utilized roughly 75% of our operating earnings to buy back shares and 25% to take that dividends similar to the ratio we outlined when we took the company public in 2007. Obviously we believe JMP is cheap relative to its words, peers of selling we also think we have one of the best performance track records in the industry as illustrated by our meeting or exceeding consensus earning’s estimates and 25 of 26 quarters since our IPO our business is volatile quarter-to-quarter that’s a difficult thing to continue so I’m sure there will be a quarter to in the future that we missed those estimates because of uncontrollable factors but we’re even more proud of meeting our beating the annual estimate at the start of the year every year except 2008 and we hope to do that as well this year and we’ll have a good start on that after nine months. To wrap up, I want to thank JMP’s employees and our Board members for their dedication to the success of the company. We continue to strive to be the last great place to work on Wall Street. And I’m proud of our accomplishments and very optimistic about our future. With that operator, we can open the line for any questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey with KBW.
Joe Jolson: Hey Joel.
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: Appreciate all the color you gave on the IPO market, just kind of wondering though, I mean, what do you guys view as the biggest risk for this slowing down?
Joe Jolson: Of the IPO markets slowing down?
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: Yeah.
Joe Jolson: Well you know it is cyclical as you know, and we’re in an up cycle and I think if you would go back over history you know once the cycle start they usually have a momentum that lasts for a year or two so I think it’s inevitable that at some point it all slowed down but I’ll let Carter you know may be elaborate on why we’re optimistic on – on the next 6 to 12 months you know for that business.
Carter Mack: Yeah I mean I would say for some big market disruption, the market you know has a lot of momentum right now and I’d say it’s increasing momentum. We really you know we haven’t seen technology IPOs be as biggest part of the market as we traditionally see. It’s been pretty well diversified as I stated earlier, we would expect to see a lot more technology IPOs at the market in the next six months. I think Twitter if it goes well and once so it does we’ll have a big curtail effect for a number of companies in the internet space. So you know, we feel like it’s gaining momentum and that’s why I said I you know the market looks like the window is going to be opened well into 2014 make the other trend that just the big increase in biotech IPOs which you know continues and – and the performance has been really good. So, you know until we see a big disruption I think we – we’ve got a very, very good IPO window right now.
Joe Jolson: I mean just from a, forget about the cycle for a second, because may be we have another year or two to run after many years of being in a down cycle in that market. When you just look at the number of deals where you know the – run rate for the latest 12 months is still just back to the average as oppose to at any kind of peak level, but from a secular point of view it been in a negative trend for more than a decade because of a lot of – regulatory changes you know as well as essentially the acquisition of the entire you know small-cap middle market brokerage group in the late 90s or early 2000 right where all those companies including our former company got acquired. And, you know so that kind of heard smaller IPOs I’ll just say that is not talked about a lot and Carter mentioned his remarks the jobs at which by the way Carter was one of that three industry representatives on that committee that reviewed that made those recommendations that got adopted by through congress surprisingly. But, excuse me, but that’s been a much bigger factor for smaller cap IPOs than people realize I mean, for a company to go public now they don’t have to take the risk of being obviously on file for six to nine months while the – and see what the market does, they can file confidentially and wait around a lot longer and – and essentially before they actually go public they have to put it you know uncloak from the cloaking device of confidentiality for just 21 days I think right Carter and so.
Carter Mack: Yes.
Joe Jolson: So I mean I think that – that’s been a big change in the last year in terms of the smaller cap IPOs.
Carter Mack: I would agree and I think we’re just seeing the front wave of that Facebook IPO last year kind of put a wet blanket over the market and as we started to see momentum pick up you know I – I believe there is a lot of deals on top.
Joe Jolson: Yeah.
Carter Mack: Right now and – and momentum continues. So…
Joe Jolson: So again I think that there has been a secular change and then of course they pass their, a change in the Sarb-Ox rules around the same time too they give companies that are smaller yeah that going public five year window before they have to – have to response you know they have to be publicly complying it with Sarb-Ox so that’s been helpful. So I think that’s a big change. And you know and after more than a decade of a secular downturn you know it’s a welcome relief for happy to see you that the business is turning here.
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: Okay and happy to speaking on the investment banking side of the business I think what we’ve seen so far in terms of overall market activity on the M&A front there has been if you look at the number of deal announcements it’s been pretty weak but I mean in third quarter numbers for yourselves and a few of your competitors seem to come in you know fairly in line with last quarters than that probably you know slightly better than what was expected just kind of wondering what you’re saying is even more or just you know certainly specific deals you guys are seeing versus the overall industry trends or just on your reason why you know the numbers might be a little bit better than what people had been expecting?
Joe Jolson: On the M&A side you know I mean we get affected by general market you know issues like some of the – no the more guys that are more if you replace on that that would hopefully trade but we’re not smaller cap and it’s then they are our average M&A deal when consideration is around a $100 million and so, other than kind of fraud market disruptions that occur from time to time, you know our issue was really the better off spread you know between doing a transaction and – and I think that that got affected a little bit with the tax law change you know starting this year but it’s kind of normalized now as the years gone along. So we’re you know we do get affected somewhat by you know these broader things that impact the bigger cap company M&A trends, but generally speaking we’re – we’re in the lower middle market kind of niche there. so it’s a little bit less cyclical.
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: Okay and then on the – on the asset management side of the business looks like you know the asset management fees are little bit stronger but it looks like due to incentive these just wondering if that was sort of just something we should expect to the seasonal issue this quarter or something that you’d see a little bit more sustainable on a quarterly basis going forward?
Joe Jolson: Well remember that you know of that let’s call it a $600 million kind of number that we have in our hedge funds you know over half of that’s in our small cap fund and – and of the $600 million not all of it is the contractually obligated to pay a full incentive fee whereas, in our small cap fund at all was. So that line item for us varies really from quarter-to-quarter when it has big swings by the performance of our small cap fund. And you know either a really good first quarter which is why incentive fees were so high it was up in the second quarter but not as – not a lot and which is why it went down and first quarter – and not as good as the first quarter but the first quarter as well so it’s kind of hard to predict that quarter-to-quarter and since he’s been close the new capital for 6 years now that probably not going to be growing you know in a – you know and there is no underlying growth rate in AUM there because you know continues to return capital to investors. So I think that’s just going to bounce around quarter-to-quarter now what’s might dry that up more over a longer period of time is raising more money for other funds and you know we’re trying and we have raised some money for other funds, but generally speaking I’d say 70% of not more of our carried interest opportunity resides in the funds managed by our small cap fund. It’s so it’s not seasonal you know it’s just return driven and – and there is really hard quarter-to-quarter there is not – is not correlated to the markets then or anything else which is good for a hedge fund manager but not so good for an analyst trying to project the quarterly revenues for that.
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: Exactly. And then just lastly from me the comp ratio was at the touch higher than what we were sort of forecasting and thinking about the driver behind that I mean was it more sort of the 13 people you’ve added there in the quarter or was it just a revenue mix and you know how should we kind of think about it going forward?
Joe Jolson: No, the growth in a year we kind of out – at the end of last year we talked about you know that one up to $0.20 that we got might be the cost this year and then may be something like that or less next year depending on availability of M&A bankers kind of thing. And we’re you know on track there we’re not coming in over that budget but the holding companies paying for that so essentially you know there is no real revenues attached to that this year right. So a big chunk of the increase in kind of the comp ratio is just related to that money that we had been pending to higher people ahead of revenues right. And we’re really excited about the quality of the people that had joined the company this year and we’ve actually you know hired a number of people that haven’t added to employees because some of them had been upgrading seats type of thing. So it’s a lot more than just the employee growth, but I think that the – added 3 percentages points or 4 percentage points to the comp ratio this year and that’s kind of straight line by quarter. So it – it’s the same number each quarter no matter what the revenues are I think. So it can be, move that comp ratio little bit quarter-to-quarter. And then you know, investment income has been below plan this year and you know obviously that should and does have our lowest comp ratio which you know the time planning would tend to take that yearly number closer to 60% by you know in our range we talked about 60 to 65, and so we’ll see what the fourth quarter’s like for investing income but that’s been a driver of it as well. So I think we’re still year-to-date around the high end of that range and I think unless we have a bad investment quarter in the fourth quarter there is no reason to think for the year it will be above you know materially above that number or anything, but that’s that what affected in the third quarter.
Joel Jeffrey – KBW: Great, thanks for taking on my questions.
Joe Jolson: Sure.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
Joe Jolson: Okay, we appreciate the interest in our company as always. And we’re available for any follow-up questions that anyone might have. And we look forward to giving an update on how the year ended up in early February I guess. Take care.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-07-24 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Andrew Palmer - Head of IR Joe Jolson - Chairman and CEO Ray Jackson - CFO
Analysts: Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods
Operator: Welcome to the JMP Group Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. (Operator Instructions). At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Andrew Palmer, the company's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Palmer : Good morning. Welcome. Here with me today are Joe Jolson, JMP’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Ray Jackson, our Chief Financial Officer. You’re joined by Carter Mack, President of the Company and Craig Johnson, Vice Chairman. Before we move on I’d like to point out that some of this morning’s comments may contain forward-looking statements about future events that are out of JMP’s control. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied. For a discussion of the uncertainties that could affect the company’s future performance please see the description of risk factors included in JMP’s most recent 10-K. With that said, I’ll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Joe Jolson.
Joe Jolson : Thanks Andrew and thanks to those of you listening today for your interest in JMP Group. JMP had a great second quarter, excluding an after-tax expense of $0.03 a share relating to the successful IPO of Harvest Capital operated in May. operating EPS increased by 38% from a year ago to $0.18 driven by a similar year-over-year increase of 37% in adjusted net revenues. JMP Securities produced record revenues for the quarter as our market share gain since 2009 positioned us to benefit from an improving capital market's environment and more than offset the decline in net investment income and incentive fees during the period. We were particularly pleased to see that positive client reaction to management changes we recently made in our institutional equities business led to improved results more quickly than we had anticipated. I’ll have Ray take you through some of the quarter’s financial results before saying more.
Ray Jackson : Thanks Joe. Operating net income as reported was 3.3 million or $0.15 per share versus 3.1 million or $0.13 per share for the second quarter of 2012. Adjusted net revenues, which exclude non-cash items and non-controlling interest was 38 million compared to 27.7 million a year ago. For the six months ended June 30, adjusted net revenues were 70.1 million compared to 62.9 million for the first six months of 2012. Our adjusted operating margin was 14% for the second quarter, and was 15.9% for the six months ended June 30. In the second quarter, JMP Securities contributed $0.13 per share to operating EPS, up from $0.05 per share in the prior quarter and just $0.01 a year earlier. Harvest Capital Strategies lost $0.01 per share on operating EPS basis but on $0.02 when excluding the $0.03 after-tax expense tied to Harvest Capital Credit IPO. JMP Credit produced $0.13 per share versus $0.14 per share for the second quarter of 2012. From an expense standpoint, pro forma compensation and benefits expense, which excludes non-cash expense tied to stock-based awards but includes any deferred compensation as a percentage of adjusted net revenues was 65.6% for the second quarter and 64.1% for the first half. The non-compensation expense ratio excluding the one-time $2.5 million expense related to the IPO of Harvest Capital Credit was 17% for the second quarter and 18.1% for the first half. With regard to our balance sheet at June 30, JMP’s recourse debt to total capital ratio was 35% and our net cash and liquid securities per share was $1.78. Stockholder’s equity, all of which was tangible was $121.1 million and tangible book value per share was $5.47. Adjusted tangible book value per share was $5.21 versus $4.78 a year ago. Because the accelerated amortization of the net liquid discount on JMP Credit’s assets was completed in May, the only remaining difference between tangible and adjusted book value is due to our accelerated recognition of compensation expense, which must be deferred under GAAP. From a capital management standpoint, JMP repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares and paid a cash dividend of $0.035 during the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned $0.22 per share to stockholders, roughly 70% of our operating EPS is $0.31 per share with the remainder increasing at tangible book value and anticipation of attractive future investment opportunities. We continue to make effective capital management priority, balancing dividends and share buybacks with other principle investment activities. With that, I’ll turn things back over to Joe.
Joe Jolson : Thanks Ray. I want to make a few comments about the record quarterly results at JMP Securities before providing a mid-year report on our progress in meeting our near-term and longer term objectives. At the time of our May 2007 IPO, JMP Securities was the primary contributor of revenue and earnings to JMP Group. Since that time, sever industry wide secular headwinds combined with the cyclical global capital markets meltdown to undermine our growth objectives and in many cases bankrupt some of our competitors. Looking back the carnage industry wide since our IPO delivering essentially flat revenues managing our cost in order to stay profitable and at the same time gaining substantial market share of JMP Securities seems like a pretty successful outcome. JMP Securities produced record results in the second quarter because of our efforts to gain market share during the downturn were rewarded by surging revenues as overall capital markets environment began to improvement. Our commissions business benefited from rotation equities during the quarter as some of our larger clients traditional money managers experienced net outflows for the first time in many years… I’m sorry, net inflows for the first time I many years. That business also benefited from the recent leadership changes we made in that area which I’ll discuss in a few minutes. Our investment banking group generated record revenues, which were fairly well diversified across our industry groups and products, and were derived from any unusually large transactions in the period. The record revenues translated into record operating earnings of $0.13 a share as our operating margin surge to little under 17% from the quarter despite the fact that we maintained our comp ratio at 65% for the first half of 2013. We’re increasingly optimistic about our future earnings prospects at JMP Securities but continue to be worry as always of overall industry conditions. Now an update on mid-year how we’re doing. In early 2013, we developed the financial plan for the year that we communicated to people on our year-end call that included a material increase in spending upwards of $0.20 a share this year and potentially next, to invest in organic growth in all areas of our business. Our objective was to accelerate our top line growth to 15% to 20% a year versus a compounded rate of roughly 6% since our IPO. Our former growth strategies did result in improved market share as well as record operating earnings but did not enable us to meet our goal of a 10% organic growth rates since we went public. Specifically, this year we anticipated the cost of strategic hires in our institutional equities business primarily in our New York office. The addition of senior M&A oriented investment bankers, underwriting fees resulting from the IPO Harvest Capital credit. A give up of potential returns in order for JMP credit to re-access the CLO new issuance market, the launch of one to two new fund strategies of Harvest Capital strategies and finally, the potential negative carried on a long term debt financing to fund some of these objectives. I am happy to report that at mid-year we've met and in some cases exceeded most of these objectives. In the first quarter, we were successful in attracting Tom Wright the leader, institutional equities effort out of our New York office. Tom previously managed trading platforms at Sanford Bernstein and Merrill Lynch has already implemented important changes in our research sales and trading operations, the 29% year over year increase and net brokerage revenues in the second quarter demonstrates that JMP is already gaining some momentum in this regard. In the first half, we also attracted two senior M&A oriented investment bankers to our platform and continued to search activity for one or two more top producers whom we believe would be a good cultural fit for our company. In early May, we closed the initial public offering for Harvest Capital credit, our small business lending strategy and that company is now very well positioned to grow rapidly over the next three to five years. As we communicated, we had to contribute $2.5 million to cover most of the underwriting expense in order to deliver a price the new investors of roughly net asset value. This cost the JMP after-tax was roughly $0.03 in the quarter. However, since we started that company in the third quarter of 2011, we did get a 49% IRR through the IPO on our investment and we would anticipate going forward that HCAP advisors, the company’s external manager could become a material contributor to Harvest Capital strategies results in JMP Group’s earnings growth over the next three to five years. In late May, we closed JMP credit advisor CLO II, a $344 million deal upsize from our target of $300 million. To re-access the market, we made a concession of roughly 300 basis points when compared to returns for our currently well-established issuers. The terms were in line with what we had budgeted and we would expect that the 17.3 million of capital we invested in the deal will produce a low double digit IRR once the funds are fully deployed. We are hopeful that CLO III will be successfully executed by the end of this year or early next year and will materially narrow the aforementioned return GAAP. Harvest Capital strategies continues to evaluate new fund strategies with the goal of launching one to two per year. While we did not execute on any in the first half 2013, we recently committed the launch two new funds post Labor Day. Blue J [ph] Capital is a newly formed healthcare sector focused along by hedge fund managed by our previous partners at Expo Capital in Los Angeles. We are providing operating capital as well investor marketing for the business which is scheduled to begin fund raising early in the fourth quarter. River Bank our joint venture with New York Mortgage Trust and Kevin Donlon plans to launch a mezzanine equity strategy in the fall that will complement its existing CMBS debt strategy which currently has over a 150 million of assets under management. We are providing some seed capital for the new fund. We are excited about the prospects for both of these sponsored funds in 2014 and beyond. Finally, earlier this year we issued 46 million of long term debt in an effective cost of 8.3% to finance some of these investments. This cost works out to roughly $0.10 a share after tax and it will eventually get intermediated by our CLO business with a lag. We invested roughly 30 million of the proceeds in our three sector hedge funds which could introduce some additional volatility into our quarterly results based on near term investment performance. Our return of 3.3% in the first quarter was accretive to this cost of funds while a 1% return for the second quarter was not, for the first half of the year a 4.2% gross return essentially covered our cost of money and obviously the alternative was leaving the money market account paying nothing so it’s very accretive to just cash. JMP’s five year goal continues to be two fold, at JMP securities doubling our ECM market share while tripling our institutional commission’s market share both to roughly 1% and at HCS and JMP credit, tripling our sponsored assets under management. Assuming a relatively stable industry-wide operating environment, we believe that if we are successful, our revenues would be more than double and then we could enjoy material positive operating margin leverage on our non-comp costs as well as on our staff cost. The results could be more than a doubling of operating EPS driven by our operating subsidiaries while at the same time absorbing material decline in net investment income as a percent of our total earnings as JMP credit advisor CLO one low cost liabilities of roughly LIBOR plus 26 basis points get fully repaid in the next few years, now that its reinvestment period has ended. To close I want to thank JMP's 218 employees as well as our independent Board members for their continued dedication to JMP and to achieving outstanding long term results for shareholders. With that operator we could take any questions. Thank you
Operator: (Operator Instructions). You have a question from the line of Joel Jeffrey from KBW.
Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Appreciating again the color and about sort of larger than expected, the $0.20 sort of earnings tied to the growth initiatives. I mean did the growth initiative this first half of the year really contribute meaningfully to the revenue side of the equation or are you really just seeing this more from (inaudible) and basically the operating leverage is really yet to come?
Joe Jolson: I don't think that they've contributed to the earnings in the first half, in the sense that we just hired some people in the sales and trading operations, Tom joined in February. So I think it's starting to contribute. So I don't we've seen that yet, but maybe a little bit of it in the second quarter. And in the investment banking side, the two investment bankers we hired, one started early in the year and he's already become reasonably productive to better than expected. The other one started in the second quarter and we're getting good feedback, but no revenues to report there, year-to-date. We did that deal in January, so obviously that expense is therefore pretty much the whole year, and of course the cost of taking (inaudible) public. I mean I think that when I gave you that number of upwards of $0.20 that essentially assumed that the comp that we kind of targeted to pay some of these guys, most of which isn't guaranteed or anything, but I think that's assuming for very little revenue. So we're obviously hoping to do better than that by the end of the year.
Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: And how much of that $0.20 do you think you have already sort of incurred in the first half of the year?
Joe Jolson: It's spread out, the interest expenses spread out right, so if you look at $0.10 potentially from just the debt cost, we have kind of covered most of that cost just r at least part of that cost with the 30 million we put into our funds, right. The CLO investment was the rest of that and that closed in April and it takes a while for loans to close. So in the second quarter they actually had a negative return on the 17.3, because you are paying out on all the bonds, but the loans haven't closed yet. I think most of those loans will be closed by the next couple of months. So it should be a positive contributor in the third quarter and then maybe be at a normalized run rate in the fourth quarter. We have just budgeted that cost for close strategic hires evenly across the year, so that is already, one-fourth of that would have been this quarter.
Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: So essentially though what we're seeing is basically half of the drag on the bottom line but no pickup really on the revenue side, so the operating margins really get to come from these.
Joe Jolson: Remember that, I mean it's hard to be precise about these we can track revenues for the people that we hired, but since most of them that we have hired have joined in the last few months, it's a little early to expect major revenue contributions there.
Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: And then I mean the broker business was particularly strong. Looks like it's getting back to sort of more traditional levels. I mean again this is really just a function of people coming back to equities. I know you said in the commentary we got some other we have seen flows in the equities. But are you seeing just that much more of an appetite for institutions that progress on.
Joe Jolson: I think that and that's not the part of business that I am involved, I will just tell you the answers for the questions when I ask that. I think we're seeing a lot higher client engagement with some of these changes we made in personnel, so that's a positive. I think if you look at industry wide business there on the commission side and you would look at this more than I bet when the dust settles it will be up slightly year-over-year for equities U.S. equities trading, and maybe 5% or something like that. And so we obviously we're up a lot more than that. So we picked up some market share there. And like I said I think that's because of some of the people we brought in and the level of their relationships with institutions.
Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: And then just lastly for me, on the investment banking side, it looks like sort of the debt and convertible securities line was pretty solid again particularly in terms of the revenue side. I mean is this sort of a new run rate we should kind of think about, was there anything specific in the line of quarter.
Joe Jolson: I will make a quick comment but I would like Carter to give you some details; but basically we bolted on a number of products in the last three or four years to leverage their relationships that we have on calling on these three participants. So it isn’t something that we just started to do but we have seen some improvement in terms of getting higher in closing revenues. So we feel pretty good about that, Carter can give us more details.
Carter Mack: Yes, we had one significant transaction in the second quarter, $300 million debt yield that we are co-book runner on. So that was a significant feed. Other than that it came from a number of different convert and debt placement. We continue to be pretty engaged in both of those areas. In the convertible area in particular, we are seeing a lot of activity and expect to have some significant deals in the second half of the year. On the debt side, it continues to be engaged more on the private placement part of that. Overall it is a more significant contributor to our business and we expect that going forward.
Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Did the potential rise in rates have anything to do with people sort of maybe accelerating their plans to raise capital or isn’t that had any impact at all?
Joe Jolson: That happened at the end of second quarter, so it didn’t really have a positive or negative effect, I think, on our quarter.
Carter Mack: No, we didn’t really see any major effect from that and Joe said it happened towards the end of the quarter. There are issues, that we’re looking at the rate environment and we are in historically one of the best high yield debt environments we have seen, very good convert market environment. So we are encouraging people to take advantage of that.
Joe Jolson: We cover middle market, kind of smaller middle market companies that are using capital to grow and expand in general. So we don’t do anything in the high grade area. So it will be less sensitive, reasonable changes in market interest rates is going to be a lot more sensitive to the user proceeds and the credit spreads type of side of it.
Operator: At this time there are no further questions.
Joe Jolson: Well, I would like to thank everyone for their interest today. I will be around today. If you have any follow-up questions, just give me a call and or Ray, or Andrew. And we will catch up within three months. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen, and that conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-04-30 11:00:00) =====
Executives:  Thomas F. Splaine Jr. – Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Kevin D. Cummings – President and Chief Executive Officer 
Analysts:  Mark Fitzgibbon – Sandler O’Neill Matthew Kelley – Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc. Collyn Glibert – KBW Mark DeVries – Barclays Capital  
Operator:  Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the ISBC First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note today’s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Tom Splaine. Mr. Splaine, please go ahead.
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.:  Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I’m Thomas Splaine, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and we’ll begin this morning’s call with a standard forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp, Inc. may make some forward-looking statements with respect to our financial position, our results of operations, business and prospects. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Investors Bancorp’s control and are difficult to predict and can cause our actual results to materially differ from those expressed or forecasted in these forward-looking statements. In our press release and in our earnings release we have included our Safe Harbor disclosure. We refer you to that statement, and these documents are incorporated into this presentation. For a more complete discussion of certain risks and uncertainties affecting Investors Bancorp, please see the section entitled risk factors, management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations set forth in Investors Bancorp’s filings with the SEC. And now I’d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Cummings; and Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Domenick Cama.
Kevin D. Cummings: Thanks, Tom. Good morning. Investors Bancorp had a strong quarter in a tough operating environment, as interest rates remain low and the level of refi activity remains elevated. Investors had its most productive quarter in its history, and we are happy to report net income of $27.2 million or $0.25 a share, and this compares to last year of $18.9 million or $0.18 a share. Last year in 2012, we had completed the acquisition of Brooklyn Federal. Without those nonrecurring merger expenses, our net income in 2012 would have been $22.7 million or $0.21 a share. Our 2013 first quarter, results in a 19% increase in EPS and a 19.8% increase in net income. Our return on equity and return on tangible equity both exceeded 10% and 11% respectively for the first time. Loan originations and residential purchases from our Corresponded Mortgage business exceeded $1 billion for the quarter, and that includes our commercial loans also, but only resulted in loan growth of $162 million in total loans. We sold over $141 million to Freddie and Fannie in the quarter, but the pay downs and refis curtailed growth for the quarter. Commercial loans grew 2.9% for the quarter, and this reflects a 44.5% year-over-year increase with the Marathon acquisition. We continue on our journey of transforming the bank to a full-service commercial bank, as commercial loans now comprise 52% of our total loans, and loan income comprises 57% of total loan income. Our credit quality remains strong, and our provision for loan losses exceeded our charge offs by $7.5 million. Our nonperforming loans increased a bit in the quarter, but our MPA ratio to total assets of 1.19 and our nonperforming loans to total loans of 1.37 remain good compared to our peers. Our allowance for loan losses increased over 26 million year-over-year at March 31 or this year. We now have a ratio of 1.41% and a coverage ratio to non-accrual loans over 100%, 110%. Our 30 to 60 day numbers are down on both the Residential and the Commercial portfolios, down $73 million to $37.5 million, which translates to an average loan of about $300,000 for both portfolios. On the Commercial side, the 30/60 totals approximately $7.8 million and is comprised of 12 loans, which equates to an average loan of $650,000. Over 90% of these loans are comprised of loans acquired through acquisition, and one is a participation with another bank. Bottom line, we have made great progress in managing our credit risk, as we have transformed the balance sheet. Year over year our non-accrual loans are down from 1.64% to 1.28% for total loans at March 31 of this year. Our commercial loan non accruals to total commercial loans is less than 1% than its 94 basis points, and total $51.6 million. In this total, $8.8 million has come through acquisitions, and $18.8 million is current to their terms and paying out of pocket, but have been reclassified as non-accrual due to regulatory and accounting guidance. Looking back over the last four to five years, it has been an interesting journey, as we have transformed the bank from the fixed income fund, as in 2003 we had 80% of our assets in securities, to 2007 when 10% of our loan portfolio was included in commercial loans. I’d like to thank Rich Spengler, our Chief Lending Officer, and his team of lenders for a great job, and for steering this ship through these difficult waters. We’ve also made significant investments in personnel in the Credit Risk Management Group, headed by Tom Stackhouse, our Chief Credit Officer. Over the last few years we’ve expanded and enhanced this group with seasoned professionals to support the loan growth of the bank. On the retail side, we continue to integrate the Brooklyn and Marathon acquisitions. These are strategic acquisitions that support our real estate and middle market lending in New York. We now have a nice franchise in New York, with 23 branches and $1.3 billion in deposits. I’d like to remind you that we entered New York in October 2010 with three branches from the Millennium acquisition, which we paid 11 basis points for about $100 million in deposits. I’m happy to report that through this week our core deposits and these franchise are up 4.5% for the Brooklyn and Marathon franchises. And we continue to mentor and train our retail teams and bring them into the investor’s culture, which is one of service to each other, our customers, and the communities that we serve. If we take care of these three constituencies, you our shareholders will be rewarded. On the acquisition front, we continue to prepare for the integration of Roma. Paul Kalamaras, our EVP of Retail, has been busy working on both the Marathon and the Roma retail structures. The retail bank has recently announced a reorganization to address our growth, and we continue to make investments in the infrastructure of the bank. There’s one thing I’ve learned at Investors, is that change and growth are a good thing, even though it may prove a little bit uncomfortable. We will be moving three seasoned Investor bankers to the Roma franchise, and with the hiring of Tim Tui as a Commercial Real Estate Exec in that franchise in Southwest Jersey, the region will hit the ground running when the deal is completed. On the regulatory and approval front, the proxies are in the mail for the Roma transaction, and the shareholders meeting for both companies are set for May 30. We have not yet received regulatory approval, as the regulatory application received a comment during the application public comment period. We plan to close the merger once regulatory approval is received. We announced our eighth acquisition this quarter, Gateway Community, on April 5, and the deal extends our franchise into the Philadelphia suburbs with four branches and $278 million in deposits. This transaction is a merger of mutual and enhances our second step valuation. In addition, with Gateway and Roma, Investors will have the largest deposits, statewide market share for a New Jersey based bank after these pending announced acquisitions are completed. Overall, it’s been a busy quarter with no moss growing under our feet. We posted greater than 10% return on equity, greater than 11% for tangible equity. We have leveraged our capital from almost 20% at our IPO day in 2005 to 7.75% at March 2013. We just declared our third cash dividend of $0.05. We continue to manage the company using our three levers, prudent organic growth, smart acquisitions that do not dilute tangible book value or second-step valuation and equity management tools such as stock buybacks and cash dividends. All of these tools will be useful as we look forward to a second-step transaction, which after Roma and Gateway deals we believe we are well positioned to execute. I would like to thank our team, our employees and staff for their continued hard work and dedication. They certainly make my job fun and interesting. We continue to look for ways to improve our service to our customers, and I am thankful for their outstanding efforts. It is an exciting time at Investors. We have some economic headwinds, and the regulatory environment is dynamic and changing, but we believe, like in 2009 and 2010, these challenges are opportunities for a bank like Investors. We look forward with great excitement for the next 12 to 24 months. We have a great opportunity here to be a $17 billion organization with 15% capital, one of the strongest regional banks in the country. With the potential wave of consolidation, which all the investment bankers are predicting, we will be well positioned, having completed eight acquisitions since June of 2008. Our team is well tested. It’s a veteran team that is up to this opportunity, and it is an honor along with our executive team of Dom Cama, Rich Spangler, Paul Kalamaras, Tom Splaine, and Dan Harris to lead this organization. I thank you for your attention and your support. And now I’d like to open it up to questions.
Operator:  At this time we’ll begin the question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon from Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead with your question.
Mark Fitzgibbon – Sandler O’Neill:  Hey, guys. Good morning.
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.:  Hey, Mark.
Mark Fitzgibbon – Sandler O’Neill:  It looks like you’ve booked about $277 million of loans that were originated by the mortgage operation on the balance sheet in the quarter. What are those – what duration were those loans? Were they 30-year fixed or hybrid loans?
Domenick A. Cama: Mark, good morning. It’s Domenick. The residential mortgage is about a 55% of the residential mortgages are fixed rate loans, and the rest are hybrid ARMs.
Mark Fitzgibbon – Sandler O’Neill:  Okay. Secondly, I wondered if you could share with us your outlook for the margin in say 2Q?
Domenick A. Cama: Right now it looks, Mark, like it’s going to be about a 10 basis point decline, notwithstanding any affect from prepayment income.
Mark Fitzgibbon – Sandler O’Neill:  Okay. And could you also share with us what your pipeline looks like on a commercial real estate and multi-family as well as a C&I pipeline?
Domenick A. Cama: It is about $900 million, the pipeline has about $900 million in it, Mark.
Mark Fitzgibbon – Sandler O’Neill:  Okay. And then lastly, I wondered if you think there’s any chance of doing additional mutual holding company deals prior to announcing a second step?
Domenick A. Cama: Well, we don’t have any that we’re talking to right now, but that – never say never.
Mark Fitzgibbon – Sandler O’Neill:  Thank you.
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.: You’re welcome.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Matthew Kelley from Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead with your question.
Matthew Kelley – Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.:  Yeah. Hi, guys. Matt. Just to follow up on the question of the pipeline, the $900 million in commercial real estate and multi-family, what’s the average yield in that pipeline? And then the average duration, anything getting longer there?
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.:  No. It’s actually starting to get a little shorter. The weighted average coupon on the pipeline is about 3 75.
Matthew Kelley – Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Okay. And what’s the split between multi-family commercial real estate?
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.:  It’s still about 60% in multi-family.
Matthew Kelley – Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Okay. Gotcha. And do you have a better sense now of where pro forma expenses are going to come in once Roma is brought on board, call it the full third quarter?
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.: We haven’t projected with Roma yet, because we’re still working on that, but we’re looking at about $56 million to $57 million of quarterly run rate, that’s without Roma.
Matthew Kelley – Sterne Agee & Leach, Inc: Okay. Got it.
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.: Just for information purposes, Roma runs at about $12.5 million, has as $12.5 million quarterly run rate on expenses. So I’m not sure how much we’re going to pare that back yet.
Matthew Kelley – Sterne Agee & Leach, Inc: Okay. Got it. And then, just a little commentary on the pipeline in the mortgage banking operation and comments on sale margins? And what you saw during the quarter and what you’re seeing now?
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.: Yeah. As far as the refi split, the first quarter saw about 75% refi businesses versus purchases. It’s been about 70% in April, but with this recent rally in the 10-year treasury, our mortgage company has seen a pickup in applications. In terms of pricing, we’re looking at probably about 2 75, about a 2 75 price profit on mortgages.
Matthew Kelley – Sterne Agee & Leach, Inc: Okay. Gotcha. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Collyn Glibert from KBW. Please go ahead with your questions.
Collyn Glibert – KBW: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.: Hey. Good morning, Collyn.
Kevin D. Cummings: Good morning, Collyn.
Collyn Glibert – KBW: How are you guys thinking about your funding strategy going forward? And just kind of thinking about loan and deposits, the loan-to-deposit ratio – just trying to get a sense of kind of your comfort level there? Will you continue to use incremental borrowings? Or do you see – are there certain deposit initiatives? Or just if you could talk and give a bit of color on that?
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.: Sure. Collyn, the loan-to-deposit ratio right now is just shy of 120%. And in the past we’ve taken the number as high as 125%, although I’ll tell you that 125% makes us uncomfortable. We don’t really like to be above that level. In terms of the remainder of the year and the future, that’s why we’re so happy to have the Roma transaction coming along, because Roma’s loan-to-deposit ratio is about 60%. And on a pro forma basis we see our loan-to-deposit ratio coming down to about – somewhere about 110% to 111%. So that helps us there, right there. Also Roma has a big portfolio of securities that we’re looking at and trying to decide how many of those securities we’ll keep going into the acquisition. The thought is that perhaps we would sell off a portion of those securities so as we could reduce borrowings a little bit more. But in terms of our own comfort zone, we’re perfectly content running somewhere between 110% and 115%, 120% loan-to-deposit ratio.
Collyn Glibert – KBW: Okay. That’s helpful. And just a question on the prepayment income that you guys saw in the quarter, was that skewed more towards the beginning of the quarter? Or and kind of what are your thoughts? I know you gave the NIM guidance, Dom, excluding prepaids. So just how you are you seeing speeds there?
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.: It was about, Collyn, it was about $3 million for the quarter.
Kevin D. Cummings: It was pretty consistent in all three months. Yeah. It was.
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.: So I can’t pinpoint one specific month where it all came it. It was really, as Kevin said, it was really consistently applied during the three month period.
Collyn Glibert – KBW: Okay. And just one final question, maybe could be interpreted from your comments on loan pricing, but just in general, how would you guys characterize the environment in terms of competition? Where are you seeing competition pick up? How much has it intensified in the last three to six months? Or has it been fairly consistent? Are there new players that are coming in with your rational terms? And then, If you could talk a little bit about that.
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.: I’ve listened to a few conference calls this past quarter of banks in the New York market, who everybody says the same thing, that the competition is irrational. And certainly we’ve run into our share of competition in which there’s some pricing that is difficult to match. We have yet to break the 3% barrier in terms of multifamily pricing, although I know some of our competitors have. Certainly, it is intense. Not only do you have a number of banks who have reentered the market, you also now have the bigger, the financial institutions, the larger financial institutions making – getting back on their feet and coming into the market and having an impact, even on some of the smaller community bank business. So I’ll just answer your question, Collyn, by saying yeah, the market remained intense. It’s been intense for the last year or so, and it hasn’t let up yet.
Kevin D. Cummings: Collyn, it’s a great opportunity. We welcome the competition. We’re not going to sit here and lament and complain about it. It’s – we’re in the market, and we’re making loans, and it’s a great challenge. We love the competition.
Collyn Glibert – KBW: All right. That was all I had. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mark DeVries from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Mark DeVries – Barclays Capital: Yeah, thanks. Could you talk about any deposit repricing opportunities you see for the remainder of the year?
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.: Yeah. Mark, we have just over the next quarter about $500 million in CDs that are maturing from a weighted average cost of 68 basis points to about 40 basis points. So we’re looking at somewhere around a 25 basis point pickup on $0.5 million in CDs repricing. We also had about $200 million in federal home loan bank borrowings that have repriced already during the quarter. We’re picking up about 200 basis points on that $200 million. So that is going to have a significant impact on the cost of borrowings for the quarter.
Mark DeVries – Barclays Capital: Okay. But I assume that’s reflected in your guidance for the 10 bps…
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.: Yes.
Mark DeVries – Barclays Capital: Decline in the margin? Okay. Hey, anything on the back half of the year we can look towards?
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.: We have some borrowings that are maturing towards the latter part of the year, but it really is not a significant as the $200 million that we had come due this quarter.
Mark DeVries – Barclays Capital: Okay. That’s helpful. And then finally are you still targeting the $700 million, $800 million or so in asset growth kind of excluding your M&A of the Roma, Gateway deals for the year?
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.: Yes.
Mark DeVries – Barclays Capital: Okay. Great. All right. Thank you.
Kevin D. Cummings: Okay, Mark. Operator And, ladies and gentlemen, we’re showing no additional questions. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Thomas F. Splaine Jr.: Okay. Well we’d like to thank you for your participation today. We’re well positioned and moving forward with the Roma and Gateway transactions and it was a very good quarter but we’re still working hard to bring value to our shareholders. We thank you for everything and thank you for your support. Have a great day.
Operator: And, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your telephone lines.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp Inc. Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I now would like to turn the conference over to Thomas Splaine. Mr. Splaine, please go ahead.
Thomas F. Splaine: Thank you. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm Tom Splaine, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and we'll begin this morning's call with the standard forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp Inc. may make some forward-looking statements with respect to our financial position, our results of operations, business and prospects.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Cummings; and Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Domenick Cama.
Kevin Cummings: Good morning and thanks, Tom. We had -- Investors had its most productive quarter in its history and we are happy to post a strong and profitable quarter with net income excluding merger-related expenses at $25.8 million or $0.24 a share, compared to $21 million or $0.20 a share in the prior year. On an annual basis, excluding the merger's expenses for Brooklyn and Marathon, our net income increased from $79 million to almost $97 million, a 23% increase in net income year-over-year. To say it was a busy quarter would be an understatement. Our management team was tested on several fronts and I'm very proud to say that the team did a great job and had a great quarter and completed many difficult tasks. The hurricane tested our disaster recovery plans and we got through the storm with flying colors as it gave our management team an opportunity to show how capable it is under difficult operating circumstances. It was a great opportunity for me to see some of our management teams that I don't work with everyday. Our technology and facilities groups, led by Sergio Alonso and Joe Valente, both senior VPs who joined the bank from Millennium, did an outstanding job. It highlights the point that sometimes we overlook that in our acquisition strategy, we are not only expanding our geography and our franchise but we're also picking up some strong people to complement our management team. On that front, on the acquisition front, we closed the Marathon deal in the quarter, which added about $780 million in deposits plus 13 branches, of which 12 are in New York. We entered the New York market in January 2010 with the opening of our loan production office in Manhattan, which has been very successful and is led by Joe Orefice, who joined us in late 2009. We entered the retail market with the acquisition of Millennium, with 3 branches in Queens and Long Island, and we now have 23 branches with approximately $1.4 billion in deposits, with 20 branches coming from acquisitions and 3 branches under our de novo branch openings, 1 we opened up in late 2011 in Borough Park and 2 in Brooklyn in 2012. Those 3 de novo branches have over $180 million in deposits at yearend, and have been opened less than 10 months. So it's not just an acquisition strategy in New York, but also a de novo strategy. Our regional manager, Anna Oliviera, also a Senior Vice President, joined us from an acquisition in 2010 from the Millennium transaction and has been doing an outstanding job in that market. She actually moved to Brooklyn to be closer to the market from New Jersey. We have a focused team and we're focused on this market and we see tremendous opportunities to expand and grow both our business lending, the retail deposit side and also the residential lending. Our mortgage company is out hiring mortgage officers to expand their sales force to work in that market. In just 2 years, we have a 23-branch franchise with $1.4 billion in deposits and approximately $2.4 billion in commercial loans in New York, and we are looking to continue to expand that market area. During the quarter, we also announced our seventh acquisition with the Roma Bank transaction which we are working on as we speak. This transaction was very appealing to us from a financial point of view, as it is similar to us and our ownership structure as an MHC, with only 25% of its shares outstanding to the public. It will give us approximately $1.5 billion in deposits plus it will support our South Jersey lending teams, where we have approximately $1 billion in loans in that market and another $458 million in commercial loans in Pennsylvania. We're hoping to close this -- we're on track to close this transaction in the second quarter. I guess the big story this quarter is our loan growth and we had an outstanding quarter as loans grew over $1 billion, of which $560 million came from Marathon, and approximately $460 million from organic growth net. And most of that growth, $507 million for the quarter, came from the commercial sector. For the first time in the bank's history, our commercial loan book exceeds the residential book, as commercial loans comprised 51% of the total loan portfolio. From a credit point, the commercial loan portfolio has $38 million in nonaccrual loans, which equates to 71 basis points on a total commercial portfolio of $5.4 billion. Our nonperforming at current levels, really the biggest piece in that piece is the $82.5 million in residential loans and that's a difficult process for us because of the foreclosure process in New Jersey. We have approximately -- it takes approximately 3 years to push things through the pipeline here in New Jersey. Our coverage ratio to non-accrual loans is 118% and we continue to manage the company in a prudent manner. Our allowance to total loans 1.36%, so if we pull out the Marathon loans, it is 1.44%. In 5 years, we have built our allowance from $9 million to $142 million, while our income for each year has grown from $12 million in 2007 to $79 million last year and $97 million in 2012. As I've mentioned on earlier calls, we remain focused on our strategic business objectives, which include a continued integration of our Marathon acquisition plus the Roma transaction through 2013. In January, we met with the employees of Roma and we're off to a good start with that group. Our C&I group, building out the middle market lending, our C&I group is getting traction. C&I loans grew $50 million in the quarter, from $120 million to $170 million. That group, though, manages not only the C&I loans but also the owner-occupied real estate that house businesses and manufacturing facilities, hotels and nursing homes, things like that -- of that nature. And that growth in the quarter, if you take those loans which are classified in the CRE portfolio, that group has grown from $361 million to $432 million in the quarter or 20% for the quarter. We have a good group of lenders, we just hired 3 lenders that form a medical team and we're focused on continuing to build that group as it brings in business loans and business deposits. And it also helps us on the interest rate risk side. We continue to move forward on our core processing conversion, which is scheduled to be completed in 2014. And finally, we continue to get closer to our second step transaction, which has been enhanced by the Roma transaction as we expect to raise $1 billion to $1.3 billion in the capital raise when the time -- once we complete the Roma transaction. As I stated on earlier calls, we wanted to get to a 10% return on equity on tangible capital, leverage our capital to the 8% mark, and we've done that. And I'm happy to announce that we're paying our second quarterly dividend. We've met all of these objectives while building a strong balance sheet with the manageable NPAs and an allowance that exceeds nonperforming loans at 12/31. We believe we are well-positioned to execute on our short-term plans and long-term plans. Our transformation continues as we build out our franchise in New York and New Jersey. With the Roma transaction and our second step, we will be a $16 billion organization with 15% to 16% tangible equity, we'll have the largest deposit market share for any bank headquartered in New Jersey. Our employees are motivated and excited with all that is happening here at the bank. Just last week, we did a company-wide questionnaire seeking feedback from our employees and received an 88% participation rate. This team continues to motivate me and I thank our employees for all the good things that they do, both at the bank and in the communities that they serve. We will continue to outhustle our competition to improve our results and create shareholder value to you, our owners. It is our pleasure to be of service to you and I thank you for everything you do. Okay. Now let's open it up for some questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Matthew Kelley with Sterne Agee.
Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just a question on the margin. The core margin x prepayments came in a little better, why don't we just talk about where you see that going and if there's anything else that benefited the margin this quarter that we should be considering going forward? That would be my first question.
Domenick A. Cama: Mat, it's Domenick. The margin was obviously positively impacted by the prepayment income on multifamily business for the month. December was a very big month and we saw a big boost in prepayment income there. That had an effect of approximately 12 basis points on the net interest margin. The other factor impacting the net interest margin for the quarter was the reduction in overall cost of funds. Cost of funds dropped about 10 basis points for the quarter. So as we look out towards first quarter of 2013, what we're anticipating, without the -- any increase from prepayment income is approximately a 10 basis point reduction in the net interest margin, that would take it down to 3 40. And depending on -- it looks like this quarter, it would -- this quarter is going to be a more normal quarter in terms of loan growth. And so with that, we're projecting about $1 million in prepayment income for the quarter.
Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Okay. Got you. And then I was wondering if you can give us some detail in the mortgage banking operation, just gain on sale margins and where pipelines ended up the year compared to September 30?
Domenick A. Cama: We had a pretty strong -- not only a pretty strong quarter but a pretty strong year in terms of mortgage banking. Margins, we have not seen the margin decline that some have experienced, and that has been a result of the fact that our pipeline has been so strong. But in talking to the mortgage company over the last few days about it, they have seen a shift in the business with where less business has been going to the secondary market. So they see that we are going to reduce our margins, I think we're going to do that next week by about 0.25 of a point.
Operator: And the next question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon with Sandler O'Neill and Partners.
Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: As it relates to the balance sheet in 2013, if you exclude Roma, what kind of balance sheet growth might you be looking for? Is it likely to be slower in the first part of the year because your capital ratios are a little bit lower than your target?
Domenick A. Cama: Yes, Mark, we are projecting a balance sheet growth of somewhere around $600 million to $700 million. That's what we expect without Roma.
Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: For the full year? Okay. And spread reasonably evenly across the year?
Domenick A. Cama: Yes. January looks like it's obviously a lighter month than -- it's a lighter month. It's historically a lighter month. However, you had a bunch of business get done in December of 2012 because of a number of factors like 10/31 exchanges for property transfers, the fiscal cliff. And so transactions that could've gotten done in January got pushed into December, so we do expect the first quarter to be a little lighter than the fourth quarter of last year.
Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And secondly, do you see much in the way of potential loss content on the Sandy loans based on your initial analysis?
Kevin Cummings: No. Actually -- we wish -- I mean, at the initial analysis, we don't see much exposure, to be honest with you.
Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: And then, I wonder if you could share with us your thoughts on the tax rate for this year, is it sort of 37%, 38% a good number?
Domenick A. Cama: I think, where we're running at right now, the tax rate this quarter spiked up because of some nondeductible expenses related to the acquisition in the fourth quarter and for the year. But as we move forward into next year, we're also going to have some expenses related to the Roma acquisition but we're probably looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of 37.5% to 38%.
Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And lastly, just wondered if you could share with us any surprises, positive or negative coming out of Marathon?
Domenick A. Cama: No. At this point, we're still integrating customers, we have people calling on Marathon customers. We actually did the data conversion over this past weekend and that went well. So we haven't seen any surprises come out of there.
Operator: And the next question comes from Mark DeVries from Barclays.
Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Can you talk a little bit about where your loan yields are coming out on your multifamily and CRE loans?
Domenick A. Cama: Mark, the multifamily yields are coming in, I mean, just new production is coming in at about 3.60%. That's where we see multifamily is being on right now and that's a result of a combination of maturity terms.
Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. So are you going out 7 years?
Domenick A. Cama: We are. About 10% of the business is getting done in the 7-year maturity bucket.
Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Got it. Can you talk a little bit on deposit repricing opportunities over the next year? And with Roma, how you think about where your organic deposit growth opportunities are, post deal close?
Domenick A. Cama: In terms of Investors, we did have a significant reduction in our cost of funds over the year 2012, that exceeded 40 basis points, 45 basis points year-over-year. In terms of Roma, their cost of funds is a little bit higher, so we expect to see some pickup there. But overall, Roma's net interest margin is actually dilutive to ours, their net interest margin is about 278 basis points. So the challenge that we have, or the opportunity I should say, is to convert some of the lower-yielding assets that they have on the balance sheet into more the higher-yielding assets that we have, or that we are producing. In terms of our own deposit costs here, while we did have this 45 basis point pick up over 2012, we see the opportunities for continued reduction is slowing. We're probably close to the bottom.
Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just one last thing. How much operating expense are you targeting for 2013, not excluding any restructuring charges for Roma?
Thomas F. Splaine: The way we're looking at it right now, Mark, is taking out the Marathon expenses. We see probably Q1 and Q2 to run probably around that $52 million to $53 million range. And then depending on what happens with Roma and when we get regulatory approval, when it closes in Q2, that would be incremental to us. But we're looking for after cost saves of Roma to come in around $7.5 million to $8 million per quarter once we get them onboard and get them integrated with cost saves, which will happen later on in 2013.
Operator: And the next question comes from Collyn Gilbert with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Kevin, can you just give us our thoughts, or your thoughts on how you would sort of prioritize expansion into contiguous markets?
Kevin Cummings: Depending on a transaction, I think we're looking east -- continue to look east. We're looking on organic growth, Hudson County. And then along the Route 80 Corridor, Southern Burton County, Staten Island, we have one branch from the Marathon transaction, so Staten Island is certainly an option for organic expansion. And I think just what will happen from an opportunity point of view, when those situations come up, banks aren't bought, they're sold. We didn't look at the recent Somerset transaction that was announced this week and I think we just didn't get a chance to look at it, we're kind of in a box here now with the -- we don't want to do anything to tangible book value, we want anything that dilutes tangible book value, it's not something we're interested in doing right now.
Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. Would you look a little bit further to the south, Southern Jersey or Philly markets at all?
Domenick A. Cama: Collyn, good morning, it's Domenick. Yes. We think that with the Roma transaction, that we're establishing a good base down in that market, that Burlington County market, which came to Roma as a result of the Sterling transaction. It's something that we're excited about. As we announced on the call, when we announced the deal, we have a significant amount of business already in that market. Kevin mentioned $500 million approximately on the Pennsylvania side, and $1.2 billion on the New Jersey side. So as we've looked at the branches, they're a lower average deposit than some of ours, but I think the market is presenting a good opportunity for us and it's one that we're excited about.
Operator: And the next question comes from Timur Braziler of KBW.
Timur Braziler - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Just a couple of questions. The $7 million pretax, M&A[ph] expense experienced this quarter, can you provide a breakdown of which line items that cost was in?
Thomas F. Splaine: Sure. That breakdown is about $5 million, went through the compensation line, and about $2.4 million went through data processing fees, termination fees and professional fees.
Timur Braziler - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. Then going back to the comments that you made in the beginning of the presentation about the current New York presence and continuing to further expand in that market, is that a -- do you have a large enough presence now, you feel that you can just add a couple de novos per year or are you looking to do anything more meaningful than that?
Kevin Cummings: I think, both. I think that we believe that the market is underserved, if you will. And while we do, we'll take a conservative approach to growth organically. We also would look at opportunities to expand through acquisitions in that market. But it's one that -- we don't think we're big enough in the market now with 23 branches, we know we need to expand that.
Timur Braziler - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And is the expansion -- if you're going to focus mainly on the city itself or some of the other Boroughs?
Kevin Cummings: No, I think, the Boroughs. We look at the opportunity to do business in New York to be better in the Boroughs. If you go into the city, the city is saturated with banks and they're mostly large institutions. And the nature of our business is one in which we're dealing with communities and relation -- have relationships with customers and we think that the Boroughs and some of the counties in Nassau and Suffolk county are better suited for that type of business.
Domenick A. Cama: I'd call Brooklyn and Queens Jersey City on steroids.
Operator: And there are no more questions at the present time so I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
Kevin Cummings: Okay. I thank you for your participation today. We're focused, we have our business plans in place and we're looking -- we're very excited about the opportunities in 2013. So I thank you for participating and I'll talk to you soon. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2010 Q1  (2010-04-30 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Andrew Palmer – IR Joe Jolson – Chairman and CEO Ray Jackson – CFO Mark Lehmann – Co-President, JMP Securities Carter Mack – Co-President, JMP Securities
Analysts: Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill Lauren Smith – KBW 
Operator: Good morning everyone and welcome to JMP Group’s first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Palmer, JMP Group’s Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Palmer: Thank you, good morning, and welcome to JMP Group’s first quarter 2010 conference call. On the line with me this morning is Joe Jolson, JMP Group’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as well as Ray Jackson, the company’s Chief Financial Officer. We are joined by Craig Johnson, President of JMP Group and Carter Mack and Mark Lehmann, Co-Presidents of the JMP Securities. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made this morning may contain forward-looking statements about future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the JMP Group’s control. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties that could affect JMP Group’s future performance, please see the description of risk factors included in JMP’s most recent 10-K. With that, I give your Chairman and CEO Joe Jolson. 
Joe Jolson: Thanks, Andrew and thanks to everyone listening in this morning and for your interest in our company. We had mixed results in the first quarter but nonetheless managed to generate $0.10 share in operating net income. Thanks to the diversification of our business model and to our more variable incentive compensation structure.  Given our robust investment banking pipeline that we discussed at the last call going into 2010, we were somewhat disappointed by the lack of revenue throughput in the first quarter. Thanks to a slowdown in the U.S. equity capital market activity. Thus far in the second quarter we have been involved in quite a few capital raising and strategic advisory transactions and we remain optimistic about our momentum in that business.  Continuing the trend from the past few quarters, institutional equities trading volume has also been subdued during the March period. Offsetting these shortfalls was another solid performance of JMP Credit and continued progress at Harvest Capital Strategies. We continue to anticipate reduced net investment income in 2010 and 2011 as JMP Credit reinvests the cash proceeds from sales and payoffs of loans that we acquired at distressed prices a year ago in the current, more normalized pricing environment. Nevertheless, we hope to offset much of the decline with earnings growth at our other operating businesses which have benefitted from our decision 18 months ago to spend some earnings to build them out during the down cycle. JMP Group will continue to invest in people and platforms in 2010 and we remain hopeful for an acceleration in topline growth in 2011 and beyond.  That said I have Ray take you through the rest of the actual numbers for the quarter. Ray?
Ray Jackson: Thanks, Joe. First quarter net revenues were $25.2 million compared to $24.2 million a year ago. As Joe mentioned, first quarter operating net income was $2.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to $0.6 million or $0.03 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2009. Operating net income excludes compensation expense related to the grant of restricted stock units at our IPO and assumes an effective tax rate of 42%. GAAP net income for the quarter was $1.7 million or $0.08 per share while it was just $34,000 or $0.00 per share a year earlier.  Investment banking revenues were $5.5 million, up 33% from $4.1 million for the first quarter of 2009.  Public equity underwriting revenues were $2.7 million for 2009; private placement revenues were $0.4 million; and strategic advisory were $2.4 million. In total, JMP executed 10 investment banking transactions during the quarter versus six a year before.  As for sales and trading, net brokered revenues were $7.7 million, down 10% from $8.5 million for the first quarter of 2009, which is indicative of the industry-wide decline in institutional equity trading volumes that has affected the majority of IPOs. However it’s worth noting that our brokered revenues have historically been the lowest in the first quarter of each year, which is not the case for our largest competitors.  Asset management related fee revenues were $3.4 million for the quarter, down 61% from $8.7 million a year ago. Base management fees increased to $2.3 million from $2 million for the first quarter of 2009, though incentive fees dropped sharply to $0.6 million from $6.5 million. Other asset management fees doubled to $2.5 million.  Client assets under management at March 31st equaled $1.1 billion compared to $1.1 billion at December 31st and $502 million at March 31st, 2009. Principal transactions generated net revenues of $1.4 million versus $2.9 million for the first quarter of last year. In addition, JMP Credit Corporation realized gains of $3.5 million from the payoff or sale of 11 of the loans in its portfolio. A loan loss provision of $0.2 million was recorded for the quarter as a pooled reserve against performing loans at JMP Credit.  Compensation and benefits expense was $15.5 million, compared to $18.8 million a year ago. As a percentage of net revenues, pro forma compensation and benefits expense, which excludes the cost of IPO-related equity awards, was 58.9% compared to 73.7% for the first quarter of 2009 and 64.4% for the fourth quarter. The decline was primarily due to revenue mix shift in the first quarter with net investment income going up and incentive asset management fees going down.  Non-compensation expense totaled $6.3 million, up from $5.3 million a year earlier due to increased business development activity and JMP Credit related operating cost. As in the first quarter of last year, we didn't yet own JMP Credit. Non-compensation expense equaled 24.9% of net revenues versus 21.9% for the first quarter of 2009. From a balance sheet standpoint JMP Group operate at very low leverage with a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of less than 7% excluding non-reco CLO debt. We have just $9 million of term debt outstanding. From a liquidity perspective, we have access to our currently undrawn $19 million line of credit that bears an interest rate of LIBOR Plus 2.25% and have over $72 million of liquid net assets or approximately $3.35 per share.  Total equity at March 31st was $123 million and tangible book value per share was $5.68 compared to $5.60 at the end of the prior quarter.  Now I will turn things back over to Joe.
Joe Jolson: Thanks, Ray. I wanted to provide some details on our investment spending at JMP Securities over the last 12 to 18 months. We have been acutely focused on increasing our Senior Analyst ranks within our existing sectors of financial services, real estate, healthcare, technology and consumer, a number that has grown from 16 analysts in early 2009 to 22 today. We fully expect that these analysts will initiate coverage on more than 100 new names in the next year, which could bring our research universe to approximately 400 companies compared to just over 200 at the beginning of last year, roughly a double in less than two years.  Concurrent with the product rollout, we have been focused on upgrading and completing the build-out of our sales and trading operation. We have a number of offers outstanding to senior producers and hope to have accomplished our objective within the next few months. The last phase of the rollout of our middle market boutique will be the addition of three to five senior investment bankers to focus on the industry verticals where we have added research coverage. While we are deep in the recruiting process, it is still too early to tell whether we will attract the 18 players we are after in an increasingly competitive environment.  So fast forward to March 2011 at JMP Securities, we hope to have around 200 employees which would be about 10% more than we have today half of which will be MDs and Directors more than 400 companies under research coverage industry and product focused investment bankers and a full complement of sales people and sales traders catering to more than 600 active institutional accounts.  While we have projected our revenues will lag this build-out of critical mass, we are very optimistic that positive topline trends could emerge later this year and accelerated over the next few years.  Also wanted to say a few words about Harvest Capital Strategies and JMP Credit, our asset management businesses because they are key to understanding what occurred in the first quarter and what could happen as the year goes on. Harvest Capital Strategies is in the second inning of its quest to be a multi-strategy alternative asset management platform with multiple top decile performance records over the past few years. We are hopeful that layering in more marketing resources this year will help the desire to (inaudible) an accelerating AUM growth over the next few years.  Asset management revenues consists of base fees, which are directly tied to AUM levels and incentive fees that can fluctuate each quarter depending on individual fund performance. To reduce the impact of the volatility of these incentive fees on our earnings, we chose a while ago to participate out a high percentage of those fees to the fund management teams themselves, which was the case in last year’s first quarter and which can lead to overstated or understated compensation ratio but a much greater stability of earnings as you saw this quarter. From a principal investment standpoint, we had another great quarter overall with a return of nearly 6% on invested capital even though performance was mixed with our hedge funds due to their consistently high short exposure and the obvious sharp drop or a sharp jump, I should say in indices for February and March.  JMP Credit had another great quarter. The improved market conditions mean that our opportunity to generate outsized capital gains on senior debt investments will likely diminish over the next year. We believe that there are tremendous growth opportunities for this business as a result of the fallout from the severe recession and financial crisis. We hope to share our plans with investors later this year.  Lastly I will point out that our compensation ratios (reset) for the first quarter was lower than it’s typically the case due to our revenue mix, which was heavily weighted to investment income and included minimal carry interest fees. As we have described before, we assigned different compensation ratios to different sources of revenue, so the blended ratio will vary quarter to quarter depending on our revenue mix. Assuming that our investment banking and hedge fund businesses perform according to plan this year, we believe our full year pro forma comp ratio will be somewhere in the mid 60s.  And in closing, as always, I wanted to thank JMP employees for the hard work and for our shareholders for the continued support. We are always happy to hear from you and answer any questions you may have.  With that I would like to open up the call to any questions. Thanks, operator. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first quarter today from Devin Ryan from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill: Just thinking about the brokerage business, what do you think is going to take the material improvement in activity and revenues? Is it more primary issuance, more conviction by market participants or higher equity flows can be enough or do you think that the industry outlook for that business is becoming any less attractive I guess I would say?
Joe Jolson: Well, let me start and I think Mark Lehmann is there, maybe he has some comments. But the brokerage business has been in a bear market institutional brokerage business for about the last 10 years and we have a little periods here where there it seems to improve a little bit, and then it goes back to kind of not hitting expectations. We have been able to grow through that down cycle. In fact, every year we had record revenues there, last year was our first down year since inception. And part of that is we have invested in the business and then the revenues lag.  For about three or four years, we hadn’t invested in the business part because of the competitive situation for hiring people a few years ago. And in the down cycle, we have take a lot of the investment income that we have generated from our funds as well as the profits on the JMP Credit acquisition and chose to reinvest those into doubling our product in that business, which of course cost some money. But we believe strongly that whether the business gets better or not, we will double our revenues over the next five years. There is a very high correlation between having good analysts that have an information edge covering industry sectors with companies that people care about and commissions revenues as well as investment banking revenues over any period of time.  So that's kind of our strategy whether the environment improves or not, Devin. And Mark, do you have anything to add to that?
Mark Lehmann: Yes, I would echo, Devin, what Joe said. I also think – kind of the perfect storm in the first quarter and we were a – we hope with some of the issuance that we have, the capital markets have improved and we continue to look for new hires. And I think there was a rash of hiring a year ago with a lot of people expecting great things to happen as long as they have built out a huge staff and I think some of that excitement has waned with the lack of capital markets activity for some. And I think we are seen as an attractive platform again with the kind of senior analysts and people we have. So I think some of the initiatives we have will bear fruit and I do think the kind of record low volumes that we saw in the first quarter starting to wane a little bit. But we are still actively recruiting and we still think that there is people out there who when they get to know us a little bit better will be attracted to what we are doing. And again, more and more boutiques are gaining market share, I am not sure the biggest firms are the most attractive places for everybody. I think boutiques mind share is going up. I continue to hear that from issuers and hopefully that will help us recruit and retain the kind of people we want here.
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill: Okay, thanks for the color. A question on the comp ratio, I know the level from quarter to quarter really depends on the mix of business but if we were going to assume that earnings for 2010 set another record like last year and I guess trigger additional bonuses, will there potentially be another special accrual at some point, that becomes more clear or is that concept maybe already contemplated in the first quarter accrual?
Joe Jolson: I will let Ray answer part of that, Devin, but I mean I think that the – we are going to file our proxy today, I believe tonight. So there will be some details into how the triggers for that for you, okay to think the accrual but suffice it to say that it’s similar to it in the past or – those kind of things were driven by the ability of the company to produce record results and the record results would be viewed as net of anything as opposed to hit the number before those bonuses type of thing. 
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill: Right.
Joe Jolson: So I mean I think last year if you look at our numbers and I have said this in every call, we had a very percentage of our revenues in pretax coming from investment income, which was great but it obviously creates a challenge to compare to that and what we did was chose to try to find expenses that we could accelerate and invest in growing our operating businesses which is why we are doubling our product. In JMP Securities we have hired a bunch of marketing resources at Harvest Capital Strategies.  So I think that that's how we are managing through that. I think it’s way too early to tell in the year whether those things would trigger, but if they did, it would probably be late in the year, I would suspect. I don’t know if you have anything to add to that, Ray.
Ray Jackson: No, that's accurate. 
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill: Okay guys, and then just thinking about the investment banking pipeline, it would be great to get a little more color in terms of what you guys are seeing in the pipeline and maybe some detail across sector – what sectors are looking better than others. 
Joe Jolson: I think Carter is on the line. Carter, do you want to take that one?
Carter Mack: Sure. We have seen a pretty market pickup in activity in the second quarter through April now with a number of IPOs and follow-ons closing, I think we have two more deals closing this week. I would say the theme is a lot more IPO activity, we have had, I think, we have had three tech IPOs in the first and the second quarter. And we see more of that to come and the pipeline on the IPO front is fairly robust, and we are seeing pickup in follow-on activity across a number of sectors, financial services in particular, and that we feel fairly good about where we sit in the second quarter so far. 
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill: Okay, great. And then just lastly, Joe, I don’t know if you can give us an update on the approximate amount of the gains maybe have to be realized on the current value, a fair value of that CLO portfolio, any flavor for that?
Joe Jolson: Yes, I mean I think that it will be in our Q that gets filed next week, you can derive the number. But obviously, the way to think about it is we bought a pool of assets, some of which were highly stressed in the economy at an average price of little over $0.60 on the dollar and part of those assets were valued low because they had credit issues. So the performing assets might have had average price closer to 65 to 70 range, Devin. And in this environment, all those assets are pretty much back at par or they paid off par and we are taking the cash and we are redeploying it in new senior debt that has been in the high 90s to par, most recently. So that’s why there is no ability to recreate those kind of capital gains now.  From a spread point of view, the credit spread, even though they have tightened up a lot are still very attractive compared to historical standards. We are getting roughly 3.50 to 4 on LIBOR type of thing and (inaudible) getting a lot of floors on the new capsule. From a spread point, it’s an attractive market to redeploy the capital even though it’s still a par type of thing but just those outsized capital gains over any period of time on sustainable investing in low risk senior debt. I think that the way that deal was structured, the subscription-piece of the securitization that we own was structured for $45 million.  So that's kind of the way you should think about it. Ultimately it might be worth $45 million at par, right, and so you can look at the loan sale gains from last year and what we have got in the first quarter. And that's not a bad guide in terms of what might be available going forward but just remember, if those occur or as those occur, they are not going to continue at that level, it’s a melting ice cube of gains type of thing. 
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill: Right, we understand that. I was just trying to get a sense of maybe how much book value –
Joe Jolson: If you take $45 million as your starting point and we did roughly $20 million last year and $3 million this quarter, right?
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill: Yes. 
Joe Jolson: That gets you $22 million left to go roughly speaking, right?
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill: Right, okay.
Joe Jolson: And let’s see what happens over the rest of this year, there is the number of the credit markets pretty active right now and a number of companies that had tight covenants and got their debt repriced in the down cycle or looking at maybe refinancing of that. 
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill: Got it. And there could also an addition of maybe be some reserve of leases, correct?
Joe Jolson: Yes, I mean the credits performed better than expected but that will get reflected in the residual value, they are effective in that 45 million piece that we bought for not a lot of money. So I mean it’s – I don't want you to double count. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will take our next question from Lauren Smith of KBW. Please go ahead.
Lauren Smith – KBW: Couple of questions. Clearly you are continuing to build out your franchise, you have identified research and banking. And I am just curious your thoughts and – or have you rethought maybe fixed income and if there were opportunities there and if not why, either that's not a business that you have really been focused on building?
Joe Jolson: Well, I don't know if we talked about this in the past but about a year and a half, two years ago we looked at it really hard back in the downturn and interviewed a lot of people and had one of our senior people in asset management take that assignment to see if we could put together our own kind of boutique fixed income shop type of thing within JMP and we had some very well regarded senior people that were interested in joining us. And so we did look at it pretty hard in the downturn. I guess what we concluded was that the outsized spreads that were available on particularly on the high grade side were just going to get competed away pretty quickly. And the competition for people in that business was pretty heated, for the people we were trying to recruit even in the downturn. So these people were asking for pretty high guarantees and we are not a guarantee shop. And if you weren't going to guarantee them cash comp, they wanted really high kind of guarantee payout ratios, which over any period of time would lock you into pretty subpar profit level, Lauren.  So we decided that that wasn't a good – there were other things that we could do like get into the JMP Credit, at the same time was much better opportunity obviously. So I think that – we will look that in the future as opportunities come up. There is some synergy from an investment banking point of view on the high yield side we think with the middle market companies that we now – as you may know, we did start a convert area before senior value. So we got into that business, which is kind of equity related if you will. And we have started a debt advisory business through our credit operation on kind of the buy side of the Street originated but now – it was successful. So we have kind of put it into JMP Securities now. 
Lauren Smith – KBW: Again, we have talked about it in the past, but you never know if – just wanted to get your thoughts if something you are revisiting or thinking about – there is opportunities with – a lot of small shops out there and (inaudible) we got to see some consolidation. We saw just earlier this week but –
Joe Jolson: We will continue to – I mean we look at a lot of things, Lauren, as you know. And I like to think that we are reasonably disciplined at financial returns and in the like. So I mean we do look at a lot of things including the kind of things you are alluding to. So you never know but there is nothing that we would be imminent there, I don’t think. 
Lauren Smith – KBW: Okay, that’s helpful, thank you. And I guess, Ray, a question for you. On the non-comp side, is this – (inaudible) to seasonality in the first quarter and its activity is accelerating, your travel and business development expense will increase, but is this non-comp run rate, is this is pretty good going forward?
Ray Jackson: Yes, I would say it’s going to (inaudible) this increase from quarter to quarter. 
Joe Jolson: Lauren, part of that is we didn't have the JMP Credit a year ago. 
Lauren Smith – KBW: Right, okay. So the year-over-year on comparison –
Joe Jolson: That’s part of it and anyway just – and by the way we locked the year-over-year numbers with them in the second quarter. 
Lauren Smith – KBW: Right, okay. And I should know this, but can you refresh my memory, I know it’s a small number, but the other income line, is that – what is that, is that pretty much like private equity?
Joe Jolson: No, we don’t really – actually we just launched our first private equity, it’s a secondary kind of venture fund. We are – they are not looking at LP interest but the actual kind of age positions in buying secondary shares from founders and venture funds. So that launched April 1st with – and we are hoping to build a interesting business around that group of people. But for us, other income is our fees that we get for sponsoring other funds. So there is a few funds that we’ve sponsored over time that aren’t for GAAP consolidated into that. So the main one there is a fund Expo Capital, it’s a healthcare focused fund run by Paul Sinclair, he has done a great job, and he is roughly closing in on $300 billion in asset under management now. So we would help start that business with Paul and we have a financial interest and that's the primary thing going through other income. 
Lauren Smith – KBW: Okay, great, thank you. 
Joe Jolson: And AUM is – in our AUM we don’t include that in the numbers we give you guys for AUM, but we market his fund. 
Lauren Smith – KBW: Got it, okay. And I guess just lastly, what – did you buy any stock back in the quarter and what do you have left rating on your authorization?
Joe Jolson: We have been buying stock back as – in conjunction with the RSU vestings. We give people the option of keeping the stock or will buy back or tax bill on the stock. And so, I think we bought back about 100,000 shares that way. 
Ray Jackson: Yes, that's right. 
Joe Jolson: And we have another lock up release coming up in May where there will be a similar kind of buyback for a much bigger number. So that's how – Ray, do you know what's left on the authorization? I think it’s (half) million shares at this point. 
Ray Jackson: Yes, it's about 500,000, 600,000.  
Lauren Smith – KBW: Okay, and how much is coming off lockup in May? Do you have a –
Joe Jolson: 35% of the IPO awards. So I think Ray maybe can get you the exact number but there was around $1.9 million shares issued when we went public and there has been a few for – not a lot of them, but a few far fetchers over time. So that would be 35%, that’s roughly maybe 650,000, 670,000 shares, about half of which, a little less than half we will buy back. 
Lauren Smith – KBW: Got it, thank so for taking my question. 
Joe Jolson: Sure. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And it appears we have no further questions at this time. 
Joe Jolson: Operator, thank you and thanks everyone for listening. Ray, Andrew and myself will be available today. If you have any other follow-up questions, and we are excited about the start to the year and looking forward to caching up with you guys next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect at any time. Thank you and have a great day.

===== 2007 Q4  (2008-03-12 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Joseph Jolson - Chairman and CEO Thomas Kilian - CFO Carter Mack - Co-President Mark Lehmann - Co-President Andrew Palmer - Head of IR
Analysts: Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill David Trone - Fox-Pitt Patrick Davitt - Merrill Lynch Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capital Lauren Smith - KBW
Operator: Welcome to JMP Group's Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Palmer, JMP Group's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Palmer: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to JMP Group's fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. First, I'd like to point out that this morning's press release regarding JMP Group's quarterly and full year results is available on the company's website at www.jmpg.com. In addition, we expect to file a Form 10-Q with the Securities & Exchange Commission later this week, which will be accessible on our website and on the SEC's as well. In the room with me this morning are Joseph Jolson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of JMP Group; Thomas Kilian, our Chief Financial Officer; and Carter Mack and Mark Lehmann, Co-Presidents of JMP Securities. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made during today's call may contain forward-looking statements about future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the JMP Group’s control. The company's actual results and financial conditions may differ from what is indicated or implied in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties that could affect JMP Group's future results please see the description of risk factors included in our forthcoming 10-K and in our Form S-1 registration statement which was filed with the SEC on May 11th, 2007. That said, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Joe Jolson.
Joseph Jolson: Thanks, Andrew. I would like to thank everyone on the call today and thank for your interest in JMP Group. As most of you know, 2007 was our first year as a public company following our IPO in May of 2007. I want to take this opportunity to especially thank all of the employees of JMP for their hard work and their dedication. We had a lot of thing happen this year; some good, some bad, but there has been a lot of change, including being a public company. It was collectively our efforts that produced these results for our shareholders. Before Thomas goes through our quarterly results in more detail, I want to make a couple of quick comments on the revenues and operating earnings that we produced. I want to point out that we refer to operating earnings as the measure that we look at. Just quickly, it's better defined in our press release, but basically the only difference between operating earnings, going forward, as well as this quarter and GAAP earnings, is the amortization of our IPO stock awards that will be with us for basically the next three years. As you could see from the press release this morning we actually reported record results in the fourth quarter. Our revenues grew 37% from a year ago to almost to $32 million and this was in the context of a very difficult operating environment, not just for the stock market in general and the second half for the fourth quarter, but also in some of the areas that we focus in. Our operating earnings grew 27% to $3.3 million or $0.16 per diluted share. For the full year, revenues grew 13% to $98 million and operating earnings grew 12% to $0.52 for fully-diluted shares. Now Thomas is going to take you through more details here, and then I will come back and make some comments about not just last year but maybe some of the things going on right now. I would also like to mention that Craig Johnson, the President of JMP group just joined us in the room as well. Tom?
Thomas Kilian: Thanks Joe. On a GAAP basis, JMP reported a net income of $2.6 million or $0.12 per diluted share for the fourth quarter. For the full year 2007, the GAAP net income was as follows: For the pre IPO partnership, JMP reported a net loss of $111.7 million for the period from January 1 through May 16th, 2007, due to a non cash one-time expense of $112.9 million related to the company’s corporate reorganization. For the period from May 16 through December 31, 2007, JMP as the post IPO Corporation reported a net income of $3.9 million. It's already mentioned operating net income for the fourth quarter was $3.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share. JMP's operating net income for the fiscal year 2007 was $10.1 million, or $0.52 per diluted share. Note that today's press release details the difference between the company's GAAP net income and its operating net income, and includes a table reconciling the two. Joe has already discussed our total revenues, but I will go into some more specifics of the various business lines here. Investment banking revenues for the fourth quarter were $16.4 million, up 56% from $10.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. For 2007 investment banking revenues were $49.3 million, up 12% from $44.1 million for 2006. Public equity underwriting revenues for the fourth quarter totaled $5.8 million, compared to $6.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. Challenging equity capital markets conditions during part of the quarter led us to complete 10 public offerings compared to 14 during the fourth quarter of 2006. However, despite the headwinds in the capital markets, public equity underwriting revenues for 2007 totaled $19.4 million, compared to $18.3 million for 2006, an increase of 6%. JMP acted as lead manager of 8 public equity offerings raising $646 million in 2007 versus 5 offerings which raised $312 million in the prior year. We had strong strategic advisory revenues for the fourth quarter of $9.4 million, compared to $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, strategic advisory revenues claimed 56% to $20.1 million from $12.9 million for 2006, while JMP completed just one more strategic advisory engagement in 2007. Then in 2006, it was 90 in this year versus 80 last year, and the JMP Group average revenues per engagement by 47% year-over-year. Private placement revenues for the quarter were $1.2 million, compared to $0.5 million for the fourth quarter last year. For the full year private placement revenues were $9.7 million, down from $12.8 million for 2006. This difference is largely due to JMP's executing fewer trust preferred securities offerings in 2007 than in 2006, as a result of the deterioration of the credit market. JMP's net brokerage revenues for the fourth quarter were a record $9.6 million, up 29% from $7.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 and for the fiscal year 2007 net commissions revenues grew 15% to $34.8 million from $30.2 million for the prior year. Asset management fee revenues totaled $2.3 million for the fourth quarter, up 13% from $2.1 million for the fourth quarter of last year. Asset management revenues totaled $5 million for the year, up 11% from $4.5 million for 2006. At December 31, 2007, our client assets under management equaled $237 million, an increase of 14% from $208 million for year-end 2006. In early January, we received additional ad contributions of nearly $36 million resulting in total client assets under management of $273 million as of January 3, 2008. Now for the expenses, compensation and benefits expense equals $20.8 million for the fourth quarter compared to $12.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. For the full year, compensation and benefits expenses equaled $64 million in 2007, compared to $50.1 million in the prior year. 2007 compensation expense included non-cash expense. This was related to equity-based awards granted or invested in connection with our IPO of $1.3 million for the fourth quarter and $7.2 million for the full year. Excluding the cost of these IPO related awards, the ratio of compensation to total revenues was 61.3% for the fourth quarter, resulting in a compensation ratio of 58% for the full fiscal year. We achieved an annual compensation ratio of less than 60% of total revenues, as we stated is our objective in our IPO prospectus, and we intend to keep the annual expense ratio below 60% in the future. Non-compensation expense was $6.5 million or 20% of revenues for the fourth quarter, compared to $6.1 million or 26% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2006. For the full year, non-compensation expense was $23.7 million in 2007 and $22.2 million in 2006 or approximately 24% of total revenues in '07 and 26% of revenues in '06. The expenses related to income allocation and accretion of Redeemable Class A member interests are excluded from these calculations in order to normalize the results. And briefly some words about the company's balance sheet: JMP's balance sheet remains fairly liquid and un-levered. At December 31st, JMP had nearly $111 million in net cash and investments that excludes accrued bonuses that we paid in February of this year. That is approximately $5.37 per share. Total equity at year-end was $116.6 million. Our book value was $5.60 per share based on $20.6 million basic shares outstanding. As we announced last quarter, the JMP Group was authorized to repurchase up to 1.5 million shares of its stock. During the fourth quarter this past January, we completed the purchase of all 1.5 million shares at a total cost of $11.5 million or $7.66 per share on average. Earlier this week, our board authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of additional 2 million shares during the next 18 months. Finally, JMP has declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.05 per share, which equals the previous quarter dividend amount, which will be paid in April to shareholders on record as at March 28th. With that, I would turn it back over to Joe.
Joseph Jolson: Thanks Thomas. I like to put these results in some perspective and some observations on some of the numbers from last year. As we have mentioned repeatedly in the past, both when we went public and on our previous conference calls, given the business mix the JMP Group has currently, we have exposures to mortgage and specialty finance, and in particular the homebuilding industry. These are exposures that we’ve had since we started the business when a 100% of our revenues came from those sectors. Then in 2006, it was about 35% of our revenues that came from those sectors going into the turmoil that occurred this year, in particular, in the second half for the year. That turmoil has continued into the first quarter of this year. We have been pretty open about these exposures and I would like to point out that based on our results for last year in the fourth quarter, exposures are fete accompli in terms of results. We had a very successful first year as a public company. We generated record revenues. We came within a few hundred grand of generating record operating net income. We finished the year with our best quarter ever, in terms of revenues and operating earnings. We have a lot going on in our asset management business, in terms of building assets under management, that didn't really show up in our '07 results because of the timeframe in terms of adding the assets and collecting the fees. But this should benefit our '08 outlook, and as Thomas and I both mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter. All this in the face of the turbulent stock market conditions that clearly impacted certain parts of our business, but I think it's the testimony to our strategy starting in 2001, which is aggressively diversifying into other industry sectors as well as other products and different business lines. Let me just go into some detail about those different business lines. Our last year investment banking revenues actually grew 12%, despite what we continue to refer to as a very difficult environment in some of the experience of our peer group out there. When you look at our sectors, they were pretty balanced last year. As I mentioned, the original basis of our group, which for us is really mortgage, specialty finance, consumer finance, which was about one-quarter of investment banking revenues last year, real estate and related areas. We put hospitality, that was about another quarter with life sciences and technology, also representing about a quarter each of our investment banking revenues. In addition to that, we have made major push in the last three years into building an advisory business. As most of you know, last year advisory fees as well as private placement revenues totaled over 60% of our investment banking revenues for last year. Three years ago, when we started this push that number was 29% of a much lower number. So, we feel pretty good about how we performed last year, given our product mix as well the turbulence stock market, particularly in the fourth quarter. From an institutional brokerage business, we went through this at length when we went public. We continue to expect double-digit and top line growth, even though we are being impacted by all the same trends that everyone else is. We have felt that we had not achieved our natural market share, yet in that business and at the end of the year, we showed over 15% growth in brokerage revenues. And there aren't great numbers on this, but our best guess is that the overall business declined over 10% last year, and what would be available to us to capture for our piece of that business? Importantly, though, not that many people focus on this from the outside, we achieved these market share gains with a relatively flat head count in research, sales and trading, which means the profitability of that area improved along with the increase in revenues. Asset management-related fees and these numbers I am going to give you now were including fundraising fees that we raised for an outside fund that we sponsor, or we get a percentage of what their fees are. That shows up in other income in our GAAP financials, but conceptually, it's part of how we are building our asset management business. Those fees last year rose over 20% year-over-year. Now, we mentioned in previous calls that over half of our assets under management have been in funds that focus in housing, mortgage, specialty finance. Our capital was invested in these funds as well. Over half of the capital we've invested is in these funds. So given the turbulent times in the equities market for the year, I think it was reasonable to assume we would have a difficult year last year, and we were cautious. Though, I'm happy to report that we did much better than expected last year, despite all this. Last year our return on our funds was up over 10%, and it wasn’t a smooth 10%, but at the end of the year when we added it up it was up over 10%. We grew assets under management for the first time in a number of years, which we were hopeful when we took -- in the IPO roadshow that that had bottomed out. And I'm happy to report that, so far this year, at least on January 2nd as opposed to December 31st -- it is in the press release; assets under management were up 15% into the new year over the level that they ended last year, which is as you saw from the press release, year-over-year, we are up 14% in assets under management. So, on January 2nd that number grew another 15% on top of that. Obviously, this bodes well for the outlook for management fee income in 2008. In particular, the two fund strategies that have been performing very well in our group and generating a lot of this growth have been our small cap fund run by Jeff [Bolsher] and our Masters Funds, both the emerging, as well as the Masters fund run by [Bruce Marsh-Becker], Craig Johnson and Jack Barber, who are just superlative in a difficult time and have been growing their assets under management. In addition to these public securities funds, we have also started some private equity and direct invest initiatives in the last few months, that we are hopeful will have positive impact not just on 2008, but over the next few years. Now since we went public, we have deployed some of the IPO proceeds. Some of it has gone into repurchasing our shares. Thomas mentioned the number of shares, which cost us roughly $11.5 million. So basically, we are able to repurchase almost 7% of our company at a net enterprise value of less than $2.5 a share. Today our net enterprise value is even less. It appears that it's closer to $0.50 a share today. That shouldn’t come as a surprise that we were interested in buying more shares now. Over the next year or so, if we execute on that 2 million share authorization plus the 1.5 million, that will be roughly a third of our float that exists right now or at least after the IPO, after lock up was released. Then I think that we are planning on paying for this buyback through retained earnings over the next 12 to 24 months. I would also like to mention, as most of you know, but this is public information, we made an investment in the company called New York Mortgage Trust in January. And our 50% owned REIT, JMP Reality Trust also made an investment. Our company invested $5 million in a Convertible Preferred REIT, which we have one half of invested, another $10 million in that offering, and then other affiliated entities that aren’t part of JMP Group investing another $5 million. In February, JMP Securities executed a $60 million equity-type transaction bringing New York Mortgage Trust for JMP Group investing another $4.5 million into that. Recently there has been a liquidity squeeze in Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities, which has resulted frankly from the liquidation of some highly levered funds, not the likes of which we have seen since long-term capital back in 1998. I am happy to report in New York Mortgage Trust, we made a press release yesterday about the fact that they have been able to weather the storm. Currently spreads on investing in agency arms and hybrid securities are at the highest levels that I think they have ever been, and they are providing really attractive returns on incremental capital. So we are hopeful over the next month or two that New York Mortgage Trust can actually access growth capital and take advantage of these, but they have been successful in weathering this downturn, unlike the number of other publicly-traded companies that are pretty high profile, which have had some significant difficulties. Just a brief comment on our margins and our goals longer-term that we have talked about in the past: We are continuing to target revenue growth over the next five years in the 10% to 20% a year range. In Asset Management, we are hopeful that we are at the top end or above that range and in Investment Banking we will be looking at the mid to top end of that range. In the Brokerage side, some of that depends on some of these secular trends, but we are still hopeful that at least it will be in the 10% to 15% range, like it has been in the last few years. I think it's important to note that we were able to deliver earnings after generating this top line growth that of an 18% operating margin. For company, of our size particularly one that just went public, and it has to absorb the cost of being a public company. I think that was a pretty remarkable feat and that was consistent with our operating margin of last few years. And as most of you know who have looked at our company, we do focus a lot of our attention on what we spend money on, what our costs are, and making sure that anything we spend money on it makes very good business sense for the company longer-term. Our non-comp expense ratio is actually the dollar amount, and increased just 7% last year. That was with 7.5 months of being a public company and as a percent of revenues. Because of faster top line growth, that ratio fell to 24% from 26%. Now, we have to absorb Sarbanes Oxley's costs this year, and we have to be compliant by the end of '08. We saw a little bit of that in the fourth quarter in our non-comp expense, and you will see more of that in the next few quarters as we ramp that up. We also have, additionally, a full year of extra shares that we issued in the IPO outstanding to compare against, going forward. Now we feel like as we get into '09, we are going to get some more leverage on the non-comp expense line that will be able to pass through to our shareholders, and hopefully get into an operating margin levels, somewhere in the 20% to 25% range over the next three to five years. If we are successful at that, our operating earnings growth will grow quite a bit faster than our top line growth. And we continue to plan to return that capital to shareholders, a third of which will be in cash dividends, and the other two thirds could be some combination of share buybacks or other growth opportunities that come our way in the next few years. Before we open up for questions, I just wanted to mention briefly our stock price. Obviously, it's dropped 45% since we went public. At first there was a curiosity, but I think at an enterprise value of $0.50, plus or minus a share. It's become from our point of view a great opportunity. And we've announced another 2 million in share buybacks. I've mentioned it over and over again, but basically we can't find anything that we can do with our capital in the public market, that’s more interesting right now, than buying our stock back aggressively. So, we plan to pursue that. I'd also like to point out, which I did at the beginning of my comments, that the headwinds that hit us for most of all of last year that we navigated successfully continues this year. And while we are very hopeful that a year from now when we are reporting our 2008 results, we'll have equal success. We also have our eyes and ears open. We are spending a lot of time looking at some opportunities that are coming along that are created by this industry downturn that could advance the ball for us quite a bit more than that 10% to 20% top line growth that we are targeting from an internal point of view. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions that any of our investors might have, we are all here to answer them. Thank you operator, could you take the queue.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Devin Ryan with Sandler O'Neill, go ahead please.
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill: Good morning, guys.
Joseph Jolson: Hi, Devin.
Thomas Kilian: Hi, Devin.
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill: It looks like there are eight deals in the public equity underwriting pipeline, but obviously not much has gotten done, since the end of January. I just want to get your view on what it will take to get these deals done, do equity market valuations maybe increase significantly from here? Do we need to see some large deals get completed? And then also are there any sectors that are looking more optimistic than others?
Joseph Jolson: We are happy to have Carter Mack who runs investment banking, he can maybe give you some more details, Devin. But basically you guys see the numbers and there haven't been a lot of offerings done in the first quarter, so that's obviously going to impact us like it will everyone else. I think that we're a little bit more diversified maybe than a lot of our public peers. Carter, do you want to give him some details on that?
Carter Mack: Yeah, I mean we have, I think you said eight deals filed and a number of other deals that were mandated on, that were in different process of drafting or getting close to filings, and I think it's difficult to say when the IPO market opens back up, there is obviously large transaction next week with VISA that is a pretty bellwether transaction, but I'm not sure that's the catalyst to open the IPO market backup. We have a number of deals on the life sciences and technology side in the pipeline, and I think we just need to see an improved equity market environment overall for some period of time for the investors start to care again on the IPO front.
Joseph Jolson: I mean I think that it’s safe because it’s the middle of March and if any of those deals aren’t currently starting a Road Show it’s not going to happen in the first quarter and not just for JMP but for everybody. So I think you know that at this point that’s pretty sure.
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill: Okay
Thomas Kilian: Most of our activity are in the equity underwriting front in the first quarter. Almost all of our activity has been in follow-on equity offerings for existing clients.
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill: Then you mentioned other deals you've mandated on, I guess just to follow-up there then. Can you describe kind of the level of conversations that you're having with companies? Are you still having these conversations or is that activity just also slowed, I guess on the cap raising and advisory side as well?
Thomas Kilian: No I think we're still having a fairly active dialog with companies and I don’t think companies are yet shying away in great numbers from pursuing the IPO route. We had a very successful pre-IPO conference about a month and half ago, where we had 40 private companies there that all were looking at the IPO market and our advice has been to continue to move ahead and to target, with the six months timeframe between filing and actually getting the deal done, what the market is going to look like at that time. So we continue to move ahead with a number of transactions and the ones that are on file are looking at the market and trying to determine when the right time is, to go out, but so far we're not seeing a rush to broaden market deal.
Joseph Jolson: For the purposes of you guys looking at us or anyone else that’s in that business or what you think we are going to earn this year, that’s a part of our business that’s difficult to predict, and in the business itself is not that easy to predict on a quarterly basis. So I think that you guys need to make your assumptions industry wide about what the stock market does and when stability returns. I think you probably need a period of stability for a 4 to 6 weeks timeframe, and then you will start to see the better quality companies that are on file, venturing out into the public market, and if they do well, that will probably encourage others to follow. So this is a kind of industry wide guess then on your part Devin.
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill:  Right. Okay and on the advisory side, there are always advisory deals that aren’t disclosed specially on the smaller size. Can you give any detail on just what you are seeing there and even on the pipeline if you can from the advisory perspective?
Carter Mack: In advisory side we continue to see good activity, we had a really strong fourth quarter with the number of deals closing. We have had reasonable activity in the first quarter; our pipeline today is about what it was at the end of last year, at the end of third quarter, while we have had some deals closed out of the pipeline, we’ve added others. We are definitely starting to see some slowdown on the M&A front. I think there is a bit of revaluation going on, with buyers looking at what’s happening in the public market. A lot of our M&As is with private sellers. So you wouldn’t see that in your pipeline, but we continue to see a fairly robust activity on the M&A side. I mean we are in the more, smaller and middle market, I think the larger market leverage. Leverage part of the market is gone down significantly with private equity buyers being on the sidelines. But our part of the market continues to be fairly active with more strategic buyers than just private equity.
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill: Great, okay, that's helpful. And Joe you spoke about the investment in New York Mortgage Trust. Just wanted to get a sense of that you're seeing similar type investment opportunities and if you can detail the kind of opportunities that you're seeing in this market or just given the dislocation we are seeing primarily in the housing market?
Joseph Jolson: We've been seeing a lot opportunities, since before we went public, Devin. I think that we try to stay pretty disciplined in terms of balancing risk in return. I think that there is a number of other opportunities currently out there in the mortgage related space. I think that we look at New York Mortgage Trust as a platform that we think is scalable given they're below fixed cost. It's highly scalable from here and that's our partner in terms of trying to take advantage of a lot of these opportunities that we might see. So, we are hopeful that we can access some growth capital with them for those opportunities. I think from a JMP Groups point of view, we have a certain amount of capital, and we are really looking at not putting it all into one sector in the economy or the market for risk management reason. So, we are looking at our capital base to not just buyback our own stock down here, but also to look at opportunities in more growth capital areas and supporting private equity funds, where we put an investment of our capital up against and stuff like that. So, but there're quite a lot opportunities to invest right now as you can imagine, and the returns are interesting, so we are always looking. We looked at a lot of things before we did New York Mortgage, and we didn't end up doing any of them. So, you just don't know, but we are optimistic. I mean Devin, if we can buy our stock back with our capital at enterprise value where it is now or even higher. I mean I think as the largest shareholder, that's me, and it's a pretty good use of our capital without taking a lot of extra risk. We kind of know what our businesses that we are buying back, right.
Devin Ryan - Sandler O'Neill: That's great. Thanks for taking my question.
Joseph Jolson: Thank you.
Thomas Kilian: Thanks.
Operator: We will take our next question from David Trone with Fox-Pitt. Go ahead please.
David Trone - Fox-Pitt: Thank you. Joe, do you guys or Carter, do you guys see any potential for wave of equity raising and consumer finance.
Joseph Jolson:  Hey, Dave, how are you?
David Trone - Fox-Pitt: Good.
Joseph Jolson: Yes, I think that it means this down turn in kind of mortgage in specialty finance and housing didn't just started in the second half of the year, as we all know. I mean we detailed the impact on us from '05 through '06 in the part of '07 in our IPO road show, right. And it was muted because of some of things that helped us have a good quarter and a good year in, for the full year in '07. Like product and industry diversification, but it has obviously gotten worse in the last six months. But I think that one of the things that we're looking forward to at some point here, and typically once the fed starts cutting short-term interest rates aggressively, with some lag, you start to see financial services stocks bottom out in for a month. That obviously hasn’t happened yet. But when that happens, you've basically eliminated a lot of public companies in the space, either through consolidation, or they got bought out, or through they went out of business, or they bought back a lot of their own shares. And it typically happens, it’s just the time that people find themselves very underweighted in financial services, and there’s not a lot of available shares to buy. So, these stocks tend to respond very quickly to that scenario, and go up in price. And companies still have great opportunities to expand for a couple of years thereafter. So, they are typically out there to raise a lot of new capital. So, you know we weren't established as a company back in 2001 and 2002, and started to by '03, but financial services revenues for instance in '05 or in '04 were over $30 million. So, I think if we had been a little bit more developed as a company then we would have done pretty close to $50 million to $100 million in that time period by perspective to now kind of thing David?
David Trone - Fox-Pitt: Yeah
Joseph Jolson: But we are very optimistic that at some point in the next 12 months a typical cycle will play out here from the fed rate cuts, and well established companies that have survived here will be asking for more capital to expand, and we're hoping to work with them to accomplish that.
David Trone - Fox-Pitt: Okay. And if I understood you correctly, at one point you mentioned the possibility of an acquisition, and correct me if I misunderstood that, but if that was true, would that be product industry or geography focused?
Joseph Jolson: I think we are always looking, I don’t mean to imply that to expect an acquisition, because we tend not to be the best acquired to be frank. I mean we actually care what our return on investment is and strategic objectives, not withstanding, we want to make really attractive return on our capital without assuming a lot of things happened, right. So, in the past there were a lot of other people that had different hurdle rates than we have that are much better acquirers. Now, if we get into an environment where there are some opportunities where we can get our kind of return on capital bogey, say, yes we will definitely look at them. We haven’t been in that environment yet, maybe that will happen as this year unfolds. But there aren’t any acquisitions we are currently looking at, I didn’t mean to imply that.
Thomas Kilian: We are seeking opportunities but there is no nothing that we are looking to do discussions on.
David Trone - Fox-Pitt: You have a pretty solid profit margin and some of your publicly traded peers are struggling with that. And obviously if this were to linger on for several quarters, it seems like some folks might get into a bit of trouble. And you know if it’s a good franchise and it’s cheap and I know your stock is, I know you are disappointed with that, but you do have some cash. Is that something that your could potentially do, maybe pickup an ailing competitor that has good franchise in a certain industry.
Joseph Jolson: Yeah. like I said it’s the business we are already in. so we think we know the business pretty well. And you have to evaluate exactly what you were looking to buy, right.
David Trone - Fox-Pitt: Yeah.
Joseph Jolson: It may be they are different then what you would look at as a analyst kind of thing.
David Trone - Fox-Pitt: Yeah.
Joseph Jolson: As we kind of be looking at what we could keep and then bake on that. If you put companies together in our space, I don't think one plus one equals two by any means.
David Trone - Fox-Pitt: Right. Yeah.
Joseph Jolson: So it may be a very different kind of analysis than you would look at as just an outside analyst covering the area. And then of course whatever we capped in revenues we would have to think that we can deliver after cost, earnings that were at a level that was a very attractive return on capital plus, as well as the effort. Because this kind of things take a lot of effort and it's all about that we could be spending doing something else for the shareholder. So I could say we are not the best acquirer in my experience. But that doesn’t mean we haven’t looked at things in the past and wouldn’t look at them in the future. And if we really got into an environment where desperation occurred and we’d be looking at taking advantage of it. But I don't know if that answers your question, the way you want it answered. I don't want to build any expectation that we are going to be aggressively roaring up in this industry or anything.
David Trone - Fox-Pitt: Yeah. Sure. Okay. and that you know at six bucks a share does that, how do you think about the possibility if were to linger there of to say, “to heck with that, lets go private again”?
Joseph Jolson: Well. I think was a lot of effort to go public. Actually it took a year. I mean obviously as a private company, some of the costs that we have as a public company will go away, and whatever our profit margin is 18% last year, would have been quite bit higher without that, right. But I think the only way to really do that would be to borrow money, right?
David Trone - Fox-Pitt: Yeah.
Joseph Jolson: And I think that..
David Trone - Fox-Pitt: Or a private equity.
Joseph Jolson: Well, but then they would borrow money on us, right?
David Trone - Fox-Pitt: Yeah.
Joseph Jolson: They typically lever these things. I think in this environment, leverage is very expensive especially for businesses that are more of a volatile quarterly or annual outlook. I think that if we can buy our stock back below cash. I don’t know how long that situation can last, but we are buyers, not just for the company, but I think you've seen quite a bit of insider buying, and you have these very long conservative blackout periods, so you go through that. We've been in the blackout period for three months now. But you may see some employees or insiders buy stock, when that lifts next week or type of thing. So we are largest shareholders and we're buying more.
David Trone - Fox-Pitt: Okay, good. Well, thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We'll take our next question from Patrick Davitt with Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, please.
Patrick Davitt - Merrill Lynch: Good morning, guys.
Joseph Jolson: Hi, Patrick.
Patrick Davitt - Merrill Lynch: Hi, how are you doing?
Joseph Jolson: Good.
Patrick Davitt - Merrill Lynch: You mentioned the large mandate in asset management in January, could you give us an idea of where that went, particularly did it go one-time to multiple funds?
Joseph Jolson: Well, there wasn't really a mandate. This is just normal business as we are trying to raise assets around performance. So within our three different asset classes the hedge fund business is actually stabilized as we went through last year, and it has been growing. So, a lot of assets have been going into our small-cap fund that has a great track record now for over two years, and a true hedge fund as opposed to just a long buyer’s fund. So, in this kind of environment people are valuing as they should someone, who actually is hedged and still can produce very attractive returns. Our fund-to-funds business which is the Masters Fund series, the larger established masters investors they were up last year was at 15%, 16% -- 18% up, that's unheard of performance and it's been 30% or better every year for the last three to four years. So, a lot of this is blocking and tackling, but that's over $100 million, and now it gets to its size, we're there are on the radar screen for the first time for institutional investors, and that could scale up pretty quickly from here and we pretty optimistic there as well. In our kind of private equity or direct investment area, there has been a lot of effort in that area from a product development point of view and we're hopeful as we go through this year that those that assets class starts to drive some growth and assets under management.
Patrick Davitt - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And do you see yourselves trying to see maybe a new distress type fund given all the distressed assets out there is it?
Joseph Jolson: Well, I think we ceded the fund last year that is in those numbers by the way, called Expo, which is Life Sciences, Healthcare Fund in LA run by a guy named Paul Sinclair, that started in April of last year, and I think end of the year it over a $100 million. And he just did a great job last year with managing the money and there is a lot of excitement around that. That is in those efforts under management numbers, but will be in our other income or piece of his fees that we get from that sponsorship going forward.
Patrick Davitt - Merrill Lynch: How much of that do you?
Joseph Jolson: What's that?
Patrick Davitt - Merrill Lynch: How much of it do you get?
Joseph Jolson: I'm not sure if we've disclosed that anywhere, but it's a kind of an industry standard arrangement, so just similar with quite a lot of these things, it's been more to that. We're always looking at sponsoring funds. Right now, we have a fund in the market that's more in the venture space, called Lake Street Partners III, that’s out there marketing, it's going to traditional LPs and those types of funds. We have a opportunity fund, we are out there in marketing in the real estate area as well. There are just on trying to raise money now though, so there is nothing really-- we are optimistic there is good response, but we haven't had a first closing yet in those. From a distressed point of view, we'd like to think that New York Mortgage, we're a significant shareholder, and after the PIPE we still own a little over 20% of the company. We are optimistic that they have an NOL and we are optimistic that we might be able to access some growth capital and take advantage of some of those, kind of opportunities in the mortgage space as we have done with our partner. So with their NOL it's more tax efficient to look at that as a vehicle maybe in the kind of mortgage space to take advantage of problems that we are all seeing.
Patrick Davitt - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And real quickly, I believe Granville’s transaction closed on the fourth quarter, correct me if I wrong?
Joseph Jolson: Yeah.
Patrick Davitt - Merrill Lynch: Can you give us an idea of how much that contributed to the investment banking?
Joseph Jolson: In the fourth quarter it was $3.75 million. There is another smaller fee related to that I think in the third quarter too.
Patrick Davitt - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Alright, thanks a lot guys.
Joseph Jolson: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Aaron Cadell with Hovde Capita. Go ahead please.
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capital: Hi, good morning. How are you guys?
Joseph Jolson: Hi, Aaron.
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capital: I was just wondering if you could talk quickly about the private placement pipeline in addition to New York Mortgage, looks like you did a deal for AmeriTrust, you talked a little bit about M&A and equities, I guess public equities but what's your pipeline like on privates?
Joseph Jolson: I'll let Carter answer to that.
Carter Mack: There are couple of different areas on the private side; our pipeline in actual true Reg D private placement is been growing and we are out in the market with a number of deals right now. Probably on the two private side as big as it has been for a long period of time. On the PIPE side we put a lot of effort into growing our PIPEs business. I think the New York Mortgage Trust was one example of a nice deal in that sector. We are in lots of discussions with potential issuers on the PIPE front and I would expect to see more activity in that area for us in the next few quarters.
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capita: So can you add up what the number of deals and the volume reflect the traditional -- all the things you mentioned, how many deals and any sense of size in terms of overall volume you are trying to raise.
Joseph Jolson: No, we haven’t disclosed any of that probably before, other than just general colors. As Carter said, we have been trying to build that area before the collapse of the public equity in markets here. It’s been a three year effort basically that in our M&A business. And last year, on revenues and investment banking they were up 12% from the previous year. The percent coming from M&A and privates was 61% compared to 27% three years early on a much-much smaller revenue base kind of number. So, I think the message we want to send you is that we are not just deciding today, with the decline in the public markets, to get into those businesses. And there is a lot of activity in those businesses. And we are hopeful that kind of percent of our revenues this year will be maintained at 60% or even higher. It’s kind of what’s in the back log right now, is it similar or higher mids.
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capita: Got it. okay.
Joseph Jolson: Okay.
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capita: And then I have a few questions just on the balance sheet. First, what was your tangible book value at the end of December?
Joseph Jolson: We don’t have any goodwill, so it’s the same as the 560 number that Thomas gave.
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capita: Okay. And then what was the cash or should we just subtract out what you bought back, so the cash balance as of December 31st?
Joseph Jolson: Well it’s all in that press release, but it's $5.37 per share in net cash. Now, net cash, we are regulated company, so we do need capital to broke or deal, or to underwrite public deals. So just keep that in mind. But that’s a measurement that you can compare from industry to industry I think so it’s relevant.
Thomas Kilian: And also that includes some marketable securities that we feel are fairly liquid.
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capita: Okay. So would that include restricted cash then?
Joseph Jolson: No.
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capital: Okay. So, that's cash and then liquid marketable securities. And then what were the other investments at the end of the quarter?
Joseph Jolson: They are investments in our hedge funds.
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capital: What was total?
Joseph Jolson: Those number will all -- there is going to be...
Thomas Kilian: It's about $28 million, and the number will be in the K that we will file late this week.
Joseph Jolson: Yeah, it will be all broken out by exactly fund by fund, and we give pretty big disclosure on all that stuff for you, and that will get filed probably tomorrow.
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capital: Okay. And then lastly I am just trying to add up all of the investments in your mortgage trust. You invested $5 million before they get the capital raise as you invested $4.5 million in the capital raised and then you own 50% of the REIT which invested $10 million?
Joseph Jolson: Exactly so...
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capital: So total that up, it is $14.5 million?
Joseph Jolson: Yeah.
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capital: And then what's the book value of New York Mortgage Trust, do you know that?
Joseph Jolson: I think that you mean as of yearend they haven't reported their results yet. So, it's a public company so I really can't comment on any of that.
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capital: Okay. And so then when you say that you are...
Joseph Jolson: I think they are going to report next week just to give you a timeframe so.
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capital: And then last question just one that you are talking about before this enterprise value $0.50, that basically that’s just the current stock price less the net cash is that's kind of the differentiator?
Joseph Jolson: I realized that for financial services investors that's not a measurement that people talk about, that’s not because most financial services companies have a big balance sheet that's levered but yes, that's measurement that people look at in cross sectors on Wall Street. And given that we don't have highly levered balance sheet and we are mostly a fee-based business I think it’s an appropriate measurement to look at for a company like our as well.
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capital: Okay and then your blackout period on the buyback would be open sometime in next week or afterwards?
Joseph Jolson: The blackout period on the buyback will open up on Monday I think I have to double check that, but I think it is Monday. We have been using one of these plans though, for the company. I think it is in par with our plan. So we haven’t been restricted in terms of buying back stock and we did as you saw in the fourth quarter. The issue is, we completed our buyback, and the blackout period was still in effect. so we couldn’t announce a new authorization until the blackout period ended.
Aaron Cadell - Hovde Capital: Okay. Alright thank you taking all my questions.
Joseph Jolson: Sure. Thanks.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) we will take our next question from Lauren Smith with KBW. Go ahead please.
Lauren Smith - KBW:  Hi guys good morning.
Joseph Jolson: Hi Lauren.
Thomas Kilian: Hi Laura.
Lauren Smith – KBW: Just a couple of quick ones and my apologies if I missed this early on, but with respect to the comp ratio, could you give us just a little color there perhaps how should we be thinking about it going forward? I mean it would certainly higher, than I had expected as we move into’08. Maybe just a little help in that regard and then if you also with respect to comp could you refresh our memory what is fixed versus variable or cash, the mix of cash versus stock and compensation?
Joseph Jolson: Sure well I think, that the comp ratio was well with in that 60% level that we talked about in the IPO. And I think one of the reason that you might had, as did we, a lower number than 60% was some piece of that was going to come in; in the form of stock-based-comp, which at least in the first year doesn't show up in your comp expense and then to get amortized thereafter okay. So, the real difference between a 60% ratio, which we've been accruing for in our operating businesses and what it ends up being the main difference might be, stock-based-comp. So, I think that would be the difference. So, I'm not sure what you were using in your model for that. But for us, we made a certain estimate at the beginning of the year of what that would be, and as we implemented that plan at the end of last year, we only have 200 employees. So, we like to try to involve for a broader group of people then just 3 or 4 of us making these kind of decisions. So, we actually spend some time in round tables, and had a committee to review what was the right number there, and we came to the conclusion that especially the lower end of the comp scale that probably stock-based comp wasn't appropriate versus what we had originally thought, when we made that forecast at the beginning of last year. So, it ended up stock-based comp, as you will see in the queue, ended up maybe a little bit less than, what we had originally thought. And that means the amortization of it in '08, in '09 will also be less. We would estimate the data counted for about somewhere between $1.5 million -- say $1 million to $2 million of higher comp expansion in the fourth quarter. And I think that would also not have to be amortized going forward, but that would have been the number that was different than what we were thinking in our outlook.
Lauren Smith - KBW: Okay. And then the mix of cash versus stock on a percentage basis, I mean obviously I'm sure it varies depending upon certain threshold, but just kind of broadly speaking if you could refresh for us what's that mix effect?
Joseph Jolson: Well, it will be in the K, so you might you just wait one day so that comes out you'll see the exact numbers, but I think that there is a stock base comp metrics that we have, and so it's estimate going forward and I'd say for '08 and going forward at least for '08 somewhere between 5% and 10% in that range of total comp. Okay and that would exclude section 16, the five of us, because our stock-based comp as a percentage of comp was much higher than that. So, this just relates to the 197, other employees somewhere between 5% and 10%. It was at the lower end of that range last year.
Lauren Smith - KBW: Okay. I imagine over the next couple of years I mean that would gradually trend higher, right?
Joseph Jolson: Well, we are hopeful. I mean the thing that would drive it higher is that the people that we have are producing a lot of revenues and graduating into higher bands on that matrix.
Lauren Smith – KBW: Okay, great. And just one last question, when I look at your year-on-year growth in your commission revenues, it really stands out relative to peers, Wiesel was up about 20%, PIPE a little less than 19%, and Jefferies and Cowen were down substantially, much of that, certainly the markets and volumes were conducive over the course of the back half of the quarter. But how much would you attribute that to or maybe just give us an update on how think integration and on the institutional side and your geographic expansion there, like into Boston how those sorts of things are progressing?
Joseph Jolson: Well I'll let Mark Lehmann, who runs that business for us, answer it specifically to some of those questions. But just to be clear, our commission numbers are net of trading losses, and some of those companies you mentioned gross up their commission dollars, not all of them. So, you have to compare it on an apples-to-apples basis. And then also we haven’t expanded into foreign markets or the like this is pretty much de novo growth in the areas that we're already in, with that I'll have Mark give you some more details.
Mark Lehmann: Yeah Lauren, I think we've done a couple of things that has been received well by the buy side. I think, like you said, we've expanded further in the east coast. We've also, I think penetrated some of those accounts that we just weren’t in previous year and we've done that with a combination of increasing our productivity of our personnel, as well as just going deeper into those big buy side accounts. I think at our trading desks also we had some personnel changes that we brought out in the beginning of the calendar year '07. And it takes a few months for those to season and the really seasoned in the back half of '07, and we are seeing some of that in '08. And we are just again, as you know from this business with following it as you have, it's basic blocking and tackling and being there for your customers. And I think the capability of our trading desk, as well as the conflict free trading that we do every single day is resonating on the buy-side, where as obviously some of our competitors don't have that.
Joseph Jolson: We don't do any proprietary trading.
Mark Lehmann: We don’t' have any proprietary trading. We don't have a prop book etcetera and I think as you've read more and more and you follow this industry again for a long time. I think some of that is having a tough time for some of our sell side competitors.
Lauren Smith - KBW: Okay great. And I guess, just lastly, when you mention you are trading losses, were there any meaningful shifts or increase there in the fourth quarter?
Joseph Jolson: Yes, I think there was. And I think that we've said in the past that we have a capital profile out there. That we are hopeful that our trading losses are within the 10% to 20% of gross commissions' range. And obviously we like it at the lower end of that range and last year it was at the high end of the range. When what derives that is in us making proprietary trading bets, one way or the other; it's just the volatility of the market, so fairly we all know how volatile the market was in the fourth quarter last year.
Thomas Kilian: But also the peak of the trading losses for us was in the third quarter, the fourth quarter was much similar to the first and second.
Craig Johnson: Yeah, this is Craig Johnson. I just want to point out too, that one of the foundations of this business, picking that small cap, mid cap research arena is actually having senior analysts that the buy side wants to hear from. So, what really drives our business is a growing appreciation hopefully and need for input from our analyst who are covering stocks that are really under-covered or are not covered effectively. So I think the institutional community continues to vote for our people on a greater basis quarter-to-quarter which you know bodes well for the future for us. Again, we've got 19 senior analysts, which are really having an impact and beginning to have an impact at a broader account base.
Lauren Smith - KBW: Alright thanks very much guys and congratulations on a good year.
Joseph Jolson: Well. Thanks. I don't know if there any other questions, operator?
Operator: No. There appears to be no further questions at this time, sir.
Joseph Jolson: Well, we appreciate your interest in the company and we look forward to give you an update I guess in about 6 weeks on our first quarter results. Thank you.
Thomas Kilian: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. And you may disconnect at any time.
