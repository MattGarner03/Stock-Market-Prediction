===== 2025 Q4  (2025-04-10 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Constellation Brands Q4 Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Joseph Suarez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Joseph Suarez: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, all, and welcome to Constellation Brands Q4 and full year fiscal ‘25 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO, and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. We trust that you had the opportunity to review the news release, CEO, and CFO commentary and accompanying slides made available yesterday evening in the investors section of our company's website, www.cbrands.com. As we have received a couple questions regarding certain figures contained in our slides, please note that we expect our beer net sales growth rate for fiscal ‘26 to be between 0% to 3% and for fiscal ‘27 and ‘28 to be 2% to 4%. And our operating income growth rate for fiscal ‘26 is expected to be between 0% to 2% percent and for fiscal ‘27 to ‘28 we expect operating margins to be approximately 39% to 40%. On that note, as a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in the news release and website. And we encourage you to also refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings for risk factors that may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill and Garth, please keep in mind that, as usual, answers provided today will be referencing comparable results, unless otherwise specified, and that any references to expectations for fiscal ’26 to fiscal ’28 reflect the anticipated impact of the tariffs announced by the US government on April 2nd and the Canadian government on March 4th of this year, inclusive of the delay in the effectiveness of certain tariffs announced by the US government yesterday which will particularly impact the Wine and Spirits Business. Lastly, in line with prior quarters, I would ask that you limit yourselves to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here is Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thanks, Joe, and welcome, everyone, to our Q4 and full year fiscal ‘25 call. As usual, I will outline a few overarching highlights, but we will then move immediately to Q&A as our broader commentary was provided to you yesterday. So, let's get going. In a tough socioeconomic environment, we are taking decisive actions designed to continue to support our industry-leading Beer Business, reset our cost base, and redefine our portfolio. More specifically, first, in fiscal ‘25, despite a softer consumer demand backdrop largely driven by what we believe to be non-structural socioeconomic factors, we continue to deliver enterprise net sales growth, realize substantial comparable operating margin improvement, and achieve double-digit comparable EPS growth. Second, looking ahead, while we expect these non-structural socioeconomic factors affecting consumer demand to gradually stabilize and subside, we remain focused on driving distribution gains, on launching disciplined innovation, and on deploying incremental marketing investments to support the growth of our Beer Business, all while continuing to deliver best-in-class operating margins. Third, in addition, we expect significant improvements in the performance of our Wine and Spirits Business beyond fiscal ‘26, following the anticipated closing of the 2025 Wine Divestitures Transaction that is primarily centered around the sale of the remaining mainstream wine brands in that portfolio as well as the implementation of associated restructuring actions expected to yield over $200 million in net annualized cost savings across the enterprise by fiscal ‘28. Fourth, against that backdrop, we are targeting to deliver approximately $9 billion in operating cash flow from fiscal ‘26 to ‘28, and approximately $6 billion in free cash flow as we continue to invest primarily in the modular development of our third brewery, Veracruz, and modular additions at our existing facilities in Mexico. And fifth, in line with this strong cash flow generation and having achieved our comparable net leverage ratio target in fiscal ‘25, we remain committed to a disciplined and balanced capital deployment framework, including our 30% dividend payout ratio, and executing share repurchases against our new three-year $4 billion authorization. And with that, Garth and I will be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is now live.
Lauren Lieberman: Hi, great. Good morning and thanks a lot for the question. I wanted to know if you could comment more specifically on tariffs. Is the Beer Business currently USMCA certified so we can get some visibility on what is baked in terms of tariffs with regard to Mexico? And also, what else is baked in terms of aluminum cans and so on? So more visibility there would be really helpful. And then, I was also just curious on the longer-term forecast around beer and the notion of socioeconomic non-structural dynamics. But how are you thinking about beer industry growth over this projection timeline? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure, why don't I start with the first part of the question? We have been USMCA compliant since it was implemented several years ago and remain USMCA compliant today.
Garth Hankinson: In addition to that, Lauren, the guidance that we provided does include the impact for all tariffs announced by the U.S. government on April 2nd and by the Canadian government on March 4th. For our Beer Business, this includes the impact on our aluminum cans. And for our Wine Business, this includes the impact for our brands coming out of New Zealand and Italy into the U.S. and for our brands from the U.S. into Canada.
Bill Newlands: Relative to the longer-range perspective on beer, there's been obviously a lot of what we see as near-term headwinds, but we think that those over time, particularly as the Hispanic consumer who's been particularly challenged, gets back to more sort of normal operating procedure.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Nik Modi: Yeah, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bill, maybe if I could just kind of piggyback off Lauren's question on the long-term beer outlook. I get the fact that things are really kind of choppy right now, but the cut in the guide just kind of over the next couple of years seemed a bit extreme relative to what you guys have been doing, even with the slowing down that we've been seeing, that I think we can all agree some of it is very temporary. So when I speak to the trade, it's pretty clear nothing has really changed on an underlying basis with the brands, the momentum, kind of how retailers are looking to space your portfolio in a bigger sense, greater manner. So just wanted to kind of get your philosophy on the range of being down, this up 2% to 4%, which is versus the 7% to 9% and kind of how you're thinking about that. I mean, are you just kind of assuming things to stay the way they are? And if there's upside, great. So, any context on that would be really, really helpful.
Bill Newlands: Sure. Well, let's start with the most important thing, Nik. And today's Nik's birthday, so, happy birthday, Nik. Now getting on to the main point. Most important thing, as we look at it, relative to the medium term, is our brand health. And fortunately, all of our brand health metrics remain extremely strong. We're very focused on what we can control, and that's distribution. It's focused innovation. It's making sure that our execution is top-notch. You noted we gained over 10% in share of space in the resets that occurred last year, so that remains a positive factor. It's very difficult to know exactly how long some of these socioeconomic issues are going to continue. Certainly, we know that the Hispanic consumer is particularly concerned about a number of issues, and we would certainly expect some improvement as those consumers become more comfortable and less concerned about the many issues that follow them. We don't have an exact answer to when that is going to moderate. And I think it's important to note that the guidance that we have provided reflects the fact that there are a lot of unknowns today, including things like tariffs, but also the impact that we're seeing with the Hispanic consumer. Until we get a more definitive answer to some of those questions, it's a tough answer to give. Fortunately, that consumer, the Hispanic consumer, continues to show extraordinarily loyalty to our brands. And over the long-term, that will moderate and continue to allow us to gain share as we have for the last several years.
Garth Hankinson: And, Nik, let me just add a couple of the actual brand health stats that Bill referenced. We've actually seen some pretty significant increases in aided awareness and consideration from Modelo, Corona, and Pacifico, which is in line with what we would expect from the media investment that we put in place this last year. All brands are holding steady on measures of popularity across all adults, Hispanic and Gen Z. Pacifico is up statistically significantly in California and all our brands are holding steady on the other metrics that we track, including is this a brand I love, is it a brand everyone likes, is it a good value, is it a brand with heritage and net favorability.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a quick follow-up on -- in the context of your cut to your medium-term algo, what are you assuming for the beer category growth or I guess declines over the next few years? And then I wanted to ask about margins, beer margins. Could you maybe walk through the different puts and takes that are going to allow you to deliver your best-in-class beer margins of 39% to 40% over the next few years despite, I guess, a considerable expected slowdown in volume and some tariff risks? I mean, you mentioned some cost cutting, so could you give us some more color on that and possibly quantify? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: I think Slide 18 is going to help you on some of those broad answers, but our view is, over the course of the medium-term, the beer industry overall will likely go back to what it has done over the last several years, which is roughly flat to down 2%, somewhere in that range. And as we've said on prior calls, we've seen a significant delta between whatever the beer industry is and our performance against it, where we have gained significant share. We expect that that overall approach is going to continue and that we'll get back to a more normal, I'll call it normal trajectory into the medium-term. As I spoke on a couple of the prior questions, how quickly that comes around will largely depend on what consumer sentiment is as we move forward.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, and then, Bonnie, on margins, I apologize, this is probably a bit of a boring story, because I think we've said it a few times before, nothing's really changed. First of all, we're going to manage our footprint in the modular fashion that we've referenced previously. So we're going to limit the impact of depreciation and overhead absorption issues. In addition to that, we'll have incremental volume growth. We'll maintain our 1% to 2% pricing algorithm. And certainly, we'll continue to -- on with our cost savings initiatives. Obviously, those tailwinds will be offset on a year-to-year basis by inflation and tariffs. But net-net, when we put all that together, we think we can continue to deliver best-in-class margins at 39% to 40%.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.
Rob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. I just want to make sure I get this as crystal clear as possible. I'm wondering if you can just kind of go through again how you're thinking about free cash flow deployment and given the fact that you've shrunk the Wine and Spirits Business or repositioned it and given the fact that at least over the next couple years, you expect less growth from the beer side of the business, you're reducing CapEx. Are you today, and kind of going forward, more open to larger acquisitions? Are you spending more time on acquisitions, given the increased cash flow? So, I'd love to get your thoughts on that. I know you've re-upped the authorization on the share buyback. Tied to that, is that a strong commitment that you will buy back? I think it was $4 billion worth of stock over the next three years, just trying to get a sense of the priorities there and what is kind of guidance versus actual commitments along those lines? Thank you.
Garth Hankinson: Well, thanks for the question, Robert. And on the one hand, this will not be another boring answer because I think there’s a lot of consistency with what we've said in the past, but actually I think it's pretty exciting what we're going to be doing here. I mean, as we outlined, through FY ‘28, we're going to generate $9 billion of operating cash flow and $6 billion of free cash flow. Our capital allocation priorities don't change. We're committed to being -- we're committed to achieving three times leverage. We're there now. We're actually a little bit below there now. We're committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and we'll maintain our approximately 30% dividend payout as we go forward. And then you referenced the new authorization for $4 billion in share repurchases that we received from our board yesterday. This is actually, I think, very exciting. I mean, not only is the $4 billion share repurchase authorization reflective of our discipline around capital allocation and share of purchases more specifically, but it's also reflective of the fact that we think that we're undervalued. Our share price is undervalued, remains undervalued. And we're going to execute on that share authorization as we have this past fiscal year where we'll be disciplined on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but we will also have the ability to be opportunistic as we see dislocations in our share price. And then as we round out capital allocation, we're going to continue to invest in our Beer Business, as we outlined in the materials yesterday, $2 billion over the next few years. And M&A remains the last of our priorities, mainly around smaller plug-in opportunities.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now live.
Chris Carey: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Garth Hankinson: Hey, Chris.
Chris Carey: So, Garth, can you just talk about the main drivers and considerations for gross margins going into fiscal ‘26? I fully appreciate that you had a lot of detail in the slides, but I'm really trying to parse out the impact of tariffs on this model, whether that's just the aluminum cans relative to everything else. You also perhaps have a quite a notable currency tailwind in fiscal ‘26 that may not help you in go-forward years. And so I'm really just trying to understand the puts and takes, specifically the impact of tariffs relative to everything else on the model in fiscal ‘26 and whether there are some nuances like currency that won't repeat, so that we can have a better idea of how to layer this in going into fiscal ‘27 and fiscal ’28?
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, so look, let me do my best there, Chris. And if we need to follow up, we can follow up. But the guidance that we provided yesterday, as we said, includes the impact of tariffs for our Beer Business. That is the impact on aluminum cans. As it relates to currency, as you know, we've talked about this multiple times, that we have a multi-year layered approach to how we manage our currency. As we entered in FY ‘26, we're above 70% hedged and we've seen some actually dislocations in the U.S. peso right here. I shouldn't say some dislocations, but some weakness and we've taken opportunities to layer in some incremental hedges both for this year and future years. So as always, we look to sort of -- we look to manage that on a year-to-year basis so that the impact isn't that material from a year-to-year perspective. We try to smooth that as best we can.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Nadine Sarwat from Bernstein. Your line is now live.
Nadine Sarwat: Thank you, guys. I appreciate all the incremental color that was provided in the prepared remarks in the presentation. Two questions for me. You called out a tough socioeconomic environment in your prepared remarks. Can you explain exactly what you're assuming in terms of that socioeconomic environment for the next three years? Are you assuming the current situation remains status quo or are you making some improvement in the back of that? And then secondly, on the weak depletion numbers and especially Modelo, appreciate the commentary that you provided. Could you pull apart the factors onto what's driving that, maybe what has changed in a little more detail? I don't know if a rank order of magnitude or trying to quantify these in any way possible, and maybe you have any incremental consumer insight on consumer type, pack type, channel, any incremental color would be helpful. Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure. So, let's talk first about the Hispanic consumer because I think this is an important element. As you would expect, we do a fair amount of research around this consumer given that they represent roughly 50% of our overall Beer Business. And the fact is, a lot of consumers in the Hispanic community are concerned right now. Two-thirds of them are concerned about higher prices on things like food, gas, and other essentials. Over half are concerned relative to immigration issues and how those impact. A number of them are concerned about job losses in industries that have a high Latino employment base. And what does that do? That has tended to mean that the consumer has pulled back on spending on a number of categories. The single biggest one, interestingly, is restaurants. But a lot of other consumer goods, clothing, home choice, things to do, travel. Beer is quite a ways down the list, but it's certainly on the list because things like social gatherings, an area where the Hispanic consumer often consumes beer, are declining today as part of these overarching concerns that they have. Therefore, all of that has had impact on our business. As you know, Modelo is over 50% Hispanic in terms of its demographic base. So, this decline in efforts to go to restaurants, to have social gatherings, things that are very much beer occasions have softened in the more recent term. And it's going to be key to watch as to how that impact continues or doesn't continue as we go forward. Net-net, it's non-structural. This is not -- our brands and our brand health continues to be top-notch. We continue to focus on what we can win at, winning the shelf, winning execution, continuing to bring interesting innovation to the table that allows us to continue to outperform the overall category. But as you would expect, we're going to need and want to see some improvement in the consumer brand health before we're able to correctly project how long some of these challenges are going to last. Garth, anything you want to add?
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, just on some of the macro data points. And I'll give you sort of how we're thinking about that for the forecast period that we provided details on last night. We're not expecting any material improvement over this forecast period. Some of the macro trends that we're seeing and that we're tracking, our unemployment, and obviously unemployment, has started to stabilize across the board. But we have seen weakness in those 4,000-calorie job sectors that have a higher impact on beer consumption. Year-over-year real disposable personal income reached a two-year low in January and stayed low in February. Consumer sediment --sentiment rather, reached a 2.5 year low in March, and long-term expectations from consumers isn't expected to change anytime soon. We've seen inflation rather -- the expectations for inflation to not get as -- to not rebound quite as quickly as we had expected. And the outlook for GDP growth now is a little bit more muted than it was. So we're not expecting any big improvements in that. As we go through calendar year 2025, we may see some of that moderate a bit and into '26, so maybe some marginal improvement. But for the forecast period, we're not expecting any material improvement in the macroeconomic conditions.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Peter Grom from UBS. Your line is now live.
Peter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. So I was hoping to talk more in near term and just kind of get some perspective and just in terms of what's happening in terms of beer top line growth. Currently, obviously, a challenging exit rate and the guidance does seem to imply some improvement from that exit rate. So can you maybe just help us frame how we should be thinking about the guidance from here? Any considerations that we should consider as it relates to 1Q? And then just any thoughts in terms of what we should anticipate price versus volume? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Well, I think if you'll recall from last year, the strongest quarter that we had, and frankly, that the industry had, was our fiscal Q1. So, while we don't make any habit, as you know, of giving quarterly guidance, certainly, the biggest overlap that we have is in this very first quarter as the business started to soften for the industry as well as for us, as you progressed through the back half of last year. So, that -- when you combine that with some of the socioeconomic climate issues that I've already referred to, I think you're going to see some volatility as the year goes on. Again, the key thing for us, I know I'm repeating myself, but I think it's important to recognize, our brand health remains best-in-class. And in the longer run, that will continue to pay dividends for us as consumers get back to a normalized behavioral pattern.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Bill Kirk from ROTH MKM. Your line is now live.
Bill Kirk: Good morning. So some people, including the Teamsters and maybe one of the mega brewers, they seem to be trying to drive a wedge between American beer and imported beer. Are they having any success with that in the eyes of consumers? And how much influence do you think those type of groups have over alcohol tariff policies?
Bill Newlands: It’s interesting question, Bill. Tough to answer some of that question. What I would say is one of the things that we're proud of as a company is our 80 years as an American company. As you know, we're -- our ownership is entirely in this country, although we make most of our beer in Mexico because we have Mexican heritage brands. But we spend roughly $1 billion a year in the United States market, supporting our brands. We have many of our grains and our barleys and our corn grown in the Mountain West of the United States for inputs. I think when the overall Teamsters take a very hard look, we are very supportive of the Teamsters. I think we have brought more jobs to this marketplace than any other competitor has because of the growth of our business over time through our distributor network. So, I think as people take a real hard look at what our company is and how we have performed in the marketplace, they will recognize that we have done an exceptional job of building US jobs as we've also built our business in Mexico to support those US jobs.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Andrew Strelzik: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I appreciate all the detail on the guidance. Obviously, it's a very fluid environment. I guess when you just think through all the assumptions that you've made here over the next -- in recasting kind of the next three years, where do you think there's the biggest risks to your assumptions and the biggest -- maybe where we might look back and say, hey, that turned out to be a little bit conservative?
Bill Newlands: Yeah, I think the single biggest risk that we have is where the consumer is and how long their concerns last. If we had a crystal ball on that, it'd be a lot easier to make some projections because as the consumer feels better about things, that will help not only our business, but the overall category. Believe me, we'd like to see a healthy category. That would be to everyone in our industry's benefit. And we certainly always like to see the industry succeed as we succeed. So that's the biggest variable that I think is out there is when does the consumer come around. We're going to stay crystal-clear focus on the variables that we can control, as I've talked to earlier today. But the consumer sentiment and the consumers' desire to get back out and shop and be comfortable in the socioeconomic environment is probably the single biggest variable that’s tough to predict.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Gerald Pascarelli from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.
Gerald Pascarelli: Great. Thanks very much for the question. I just had a housekeeping item on the Wine Business. So, the $41 million impact that you called out in your commentary, can you provide some detail on when you expect that to hit the operating income? Is that going to be in the first quarter of 2026? I guess that's my first question. Just any color on the cadence? And then as we think about the cost savings, I think $100 million of the $200 million is coming out of wine. Is that going to be more pronounced benefit to the operating income booking? Like if we had to look to 2027 or 2028, is that going to be more of a benefit when we get to 2027? So, again, any color on the cadence there, I think, would be helpful. Thank you.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah. So, the $41 million that you referenced, that was called out in the prepared materials, that will kind of happen throughout the year. So, just -- it won't be any one big quarter where that hits but throughout the year. And then in terms of the cost savings, we called this out in our materials, right? So it's about $100 million in total for Wine and Spirits. We're expecting about $55 million in Q -- or in fiscal '26. So the majority of the actions that we will take to achieve that $100 million savings will occur in FY '26. It's just you won't get the full run rate of that until you move into FY '27 and then maybe a little bit into FY '28.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning. So, clearly, a pretty big revision in long-term beer sales growth from the 7% to 9% range to 2% to 4% in fiscal '27 and '28. So, can you just give us a little more detail on how much of that is just related to the external environment and more conservatism on macros? How much of it is pressure points maybe that are more durable on the beer category, health and wellness, demographics, et cetera? And then a third bucket of market share opportunity for STZ. Just give us a sense of conceptually how much of that falls into each bucket? And I realize this is like the eighth version of this question you've got on the call. But I guess the point is, we're kind of hearing from you guys, your tone is that the beer depletion slowdown, it's more driven by short-term factors. Obviously, we understand the difficult macro environment. But at the same time, you're making pretty large revisions, the beer sales growth post fiscal '26, which should be significantly macro depressed based on what we're seeing. So I'm just trying to sort of bridge those two points and how you guys think about that conceptually? If that makes sense.
Bill Newlands: Yeah. It totally does, Dara. Our points are -- we have a near-term issue as it relates to consumer sentiment. Very difficult to predict how long that will last or not. And so as we look at the fiscal year that we're in, we expect that it very well could be a significant factor throughout this fiscal year. I think the question is, when does the consumer sentiment turn around? That's the one that's very difficult to project. But again, this is where we go back to -- you have a shorter-term issue, you have a near-term issue, you don't have a brand health issue. I mean, I look at brand -- we don't always talk about on every single call, but Pacifico. Pacifico was up 16% last year. It continues to grow and get consumer demand. It's -- and I've called it in years past, an early-stage Modelo because it's shown a similar growth profile to what Modelo did sort of a decade ago. The punchline to that is we have strength within our brands. We have new innovation agenda items that will open up new consumer occasions and new consumers to our franchises, and we're going to continue to work on the controllables. It's very difficult for us to project some of the socioeconomic elements that are going to impact it. And it was our belief that it could be longer than we'd all anticipated. It's simply an area we can't answer, and that, therefore, is all reflected in the guidance we provided.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies. Your line is now live.
Kaumil Gajrawala: If I can just follow up on that, Bill. So many times we're hearing sort of non-structural, non-structural and there's a lot of macro stuff, of course. But, at the same time, the long-term algorithm has changed quite a bit. And it feels like maybe some of it is structural and that could be a law of large numbers. Is there maybe a revision in expectations for Hispanic population growth in the United States? Just, is there anything maybe bigger in there that we should be aware of as part of the calculus?
Bill Newlands: No, I don't think so. I think that when you look at lots of factors, when you look at our awareness levels versus some of the competition, when you look at our shelf positions versus some of the larger competition, we still have a lot of runway to grow. We have a lot of expansion capability of reaching -- using Modelo as an example, into the non-Hispanic community. We have only been investing against the non-Hispanic community for the last several years. We have increased our amount of marketing spend. As you know, in the back half of last year, we increased our spend even though the consumer was pulling back. And we're seeing that as providing great returns to our business. So, we believe there's still a lot of opportunity for our business going forward that most of what is going on is socioeconomic issues that we believe will moderate over time. The question is, what's that time arise? That's a bit of a difficult one to answer.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
Andrea Teixeira: Hi, good morning, everyone. So, Bill, Garth, seems like you have collected hard data to inform you on the new guidance. So I think it would be helpful if you can comment on what has happened with beer volumes in the more Hispanic ZIP codes against the general public, perhaps the later part of the fiscal Q4? And then I definitely understand the loyalty and the dermographic bonus of this cohort from covering Group Modelo when it was public exporting decades ago, and that strength, of course, kind of carry over to you as an importer. Can you also tell us like how that -- I mean, obviously, against the general public has shaped your information -- I mean, your decision to reduce long term? And also related to that, you invested close to 9% of sales into the Beer Business in terms of A&P. And obviously, you have been investing that $1 billion, as you said. So just thinking of the 8.5% that you gave as a guidance for fiscal '26, how should we be thinking given, one, you have already gained a lot of distribution. Of course, you're going to gain additional 10%. And how you are going to be, I think, shifting given that you're becoming more general public as we go, how we should be thinking about all these dynamics? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure. So, let's try to take that in some order here. Relative to Hispanic consumer behavior, one of the things we've seen both factually and anecdotally is that there has been some channel shifts in what that consumer is doing. So, historically, you saw overweighting to the stores that were largely Hispanic consumer base and C-stores. Both of those, we have seen some shifting into broader chain-based accounts that are larger accounts. And I think that reflects some of the concerns that we've talked about earlier that the Hispanic consumer is seeing across their broader life and lifestyle. Relative to the 8.5%, we continue -- keep in mind, that with the growth profile that we have every year, that continues to be an increase in the amount of spend that we have put against our business and because of the very strong cost agendas that we have, we continue to put more fuel on that fire where appropriate to continue to support our business. We are going to continue to do exactly that. Our cost agenda, as you saw, we are expecting $200 million over the next 2.5 fiscal years based on a strong cost agenda, and we believe that some of that will get reinvested against our business to help drive future success along those lines. But we test and we review our marketing approach as you would expect on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But we're quite pleased that we continue to see very strong returns for the spend that we put against our Beer Business.
Garth Hankinson: Bill, if you don't mind, I’ll just explain a couple more just on the marketing spend, right? I mean -- as Bill just noted, we don't compromise on our marketing spend. It's a very disciplined approach. You've heard us say this before, we've gotten a lot of efficiencies with our media agencies in terms of the effectiveness and spend. And we will continue to target being the number one and number two share of voice with Modelo and Corona. And we've increased our sponsorship or our spend in -- with March Madness, with Soccer, with Major League Baseball, and with college football. So we're not shortchanging by any means the marketing investment behind our beer brands.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. Your line is now live.
Carlos Laboy: Yes. Hello. One interpretation of your three-year guidance and its long-term implication is that Corona Extra is the Bud Light of 2008. Just a declining aging brand with volume declines that the rest of the portfolio might not be able to offset. Can you make the case for Corona Extra as you see it evolving? And I remember that in 2008, you were able to restabilize Corona actually where Bud Light couldn't. How are you planning to stabilize it now and return that to growth? And might that be one of the structural kind of hurdles that you need to clear here that Kaumil was maybe alluding to in an earlier question?
Bill Newlands: So, a couple of things as it relates to Corona. First of all, I think it's important to think about Corona about the brand family. Corona Familiar is one of our strong growth players in today's market. We have introduced Corona Sunbrew this year, which we're very encouraged about in its early days. We feel that's going to reach a different consumer and provide the opportunity for improvement in that particular piece. Remember, it's got strong brand equity and awareness. It's the number one brand in the mind of consumers -- the most loved brand in the mind of consumers in the United States. So, Corona still has a very strong consumer base and consumer franchise. Interestingly enough, it is one of our best returns against our advertising approach, very, very strong. And we're increasing that spend in this fiscal year versus what we have done in the past. So, we remain optimistic about Corona. And we expect that that's going to continue to be an important part of our brand flow going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Your line is now live.
Filippo Falorni: Hi, good morning, everyone. I wanted to go back to the beer margin question that were asked before. Just a clarification. So on Slide 14, you guys show that you're expecting COGS inflation of low to mid-single-digit through fiscal '28 including net of cost savings. So, on a net basis, you still have cost inflation. Depreciation, even though you're mitigating some of the incremental addition -- capacity addition is still going up. And the volume environment is also softer. So, I assume there's a little bit less fixed cost leverage, although still positive. So can you help me understand what are the offset to all these headwinds on beer margins that allow you to maintain the beer margin unchanged? Thank you.
Garth Hankinson: No. I mean, look, as we said earlier, right, there will be volume increases, which will help. There will be pricing in that 1% to 2%, which will help. Those cost initiatives will keep our inflation or will help mitigate that cost inflation and we'll manage depreciation. So that's where we feel comfortable, say, we'll be in 39% to 40% operating margins. It's all of that put together.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Bryan Spillane: Hey. Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. First, Bill, Garth, thank you for putting a stake in the ground. This is not an easy environment to try to forget about forecasting next month, let alone the next few years. And so whether it's accurate or not, it's just that you put a stake in the ground, you gave us some detail, it's really helpful. So, thank you. My question is more around, as we're thinking about margins in beer and for the whole enterprise actually, just structurally, is the $200 million in savings that we talked about yesterday, is most of that just a -- is most of that related to the divestiture of the parts of the Wine Business and kind of reducing some of the stranded overhead? And I guess what's really underneath my question is, as things evolve, should we expect there could be some opportunities to drive more efficiency and especially as hopefully, the landscape sort of becomes more clear?
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, Bryan, thanks for the question. And I think I understood it. So let me try to answer it. As we said that the -- over $200 million of annualized savings, of that, about $100 million of that is associated with the wine business. And that comes out after the divestiture. The remainder of that really is across our corporate functions as well as some in beer. So it is a reset as we try to make sure that we've got the most capable organization with the best skills and resources and investments behind it to deliver on our strategic priorities going forward. I think we've got a pretty good history around discipline of cost management. And so to the extent we identify areas over and above what we shared yesterday, we absolutely would execute on those. But it's a pretty -- the amount of cost we're taking out is, I think it's a pretty aggressive yet very achievable amount and most of which we execute on this year.
Bill Newlands: So let me pile on you for once. Bryan, I think one of the things that Garth was just touching on is important. We have -- first of all, we have a superb supply chain capability within our business, and we have already shown our colors around that. As we create more efficiencies over time, we invest that money behind our business to help grow the future. That's an approach we have taken for many, many years now, and it's one that we're going to continue to take. So as our ability to improve the efficiencies in our business continues to grow, we will continue to invest that money on the future of our business.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.
Steve Powers: Good morning. Bill, Garth, thanks for the question. Maybe a quick one for each of you actually. Bill, similar to how you've discussed a couple of times the factors influencing demand on beer, I'd love any analogous comments you might have on the Wine and Spirits side and just how you see the various factors stacking up to inform the flat to 3% outlook that you have on the portfolio you are planning to retain. And then, Garth, maybe you could expand a little bit more detail, if possible, on just how recent results and the revised outlook on beer is influencing how you're approaching the build-out in Veracruz or any of the modular additions at the existing, the other facilities? Just any changes that are maybe worth highlighting? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure. Starting with wine, I'll let Garth answer the second half of the question. Our thinking around the Wine Business relates very similar to what we've done in beer, which is this creates a Wine and Spirits Business going forward that plays at the higher end of the business. And that ties in with the long-term premiumization trend that you see across all alcohol beverage. So we've finally gotten our portfolio sort of where we want it so that it reflects that we're playing against that premium and up-sector across both segments of our business. To give you a perspective, in the fourth quarter of last year, the retained business in Wine and Spirits grew 4% in depletions, which I think gives us some confidence and some excitement about what the future can look like for a much narrower but a much more focused higher-end portfolio for our Wine Business. That business has continued to be much stronger than what we've seen in other sectors of the Wine Business, which is why we're going to spend our time and energy on that subsegment of the overall wine category. Garth?
Garth Hankinson: Yeah. And then just in terms of the modular approach and changes in how we're thinking about capacity, I mean, there's really nothing more to share than what was in the materials we had earlier today or last night, I should say. We're going to continue to manage our footprint responsibly and in line with what our volume expectations are. As you've seen, we've reduced our expectations for capacity through FY '28 in the materials we shared last night. We're on pace -- specifically to Veracruz, we're on pace to open that. That will be an important brewery for us as we think about the contribution that it has to the overall portfolio. But we'll be really mindful and bring on capacity when it's needed.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Kevin Grundy from BNP Paribas. Your line is now live.
Kevin Grundy: Great. Thank you. Good morning, guys. I wanted to come back to the investment levels in the Beer Business. I want to ask it from a little bit of a different angle. Garth, I think you mentioned satisfactory levels. I think looking back, the 8.5% is below the 10% levels where the company was in fiscal '20 and 2021, and you typically are in this 9% to 10% sort of range. So I wanted to ask, everyone on the call is sympathetic to the volatility in the environment. Number one, was there any thought to kind of leaning in here, albeit weighing on margins a bit to try to accelerate top line growth, not an uncommon tact, as you guys are well aware, in CPG you do see companies do that when the top line is waning as it clearly is. And then two, for both of you, should investors perceive this as kind of a philosophical reorientation, if you will, at Constellation, where there's kind of less of a bias towards top line growth and more of a bias towards margin preservation and cash flow, just kind of given what you're experiencing in the business, which would also not be uncommon either. And you might push and say it's not an either/or that's kind of a false choice, but I’m just -- would like to hear more about how you're thinking about that balance. Thank you both.
Garth Hankinson: So just on the marketing investment. So, we feel, as I said earlier, and as Bill said as well, we feel really comfortable around our marketing investment. As we laid out at our Investor Day, our target was to be about 9%. And that's where we were in FY '25. We're going to be a little bit below that in FY '26 in terms of the forecast. But we don't limit that, right? When we talk to our marketing teams, we ask them what they need and they tell us what they need, right? And so this is reflective of what our team thinks it needs to drive the type of performance that's included in our outlook. That being said, and Bill referenced this earlier around our cost savings agenda and how we take savings from our cost savings agenda and reinvest that in high-return opportunities within the business. We did that last year, where in Q3 and Q4, we invested significantly more money in marketing to drive and to support our brands. So that's the discipline that we have on a year-to-year basis or a quarter-to-quarter basis. That won't change. And the last piece I'll just say on that before I turn it over to Bill as well is, again, while the percentage is coming down, we've gotten significantly more efficient in the way that we buy media and the way that we manage our marketing spend.
Bill Newlands: And relative to your comment about, has our approach to things changed? The answer is no. Look, six out of the last eight years, we have been the number one Circana large company CPG company in terms of growth. It included last calendar year despite the challenges that we saw both within our industry and to some degree, within our brands as part of that industry. But it didn't change the fact that we were the number one large company -- Circana growth company last year. We expect to continue to see both top line growth and maintaining a strong margin structure of 39% to 40%, as Garth outlined. Our expectation around that hasn't changed. We think both are important, and we're going to do our damndest to do both of those.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.
Robert Moskow: Hey, thanks. We're all kind of trying to fish around to figure out what the exact tariff impact is on your can costs. And it sounds like it's pretty sensitive information, so I understand. But I'm just trying to figure out if I have the building blocks right. If you spend like $900 million a year on aluminum cans and it's a 25% tariff, do I just put those two numbers together? Or am I just way too high on that number?
Garth Hankinson: I would say take a look at the information that we provided in the guidance that we issued last night. And I think that if you look at the top and bottom-line growth rates, you can figure out what the impact is.
Robert Moskow: Well, there's a lot of other assumptions in those impacts. So, what are the other assumptions? Would it be productivity?
Garth Hankinson: Robert, yeah, on an absolute basis, as we disclosed in all the materials, it includes productivity, it includes cost savings. It includes inflationary pressures and so forth. But again, that is all baked into the margin assumption. Tariffs are as well. So all disclosures have been made available as made available.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live.
Michael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to come back to just the capacity approach, and I recognize you've tried to adjust to match what you expect to need. But maybe help us understand the mix a little bit. It sounds like you're still adding modules besides Veracruz. I guess maybe first, are we right to assume that the flexibility you have to ship by sea from Veracruz should at least allow for some potential savings? And if so, what's the thinking to add at all your locations as opposed to just push there? Maybe just would love to understand that a little bit better.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah. I mean when we look at our brewery footprint, there's a number of things that we take into consideration. One is the size and scale of the brewery. Another is, what are the capabilities of that brewery in terms of the brewery capable of producing the entirety of the portfolio and have the complexity to service the entire portfolio, or is it a brewery that's going to be a bit more specialized and run large packaging lines. And then to your point, we also look at how do we optimize logistics costs in terms of getting product into the market most cost efficiently. So those are the things that kind of go into it. Specifically to Veracruz, while that is further south, and I know that there's been questions around what the impact that will have on logistics going forward, keep in mind that in the overall footprint, that will be about 3 million hectoliters of the overall 55 million hectoliters. So, it's a relatively small piece of the total footprint. We're still reviewing what we -- what options we have from a logistics standpoint to make that as cost effective as possible. But we're also, from a capability standpoint, treating Veracruz as a brewery that will run along production lines of high-volume SKUs and therefore, minimize the cost there and try to offset any incremental logistics costs.
Operator: Thank you. We’ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2025 Q3  (2025-01-10 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to the Constellation Brands Q3 Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Joe Suarez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Joe.
Joseph Suarez: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, all. Happy New Year and welcome to Constellation Brands Q3 Fiscal '25 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Following the call, we'll also be making available in the Investors section of our company's website a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters and as Kevin just noted, I'd like to ask that we limit everyone to 1 question per person, which will help us end our call on time. Thanks in advance and now here is Bill.
William Newlands: Thanks, Joe and welcome all to our Q3 fiscal '25 earnings call. As usual, I will start with a few key points regarding the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. First, growth in consumer demand for our beer portfolio sequentially expanded in the third quarter and this in turn drove a marginal uplift in depletions growth relative to Q2. This acceleration was supported by the incremental marketing investments we deployed across our core brands in Q3 as we responded to the softer macroeconomic backdrop that began affecting consumer spending during the summer. As a reminder, subdued overall spend and prolonged value-seeking behavior among consumers, have been key near-term limiting factors on demand growth, not only for our portfolio but also for the dollar sales growth rate of total beverage alcohol. That said, beverage alcohol remains relatively unchanged in its share of total consumer expenditures. So we believe its slower rate of growth also reflects the adoption of broader value-seeking behavior across consumer goods. Against that backdrop and given the near-term uncertainty on whether consumers will revert to more normalized spending behaviors in Q4, we have made the decision to adjust the outlook for our fiscal '25 beer business net sales growth to be 4% to 7% and operating income growth to be 9% to 12%, still yielding an operating margin of approximately 39%. Notwithstanding this prudent adjustment to our beer business guidance, our revised fiscal '25 comparable EPS range still yields double-digit growth from the midpoint to the high end, which includes other adjustments to our outlook that Garth will cover in more detail shortly.  Second,  despite softer consumer demand due to macroeconomic headwinds, our beer business continued to outperform the total beverage industry in dollar sales growth in Circana tracked channels over the 12 weeks ended December 1. And at a total company level, we once again achieved dollar sales growth outpacing the total CPG sector, as we approach nearly 12 years as a CPG growth leader. Third, we continue to effectively execute against our key initiatives in our beer business. From a distribution perspective, we have now secured more than half of the incremental 500,000 points of distribution that we identified as the fiscal '24 to fiscal '28 target for our core brands during our Investor Day with a significant portion of those gains achieved in the current fiscal year. On the innovation side, the depletion growth contribution of our new liquids and pack formats released over the last couple of years is within the 20% to 40% range provided in Investor Day. That said, across our high-end light beer offerings, which include Modelo Oro from an innovation perspective and our more tenured Corona Light and Premier brands, we are facing headwinds from competitive pricing, particularly in large pack formats. And across our Chelada brands, we are facing consumer demand growth rate headwinds from the convenience channel, where our Cheladas have outsized representation given the channel's core consumer base and the predominantly 24-ounce can format that skews more towards C-store retailers. To that end, we are actively working on levers to address the competitive dynamics in the high-end light beer segment and continue to pursue distribution opportunities for Cheladas given our ongoing investments in broader marketing for the brands, including English language linear TV advertising for the first time and recent extensions into the 12-ounce can 12-pack formats. We also continued to drive significant demand in our portfolio from new legal drinking age consumers and are pleased to have had a higher proportion of our dollar sales this year coming from 21 to 24 year olds as they have made more trips to the store and spend more on each trip across our brands. In fact, the share of spend for this demographic within our dollar sales is nearly twice that of the beer category and that share has grown at more than twice the rate of the category and the high-end segment relative to last year. Last but not least, we also continued to consistently deliver against our capital allocation priorities. We maintained a 2.9x net leverage ratio on a comparable basis in the third quarter, still slightly below our 3x target. We further advanced our brewery capacity investments and returned nearly $220 million to shareholders through share repurchases and over $180 million in dividends in Q3. This brings our total year-to-date cash returns through share repurchases to approximately $670 million or to more than $1.2 billion, including both repurchases and dividends. With that, let's turn more fully to our beer business' performance. During the third quarter of fiscal '25, our beer business grew depletions by 3.2%, which again was an acceleration from last quarter despite continued consumer economic weakness. Shipments were up 1.6%, which as noted in our prior earnings call, trailed depletion growth due to the impact of planned maintenance activities at our breweries during the quarter. From a financial perspective, the business delivered net sales and operating income growth of approximately 3% and 2%, respectively, which included disciplined incremental pricing taking in the fall, which is in line with the 1% to 2% pricing expectations we provided for fiscal '25, another $40 million in cost savings achieved in Q3 as the persistent focus on driving savings and efficiency from our end-to-end supply chain team continues to deliver significant benefits to the business and incremental marketing spend for the third quarter that we announced in early September. Now moving on to the performance of our largest brands. Modelo Especial grew depletions by over 3% and upheld its position as the top share gainer in U.S. tracked channels. We continue to see a long growth runway ahead for Modelo Especial, as significant opportunity remains across key metrics like awareness, distribution and household penetration relative to competitive brands. While Corona Extra depletions declined approximately 1%, it continued to increase its dollar share as a top 10 gainer in the category. We remain positive about the outlook for Corona Extra's growth as it continues to be the most beloved beer brand in the U.S. and has responded well to the incremental marketing spend deployed in Q3, particularly around the World Series. Pacifico delivered another quarter of very strong depletion growth of nearly 20% and remained the #4 dollar share gainer across the total beer category. We continue to build on the momentum of this brand in its core Southern California market, where it is already the #3 beer brand but still growing double digits. At the same time, we are strategically expanding Pacifico into key metro markets across the country using the same thoughtful approach we applied to Modelo Especial, seeking to balance rising awareness and demand with the appropriate increases in distribution to support sustainable long-term growth. Our Modelo Chelada brands delivered an increase of approximately 4% in depletions and LimÃ³n y Sal remained a top 15 share gainer in the category. As noted earlier, our Chelada brands are facing a challenging consumer backdrop in the convenience channel but we expect this to only be a near-term headwind and for the brands to return to the growth profile more in line with expectations provided at Investor Day. All in, looking ahead, we aim to build on the sequential acceleration we have seen in volume growth across our core brands by continuing to make progress across the key volume growth drivers for the business, increased distribution, consumer-led innovation and attracting new legal drinking age consumers across our brands, as well as by deploying continued incremental marketing investments in Q4. Moving on to wine and spirits. As announced last month, our decision to divest SVEDKA builds on the actions we have taken over the past several years to align our wine and spirits portfolio with evolving consumer preferences and growing market sectors, focusing on higher-end brands. To that end, we are pleased to announce this morning the closing of that transaction. And we look forward to continuing to drive the growth of our higher-end craft spirits portfolio, which in the third quarter delivered depletion increase of approximately 9%. Conversely, the impact of ongoing consumer demand headwinds in the wine category, particularly in the lower-priced segments and of retailer inventory destocking remain the main drivers of a decline in wine and spirits shipments of 16% year-over-year, which in turn was the primary driver of the respective 14% and 25% declines in net sales and operating income for that business. Our fine wine portfolio, however, achieved depletion growth of 6%. And our largest premium wine brands, Meiomi and Kim Crawford, delivered depletion increases of over 7%. This is aligned with our focus on delivering growth and improving margins by driving our higher-end brands and operating efficiencies while also seeking to deliver value from our mainstream brands. Against that backdrop, the business remains focused on continuing to advance in several areas. First, the tactical pricing and marketing support actions we are taking in selected markets to accelerate our top 10 largest brands; second, with better alignment with our distributor partners to help improve performance in our largest markets and channels; and third, cost savings and operational efficiency initiatives to drive leverage to the bottom line.  In light of continued consumer demand headwinds previously noted, we have updated our fiscal '25 outlook for wine and spirits business to net sales and operating income declines of 5% to 8% and 17% to 19%, respectively. In closing, we continued to manage a softer consumer backdrop due to macroeconomic headwinds and expect to deliver a very solid fiscal year underpinned by our continued progress against the key growth drivers of our beer business and our proactive actions to improve the performance of our wine and spirits business.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Garth, who will give you more details on our financial results and outlook. Garth?
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill and good morning, everyone. As usual, my discussion will focus primarily on comparable enterprise results accompanied by business segment details. Let's get started with our enterprise results. For the third quarter of fiscal '25, enterprise net sales were relatively unchanged year-over-year as moderated growth from our beer business was offset by the decline in our wine and spirits business. Enterprise operating income on a reported basis was in line with the prior year and on a comparable basis, declined by 2%, reflecting growth from our beer business and favorability in corporate expense being more than offset by the decline in our wine and spirits business. Comparable EPS was $3.25 for the quarter and was relatively flat year-over-year as the decline in comparable operating income was offset by favorability in unconsolidated investments from the transition in our Canopy ownership to exchangeable shares and the impact of a more favorable comparable effective tax rate. Before I get into the segment details, I would like to provide an update on our enterprise guidance for fiscal '25. We now expect enterprise net sales growth of 2% to 5%, comparable operating income growth of 6% to 9% and comparable EPS to be between $13.40 and $13.80. These new enterprise guidance targets reflect changes to the net sales and operating income growth targets for both business segments that Bill referenced earlier as well as a few additional updates that I will cover in more detail shortly. Now diving into the business segment details for the quarter. Starting with our beer business. Net sales grew by 3%, a $64 million increase, driven by beer shipment volume growth of 1.6%, a price uplift of 2% or $39 million from targeted actions taken during the fall and a 30 basis point headwind from unfavorable mix as consumers continued to shift to value-oriented larger pack size, particularly in cans. Beer depletions grew 3.2%, an acceleration from Q2 but reflected the ongoing consumer dynamics that Bill discussed. Regarding selling days, they were flat in the third quarter. And as a reminder, for the full year, there will be 1 less selling day, which already transpired in Q2. Our on-premise depletions grew nearly 5% and accounted for over 11% of our total volumes, supported by Modelo Especial and Pacifico as the top 2 dollar share gainers in draft and Corona Extra maintaining its top spot in packaged on-premise. Off-premise depletions grew nearly 3% and accounted for approximately 89% of our total volumes. Within the off-premise channels, independent retailers not captured in Circana data achieved a lower growth rate, mainly driven by convenience and liquor store channels in most of our top 10 markets as well as independent grocers in our top state of California. Across these key states, unemployment rates for both total and Hispanic consumers remained elevated relative to the national average, which we continue to believe is a fundamental near-term driver for the relatively lower depletion growth rates we have seen in these markets over our last couple of fiscal quarters. However, as Bill noted,  while it is uncertain whether consumers in these states and channels will revert to more normalized purchase behaviors in the near term, we do not anticipate these trends to be a structural headwind over the longer term. On that note, shifting to our full year expectations for top line drivers. While the third quarter beer shipments were outpaced by depletions due to normal seasonality and planned maintenance at our breweries, we continue to expect full year absolute shipment and depletion volumes to be closely aligned. And also from a full year perspective, as Bill noted, we now expect net sales for our beer business to be 4% to 7%, inclusive of 1% to 2% pricing. Moving to beer operating income and margins. Operating income grew by 2%, and we had a 60 basis point per year -- per year-over-year decline in operating margin to 37.9%. The increase in operating income was driven by higher gross profit, partially offset by increased marketing investments. Improvement in gross profit was largely a result of the previously mentioned net sales drivers and a $40 million benefit from ongoing cost savings and efficiency initiatives, partially offset by an absolute COGS increase of nearly 1%, excluding these savings. Marketing expense as a percent of net sales was just over 10% for the quarter, driven by the incremental marketing actions that Bill discussed. Our full year expectation for marketing expense as a percent of net sales remains approximately 8.5%. Other SG&A expense was 5% as a percentage of net sales in line with our unchanged full year expectation. From a fiscal '25 full year perspective, in terms of operating income, we now expect our beer business to grow between 9% to 12%, while our operating margin expectation remains unchanged at approximately 39%. Shifting to our wine and spirits business. Net sales declined just over 14% in the third quarter, largely driven by shipment volume decline of over 16%. The volume decline was largely a result of the ongoing category headwinds in the wine category, particularly in the U.S. wholesale market from weaker consumer demand, as well as continued inventory destocking by retailers. Despite these persistent challenges, we continue to expect improved organic shipment volume growth performance in our wine and spirits business in the fourth quarter as we anticipate more fully realizing the benefits of the pricing, marketing and distributor initiatives we launched at the beginning of this fiscal year, while also benefiting from the historical seasonal trends of the business. Additionally, retailer inventory destocking has broadly started to stabilize, which we expect will result in additional tailwinds to support demand growth moving forward. As Bill noted, for fiscal '25, we now expect wine and shipments organic net sales to decline 5% to 8%, reflecting persistent volume headwinds in the wine category and excluding $23 million of net sales following the recently closed divestiture of SVEDKA. Operating income for the wine and spirits business declined by $32 million, resulting in an operating margin of 22.1%. This decline was primarily driven by a decline in overall shipment volumes. Marketing expense for the wine and spirits segment as a percentage of net sales was just over 11% and remained elevated above our medium-term target as increased investments in our largest brands continue, the vast majority of which are for our higher-end brands. Other SG&A as a percentage of net sales was over 14%, consistent with our medium-term targets. In line with the adjustments to our net sales expectations, we are now expecting fiscal '25 operating income for our wine and spirits business to decline 17% to 19%, excluding $10 million of gross profit less marketing of the SVEDKA brands that are no longer part of the business following their divestiture. Shifting to the balance of the P&L. Corporate expense for the third quarter was $63 million, a 3% decrease driven by lower compensation and benefits, partially offset by higher consulting services and increased depreciation expense as a result of our corporate headquarters relocation. Following this decrease, we have updated our fiscal '25 corporate expense outlook to be $250 million. Interest expense remained flat year-over-year and for the quarter was $104 million. For the full year, given continued favorability from lower average borrowings and adjustments related to capitalized interest, we now expect our fiscal '25 interest expense to be $410 million. Comparable effective tax rate was 16.3% compared to 18% for the corresponding quarter last year and we continue to expect our full year comparable tax rate to be approximately 18.5%. Wrapping up with free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We generated year-to-date free cash flow of $1.6 billion for fiscal '25, a 13% year-over-year increase. This strong cash flow generation has enabled us to reach and maintain a net leverage ratio below our stated target, return over $1.2 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases through November of 2024 and continue to advance our brewery investments in a disciplined and agile manner. As we look to the remainder of fiscal '25, we now expect to deliver annual operating cash flow of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, both above our initial targets and to continue to deploy that cash with a balanced and thoughtful approach to capital allocation. With regards to our brewery expansions and given our agile modular approach to these projects, we have shifted the completion and planned start-up of our latest addition at our existing breweries in Mexico from the end of fiscal '25 to fiscal '26. The timing of our new brewery in Veracruz remains on track with the completion of the initial phase of that facility anticipated by late fiscal '26 or early fiscal '27. While the timing adjustment of the existing breweries expansion has shifted some of our beer CapEx, we previously anticipated for fiscal '25 into fiscal '26, we continue to expect to deploy approximately $3 billion in CapEx between fiscal '25 and fiscal '28. In closing, we made strong progress against our strategic initiatives this quarter and maintain a solid growth trajectory for the enterprise. We continue to invest behind the momentum of our brands, drive operational efficiencies and maintain cost discipline and provide strong cash generation while still executing against our capital allocation priorities as we have done for the last several years. We will continue to closely monitor the subdued spend and value-seeking trends we have seen develop across our consumer base and the economic drivers influencing that behavior as well as other possible macro shifts, particularly any changes arising from potential tariff policies. As always, we will seek to balance our consumer obsession and our value creation commitment to our stakeholders as we focus on executing against our strategy and stated priorities. Thank you all for your continued support as we approach the close of fiscal '25. With that, Bill and I will now be happy to take your questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: Bill, just wanted to take a bit of a step back on the drivers behind the softness you're seeing on the beer depletion front. If you had to separate that out between the short-term consumer weakness you focused on with the subdued spend and the value-seeking behavior that you mentioned on the call versus some of the longer-term concerns in terms of health and wellness, whether GLP or demographics, maturation of the beer brands in your portfolio, cannabis, et cetera, what are your sort of thoughts on if you're seeing any pressure from some of those more enduring longer-term points versus the short-term dynamics that you mentioned? And just putting it all together, how might that impact the way you think about long-term beer revenue growth guidance?
William Newlands: Sure. Our view of this is that the length of the near-term moves has been a little longer than what we had anticipated but we still don't see it as anything structural. We don't see it as long-term issues attached to this business. We've seen higher uptick in unemployment, 31 -- even though the overall unemployment rate was pretty consistent, 31 states were actually saw an increase in unemployment and that always effects. You may have also seen, there was an interesting Wall Street Journal article 1 week or so ago that showed the breakout of consumers' spending for those making $50,000 a year and less and that's a portion of our business. The key thing that I think is important as you look at this, is one of the things I noted in my remarks, which is that alcohols percent of the consumer basket remains consistent. The overall basket is down but our percentage of that basket remains the same. And I think that's an important thing. We would expect to come out of this trough and we certainly hope that that's going to happen in the nearer term.
Operator: Next question is coming Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies.
Kaumil Gajrawala: I think maybe just to talk a bit on capital allocation. How do you maybe think about the right amount of CapEx that you're deploying into new capacity given that we've got this slowdown. And if it's macro, we don't really know how long it will be, maybe delaying Veracruz or pushing out some of this CapEx. And then also, when you think about the returns on those investments and maybe the risk to the returns on those investments, how do you think about that capital deployment versus just buying back a much larger amount of shares?
William Newlands: Yes. I think a couple of things. I'll start and see if Garth wants to add anything into that. One of the things we've said consistently is that all of our expansions at this point are modular, which gives us the opportunity to advance them or delay them depending on any particular effects that we see in the marketplace. I think Garth has been really clear that our capital allocation priorities have been very consistently driven over the last several years. You've noted that we continue to buy a significant amount of shares in this quarter, $220 million. We still have $1.9 billion in authorization to buy back shares from our Board of Directors. So I think it's pretty clear what our focus of attention is and you would expect that, that's going to continue. Garth, anything you want to add to that?
Garth Hankinson: No. I mean, just a couple of minor things, I guess, Kaumil. I mean and then as Bill stated, our approach has been and continues to be very agile, very modular. I mean, in my remarks, we outlined the fact that we're pushing off some of the -- bringing online some capacity from this year into next year. So again, that's just an example of the things that we have done and we will continue to do. As Bill noted, we still have the $1.9 billion worth of authorization under our existing share repurchase program. And one of the things we've talked about in the past is this cash flow inflection that we have here over the next couple of years and we're excited to what that means. And we will use a very disciplined approach as we think about deploying that next dollar and where that goes. I think one of the things that's worth pointing out, as Bill stated, we've been committed to our capital allocation priorities. We're nearing the end of our large commitments as it relates to brewery expansion in Mexico. As we stated in our prepared remarks, we've now been 2 quarters at or below our targeted leverage ratio and we've deemphasized M&A. And so as we look forward, I would say that the approach to capital deployment and with a bias towards returning capital to shareholders is likely going to continue.
Operator: Next question today is coming from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. I actually had, I guess, a couple of questions on your updated guidance. First, while you lowered your full year beer net sales growth guidance, which makes sense, you actually widened the range and there are only 2 months left in the year. And I certainly understand there's a lot of uncertainty but just curious why you might not have better visibility on your shipments, especially thinking about the upcoming spring reset. Then second, what will be the key drivers that will put you at the bottom end of this range maybe versus the top end? I guess, Bill, based on all your comments, I assume if unemployment for your core demographic weakens, this will certainly put you at the bottom end. But have you factored in the impact from the awful California fires?
William Newlands: Sure. What -- as you would expect, when we decided on this particular range, this range reflects risks that we see that could potentially occur that would include things like unemployment, potential tariffs, things of that nature. And the opportunity is just the opposite of that. The upper end reflects if things improve and we start to see some of these macroeconomic headwinds go the other direction, then you could see improvement in a wider range. It's -- I think the best way to think about it is, there's been a lot of volatility. It's been very volatile compared to historical trends. And we thought it was prudent given everything that we can see at this point in time to broaden the range a bit. Relative to the fires, it would be very fair to say that our thoughts are with everyone affected by these fires in Los Angeles. Our focus remains on ensuring the safety of our people. And beyond that, we're in the process of making donations to support both the victims and the efforts of those on the ground. Certainly, the end of that is not clear at this point. But certainly, that had already begun. And I think our -- you should view that our guidance reflects that particular unfortunate situation as well.
Operator: Next question is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.
Lauren Lieberman: So just shifting to wine and spirits. I mean, I think it's fair to say we're kind of in negative -- this ongoing negative revision cycle for that business. So I just -- you called out some of the positives. Maybe you could share a little bit more on like what hasn't gone according to plan? What in the turnaround plan might need tweaks because the hole kind of keeps getting deeper and it doesn't seem like there's many signs, at least from the external standpoint of stabilization.
William Newlands: Sure. Well, as we said at the beginning of the year, it was going to take us 9 to 12 months and that's about what we're heading into at this point. I think you saw some firm shoots in Q3. Meiomi and Kim Crawford were up 7%. Our craft and depletions, our craft spirits portfolio was up 9%. We continue to be hit very hard at the lower end of the business. The lower end of the business is not healthy. But I think the move that we made relative to SVEDKA is an important example of where we continue to be focusing our business toward the higher end, where we believe there's better growth potential and better margin and profit potential than the lower end of the business. That process is continuing. And we remain optimistic that we're going to continue to see some of these critical brands, those top 10 brands that we're focusing our attention on, continue to see improvement, as you saw with Meiomi and Kim Crawford as an example.
Operator: Next question today is coming from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane: I guess my question is more about just the beer category in general and if I'm looking at the numbers right, we're going to ship in calendar '24 close to what we shipped in 1990, right? Like the category is definitely sick. So I guess 2 questions related to that, or 3. One, do you agree with that? Two, why -- what will turn it? Seltzers seem to give it a little bit of a pop and that's faded. Just so what do you think from a category perspective is needed to turn that? And then the third is just -- can you remind us what level of volume growth in the U.S. beer category in total underpins your medium-term sales targets?
William Newlands: Sure. So obviously, the beer category hasn't been particularly healthy, as you point out. I think the differentiating points that need to be reflected relative to our business, is that we have consistently outperformed that category. Modelo, we continue to believe has a lot of runway for growth. It's awareness, household penetration and so on remain tremendous opportunities. And as you saw from the distribution perspective, we're already halfway plus to the distribution growth that we had presented at Investor Day. So I think all that's positive. You then add on the growth potential that you see on brands like Pacifico and Victoria, frankly, they both have seen strong double-digit growth profiles for those businesses. The demographic profile of those business is slightly different. So those present some good opportunities. And then you look at things like Corona Sunbrew or Corona Non-Alcoholic, which again, put us into slightly different opportunities and situations than what we have been in before. Keeping in mind, when you sum all that up, Bryan, we continue to grow ahead of CPG and have for over 1 decade. so certainly, while there have been some challenges in the overall category, we have consistently outperformed not only the category but the CPG sector for literally over 1 decade and we continue to expect to be able to do so going forward.
Operator: Next question is coming from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore.
Robert Ottenstein: Great. Just 2 short follow-ups. One, can you just give us a sense of what -- and this is both on the beer side, what your internal inventories are for beer and your distributors maybe benchmarking versus kind of normal levels of this time of year? And then the second, what are your expectations in calendar 2025 for shelf space gains for the year compared to prior years? And any kind of percentage would be great.
William Newlands: Sure. Inventories are fairly consistent with what we've had historically. We -- just in case there are any order disruptions, as you would expect, we have a bit more on this side of the border than we have had historically and we'll probably continue to do so until we understand exactly how that all lands but that's just good business. Really, it has no impact on the ongoing inventory levels. We would expect, given the outsized double-digit gains that we had in shelf positions this past calendar year, that this year would -- coming would probably refer to a more normal year, where we have consistently outperformed and gained shelf presence, primarily because we've outperformed the category, both at the high end and in the overall beer category collectively. So while we haven't put an exact percentage on that at this point, Robert, we would expect to continue to gain shelf because, frankly, we've earned it.
Operator: Next question is coming from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: I have a follow-up question on the volume. And also the real question is more how to think about the tariff risk? I understand, obviously, you're lobbying with some of the raw materials that you buy from the farmers in the U.S. But based on your long-term algorithm, if a tariff were to be implemented, would you prioritize volumes? In other words, take less pricing given the elasticity? Or would you say that 39% to 40% is our operating margin goal and that's going to be a hit for the beginning but you want to stand behind it. And then from a follow-up perspective, I was just like, the range for volumes, I know Bonnie tried to ask that question, the range for volumes were very wide, given that you only have about 45 days left, it was like between minus 5% and plus 9%, if my math is correct. So I understand the puts and takes and the lack of visibility. But really, what would take you to the minus 5% given that you're still seeing volume growth from our understanding in the track channel.
William Newlands: Sure. Well, let's start with a minor correction on the last point, which is beer volume growth projection was 4% to 7%. It was not negative. It's 4% to 7% plus. So, just so we're clear on that particular point. Relative to the tariff [indiscernible]
Andrea Teixeira: For this quarter -- sorry, just for the quarter, I believe it's a really wide range for the quarter itself, for the fourth quarter.
William Newlands: So continuing to answer your question, relative to the tariff scenario, we have a number of what ifs, as you would expect and it's really too early to hypothesize about what might or might not happen. As you would expect, we have a lot of permutations that we have considered and certainly we'll adjust our approach depending on what terms -- what plays out as we go forward.
Garth Hankinson: And Andrea, I'll just follow up quickly on your question regarding Q4, right? So as Bill alluded to in his prior answer to Bonnie's question is, we acknowledge that the range right now is a little bit wider than we typically are given where we are in the calendar year. But this really is to acknowledge that there's potential for continued risk on the lower end, given macroeconomic conditions and whether or not they improve, stay where they are or get worse but also opportunity on the upper end as well. As we think about those macroeconomic risks potentially, obviously, as we've been talking about in this call, we're most concerned around unemployment but there are others as well. Fortunately, the print today from -- on unemployment seem positive. So hopefully, that continues and is a tailwind for us as we go through Q4.
Operator: Next question is coming from Filippo Falorni from Citi.
Filippo Falorni: I wanted to ask on beer margins. Obviously, this quarter, they were down year-over-year but given the increase in advertising that you called out, as you look a little bit ahead in terms of the beer margin opportunity, can you talk a little bit about the opportunities from pricing, commodities and also some of the FX consideration given the pace of weakness in recent months?
Garth Hankinson: Yes. I mean as it relates to beer margins. Look, I mean, the way we feel about beer margins really hasn't changed over the last several years. We think that the right way to think about our beer margin profile is in that 39% to 40% range. In any given year, we're going to have the tailwinds of incremental volume, more throughput through our footprint, obviously, very aggressive cost savings initiatives that we have every year as well as the pricing actions we take.  Offsetting those in any given year will be normal inflationary impacts. Obviously, as we build out our portfolio and our production footprint, we have more, the depreciation that comes on. And then obviously, there can be drags as it relates to fixed overhead absorption as you're growing into that capacity. So all up, all in, we continue to think that 39% to 40% is the right range for our beer margin, acknowledging that in any given year, we might have more headwinds and we could fall below 39% like we did in '23 and '24, where we had outsized inflation. But there could be years where we have more tailwinds like we did in '22, and we can deliver above 40%. So those are the puts and takes and that's why we think 39% to 40% is the right range.
Operator: Next question is coming from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen.
Robert Moskow: I think you said that price competitiveness has started to dial up on the light beer segment. And I wanted to know like -- I didn't hear if you have a response to that. Do you intend to promote more aggressively? And just in general, if the volumes are weak overall in the industry, can the industry still get pricing like it normally does? Or is there a risk that some of it needs to be discounted back more than normal?
William Newlands: We're assessing that -- the question of the light beer sector as we speak, as you would expect. 1% to 2%, as you know, we do it on a by SKU by market basis. So therefore, I think the answer remains yes. Those opportunities continue to present themselves but they do them selectively. It's not a broad market across the board change. It's looking specifically at markets, looking at velocities and growth profiles in particular markets and understand where those opportunities present themselves. It also applies to pack sizes. You might be able to do something in single serves versus larger pack sizes or vice versa. So we believe 1% to 2%, which we've done very consistently over time, remains the right answer, given big swings is a negative. And that's what we've tried to avoid. In fact, as you know, we avoided that during COVID. We were much more consistent on our 1% to 2% algorithm and we think that's more consumer-friendly than the opposite.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Peter Grom from UBS.
Peter Grom: I was just hoping to ask on beer guidance for the fourth quarter but just maybe a couple of modeling considerations. Maybe just to start, shipments versus depletions, Garth, I think you mentioned that you still expect them to be closely aligned on a full year basis. So I just want to make sure I heard that right, which would mean you would expect shipments to be a bit below depletions in the fourth quarter. And then just relative to the tracked data, you kind of saw a return to the low single-digit gap this quarter. You touched on the weakness in the nontracked channels that might be driving that. So is this gap something we should expect as we move forward here?
Garth Hankinson: Yes. So just on shipments and the depletions. On a full year basis, we expect shipments and depletions to be largely aligned. That -- you heard that correctly. As it relates to the gap between Circana and our depletions, look, I'll tell you what we say sort of every time we have this call, which is, we don't use the Circana data to track our depletions. Obviously, we know that that's the data point that you have to use but there are certainly limitations to Circana. Certainly, it only captures about 50% of our sales activity. And so that's something that you have to take into account. And there's been a lot of volatility, obviously, over the course of the last several years regarding that gap and how wide it has gotten. And for those questions as to what drives that gap, those are best suited for Circana and not necessarily answered by us.
Operator: Next question is coming from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.
Stephen Robert Powers: I wanted to go back to the discussion on CapEx that Kaumil had begun earlier in the call. In your answer there, you highlighted the modular nature of ongoing expansions and I guess, therefore, the -- effectively the discretion you have over CapEx. And I think that's intuitive with respect to expansions in Northern Mexico. But I guess my impression of Veracruz commitments is that they're a bit more fixed. So could you talk about whether that is correct or not? And then maybe more generally, just how much of the beer CapEx you've outlined from here, how much of that would you frame is like truly discretionary through fiscal '28?
William Newlands: So let me answer the first part of that. Yes, we are expecting to open Veracruz, as Garth noted, in roughly 18 months, a little less, which is right on schedule with what we had anticipated. That has all been mapped into what our anticipated supply requirements are. My point about modular was, if we need to add more going forward at Veracruz or at Obregon, as an example, we might -- we can speed up or slow down additional capacity expansions as need be, going forward. I think that's the beauty of where we are today versus at a time several years ago, where frankly, we were just trying to keep up with demand. We're in a much better position today that allows us to move forward with capital expenditures against building out our facilities in conjunction with what we see the business delivering.
Garth Hankinson: I think the only thing I'd add to that, Bill, is just as you think about Veracruz and the fact that it will come online in the time frame in which we were previously discussing, it's important to note that the first module that comes online at Veracruz is only 3 million hectoliters. So it's a relatively small piece of the overall production footprint.
Operator: We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Bill for any further closing comments.
William Newlands: Great. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining today's call. In closing, while in the third quarter, we continued to manage a softer consumer backdrop due to macroeconomic headwinds, the growth of our beer business still outperformed that of the total beverage industry. And as a company, we also outpaced the total CPG sector, both on a dollar sales basis. Furthermore, we also continued to consistently deliver against our capital allocation priorities, including returning another $220 million to shareholders in buybacks in Q3, which brings our total year-to-date cash returns through share repurchases to approximately $670 million. Looking ahead, we have prudently lowered our growth outlook for fiscal '25 given the near-term uncertainty on when consumers will revert to more normalized spending. However, we continue to expect another solid year with our revised comparable EPS range still delivering double-digit growth from the midpoint and above, underpinned by our continued progress against the key growth drivers of our beer business and our proactive actions to improve the performance in wine and spirits. And with that, we wish you all happy New Year and thank you again for joining the call.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2025 Q2  (2024-10-03 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Constellation Brands' Q2 Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Joe Suarez. Please go ahead, Joe.
Joseph Suarez: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning all, and welcome to Constellation Brands's Q2 fiscal 2025 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Following the call, we'll also be making available in the Investors section of our company's website a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now, here's Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thanks, Joe, and welcome to our Q2 fiscal 2025 earnings call. As usual, I'd like to start with a few key highlights for the quarter. First, while the current macroeconomic backdrop weighed on demand for beverage alcohol and, more broadly, across consumer packaged goods, we continue to deliver strong performance in the marketplace driven by our consumer-centric strategy and thoughtful approach to brand building. At a total company level, in Circana tracked channels over the 12 weeks ending September 1, we held the number one spot for both dollar sales growth and share gains within all beverage alcohol. And more notably, we once again achieved dollar sales growth outpacing the total CPG sector as we continued to build on our track record of over a decade as a CPG growth leader. Second, our Beer business remained the clear winner across the total beverage industry, having significantly outperformed in dollar sales growth and, of course, maintained its leading share-gaining position in the U.S. beer category. Third, and continuing with our Beer business, we delivered another quarter of significant margin expansion, supported by disciplined operational and financial management. Importantly, our cost savings and operational efficiency initiatives are delivering significant incremental benefits for our Beer business beyond what we had anticipated at the start of fiscal 2025, which are now enabling incremental marketing investments in our largest beer brands as of Q3. Fourth, our relentless focus on winning in the marketplace, delivering top-tier growth and driving efficiencies supported another quarter of double-digit increase in comparable EPS in line with our full year outlook. Our strong earnings performance and, in turn, significant cash generation enabled us to achieve a pivotal milestone of our capital allocation priorities, having reached a 2.9 net leverage ratio on a comparable basis in Q2, slightly below our approximate three times target. And equally important, consistent with those same priorities, we also returned nearly $250 million of cash to shareholders through share repurchases in Q2, bringing our total year-to-date cash returns through repurchases to approximately $450 million, while continuing to pay our dividend and advance our brewery investments in our Beer business. All in, as we noted a few weeks ago, while ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, particularly rising employment, have led to a recent deceleration in the rate of growth of consumer demand for our products, we remain on track to deliver another solid fiscal year and continue to create value for our shareholders. With that, let's turn more fully to our Beer business performance. During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, our Beer business continued to deliver strong financial performance with net sales and operating income growth of nearly 6% and 13%, respectively. As noted earlier, these increases were primarily supported by solid volume growth and carryover pricing from last fall, as well as disciplined cost management and operational efficiencies. Our Beer business grew shipments by 4.6% in Q2, while depletions were up 2.4%, which includes the impact of one less selling day. It is important to reinforce that the Q2 performance of our Beer business was accounted for in the updated expectations we shared for fiscal 2025 four weeks ago. Now, honing in on the performance of our largest brands, Modelo Especial grew depletions by nearly 5% and upheld its position as the top share gainer, further extending its lead as the number one beer brand in U.S. tracked channels. Corona Extra depletions declined approximately 3%. However, it remained a top five beer brand in dollar sales in the U.S. and continued to gain dollar share in the category. Pacifico delivered another quarter of remarkable depletion growth of nearly 23% and remain the number four dollar share gainer across the total Beer category. Our Modelo Chelada brands delivered an increase of approximately 2% in depletions and our Limón y Sal flavor remained a top 15 overall dollar share gainer in the category. As noted earlier, our Beer business also maintained the momentum of its significant operating leverage gains, driving 2.7 percentage points of operating margin expansion year-over-year. As mentioned earlier, we are pleased to be deploying incremental marketing investments across our largest beer brands in the second half of fiscal 2025 as our cost savings and efficiency initiatives have delivered results above our initial expectations. Looking ahead more broadly, consistent with our recent outlook update, we continue to expect our Beer business to deliver net sales growth of 6% to 8%, operating income growth of 11% to 12%, and an operating margin of approximately 39% in fiscal 2025. Moving on to Wine and Spirits, as noted a few weeks ago and our full year guidance update, we continue to face incremental category headwinds in our Wine and Spirits business, particularly in the lower-priced segments. This affected both the performance of Wine and Spirits in this latest quarter and our fiscal 2025 outlook for that business. In Q2, the impact of these category headwinds largely drove Wine and Spirits shipments down 9.8% year-on-year while in turn was the primary driver of the respective 12% and 13% declines in net sales and operating income for that business. Against that backdrop, the business remains focused on continuing to advance the operational and commercial execution initiatives identified at the end of our last fiscal year to improve the performance of our largest Wine and Spirits brands. Encouragingly, we saw some green shoots in Q2 across our largest higher-end wine brands, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, The Prisoner as tactical pricing and marketing support actions we are taking in select markets began to drive better consumer takeaway trends. So we plan to continue these actions through the remainder of the year to drive further improvements in this select group of our most scaled higher-end offerings, which ultimately underpins the sequential improvement we expect in our Wine and Spirits business over the second half of fiscal 2025 for our updated outlook. Also notably, our Craft Spirits portfolio, albeit smaller and scale continues to be a positive driver for the business, delivering strong depletion volume growth as well as high single-digit dollar sales growth in Circana U.S. tracked channels, significantly outperforming the low single-digit growth rate of the higher-end spirits segment. Looking ahead for our recent updated fiscal 2025 outlook, we expect the Wine and Spirits business to ultimately deliver for the full year net sales and operating income declines of 4% to 6% and 16% to 18%, respectively. Lastly, we usually take this opportunity in our Q2 call to bring your attention to the upcoming release of our annual ESG impact report every October. That said, going forward, we'll be publishing this report under the same time line as our other fiscal year-end materials. This shift in timing will help ensure better alignment between our most recent and relevant full financial year updates and these related to our efforts to address pressing environmental and societal needs that are important to our business and our stakeholders ahead of our annual meeting. We look forward to sharing progress and updated targets in a few quarters. So in closing, while our sector is facing less favorable consumer demand due to macroeconomic headwinds, we delivered another quarter of strong financial results underpinned by the continued solid net sales growth and significant margin expansion of our Beer business, ultimately achieving our second quarter double-digit comparable EPS growth in line with our full fiscal year expectations. In addition, we continue to build on our leadership position within consumer packaged goods and the total beverage industry, outperforming in dollar sales growth across Circana tracked channels. And we remain steadfast in delivering against our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities, achieving a two times net leverage ratio on a comparable basis, slightly below our stated approximately three times target, while also returning nearly $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases in Q2, as well as continuing to pay our dividend and advance our brewery capacity investments. And with that, I will turn the call over to Garth, who will provide more details on our financial results and outlook. Garth?
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As usual, my discussion of our Q2 fiscal 2025 performance will focus mainly on our comparable enterprise results accompanied by business segmented analysis. Let's get started with our enterprise results. For the quarter, enterprise net sales grew 3%, while enterprise operating income decreased 226% on a reported basis and increased 13% on a comparable basis. The increases in enterprise net sales and enterprise comparable operating income were driven by strong results from our beer business, which were partially offset by ongoing category headwinds affecting the performance of our wine and spirits business, both of which I will address in more detail shortly. The decline in reported enterprise operating income reflects a non-cash goodwill impairment loss for the Wine and Spirits business of $2.25 billion. As noted in our updated guidance last month, we now expect enterprise net sales to grow between 4% to 6% for fiscal 2025 and for enterprise comparable operating income to grow 8% to 9% for the full year. At an enterprise level, we remain confident in our ability to deliver against our initial double-digit comparable EPS growth expectations, as demonstrated by our decision to raise at the lower end of our full-year comparable EPS outlook during our recent guidance update, with that range now set at $13.60 to $13.80. Now I'll turn to a more detailed review of our Q2 fiscal 2025 results. To start, our Beer business net sales grew by 6%, representing an uplift of $137.5 million. This was driven by Beer shipment volume growth of 4.6% and favorable pricing, which added $50.2 million to the overall net Beer net sales increase. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect pricing to account for 1% to 2% of our net sales growth, reflecting both the muted pricing from the first half of this year, which was driven by lapping outsized pricing from last year, as well as targeted price actions we are taking in the second half of fiscal 2025. Beer depletions grew 2.4%, marking our 58th consecutive quarter of growth. As a reminder, in the second quarter, we had one less selling day, and the impact of a selling day variance to our volume growth performance has historically been between 0.5% to 1.5 percentage points, depending on the day a week lost or gained. Also, as Bill noted, Beer depletions for the quarter were impacted by the recent challenging macroeconomic backdrop, where rising unemployment rates have impacted consumer behavior. That said, we are pleased to have had our Beer business once again outperform the category and sector in dollar sales in the second quarter, and in particular, to have once more won the 4th of July holiday as the top share gaining supplier in Circana dollar sales, growing 5.1% and gaining 1.2 share points of total Beer and 1.3 share points of high-end Beer. Our on-premise depletions grew 5% and accounted for approximately 11% of our total volumes. Corona Extra remains the number one packaged Beer by dollar sales in the on-premise, while Modelo Especial continues to hold its number four beer position on draft in the U.S., up from the number five spot last fiscal year. For the second quarter, Beer shipment growth outpaced depletion growth as distributors proactively managed inventory levels to supply the higher-volume summer season. For the full fiscal year, we expect absolute shipment and depletion volumes to be closely aligned with each other, and for the quarterly share of full-year volumes across both of those metrics to be in line with those of fiscal 2024. As we look ahead to the balance of the fiscal year for the Beer business, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate our updated outlook announced last month. Beer net sales are now expected to grow between 6% to 8% for fiscal 2025, reflecting the incremental macroeconomic headwinds we have seen this year affecting the consumer as noted earlier. We believe these headwinds are transitory in nature. And while our consumers are cautious, they also remain very loyal to our brands as they seek more value-oriented packs and channels to manage their spend in this environment. We are focused on managing the levers that we can control and continue to advance our cost savings and efficiency initiatives that allow us to accelerate incremental marketing investments toward our Beer business to drive top line growth. We remain confident in our overall growth profile, which again continues to outperform our sector and industry as we pursue further incremental points of distribution in the U.S. and push forward with our focused and disciplined innovation agenda while building on the broader demographic tailwinds from our loyal Hispanic consumers. I'll now turn to Beer operating income and margins. The Beer segment grew operating income by 13% and had a 270 basis point increase in operating margin to 42.6%. The strong performance in our beer operating income is largely the result of an over $65 million benefit from our ongoing cost savings and efficiency initiatives, partially offsetting an increase in COGS of 4%, excluding these savings but inclusive of the impact of the volume and foreign currency. As a reminder, approximately 25% of our total COGS are exposed to the Mexican peso and we are approximately 90% hedged against that exposure for the fiscal year. For the remainder of fiscal 2025, we anticipate incremental COGS relative to net sales due to lower fixed cost absorption from normal volume seasonality. That said, it is important to recall that in Q4, we will lap the VAT write-off from the same period last year, which will provide some favorability year-over-year but will not offset the sequential impact of lesser fixed cost absorption due to seasonally lower volumes. Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales was 7.6% for the quarter. For fiscal 2025, we are still on track to be in line with our full year expectation of approximately 8.5% as we continue to ramp up investments to support our core brands and during the NFL and college football season, particularly in Q3. Other SG&A expense was 3.8% as a percentage of net sales. And we expect this ratio to increase in the second half of the year, largely due to lower volumes yielding less cost absorption. This is in line with our expectation and we continue to anticipate our full year SG&A expense to be approximately 5% of net sales. Overall, for Beer operating margins, we continue to expect to be at approximately 39% for fiscal 2025. As just noted, we expect lower fixed cost absorption and incremental marketing investments to drive sequentially lower operating margins in the second half. Moving on to the Wine and Spirits business. Net sales for the segment declined 12% in the second quarter, driven largely by a 9.8% decrease in shipments. The decline was largely driven by ongoing challenges in the wine category, particularly in the U.S. wholesale marketplace due to both weaker consumer demand and retailer inventory destocking. Accordingly, we remain focused on the ongoing tactical pricing and marketing actions shared at the beginning of this fiscal year to help drive net sales improvement in the performance of our largest brands. As Bill noted, we are seeing some encouraging early results from these actions. And as a reminder, we continue to see the back half of the fiscal year as the higher volume period for our Wine and Spirits business, due to historical seasonality related to vintage releases from our higher-end brands and incremental demand over the holiday season, as well as incremental benefits from the initiatives just referenced. Operating income for Wine and Spirits business remained relatively flat with a decline of approximately $10 million, resulting in an 18.1% operating margin. Altogether, the decline in operating income and relatively stable margin performance were primarily impacted by unfavorable product mix and overall lower shipment volumes, partially offset by higher contractual distributor payments. Our marketing expense as a percent of net sales was 9.3%, which is slightly above our medium-term targets, as we continue to make near-term investments in our largest brands to help support our top line. And SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 14.8%, coming in line with our medium-term outlook. Looking forward to the remainder of the year for the Wine and Spirits business, we expect operating margins to benefit from mix benefits due to the previously noted seasonally driven increase in volumes for our higher-end brands, incremental volume benefits from the commercial execution initiatives also previously referenced to further support demand for our core brands, and operational efficiency and cost savings actions similar to those being executed in our Beer business. As we face ongoing operating deleverage due to larger top line headwinds, we anticipate a full year 16% to 18% decline in operating income for our recently revised fiscal 2025 guidance. Capping off the rest of the P&L. Corporate expense for the quarter was approximately $58 million, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of $8 million or 13%, driven by a one-off real estate tax benefit in the second quarter. In the back half of fiscal 2025, we expect a marginal increase mainly due to the increase in compensation and benefits and digital capabilities investments. And for the full year, we continue to expect $260 million. Interest expense for the quarter was $104 million, a 6% decrease from the prior year due to lower average borrowings and an increase in capitalized interest from our investments in our breweries. As noted in our previously updated guidance, interest expense for the fiscal year is now expected to be approximately $430 million, as we see favorability from lower cost of borrowing and adjustments related to capitalized interest. Our comparable effective tax rate was 18.7%, compared to 17.8% for the corresponding quarter last year. And we continue to expect our full year tax rate to be 18.5%. And finally, free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For the first half of fiscal 2025, we generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion, a 12% increase from the prior period. As a reminder, we expect free cash flow to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion for the fiscal year as we reached the high watermark year of capital expenditures in our Beer business medium-term outlook provided at our Investor Day. Beyond fiscal 2025, we continue to expect an uplift in free cash flow generation, particularly as we complete the initial phase of our new Veracruz Brewery by late fiscal 2026 or early fiscal 2027. To conclude, we continued to make solid progress in delivering growth from our strong portfolio of brands, margin expansion from our relentless pursuit of operational efficiency and cost discipline, and against our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities. That said, in light of constantly evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical dynamics, we continue to closely monitor for any signs of ongoing pressures on the consumer and we plan to continue to take proactive actions to mitigate these possible headwinds and maintain the momentum of our brands with the consumers, such as reinvesting incremental cost savings into high-return marketing opportunities and advancing our price pack architecture efforts. And as we've always done, we will continue to provide timely updates to our stakeholders as we develop any additional relevant insights on our consumers or should there be any material changes to our expectations, both favorable or unfavorable. As I wrap-up, I want to thank all of you for your support as we continue to execute against our stated initiatives. And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies. Your line is now live.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hi guys. Good morning. Congrats you hit your leverage target. Can you maybe talk about moving forward, now that you're there, what the appetite is for more aggressively repurchasing shares, especially as, using your words, you hit sort of the high-water mark on CapEx? And then just maybe procedurally, how often does the Board meet to have those discussions? Is it ongoing or just kind of once a year? Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Thanks Kaumil and as you suggested and as were in Bill's and my remarks, we did continue to deliver against our disciplined allocation priorities as we've done for the last year -- or last five years in Q2. As you noted, in Q2, we hit an important milestone, which is we got at our target or slightly below our target. And throughout the first half of the year, we've been fairly opportunistic as we've repurchased shares. In fact, we accelerated our repurchase activity in Q2, delivering $249 million in Q2 after delivering -- or $200 million in Q1, for a total of nearly $450 million through the first half of the year. We have $2.2 billion of authorization left under the current authorization provided by the Board, which will allow us to continue to be opportunistic as we move into the second half of the year. And per your sort of procedural or administrative question, we typically get additional authorizations and/or announce any incremental programs or commitments in the back half of our fiscal year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
Dara Mohsenian: Hi good morning. So, just on beer depletions in the quarter, a bit softer result than we've been used to from you guys looking back over the past few years. Just can you give us a bit of postmortem there? Obviously, you talked about the macro factors. Is that really the key factor in your mind? Or are there other pressure points? And maybe parse out trends in different key consumer segments for you to give us some insight there. And then the pickup so far in September, that's obviously scanner data, just put that in context and how that sort of informs your forward view from here around depletions in this macro environment? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure. Let me tackle that one. First of all, there were two or three factors that were critically important in Q2. One is there was somewhat higher unemployment rate, particularly in the Hispanic market. And that affects most of our top five states, which represent roughly 50% of our volume. I think, secondly, and if you look historically, this often happens, whenever there is a scenario where you have a federal election that is close, you often have people pull back. You see it across the whole consumer sector, and that is consistent as well. I think a couple of things are important to recognize. One is demand. Our buy rate continues to be very strong. On a 52-week basis, we are up mid-single digits, with the Hispanic consumer is slightly ahead of that. You point out, I think it's obvious, in IRI Circana data, the four-week trend is better than both the 12-week trend and the 26-week trend. I think this is consistent with what we've said all along, which is we don't see this as any radical change in the long-term perspective on the business. It is purely a near-term issue. I think the fact that the Fed has reduced rates is going to help to manage the unemployment issue and stimulate consumption. So we remain as optimistic as we have been about our expectations for the back half of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. Thank you. Hi, everyone. I had a question on your increased space and distribution gains. I know you've captured a lot of space in the spring reset. So I guess curious to hear if the lift from that has met your expectations. And then also, any color on potential shelf space gains you got or maybe getting this fall? And if so, could you maybe quantify this and really share with us how that factors into your full year Beer top line growth guidance, which essentially implies top line growth should accelerate a little bit in the second half versus the first half? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Well, obviously, any time you pick up shelf -- and just to remind everyone on the call, we had double-digit share gains here in the spring resets, that always is beneficial. And it's particularly beneficial in areas where we are still radically improving our share and increasing our awareness levels. I think this is going to be doubled-down, Bonnie, on the fact that we are spending a significant amount of increased marketing investment against our Beer brands because of the strong cost and efficiency initiatives that we've been able to achieve above and beyond what we expected at the beginning of the year. So we expect that, therefore, those shelf initiatives that have occurred in the early part of the year, combined with our marketing efforts to double down at a time when many in the consumer sector having to pull back will be highly beneficial to our results as you continue through the rest of this year.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Bill Newlands: Hello Nik.
Operator: Nik, probably your phone is on mute.
Nik Modi: Can you hear me?
Bill Newlands: We can now.
Nik Modi: Yes. So if you could just talk about Corona. It was a little weaker in the quarter. Is this a function of just Modelo really doing better and maybe cannibalizing maybe Pacifico? Just any thoughts around that would be helpful.
Bill Newlands: Yes. Corona was slightly softer than we expected it might be in Q2. But as we noted, there were some, again, macro factors. Corona is a little overweighted to the East Coast. There were some challenging times during that window -- during the second quarter for many of the Eastern markets. With that said, there's a lot of excitement around Corona as well. We are already seeing a pickup, as you've seen in the IRI takeout data, Corona has, much like our overall business, has looked much better on a 4-week basis than it did in the prior window of time. We're very excited about the impending launch of Corona Sun brew, which has done very well in consumer testing in the Northeast here during this window of time. So we continue to say that Corona is going to be slightly up for the year. We still think that's probably where that will land. And Corona is going to be one of the big benefitees in the increase in the marketing spend that we have in the back half of the year because of our strong cost efficiency initiatives. So I think Corona is going to be just fine as we continue through the remainder of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you, operator and Hi Bill and Garth. It seems like, obviously, beer volumes picked up in the last few weeks, as you mentioned. I was hoping to see if you can comment a little bit on how to expect the beer depletions against consumption as we unfold. Of course, you have an extra day in the fourth quarter, if I believe that's correct. But you also have -- you have easier comps now in the third quarter, but tougher comps in the fourth quarter. So how we should be thinking about cadence of beer shipments and depletions as we move forward? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Yes. I think there's going to be another number of things that work to our advantage as the year progresses. One is, and you already pointed it out, there's been incremental change that you've seen in the recent weeks. We do not see it this is a structural change, as we've said many times, a number of things are going to be working better as we go forward. The fact that the Fed action to reduce rates, I think, is going be a big help. I think the fact that we expect Hispanic unemployment to come back in line, and obviously, the resolution of the election will occur here in the next several weeks. The other thing I'd point out, and we've said this, and I'm sure Joe has said this when you've spoken to him directly, beer depletes and scanner results have tended to be right on top of one another recently, after there having been some fairly broad differentiation amongst those. So I think that begins to be -- begins to be a little more consistent as you go forward through the rest of the year. Based on our assessment, the sell days are the same at both Q3 and Q4, we don't expect any impact of that. Just a reminder for everybody, Q2, there was 1 less selling day, and in our judgment, that probably impacted somewhere toward the upper end of the range that Garth mentioned during his conversation.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Peter Grom from UBS. Your line is now live.
Peter Grom: Yes. Thanks. Thank you, operator. Maybe just two quick follow-ups. I just want to follow-up. Just in the context of what we've seen year-to-date with shipments coming in ahead of depletions and the expectation that they're going to be aligned for the year, how should we be thinking about the timing of that reversal? Would that be largely in 3Q or spread evenly in the back half of the year? And then just thinking about the full year, obviously, you're kind of squarely at the midpoint of your sales guidance. But with shipment timing benefits expected to reverse a bit, should we kind of view the high end of Beer top-line range as aspirational? Or are there other key drivers or offsets that could result in stronger growth in the back half? Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Thanks, Peter. In terms of the sort of quarterly cadence, the shipments and depletions. As we noted during my opening remarks, we expect the quarterly share of annual shipments and depletions to be in line with where they were fiscal 2024. And as noted, and you noted, Q2 shipments surpassed depletions as distributors build inventory for the peak season. In Q3, the shipment share will be lower than the depletion share due to maintenance activities. And this has historically resulted and our shipment growth being below depletion growth. So you will see some of that reversal that you referenced, in Q3. And then in Q4, both the share of the full year for both of those tend to normalize just as we saw last year. So net-net, as you indicated, we expect, on a full year basis, shipments and depletions to be largely in line with one another.
Bill Newlands: And I would say, I would not necessarily agree with your aspirational comment. What we try to do with our range is provide a range that gives us, if things go positively, we would expect to be to the upper end of the range. And if things are a bit more challenging for any reason, it might be the lower end of the range. That's why we give it a range. So I would not characterize it in the way you asked it. .
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live.
Michael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping you could unpack some of the marketing color a little bit. You talked about some of the incremental spending. But then I think you also reiterated the 8.5% spend for the full year for beer. So maybe can you just help us understand what's new or what's changed and how we should we should -- what expect to see?
Bill Newlands: Yes. What's new and what's changed is we've decided to put a significant amount of additional investment against our brands. Corona, Modelo, Chelada, Pacifico will all benefit from some of that increased spend. And that's already started. You may have noticed against the football schedule that you kind of can't miss our brands if you happen to watch any football, whether it be college football or National Football League. So we're going to continue to do that because of the tremendous work that's been done around cost and operational efficiencies. And all of our critical brands are going to benefit from the uplift that we will have in the back half of the year. And I think it's important to point out, the reason we can do that is because of the growth of our business and the cost savings initiative. This is at a time when many, many other consumer businesses are challenged and wouldn't be able to do this. I think this is a great opportunity for our business in the back half of the year to double down on our approach to going after the consumer and providing them with outstanding opportunities to consume our products.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Your line is now live.
Filippo Falorni: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask on Beer gross margins. That's been an area of upside surprise versus our estimates. Clearly, you talked about the cost savings coming in better and driving the opportunity to invest more behind the brand. How should we think about those savings in the second half of the year, and maybe other drivers, both from a commodity and foreign exchange standpoint, you mentioned the pay so you're 90% hedged this year this year. Should we think maybe some vulnerability on the pays on Q4 and maybe into fiscal 2026? And then on the commodity side, maybe any update on the commodity headwinds that you're expecting? Thank you.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. Well, thank you for the question. And as you noted, we've made very good progress against our cost savings and efficiency initiatives. And we've -- at this point we've really hit that $300 million target that we laid out at our Investor Day last year. Obviously, that doesn't mean we'll stop there. As we go forward, we'll continue to identify areas of opportunity to take costs out of the business, become more efficient, as we always have done. But those -- the acceleration of the achievement against those has helped lead to the margin profile that we announced today. As we look towards the second half of the year, we will continue to benefit from the cost savings that we generated through the first half of the year. That being said, in the second half of the year, in the Beer business, we typically see about 45% of our volume, so the normal cadence. So we will have less fixed cost absorption in the second half of the year. Again, typical in what we'd see in the back half of every sort of normal year. And then, as we said in the opening remarks today, we are spending more on as a percent of net sales and marketing in the second half, we're going to support the growth of the business, inclusive of the incremental marketing expenditure that Bill just spoke to here a moment ago. And that's why you'll see some -- you'll see the margin be a little bit lower in the second half of the year. Importantly, on that marketing, you'll see the biggest impact of that in Q3.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.
Robert Moskow: Hi. I want to ask about Wine and Spirits. The marketing plans that you had this year it looks like it's been slow to materialize, although you did mention some green shoots. And I wanted so if the plan going forward also includes more acquisitions. You had Sea Smoke acquisition earlier this year. Do you think that you need to make more acquisitions of up and coming brands like this in order to truly turn around the business?
Bill Newlands: Yes. Thanks for the question. So, let me remind you what Garth and I said at the beginning of the fiscal year, that a lot of the work that was put in place was going to take us 9 to 12 months to fully play out. And as we said on today's call, we expect sequential improvement in the Wine and Spirits business in the back half of the year. The answer to your question, no, I don't perceive us to be acquiring additional properties at this point in time in our -- particularly on the wine side of our business. Frankly, our focus right now is on improving the operational performance of that business. And all the time, energy and efforts are being put against seeing that operational improvement play out in the back half of the year, including engaging more directly and more often with our distributor partners as part of that. As we've said, and I'll just reiterate one more time, we do expect to see sequential improvement in the back half of the half of the year based on all the work that's been put in on the first the year to see that coming along. Noting the point about green shoots, we are starting to see some of that result. We look forward to seeing more of it in the back half.
Robert Moskow: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Bill Kirk from ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is now live.
Bill Kirk: Hi. I have another one on Wine and Spirits. At fiscal year-end, the fair value was still estimated, I think, in the 10-K at about $3 billion. The impairment takes it down to like $500 million. So I guess why the dramatic change in such a short time? Why is $500 million the right number when it's generating $400 million in EBITDA and there's some green shoots out there? And then finally, like does the impairment give you any flexibility to do something strategically with those assets?
Garth Hankinson: Well, thanks for the question, Bill. I would say that the amount that remains on the balance sheet is -- it's fairly formulaic as you go through what you think the future business will look like, there's a number of assumptions that will go into that. And so it's -- I think it's important to note that it's non-cash as well. I wouldn't read anything too much into it other than that. And I don't know that it really has any impact other than it was an accounting requirement for us to take -- it doesn't really change the strategic outlook for the business.
Operator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further closing comments.
Bill Newlands: Great. Thank you, operator, and thank you all again for joining today's call. We're very pleased with our solid performance in Q2 of fiscal 2025. At a total company level, we once again outpaced the total CPG sector in dollar sales growth across Circana tracked channels and delivered another quarter of double-digit comparable EPS growth in line with our full year outlook, and achieved our approximate three times net leverage ratio, while returning another $250 million of cash to shareholders via share repurchases, now totaling nearly $450 million fiscal year-to-date. In our Beer business, we continued to outperform the total beverage industry in dollar sales growth, maintaining our leading share gainer position in the U.S. beer market, delivering our 58th consecutive quarter of depletion growth, and sustained the momentum of margin expansion in the Beer business through our cost savings and operational efficiency initiatives. And in our Wine and Spirits business, while we continued to face challenging market dynamics in Q2, we expect sequential improvements in Q3 and Q4 as we make further progress on our commercial and operational execution initiatives launched at the beginning of this fiscal year. In closing, as our next earnings call is not until January, I'd like to wish everyone a happy holiday season and hope you will enjoy your celebrations with some of our fantastic products. Thanks again for joining today's call.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time. And have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2025 Q1  (2024-07-03 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Constellation Brands First Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Joseph Suarez, SVP of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Joseph Suarez: Thank you, Daryl. Good morning, all, and welcome to Constellation Brands Q1 fiscal '25 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Following the call, we will also be making available in the Investors section of our company's website a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, and as Daryl mentioned, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance and now here's Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thanks, Joe, and welcome all to our Q1 fiscal '25 earnings call. I'm pleased to say that we got off to a solid start in Q1. And as usual, I'd like to start with a few key highlights for the quarter. First, we continued to extend our position as a growth leader within consumer packaged goods, achieving an enterprise dollar sales increase 4.5 percentage points above that of the entire CPG sector. Let me repeat that. We achieved an enterprise dollar sales increase 4.5 percentage points above that of the entire CPG sector per the Circana tracked channel data for the 12 weeks ended on their May 19 quad week. This significant outperformance was largely driven by the continued growth of our Beer business, which attained the second largest share gain in the total beverage industry, as well as once again the top share gain in all beverage alcohol. This is for the Circana 12 weeks ended June 2, which most closely aligns with our quarter. Second, continuing with our Beer business. We delivered another strong quarter with high-single digit net sales increase driven by our Beer portfolio's 57th consecutive quarter of depletion growth, as well as significant operating margin improvement supported by our cost savings and operational efficiency initiatives. And, of course, all of this was aligned with our full year guidance and our medium-term outlook for the business. Third, in-line with our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities, which we have consistently delivered against for more than five years now, in the first quarter of this fiscal year, we did several things. First, we maintained our strong investment grade balance sheet and still expect to achieve our target 3 times net leverage ratio in fiscal '25. Second, we returned $185 million to shareholders in dividends and executed $200 million in share repurchases, plus we completed over $40 million more dollars of buybacks in June. Third, we continued to advance our latest brewing capacity addition at Obregon and new brewery development at Veracruz. And we are pleased to have executed the divestiture of our Mexicali site, which as a reminder was mainly the land building as we had already repurposed most of the equipment. Fourth, we executed the tuck-in acquisition of SeaSmoke to address white space and enhance asset utilization in our wine portfolio. And in parallel, initiated a potential sales process of a few wine and spirits non-core assets, including certain vineyards and facilities to better align our network and partially offset the acquisition cost. Staying with Wine and Spirits for a moment, while the performance of the business continues to face near-term challenges largely driven by broader category headwinds, we expect net sales and operating income improvements and our outlook for the fiscal year is unchanged. Lastly, all in, we drove comparable earnings per share growth of more than 17% and remain focused on achieving our stated full year guidance and medium-term target of low double-digit comparable EPS growth. With that, let's turn more fully to our Beer business' performance. We maintained the momentum in our Beer business during the first quarter of fiscal '25 with net sales and operating income growth of more than 8% and nearly 16%, respectively. As noted earlier, these increases were primarily supported by strong volume growth as well as cost and operational efficiencies. Our Beer business grew shipments by 7.6% in Q1 on a reported basis, while depletions were up 6.4% excluding the impact of the craft brand divestitures in June of last year. It is important to reiterate that this mid to high-single digit level of volume growth was fully aligned with the expectations we shared for our fiscal year, as well as our medium-term algorithm. So, despite the volatility of short-term scanner data, be it due to weather, timing of holidays or other non-structural factors or the performance of the broader beer category, be that due to dynamics affecting other brands or segments, our Beer team once again consistently delivered on our targets and objectives. Now honing in on the performance of our largest brands, Modelo Especial grew depletions by nearly 11% and upheld its position as the top share gainer, extending its lead as the number one beer brand in U.S. tracked channels. Importantly, Modelo Especial also continues to grow household penetration, rising to become the number three brand on this metric at the end of May, with a 2.4 percentage point increase on a 52 week basis. While Corona Extra depletions declined just over 1% in Q1, we continue to expect, we can deliver low-single digit growth from this brand. Importantly, Corona Extra remains a top five beer brand in the U.S. and it continues to gain share in the category. Pacifico delivered remarkable depletion growth of over 20% and was the number four dollar share gainer across the total beer category. Our Modelo Chelada brands delivered an increase of more than 5% in depletions and we are excited to continue to build on that momentum in fiscal '25 with two new flavors, Fresa Picante and Negra con Chile. More broadly, from an innovation pipeline perspective, the rollout of our two new Modelo Oro pack sizes is underway, as we continue to thoughtfully build out the brand using our disciplined approach after a successful national launch last year. In addition, the expansion of our Aguas Frescas variety pack to an additional 20 markets and the launch of Corona Sunbrew in select Eastern test markets are also advancing per our plans and we look forward to sharing more on these additions to our portfolio over the coming year. The strong execution of our Beer business in Q1 was also reflected in our ability to deliver significant operating leverage, driving 2.6 percentage points of operating margin expansion year-over-year. Looking ahead, we continue to expect our Beer business to deliver net sales growth of 7% to 9%, operating income growth of 10% to 12% and an operating margin of approximately 39% in fiscal '25. Moving on to Wine and Spirits. As noted earlier, we continue to face challenging dynamics in these categories, particularly across most of the wine price segments. These headwinds were the main drivers of the 7% net sales decline for that business in Q1. That said, our craft spirits portfolio achieved shipment volume growth of 14% as well as double-digit dollar sales growth in Circana U.S. track channels, significantly outperforming the low-single digit growth rate of the higher-end spirit segment. In addition, we continue to make good progress against the operational and commercial execution initiatives identified last quarter to support our efforts to improve the performance of this business in fiscal '25. The tactical investments in the 11 brands that represent 75% of net sales and over 80% of volumes for our Wine and Spirits business in fiscal '24 are now underway and we expect to see improvements in this select group of our most scaled offerings over the remainder of the year, ultimately underpinning the relatively stable net sales outlook for that business in fiscal '25. However, these incremental investments did have a near-term impact on the operating income, which declined 25% in the first quarter. That said, we also expect year-over-year operating income performance of our wine and spirits business to improve throughout the remainder of the year. And we continue to target Wine and Spirits operating income to be down 9% to 11% in fiscal '25. As we have noted previously, we remain committed to continuing to advance this business over the coming years towards the medium-term target shared in our Investor Day. Lastly, we continue to make-good progress against our ESG ambitions, having recently received TRUE Certification for Zero Waste at our Nava and Obregon breweries, marking a significant milestone in meeting our waste reduction commitment. And as a reminder last year, we also achieved our initial water restoration commitment one year ahead of schedule and we then set an ambitious target nearly 5 times the size of the original goal to be completed within the same timeframe of fiscal '23 to '25. So in closing, we once again delivered another quarter of solid performance driven by the continued strength of our Beer business and we expect to maintain this momentum throughout the rest of fiscal '25 and beyond as committed at Investor Day. Our Beer business continues to achieve strong volume growth, well above that of its category and total beverage alcohol. This outstanding performance supported the second largest dollar share gain within the broader beverage industry and reinforced our significant growth outperformance relative to the entire CPG sector. Our Wine and Spirits business is making progress against the operation and commercial execution initiatives identified last quarter to support its trajectory for this year's guidance. All in, we continue to advance toward our enterprise wide financial targets, including the delivery of double-digit comparable EPS growth, while upholding our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities from the last five years, which so far this fiscal year has also included the return of over $240 million to shareholders in share repurchases through June. And with that, I turn the call over to Garth.
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As usual, my discussion of our Q1 fiscal '25 performance will focus mainly on our comparable Enterprise results accompanied by business segment details. Starting with our Enterprise net sales, we delivered top-line growth of 6% for the quarter, in line with our full year expectations and our medium-term outlook for our Investor Day targets. As anticipated, this strong growth was driven by our Beer business, which I will elaborate on shortly. For fiscal '25, we continue to expect Enterprise net sales to grow between 6% to 7%. Enterprise operating income increased 23% and 12% on a reported and comparable basis, respectively. This resulted in a 35.4% operating -- reported operating margin and a 180 basis point year-over-year increase in comparable operating margin to 34.7%. While we delivered very strong operating income growth in the first quarter, again driven by our Beer business, we continue to expect Enterprise comparable operating income growth of 8% to 10% for the full year. At an Enterprise level, we also remain on track to achieve our full year comparable EPS guidance of $13.50 to $13.80, having delivered comparable EPS of $3.57 for the first quarter. As a reminder, our full year comparable EPS guidance represents a 10% increase year-over-year using the mid-point of our range. Importantly, these comparable EPS results and expectations are also consistent with our medium-term annual low double-digit comparable EPS growth target we outlined at our Investor Day last November. Now, turning to the more detailed discussion of the underlying drivers of our Q1 performance. Starting with our Beer business, the segment is off to a great start in fiscal '25. Our Beer business grew depletion volumes by 6.4%, excluding the impact of last year's craft brand divestitures, which will be the basis of our depletion figures this year to eliminate any sequential distortions from lapping periods without the craft brands. This reflected the solid consumer demand during the quarter, as well as the strong execution and performance during the key Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays. As usual, we led Cinco de Mayo and we are pleased to have once again won the Memorial Day holiday as the top share gaining supplier in Circana dollar sales, growing 6.3% and gaining 1.6 share points of total beer and 1.8 share points of high end beer. Modelo Especial was the top share gaining brand, picking up 1 share point and we had a total of five out of 15 top share gaining brands. Our on-premise depletions grew 2% as we continued to capture tap handles and gain share as demonstrated by Modelo Especial, shifting up one spot to now be the number four beer on draft in the U.S. Beer shipment volume for the quarter increased 7.6% and ran slightly ahead of depletions on both a growth rate and on an absolute basis. This is aligned with our usual seasonality as distributor and retailers prepare for the peak summer season. That said, from a full year perspective, we continue to expect absolute shipments and depletion volumes to closely align with each other. And in terms of the quarterly cadence of our volumes in fiscal '25, we still anticipate the quarterly share of full year shipment volumes and depletion volumes to be largely aligned with that of fiscal '24. Lastly, regarding selling days for our Beer business, they were flat for the first quarter of fiscal '25. For the balance of the year, we will have one less selling day, which will occur in Q2. In addition to the shipment volume growth, we realized pricing benefits of less than 1% due to lapping the wrap-around impacts of the pricing actions we took in the fall of calendar year 2022, which were above our normal pricing algorithm. Altogether, volume growth combined with price/mix benefits drove net sales growth of more than 8% for our Beer business. As we look towards the balance of fiscal '25, from a top-line perspective for our Beer business, we anticipate the momentum of our portfolio to continue. The shelf space gains we captured this past spring and our ongoing pursuit of additional points of distribution across the country are in line with what we outlined during our Investor Day. In addition, the opportunities across our disciplined innovation launches and the demographic tailwinds from Hispanic consumers who have high affinity and strong loyalty for our brands, as well as the incredible equity of our brands underpinned by our consistent marketing efforts give us further assurance that our top-line performance is sustainable. Moving on to operating income and operating margin performance for our Beer business. This segment delivered 16% growth in operating income and a 260 basis point increase in operating margin to 40.6%. These increases were largely driven by the strong top-line growth of our Beer business, as well as a nearly $50 million benefit from our savings and efficiency initiatives, which partially offset an increase in COGS of 7% excluding these savings, but inclusive of the impact of volume and foreign currency. As a reminder, approximately 25% of our total COGS are exposed to the Mexican peso and we are approximately 85% hedged against that exposure for the fiscal year. Marketing expense as a percent of net sales was 8.4% for the quarter, relatively in line with our full year expectation of approximately 8.5%. Other SG&A expense was 4.4% as a percent of net sales, slightly under our full year expectation as we expect an uplift in the second half due to lower fixed cost absorption, as well as talent acquisition and integrated supply chain investments. We continue to expect Beer operating margins of approximately 39% for fiscal '25. And from a cadence perspective, we anticipate incremental COGS relative to net sales in H2 due to lower fixed cost absorption from normal volume seasonality with some favorability in Q4 from lapping the VAT write-off in the same period last year. Shifting to our Wine and Spirits business. The segment realized a 7% net sales decline in the first quarter. This was largely driven by a 5.1% decrease in shipment volume as marketplace dynamics in U.S. wholesale remain challenging, particularly in the wine category. That said, we continue to expect that the operational and commercial execution initiatives identified in Q4 of last fiscal year and set underway in our recently completed Q1 should help us more effectively navigate the broader category and segment headwinds to ultimately deliver relatively stable year-over-year net sales performance in fiscal '25. Note, however, that we expect the top line performance uplift in our Wine and Spirits business to be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year, aligned with the usual seasonality of the business and as the benefits of our commercial and operational execution initiatives begin to take hold. From an operating income perspective, our Wine and Spirits business realized a decline of approximately $20 million, which in-turn resulted in a 370 basis point decrease in operating margin to 15.3%. These declines were primarily driven by unfavorable cost of goods sold, lower volumes and unfavorable product mix due to category headwinds extending into higher priced segments, which more than offset the favorable impacts of SG&A expense and favorable pricing. The unfavorable COGS relative to the net sales was primarily driven by higher grape and low end spirits costs, partially offset by cost savings realized in freight and warehousing. Our marketing expense as a percent of net sales was 10.5%. This was elevated when compared to our medium-term target due to ongoing marketing investments around some of our largest brands, particularly through tactical initiatives. SG&A as a percent of net sales was 17.5%, which was also elevated when compared to our medium-term target as benefits of our SG&A savings initiatives are expected to be realized in future quarters. As we look towards the rest of the year for our Wine and Spirits business, while we expect improvement in our performance for both operating income and operating margin, we continue to anticipate a full year 9% to 11% decline in operating income for our initial fiscal '25 guidance. Rounding out the rest of the P&L. corporate expense for the quarter was approximately $59 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of $9 million or 18%, largely driven by higher compensation and benefits, and professional fees. Interest expense for the quarter was $103 million, a 14% decrease from the prior year and our comparable effective tax rate was 18.2% compared to 20.7% for the corresponding quarter last year. Our corporate expense, interest expense and comparable effective tax rate expectations for fiscal '25 remain unchanged at $260 million, $445 million to $455 million and 18.5%, respectively. We expect a marginal increase over the coming quarters in corporate expense, mainly due to an increase in compensation and benefits and digital capabilities investments. We also expect a slight uplift in interest expense due to lower capitalized interest from our Beer business expansions beyond Q1, any minor increase in our effective tax rate due to anticipated incremental contributions from our Wine and Spirits business to our Enterprise operating income. Turning to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For the first quarter of fiscal '25, we generated free cash flow of $315 million, a 19% decrease from the prior year as capital expenditures increased 35%, primarily driven by the construction of our greenfield brewery in Veracruz. That construction is progressing as planned And similar to all of our recent expansions, we believe will enhance our production capacity, product redundancy and overall efficiency for our Beer business. We expect our new brewery to be operational towards the end of next fiscal year or in the earlier part of fiscal '27. To conclude, the excellent Enterprise results were achieved in the first quarter of fiscal '25 support our confidence and our ability to deliver on our financial and strategic objectives for the full year, as we continue to leverage our strong portfolio of brands, relentlessly pursue operational excellence and remain consistent and adhering to our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities. That said, as we always do, we will continue to closely monitor the consumer, currencies and our input costs and to take appropriate action in response to any potential volatility or macro headwinds. As always, we thank you for your continued support and interest in our company and we look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the year. With that, Bill and I will be happy to take your questions during our Q&A session. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Andrea Teixeira: Yeah. Hi, Good morning. So, Bill, Garth, you elaborated -- you commented on the continued momentum in beer and disciplined marketing efforts leading to sustainability of growth. I think, we are all hoping to hear from you a little bit of how you exit the quarter. Any June commentary so far given the state-of-the consumer, given all we are hearing from other companies and the economy in general? So if you can comment on that? And related to that, like I think we all hope that you are benefiting from all the shares and expansion in distribution? And if you can kind of tell us like a little bit of how you benefited from -- in the depletions that you just reported at 6.4%, how much you would say came from same shelf growth or how much was additional distribution? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure. Let me start with that. First of all, I think the important thing to always keep in mind is that our buy rates for our Beer business remain very strong. We saw high-single digit both at a consumer level and within the Hispanic community, with the Hispanic community being slightly higher than the total consumer. Now that doesn't mean there aren't some shift around in pack sizes and channels, but our buy rates remain extremely strong. And I think this is a consistent theme that we've said time -- frankly, time and time again, which is our Beer business has tremendous brand loyalty and therefore it continues to excel despite whatever might be going on with other beer companies or with other brands in the sector. As we noted, we had an unusually strong performance against all other CPG sectors and we're again the number one share gainer within beverage alcohol. To your point, I think the gains that we saw in shelf sets is certainly an additive factor in this. It also gives us plenty of chance to expand things like Oro, which we're very excited about for this fiscal year. So I think it's very difficult to put an exact number on the dimension of it. And I think you've seen, we've consistently delivered year after year after year on exactly what we said we would do and this quarter is no different.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Please proceed with your question.
Carlos Laboy: Yes. Hello, everyone. You've been able to sustain pretty good profit margins or pretty stable profit margins here remarkably well despite the Mexican peso having appreciated very strongly in recent years, but that seems to have turned this quarter. If you were to enter a period of pace of weakness, can you speak to the sort of flexibility that this might give you or that would enter into your pricing strategy? And look, just to be transparent, the reason I'm asking is because in the 80s and 90s, we went through periods of peso weakness and you were able to successfully close price gaps with mainstream beer and the dividends of that are still coming through today. So if you could just speak to how you're thinking about this, it would be helpful.
Bill Newlands: Yeah, Carlos. I think the results that you referenced are just an indication of how effective our hedging policies really are. We have a multi-year hedging policy which allows us to layer in incremental hedges over a multi-year period when we see moments of weakness, if you will. In Q1, we actually did see a couple of days there where there was some fairly significant movements, greater than 10%. And we took advantage of that movement with our treasury team again layering in incremental hedges, not just for this year, but also for future years as well. Just as a reminder, when we entered this fiscal year, we were about mid-70% range hedged against the peso. And as a result of these incremental hedges, we now sit at about 85% for the full-fiscal year. So again, it's a very robust practice, very methodical, disciplined and flexible approach and it certainly been paying dividends for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning. So just to follow-up on Andrea's question in terms of macros and potential impact on the Beer business, can you unpack a little more maybe what you're seeing from low versus middle versus high-end consumers in terms of demand for your Beer business? And then also just any update on on-premise channel trends and what you're seeing throughout the course of fiscal Q1 and so far this summer, just in terms of if we're seeing any big channel shifts or any types of impact on that front? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure, Dara. Let's start with the second question first. The on-premise was slightly weaker than what we might have expected. Although as you saw, we had some significant gains within our franchises, particularly Modelo, which stepped up a position versus what we had in prior years. I think some of that relates to couple of things. One is, as many people have noted, the weather scenario that existed over the course of the early part of the spring/beginning of summer, while it wasn't great, which impacts the on-premise, much like it impacts the overall business. So I think that was a bit of a play. But as we are getting into the summer months, we expected this to show some resiliency. I'd reemphasize to your question about where the consumer is at various price points -- excuse me, income points. I think yet again, this goes right back to what I said in answer to her question, which is the brand loyalty that exists with our consumers is second to none. I mean, when you look at the Hispanic consumer, which is one we watch very closely given it's more than 50% of our overall mix, that consumer buy rate was up compared to the total consumer. Again, I think that speaks very strongly to the loyalty that we see within that consumer base, irrespective of income. That in particular is a long range benefit for our business and will continue to be a long range benefit to our business given that community in many respects views beer as a stable. So again, overall, we continue to be very pleased with our buy rates. And despite gives and takes during the course of the quarter, I think it's reflected in our depletion rate of 6.4%. It's a very strong quarterly result.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Filippo Falorni: Hey. Good morning, everyone. First, just a quick follow up on Andrea's question, if you can just provide any update on just what you're seeing exiting the quarter into June. And then a bigger picture question on innovation. Last year, obviously, you had Modelo Oro, which was pretty successful and you have some runway for this year. Can you talk a bit about this year's innovation including Corona Sunbrew and the Modelo Aguas Frescas expansion and anything else we should think about in terms of innovation contribution in beer. Thank you.
Bill Newlands: You bet. And as we've said in other quarters, we're not going to give quarterly depletion guidance. But what I will say is we're very pleased with the status of the weather going into this particular quarter. And as we've always said, that's really a big factor in terms of the delivery of the business. And quite frankly, the forecast for tomorrow is terrific. So we're looking-forward to the July 4, being yet another event in a weekend and weekday in this case that we will win, much like we did on Memorial Day before it. So relative to the innovation agenda, we have expanded Modelo Aguas Frescas to 20 additional markets. As you may recall, it was test marketed last year in Las Vegas and was the number-one FMB in that particular market, had a very strong start and that variety pack is now in 20 additional markets, which covers roughly 70%, 75% of the total consumption expected for that product. So we're very excited to watch that one develop as the year goes on. Similarly, we are testing Corona Sunbrew in the Northeast just -- again just getting started and it's very early days, but we're very pleased with their response to it. And certainly, much of the consumer sampling that's been done around that product suggests that, that product is going to be a home-run for us with the consumer. So, again, both of those are too early days to really have any, what I would call, concrete results. But as we always do, those were only introduced after significant testing at a consumer level to make sure that we had the right product, the right package and the right pricing mix to give them a very high probability of success.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. So the strong start to the year on profitability would seemingly create more flexibility to hit that 10% to 12% operating profit guide for Beer for the year. Particularly there's nothing too material from a timing perspective in the quarter. So kind of what do you see as the key variables that influence the high versus the low-end of that operating profit guidance range from here? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Well, look, Lauren, we feel really good about the guidance we gave for the full-year. And obviously, we feel really good about the results that we reported today. As we gave guidance in April of this year, obviously we laid out that from a Beer perspective, we very much expected that our operating income growth would be in that 10% to 12% range and we certainly reiterated that today. That implying that our operating margins would be at about 38%. I think it's important to note that -- or 39%, I should say. I think it's important to note that we gave that guidance as it relates to the margin on an annual basis, not on a quarterly basis. So that means that we won't necessarily hit 39% or approximately 39% every quarter. Certainly, we expect that there's going to be the normal seasonality that we see every year, which means we have higher volumes in the first-half of the year and then lower volumes in the second-half of the year just due to regular seasonality, which resulted in a bit of a fixed overhead absorption drag as well as the second-half of the year is when we do most of our maintenance on our breweries. So therefore, the second half of the year will be lower from a margin perspective than the first half of the year. That being said as we've noted previously, we do expect that in Q4 that we will see some favorability on a year-over-year basis due to the lapping of the VAT write-off of last year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Nik Modi: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bill, just more of a philosophical question. I mean, the sentiment on the beer category has been pretty poor for a while now. Obviously, investors see it, but the trade talks about it as well. And obviously, your business has been very disconnected from that. So I'm just curious like as you engage with your supply chain partners, distributors, retailers, what's the conversation look like? I mean, are they coming around the fact that maybe they can't index your business relative to the beer category anymore because there's a lot of moving pieces and cross consumption? It's really about occasions versus just some holistic category. I mean, I'm just curious like what that discussion looks like right now especially as you're in the middle of shelf resets and probably discussions for what's going on in the fall and even next year?
Bill Newlands: And I'll have to start, Nik, by giving a little tip of the cap to you because you pointed out what we think is a critical point, which is this is all about brands. The reason our brands have gotten double-digit increase in their shelf position during this period of time is because of the strength of those brands and the takeaway. As we've said on prior calls, our average SKU takeaway in dollars is five times the rate of our cheap competitors. So if you're a distributor or you're a retailer, you're going to put the emphasis on where you get growth and profitability and growth in takeout and strong velocities. And our brands represent that. That's why you see Pacifico with 20% growth and being the number four share gainer. That's why you see Modelo Especial now being the number one play in off-premise dollar volume. Our brands are very strong and they stand out distinctively from other brands in the category and I think you've made that note many times and we happen to agree fully with that. Lastly, I'd say, we continue to invest in our brands. Part of what we are doing is we believe there's still significant upside on the longer-term in terms of our brands and the investment that we put behind them. Despite Modelo being number one, there's still a lot of awareness opportunity and we're planning to go get it. We feel the same way about things like Oro and Aguas Frescas and Sunbrew. We're bringing new scenarios and new occasions to more consumers. I think that all speaks to the strength of our brands. And I think whether you speak to retail or whether you speak to distributors, they're all very excited about our prospects, not only today, but for the long-term.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Bryan Spillane: Hey. Thanks, operator. Good morning, guys.
Bill Newlands: Good morning.
Bryan Spillane: I have just two questions. I guess the first one is just Garth or Bill. If you can just comment on Veracruz, I know you made a comment in the prepared remarks, but just how far along you are in the construction or do we have a foundation yet? Have we piped in water? Just some sense of kind of where you are and where that is relative to plan? And then I have a follow up.
Bill Newlands: Well, Brian, I mean, as I said in my remarks, I mean we are well on our plan. We expect to open that brewery at the end of the next fiscal year, early in the fiscal year-after that. So we're well on our way. It is why our CapEx this year is at its peak. As a reminder, we shared with everybody at Investor Day that FY '25 would be our peak in terms of CapEx as that construction is kind of at full throttle. Importantly, our -- as this is our peak year of CapEx, we do expect that by the sort of end of our medium-term outlook, meaning FY '25, we'll go from CapEx kind of in the low double-digit range of net sales to mid-single-digit range of net sales. So just important for all of you to know and appreciate that. But as it relates specifically to Veracruz, we are on-track.
Bryan Spillane: Okay, thanks. And then just a follow up on some of the earlier conversations. Bill, the stock is down today because I think there's a concern about the tough comparisons in beer, maybe a little bit of election concern because of how the stock reacted when Trump was elected in 2016. So could you just give us a first -- or a perspective on how you think about the comps? I mean, the comps were the comps when you set your plan. So it's not like they're a surprise. So if you can give us a perspective on that and whether or not people should actually even be worried about the election and who wins or loses relative to FTC? It's a different…
Bill Newlands: Yeah. Sure. I think it's always risky and we've talked to many, many times, Garth and I have about this topic about getting too excited about what happened tomorrow morning rather than looking at the longer-range picture. Year after year after year now, we've delivered against the goals that we set out and we're not varying from our expectation from this year in part because of very strong performance that we delivered in Q1. As Garth noted in his remarks, that doesn't mean there aren't times when it's a little better or a little worse or you have a little variability because you have less sell days or you have various things that go on. I think it's important to look at the bigger picture. Our brands continue to perform year after year and the runway for those brands remains extraordinarily strong. I think that's going to be a true statement no matter who's elected in November. Our brands are really focused on delivering against the consumer and that consumer is incredibly loyal, as I said just a few minutes ago. That makes a big difference irrespective of who happens to be the President of the U.S. So we're certainly -- I might add and we've said this before as well, our government affairs team works very closely, both in the United States and in Mexico on both a federal and a local level. And I think that capability is one that's also advantageous to us again irrespective of any particular party that might happen to be in office at any particular time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Grom: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. So Garth, I was hoping to get some updated perspective on just kind of the puts and takes as it relates to the beer profit outlook. Back in April, you touched on volume leverage, price/mix, cost savings being tailwinds versus commodities and FX being headwinds. I mean I'd just be curious, have your expectations for those buckets changed at all over the last few months? I totally understand you've reiterated the outlook this morning, but just have the building blocks changed at all versus your prior expectations? Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Well, thanks, Peter. I mean, I guess the shorter answer to that question is no. I mean, as I just laid out previously, we are -- we will see quarterly variability as we do every year, mostly driven due to seasonality, volume seasonality, certainly the building blocks that we laid out in detail at our April conference call, we were provided for full-year guidance, those remain where they are or what they are. As we noted a couple of times now, we are taking actions where we see that there's opportunity to take actions like making sure that we further hedge against the peso when we see weakness. But other than that, I mean, the business continues to be the business and the building block for the building blocks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Carey: Hey. Thank you very much. I'm going to follow up on Peter's question there around gross margins in beer specifically. Garth, can you maybe frame how the Q1 gross margin came in relative to your expectations on paper? It certainly looks like strong delivery specifically in the context of the rest of the year. And then just regarding the commentary around taking advantage of the weaker peso, does that give you more confidence on this fiscal year? And how much can you actually take advantage of for fiscal '26 at this point? Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah. So I would say that the gross margins kind of came in within our expectations just to give you a little bit of color around what drove that. We essentially saw about 100 basis-points of improvement in gross profit margin on a year-over-year basis. About 30% of that or 30 basis-points of that, I should say, is volume, price and mix driven. About 80 basis points are what I would just call cost of goods, logistics materials, labor, offset by depreciation and things of that nature. We got about a 20 basis points bump due to the craft divestiture and then we had about 30 basis points hit just due to the exposure against the FX that's unhedged. So that's really what the building blocks or not, the makeup of the changes. We feel really good about where we are for the balance of the year. Certainly, we continue to progress against our aggressive cost savings initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day. As I mentioned in my comments, we've already got $50 million or about $50 million in Q1 that we think is sustainable and we'll certainly continue to execute against the cost savings initiatives as we go through the balance of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on just marketing. Your outlook for marketing and advertising spend this year, it's below historical levels. And I guess there's some concern that you may be starving your brands. So could you touch on this and provide a little more color on the efficiencies you've gained and may continue to gain, how you're approaching investments this year? And I guess why you feel good about these investment levels? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Yeah. You bet, Bonnie. We're actually going to be spending more dollars this year than we have in prior years as you would expect because our brands demand it and our growth profile allows us to continue to do it. With that said, you did point out an important point is we have created some efficiencies within our spend and therefore the percentage is slightly less than we've done in prior years, purely driven by efficiency. That doesn't change the fact that we are spending more against our brands than we've ever spent and that process will continue. We strongly believe engaging our consumer with critical national media and digital advertising platforms are critically important to continue to create awareness and to bring consumers into our franchises. In fact, you're seeing spend against many of our new initiatives. You're seeing that against Sunbrew, you're seeing that against Aguas Frescas. We just kicked off our Oro spend for the year. We are very strongly supportive as we have been for many, many years against our brands and that process will continue.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah. And if you don't mind me, Bill, I'll explain a little bit more. I mean, we've said this publicly multiple times now. We will continue to invest in the growth of our business, both in marketing just like we did, just like we do with the investments we're making in our brewery capacity. We will not starve our brands for marketing in order to hit a margin profile. Instead, we will continue to invest for growth.
Bill Newlands: So since we're piling on, Garth, do you mind if I pile on too?
Garth Hankinson: Yeah.
Bill Newlands: One of the reasons why we saw the improvement in the Modelo penetration and the double-digit growth in Modelo's business in the quarter is exactly what we're just talking about, which is we spend against our business. That's why Modelo in 10 years has gone from a tiny little brand to the number-one brand by dollars in the United States.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.
Nadine Sarwat: Hi. Thank you. I want to come back to the November election. So former President Trump has mentioned the potential of a 10% universal baseline tariff should he win. Given your Mexican import beer business, how do you think that potential scenario would play out for Constellation? And how would you add color on the risk that it would place? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: I think it's too early to speculate on what may or may not happen in November. Quite frankly, our business performed just great during the last Trump administration and I would expect that we would perform extraordinarily well in a new administration, irrespective of who might be at the helm of that administration. I think it's important to recognize. Our business includes inputs from -- heavy inputs from the upper Midwest in the United States as an integral part of what our overall package of inputs are in our business. Admittedly, there's a lot of flow, our biggest trading partner in this country is Mexico and I think that's likely to continue. And we're sure we'll be able to navigate anything that might occur just fine and we'll work aggressively to do just that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Rob Ottenstein: Great. Two questions. One, terrific quarter, reiterated the guidance, a lot of confidence, stock down. Love to get your -- kind of renew your kind of your thoughts on share buybacks here with the stock, really not much higher than it was in 2018 which has got to be a huge disappointment to you, your management team and the Board and myself frankly since we've been recommending it. So that's question number one. And then question number two, I'd love to get your thoughts on just the beer industry overall, how it's been developing. And there was an earlier question, I think, on how you did in June. I'm not sure you answered that. If you're not comfortable talking about your performance in June, maybe the industry overall in June, whether it looked better sequentially than in May? Thank you.
Garth Hankinson: Thanks, Rob. Hey, just in terms of the share buybacks, I mean, I think as Bill alluded to in his opening remarks, in Q1, we continued to make and show the same progress that we have over the last five years in terms of all of our capital allocation priorities that included our share buybacks. As Bill noted, we bought back $200 million worth of shares in the first-quarter. And then through the end of June, I bought back an additional $40 million plus. So we've continued to do what we said we would do. As we've come -- as we've come out of the Q1, we still have about $2.4 billion, $2.6 billion left on our share reauthorization and we will continue to use the same discipline that we have exercised over the last several years and by when we see periods of dislocation.
Bill Newlands: And relative to your question about the overall beer category, certainly, it appears that there's been some positive momentum as we've come out of June. I think a lot of that relates to the development of the summer. We're heading into the peak summer selling season, which we're always excited to see given we tend to win all of the major holidays during those seasons and would expect to do so tomorrow as well. But certainly, it looks like there's been some improvement. I think a lot of that, we've covered this and you hate to note this too often, but the reality is there were a lot of sort of bad weather moments at key times around weekends and holidays over the first part of this calendar year, which certainly hasn't been beneficial for the category overall. But I got to go right back to what I said a couple of times already today, which is our brands have outperformed this category for a long, long-time and we expect that to continue because of the strong brand loyalty that we have amongst our consumers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Moskow: Hi. Thanks for the question. I guess I'll ask about wine. The guidance for the year implies a pretty substantial pickup in sales growth, I guess, in the second-half. What kind of visibility do you have with your distributors on how the commercial turnaround is going? Are they making bigger commitments about what they're willing to take on? And because it does it does imply a pretty steep ramp. Thanks. We already always said, especially after our prior quarter, that we were going to take nine to 12 months-to get our wine business back into the position that we expected to do.
Bill Newlands: We're pleased with what the work that's been done. I think we're ahead of schedule on some of the operational points that we expect recognizing they're likely to be second-half loaded because once you put into work, you have to wait to get the results out of them. Second, I think we've seen some significant improvement in our engagement, particularly with our wholesale network. And we believe that's going to create good opportunity in the back-half of this year. Some of the re-expression of our marketing dollars that we have put in-place, you saw some of that play-out in that -- in terms of the early spend in this quarter are already showing some positive signs and we'll look-forward to reporting on those as we go-forward. But certainly, we expect the improvement in this business to be back-half loaded as we've said now a couple of times. I think the other thing to also recognize, both our international business and our DTC business are performing ahead of what we had planned. The place where we're still spending a lot of time and energy is on the wholesale portion, but we're working very closely with our key wholesale partners to deliver against those expectations. And I think fortunately, we are all on the same page about what needs to be done and what delivery we expect against that business as we progress through the year.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Bill Newlands for closing remarks.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Darryl, and thank you all again for joining today's call. We're certainly off to a solid start in fiscal '25 and clearly today brings a great buying opportunity for our stock. Our beer business continues to deliver excellent top-line performance underpinned by leading volume growth while achieving solid margin expansion through our cost-savings and operational efficiency initiatives. While our Wine and Spirits business continues to face challenging market dynamics, it is making progress on commercial and operational execution initiatives expected to drive improved performance. Altogether, at an enterprise level, we continue to significantly outperform the entire CPG sector with our strong volume-driven growth and we remain confident in our momentum and our outlook for the full-year, including delivery of our double-digit comparable EPS growth. And with that, I wish you all a happy 4th of July holiday and certainly hope that you contribute to our outstanding performance that we expect to have during this critical holiday period. Thank you all for joining the call and have a good summer.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-04-11 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Constellation Brands' Fiscal Year 2024 Fourth Quarter Full Year Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Snehal Shah, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Shah, you may now begin.
Snehal Shah: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, all, and welcome to Constellation Brands' Year End Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO, and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in today's news release or otherwise available on the Company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please note, when we discuss comparable earnings per share figures for fiscal 2024 and prior fiscal years, we are referring to earnings per share on a comparable basis excluding Canopy equity and earnings, unless otherwise noted. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Following the call, we will also be making available in the Investors section of our Company's website a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time today. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thanks, Snehal, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fiscal '24 year-end earnings call. As usual, I'd like to start with a few headlines from this past fiscal year. First, I'm pleased to report that we delivered another year of strong performance in fiscal '24. We drove comparable earnings per share growth of nearly 9% and remain focused on achieving our stated medium-term target of low-double-digit comparable EPS growth moving forward. This growth was supported by a net sales increase of 5% at an enterprise level and solid operating leverage that resulted in an increase of 7% in comparable operating income, representing an enterprise comparable operating margin of nearly 33%. This performance once again yielded recognition for Constellation Brands as the number one growth leader among large CPG companies by Circana in calendar year '23, as we have been five of the last seven years. We are the only CPG company of scale to make their top 10 ranking for 11 consecutive years. Our continued strong performance and momentum heading into fiscal '25 reinforces our confidence and our ability to deliver against the following targets outlined at our Investor Day this past November, maintaining 6% to 8% enterprise net sales growth, delivering 33% to 35% enterprise comparable operating income margin and generating low-double-digit comparable earnings per share growth, all of which we intend to achieve in fiscal '25. Second, from a segment perspective, our fiscal '24 results were largely driven by our Beer Business, which delivered net sales and operating income growth above 9% and 8%, respectively, both exceeding our expectations from the beginning of the year. This strong performance drove our largest dollar share gain ever for a full fiscal year, adding an impressive two points of dollar share within the US beer category. And we achieved a significant milestone this year, as Modelo Especial became the number one beer in US dollar sales. Furthermore, across all beverage alcohol, our Beer Business was the number one dollar share gainer, capturing 1.1 points of share and driving nearly 70% of the total dollar growth in the sector. This was truly a remarkable achievement by our entire beer team working in concert with our distributor and retail partners as they delivered volume growth for the 14th consecutive year, which is certainly another incredible differentiator amongst CPG companies. In our Wine & Spirits business, we faced a series of near-term category headwinds throughout fiscal '24, but remain confident that our strategy is sound. We recently promoted Sam Glaetzer to serve as our new President of Wine & Spirits. He is a well-rounded and accomplished industry veteran with nearly 30 years of experience in the wine and spirits category and a successful track record of driving commercial and operational efficiency and effectiveness. Sam also played an integral role in the implementation of the business transformation over the last few years, leading our global end-to-end supply chain optimization initiatives and building a world-class farming, winemaking, and distilling network aligned to consumer preferences while developing a focused international route to market to deliver incremental growth for the business in the medium-term. Now that the strategic transformation of our Wine & Spirits portfolio is largely complete, Sam is well-positioned to lead our team in driving enhanced focus on execution and the delivery of growth and improved profitability. To that end, our Wine & Spirits team has identified several immediate actions to help drive improvement in our year-over-year top line performance, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. Third, we continued to achieve superior cash flow generation and deployed that cash in a disciplined and balanced manner underpinned by our consistent capital allocation priorities. For fiscal '24, we generated $2.8 billion in operating cash flow and we're able to reduce our net leverage ratio by nearly half a point while returning over $900 million back to our shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. We also continued to prudently invest to support the ongoing growth with total capital expenditures of nearly $1.3 billion in fiscal '24, most of which was focused on capacity additions to our beer brewing operations. And fourth, we continued to deliver against our environmental, social, and governance objectives, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. With that as a backdrop, let's turn to a more detailed discussion of our fiscal '24 performance, starting with our Beer Business, which despite some challenging weather in our fourth quarter, grew depletions by 9%, resulting in our 56th consecutive quarter of depletion's growth. For the full year, we continue to extend our lead as the number one high-end beer supplier in the US, delivering top share gains across the total beer category, underpinned by a nearly 14% increase in dollar sales and nearly 11% volume growth across tracked channels. And in line with our expectations, we captured low-double-digit percent incremental shelf space this spring while adding another 21,000 resets through our Shopper-First Shelf program in fiscal '24. These factors all played a significant role in driving the growth of our Beer Business paired with the strength of our portfolio's iconic brands, starting with Modelo Especial, which grew depletions by nearly 10% and maintained its leading position as the top share gainer, and as noted earlier, the number one overall beer brand in US tracked channels. Corona Extra increased depletions nearly 1% and maintained its position as the number three high-end beer brand in the US. And Pacifico delivered depletion growth over 17% as it reached the 20 million case sold milestone and remained a top 10 dollar share gainer across the total beer category and the number four dollar share gainer in the high-end. While we continue to build on the success of our iconic brands, we are also building good traction with our focused innovations aligned with consumer-led trends of premiumization, flavor and betterment. Our Modelo Chelada brands delivered an increase of 30% in depletions, also surpassing 20 million cases sold, and remain the number one Chelada in the category, supported by the launch of our new flavor, Sandia Picante, and new pack-size offerings. We are excited to continue to build on that momentum in fiscal '25 with two new flavors, Fresa Picante and Negra con Chile. Modelo Oro's national launch established a strong foundation for the brand as it rose to become a top five share gainer across the total beer category and the number three share gainer in the high-end with just two SKUs. Given that strong reception and ongoing consumer demand for betterment products, we are launching two more Modelo Oro SKUs in fiscal '25, an 18-pack and a 24-pack. Staying within the Modelo brand family, our new Aguas Frescas variety pack secured the number one new FMB spot in its test market of Nevada. So on fiscal '25, we will be expanding its rollout to another 20 markets for this authentic liquid aligned with consumer-led flavor trends and featuring our nitro technology. In our Corona brand family, we introduced Corona Non-Alcoholic, which is the leading dollar share gainer in the fast-growing non-alcoholic beer segment. As for fiscal '25, we are testing Corona Sunbrew in select Eastern markets. This new, refreshing beer is brewed with real citrus peels and a splash of real citrus juice. The strong execution of our Beer Business in fiscal '24 was also reflected in our ability to maintain best-in-class margins by combating trailing inflation headwinds with cost savings and efficiency initiatives. We also continue to invest in our Beer Business in fiscal '24, deploying approximately $950 million in capital expenditures, supporting our ability to meet the continued robust demand we see for our brands through the expansion of our beer brewing capacity at Nava and Obregon, and the ongoing work at our new Veracruz site. Looking ahead to fiscal '25 and in line with the plan we laid out in our Investor Day in November, we expect our Beer Business to remain within our net sales growth algorithm of 7% to 9% and for operating margins to gradually improve, supported by our operating income growth of 10% to 12%. Moving on to Wine & Spirits. Due largely to the challenging market dynamics referenced earlier, our Wine & Spirits business saw declines of approximately 8% for both organic net sales and operating income, but still landed within our revised guidance range. While we do not expect ongoing challenges in the Wine & Spirits category to immediately subside, particularly in the mainstream and premium price segments. We have identified several areas to improve the performance of our Wine & Spirits business in fiscal '25, including, but not limited to, refocusing our efforts within our premium and above brands to more consistently drive growth in our most scaled and central offerings, notably Kim Crawford, Meiomi, The Prisoner, High West, and Mi CAMPO, while accelerating additional tactical investments to revitalize the equity and support demand for our largest mainstream brand, Woodridge, and ensuring that we continue to support the transformation of other significant brands in our portfolio such as SVEDKA then by Robert Mondavi, Ruffino, and Lumina. Note that these 11 brands represent three-quarters of net sales and over 80% of volumes for our Wine & Spirits business in fiscal '24, which is why we plan to provide more focus and investment for them. Another key area we are focused on is aligning with our US wholesale distributor partners on clear priorities to help enhance our performance in our largest markets and channels. As noted in our prior call, these priorities include enhanced focus on improving mix, inventory, and sales execution. We will also be making additional investments in media spend and price promotions, as well as adjustments in our own sales capabilities to better support the execution and go-to-market efforts of our distributor partners. And similar to our Beer Business, we will continue to focus more broadly on efficiency opportunities to drive operational and sales excellence across our Wine & Spirits segment. This will include the operational and supply chain initiatives highlighted at our Investor Day, as well as enhancements to the business' organizational structure to enable a more effective and competitive operating model. Looking forward to fiscal '25, we expect our Wine & Spirits business net sales to be relatively stable and operating income to be down 9% to 11%. While we believe the focus on sales execution I just outlined will help stabilize the top line growth for Wine & Spirits, our operating income guidance reflects incremental investments in additional media spend, price promotions, and sales capabilities, as well as continued inflationary pressures on some cost of goods sold and lapping of distributor contractual payments and reduced incentive compensation that occurred in fiscal '24. As we noted, we remain committed to continuing to advance this business over the coming years toward the medium-term targets shared at our Investor Day. Moving on to capital allocation, we continue to deliver against our stated priorities and targets in fiscal '24. As noted earlier, we further strengthened our balance sheet with a reduction in our net leverage ratio supported by our strong earnings performance and our disciplined debt management. We returned cash to shareholders and deployed most of our capital investments to brewery expansions to support the growth of our Beer Business. And we continued to conduct tuck-in gap-filling acquisitions that are aligned with consumer-led trends and complemented our portfolio. We also made notable progress in regards to our environmental, social, and governance ambitions in fiscal '24. From a governance perspective, our Board undertook refreshment actions that resulted in the appointment of two new independent directors, each with strong financial backgrounds. We also recently announced the election of a new independent Board Chair, Chris Baldwin, who brings a wealth of senior leadership experience from the CPG sector. In addition, in line with our commitment to be good stewards of the environment, since we had surpassed our initial water restoration target in fiscal '23, we established a new goal of restoring more than 5 billion gallons of water to key watersheds near our operations between the timeframe covering fiscal '23 and '25. This goal is designed to ensure local residents and businesses have ample supply and access to water, which is the key to building sustainable and thriving communities. Finally, we announced two new environmental commitments in fiscal '24 to reduce waste within our key operating facilities and to enhance circular packaging. So in summary, we, once again, achieved another strong year of performance and significant progress across our strategic initiatives in fiscal '24, and we fully expect to build on this momentum in fiscal '25. We are confident in our ability to continue to create shareholder value and deliver on our commitments, including achieving low-double-digit comparable EPS growth by generating high-single-digit net sales growth and delivering best-in-class margins for our Beer Business, managing category challenges and improving the growth trajectory of our Wine & Spirits business with enhanced execution, and maintaining our capital allocation discipline and commitment to operate in a way that is good for business and good for the world. As I wrap up, I want to once again thank all of our colleagues across Constellation, as well as our trade partners, for their hard work and dedication in helping us deliver another year of industry-leading performance. And I believe we are well-positioned to keep that momentum going in fiscal '25. And with that, I will turn the call over to Garth, who will give more details on our financial results and outlook.
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As usual, my discussion will focus mainly on our comparable P&L results, starting at an enterprise level followed by business segment detail for fiscal '24. I will then discuss our fiscal '25 outlook and expectations in the same manner. Starting with net sales. As an enterprise, we delivered growth of over 5%, slightly exceeding our fiscal '24 guidance range of 4% to 5%. This was driven by the strong performance of our Beer Business, which grew net sales over 9%, exceeding our guidance of 8% to 9%. As Bill mentioned, our Beer Business had another strong year of depletion growth, a 7.5% increase as the strength of our portfolio carried throughout the entire year. Off-premise depletions grew by over 8%, which represent nearly 89% of our total depletion volume. The on-premise accounts for the balance of our depletions and grew by over 1%. We expect to build on our momentum in off-premise channels supported by the low-double-digit incremental shelf space that we captured this spring, which we foreshadow at our Investor Day last November. And we continue to see opportunity to drive growth in the on-premise with new draft handles, particularly for Modelo Especial and Pacifico in the coming fiscal year. I will elaborate on fiscal '25 shortly. Shipment volumes for our Beer Business in fiscal '24 grew 7.4% and we achieved favorable pricing of 2%. These volume and pricing increases were partially offset by the divestiture of our craft beer business and an unfavorable shift in product mix. In aggregate, the volume, price and mix changes amounted to a nearly $700 million increase in beer net sales for fiscal '24. In regards to selling days, we had one extra sell day in the year, which occurred in Q4. This had a minimal impact on our volumes as shipments and depletions, on an absolute basis, were over 99% aligned for the year. For our Wine & Spirits business, net sales declined 9% and 8% on a reported and organic basis, respectively. The change in organic net sales for our Wine & Spirits business was within our lowered guidance range of a 7% to 9% decline. This decline was largely driven by unfavorable US wholesale performance, particularly across our mainstream and premium brands. As Bill noted, we are working with our US wholesale distributor partners to enhance performance in our largest markets and channels in fiscal '25. Additionally, in our international markets, net sales for fiscal '24 were down 7% by destocking, particularly in Canada, our largest export market. More recently, in Q4, net sales from our international markets grew 14%, largely driven by the Canadian market, where inventory levels have begun to normalize. The net sales declines in our US wholesale and international markets were partially offset by 10% net sales growth in our direct-to-consumer channel. Moving on to our operating income and margin. At an enterprise-wide level, we delivered a 7% increase in comparable operating income at the upper end of our 6% to 7% guidance, resulting in a 50-basis-point increase in comparable operating margin to 32.6%. This was driven by the strong performance of our Beer Business, which grew operating income by just over 8% and delivered an operating margin of 37.9%. Enterprise-wide operating margins also benefited from an 11% reduction or $30 million decrease in corporate expense driven mainly by reduced third-party consulting fees related to our DBA project spend. This solid performance was partially offset by our Wine & Spirits results as operating income excluding the gross profit, less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following their divestiture declined by 8%. This decline was within our lowered guidance range of a 6% to 8% decline, resulting in a flat year-over-year operating margin of 22.2%. Elaborating on the margin puts and takes in more detail, starting with the Beer Business. The increase in operating income and slight 40 basis point decrease in operating margin were reflective of an absolute increase of approximately 12% in overall cost. This increase in COGS includes the impact of increased volume and the nearly $205 million from cost savings initiatives realized in fiscal '24. By COGS component and on an absolute basis, inclusive of both volume growth and cost savings, year-over-year changes were as follows. Raw materials and packaging represented the midpoint of 55% to 60% of total COGS and had an absolute increase of 16%. Logistics making up just over 20% of total COGS increased 3% as a large portion of the benefits from our cost savings agenda came from this area. Labor and overhead landed at just under 15% of total COGS and increased 19% attributable to the construction activities at our Veracruz Brewery. And the remaining portion of total COGS depreciation increased approximately $37 million, representing the incremental capacity that was brought online in fiscal '24. Moving on to marketing. Our dollar spend increased by approximately 2% year-over-year. As a percent of fiscal '24 net sales, marketing was approximately 8.5%, coming in slightly below our medium-term 9% algorithm, partly driven by the divestiture of our craft beer brands and efficiencies from the transition to our new media agency. Lastly, SG&A, which represented approximately 5% of net sales, increased approximately 8%, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and increased compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by benefits from the craft beer divestiture and lower legal fees. Moving on. Our Wine & Spirits business operating income margin, excluding the gross profit, less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following last year's divestiture, remained flat year-over-year as the volume decline and unfavorable channel mix were offset by favorability in our COGS driven by nearly $40 million coming from our cost savings initiatives, favorable pricing, reduced other SG&A expenses, and a reduction in marketing expense. Interest expense for fiscal '24 was about $435 million, a 9% increase from prior year driven by higher average borrowings and weighted average interest rates. We ended fiscal '24 with a comparable net leverage ratio, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, of 3.2 times, leaving us well-positioned to achieve our target of approximately three times in fiscal '25. Our comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings was 18.5% versus 19.2% last year. Comparable EPS for fiscal '24, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, grew nearly 9% year-over-year to $12.38 and came in above our guidance range of $12 to $12.20. Moving to fiscal '24 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow slightly over $1.5 billion, exceeding our $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion guidance range. Free cash flow decreased 12% year-over-year, driven by a 23% increase in CapEx investments attributable to our expansions at our existing facilities and the ongoing construction of our new brewery in Veracruz. In fiscal '24, we increased our total nominal capacity from our Mexico brewery operations from 42 million hectoliters to approximately 48 million hectoliters as a result of the modular expansions brought online over the summer that were fully ramped by year end, along with unlocked incremental capacity through our optimization initiatives. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we, once again, delivered cash returns to our shareholders with over $900 million of expenditures in dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we executed portfolio gap-filling transactions encompassing both a tuck-in acquisition of a female- and Black-founded luxury wine brand with a successful track record and a venture investment in the high-growth non-alcoholic space in fiscal '24. With that, let me now step through our outlook for fiscal '25, starting with net sales. We are targeting our enterprise-wide net sales to grow up 6% to 7%, inclusive of a 7% to 9% growth target for our Beer Business, and a 0.5% decline to 0.5% growth in net sales for our Wine & Spirits business. The beer top line outlook is expected to be primarily achieved by continued strong volume growth of our portfolio. Again, we expect this to come from distribution of our largest brands bolstered by spring shelf reset gains, the health and continued support of our consumers, and innovation in the form of brand extensions, new to world products, and new pack sizes. Regarding beer volumes, we anticipate fiscal '25 shipments and depletions to track closely on an absolute basis, consistent with prior years. Similarly, we expect the cadence of our shipments and depletions, in terms of share of annual volumes from a quarter and a half year perspective to be fairly in line with fiscal '24. For Wine & Spirits net sales, we expect to largely offset ongoing category headwinds as we drive the sales and marketing execution initiatives described by Bill earlier. Additionally, we expect mix-related benefits due to the better performance in our higher-end brands. That said, we continue to anticipate overall volume growth to remain challenged, particularly due to demand headwinds in the mainstream and premium price segments, which account for a major part of our volumes. Furthermore, from a net sales perspective, we're expecting unfavorable lapping of bulk sales in fiscal '24. From a cadence perspective, we also expect quarterly and half yearly shipments and depletion shares of the full year total to be fairly aligned with fiscal '24. For fiscal '25 operating income, we expect comparable enterprise-wide growth between 8% and 10%, reflecting 10% to 12% operating income growth for our Beer Business, a 9% to 11% operating income decline for our Wine & Spirits business, and a slight increase in corporate expense to approximately $260 million. For our Beer Business, we anticipate operating income tailwinds from volume growth and favorable pricing. We expect these tailwinds will be partially offset by continued input cost inflation with an absolute increase in COGS, inclusive of volume growth, cost savings initiatives, and our multi-year hedging actions in the high-single-digits. We expect the following percent of total COGS and absolute increases across each component, for packaging and raw materials to account for 55% to 60% and increase mid to high-single-digits. Logistics to make up approximately 20% and increase mid-single-digits. Labor and overhead to be approximately 15% and increase in the high teens, primarily driven by merit salary increases, given the strong operational performance from the business and incremental headcount, primarily at our Veracruz Brewery, as we continue with construction. And the remainder of COGS depreciation with a mid-single-digit increase, which approximately equates to a $20 million step-up, which is slightly lower than recent years, given prior depreciation of the packaging line of the ABA facility that was operational throughout all of fiscal '24. Outside of COGS, we expect marketing expense as a percent of net sales to be approximately 8.5%, which is lower than our unchanged medium-term algorithm of 9%. The change of marketing expense as a percent of net sales for fiscal '25 is driven by a shift in our marketing investment allocation with an overall focus on maximizing value. The investment shift is geared towards prioritizing our largest brands to support their continued momentum, followed by our high growth potential Next Wave brands and then thoughtful and deliberate investments to support our innovation pipeline and savings driven by efficiencies from our new media agency partnership announced in Q3 of fiscal '24. Rounding out beer operating margin drivers, we anticipate SG&A as a percent of net sales to be approximately 5%, in line with the medium-term algorithm we provided during our Investor Day. All in, this implies beer operating margins of approximately 39% as our Beer Business continues to generate best-in-class operating margins and year-over-year improvement as we close in on our medium-term targets. For our Wine & Spirits business operating income, we anticipate an overall COGS increase of mid to high-single-digits driven by less favorable fixed cost absorption as a result of lower volumes and higher seller overhead and blend costs, partially offset by favorability in logistics and packaging costs as part of our cost savings initiatives. For marketing and other SG&A expense as a percent of net sales, we anticipate 9% and 10%, respectively, each slightly above our medium-term outlook driven by the adjustments to our marketing, pricing, and sales investments to drive top line growth and partially offset by organizational structure changes, both points previously referenced by Bill. In addition, we expect to face headwinds from unfavorable lapping of contractual distributor payments and lower compensation and benefits in FY'24. That said, this implies Wine & Spirits operating margins to contract to approximately 20% in fiscal '25 as we continue to navigate category headwinds and reset investments in certain marketing and sales activities. We believe our enhanced focus on execution and planned cost savings can provide margin improvement over the medium-term toward the targets outlined at our Investor Day in November. Corporate expense is anticipated to increase slightly as we continue to invest in the business while reducing third-party fees more broadly. We expect interest expense to be approximately $445 million to $455 million driven by higher weighted average interest rates, and we expect our comparable effective tax rate to remain unchanged coming in at approximately 18.5%. We expect non-controlling interest to be about $35 million and anticipated weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal '25 to be around 183 million, inclusive of share repurchase activity. Based on these assumptions, we expect our reported EPS to be between $13.40 and $13.70 and our comparable EPS to be between $13.50 and $13.80, representing a 10% midpoint increase year-over-year. From a cash flow perspective, we expect our free cash flow in fiscal '25 to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, reflective of $2.8 billion to $3 billion of operating cash flow net of CapEx spend of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the expansions of our existing breweries and the ongoing construction in Veracruz. We anticipate approximately $3 billion of remaining CapEx spend from fiscal '25 to fiscal '28, with fiscal '25 expected to be the peak spend year as we progress with the construction of our greenfield site in Veracruz. And consistent with our Investor Day messaging, we expect a step-up in free cash flow that should yield cumulatively between $7 billion to $9 billion from fiscal '26 to fiscal '28. To conclude, we ended fiscal '24 with strong results, driven by continued outstanding growth in our Beer Business, as its core brands reach new milestones in cases sold and market share. Our Wine & Spirits business faced difficult marketing conditions in FY'24, but we've identified key actions to improve execution and performance. As we look ahead to fiscal '25, we are confident that we can deliver against our plan with strong enterprise results aligned with our medium-term targets, execute our capital allocation priorities and seek to create value for our shareholders. We thank you for your ongoing support throughout fiscal '24 and look forward to updating you on our progress and success in fiscal '25. With that, Bill and I are happy to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question today comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Hi, questioner. So we lost that questioner. Moving on to our next questioner is coming from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Nik Modi: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just two quick ones for me. Just been getting a lot of questions about gross margin and wanted to get any perspective on if there's any one-time issues that might have affected the gross margin this quarter for beer. And then the second part of that is just when you think about the shipments this quarter, can you give us any context on how much might have been attributable to some, whether it be the Aguas Frescas launch into wholesale or preparing for some of the shelf resets that would be helpful. Thank you.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, Nick, I'll try to address both of those. First on the gross margins, as we laid out in our press release, we did have a bit of a write-off of a bad accrual as it relates to bad receivables in Q4. That impacted our Q4 operating margin by about 100 basis points. Obviously, that would have hit gross margin as well, and that impacted the full year by about 30 basis points, again, at the operating profit margin. As it relates to Q4 impact of Aguas Frescas' launch, very, very minimal impact, really just the strength of the portfolio more broadly is what drove Q4.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. Second attempt. Can you hear me?
Bill Newlands: Second time is the charm, Dara.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay, great. So I wanted to touch on beer depletions, the nearest 7% result in the quarter, ex the extra day. It's a pretty solid result considering the weather. Can you just give us any sense for momentum so far in March and April when the weather normalized or maybe how big a drag January was in Q4? Just give us sort of a sense of underlying trends. And just on market share, you mentioned the shelf space gains being disproportionate this year, post-Bud Light struggles. How much of a positive impact are you expecting from that, and can you juxtapose that versus the risk that Bud Light trends get better, and you see some direct impact on your brands from that? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure. We obviously take into account our March results with our overall expectations for the year. But I'd say, March was very consistent with what our expectations were. Everyone should keep in mind that March has two less selling days, April has two more. So we internally look at it as sort of the combo plan of those two months. With that said, we had a very comfortably strong March as we expected that we would, and think it's setting us off on a really solid year, as we said, consistent with what we said at the Investor Day in New York. As we also noted in my script, we had low-double-digit growth in our shelf sets here in the spring, greater than our growth algorithm, which is what we expected. And certainly, that's going to be one of the added values in our delivery of the total year. But as we've said, and as all of you know, incremental space, by and large, is not at the same velocity as what you have from existing velocity, because it's marginal returns. With that said, we're very pleased with the increase in our shelf position. We've said for many years, our brands really deserve it. They've averaged over $50 million per SKU in dollar return, and it certainly is reflective of what I'm sure all retailers are seeing and that our brands are driving the growth in the category.
Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Bryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, Garth. Good morning, Bill. So I guess, just stepping back, we had this question a couple of times this morning, and maybe the underlying question is just at an enterprise level we get back to being basically on algorithm for the year, but in a year where wine and spirits underdelivers beer, at least in terms of growth rate on operating profit, maybe a little faster than normal, a little help from below-the-line on interest expense. So just is it a coincidence, right, that basically there can be a hole with wine and spirits underdelivering, but there were other offsets? Or was this more a function of you all maybe making some adjustments to get to that place, whether it's pulling some savings forward or using some tax credits? I think people are just trying to understand how much manipulation or how much work you had to do to sort of make up the difference or whether this was just a coincidence.
Bill Newlands: No, Bryan, we don't play with the numbers. The numbers reflected very strong results in our Beer Business. As we've said, we've had some challenges in our Wine & Spirits business. As you know, we just installed a new President of our Wine & Spirits business whose focus will be on execution. We have a number of things in this coming year that will cause it to be a bit of a reset year at the bottom line because we're lapping a number of one-time issues, but that isn't going to stop us from delivering on the enterprise-wide results that we committed to in New York and that we are reiterating today. We expect to continue to show best-of-class results. As you heard in my remarks, last year, we again were the number one growth company in Circana large companies as we have been five of the last seven years, and that is what's really driving the success of our business, not anything else.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Sorry. Good morning. I was just curious, you gave a lot of help and color on the Wine & Spirits, but I was just curious and we've heard in the industry more about, you spoke last quarter about promotional pressures, other manufacturers have talked about retailer destocking, seeing more inventory management at the distributor level. Just curious to hear your take on kind of the promotional environment and kind of state of the union on inventory levels within the system, knowing it's tough to have visibility within three-tier, but just curious your view on inventory in the system online?
Bill Newlands: Yeah, you bet. We did see some inventory reduction this past fiscal year, particularly in Canada. There was quite a bit of inventory realignment in Canada, and certainly there has been some that we've seen in the US as well. The thing that I think is important for us to continue to focus on is we've made a number of changes. We're going to focus on those 11 brands that are really the biggest drivers of our success. That's a bit of a change. Frankly, we've probably peanut buttered our efforts a little too broadly in the past, and we're going to focus on those brands that we believe have real growth potential for the long term. We're also going to do a bit more promotional spend than we have in the past, particularly on brands like Woodbridge, where that's an important part of the consumer dynamic. A lot of work and research has been done in the last few months to make sure that we understand all the consumer dynamics around our critical brands and we will execute against those dynamics in this coming year. And I think that's reflective of an improved top line that you see this year, acknowledging there'll be a bit of a reset at the bottom line.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Carey: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So Garth, thank you for all the perspective on expectations around beer margins for the full year. Can you just perhaps expand a little bit on what specifically is driving the commodity input inflation, number one? And then secondly, if I put all this together, it does feel like maybe there's a little bit of top line leverage you're expecting or you need a little bit more savings on the G&A line to get to the low-double-digit number for the full year in the division. So maybe just help provide any context on that. So thanks on the commodities and maybe just some of the assumptions on how you're getting to the operating profit number for the full year. Thanks so much.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, so just as it relates to margins for beer I think that, first of all, I think we have to acknowledge that if you look at the past two years, and you look at the disruptions we saw to global supply chains and then the elevated inflation environment that we've been dealing with, that the improved margins, starting in the back half of our fiscal '24, and then moving forward with significant margin expansion in FY'25 to get near the low-end of our target range I think that that's no small feat. As we look forward to FY'25, we're going to face similar tailwinds and headwinds that we have for the last several years. The tailwinds, again, will be volumetric growth given the strength of our brands, as well as our typical pricing algorithm. Some of the issues that we'll face or headwinds that we'll face is that while commodity prices have certainly abated from their highs, they're certainly sort of higher still than their historical norms or near-term historical norms. And there have been a couple of commodities that have been a bit resilient in their strength, if you will, or haven't come down nearly as much as we would have hoped. So we still face those. In addition, we have the strength of the peso, which is something that we're going to continue to manage through. Fortunately, we're hedged as we enter the year against the peso at about 80%, so we're going to manage that effectively. And as you've heard us talk about extensively, both on this call and Investor Day, we have this year, as well as have had last year, an aggressive set of cost savings initiatives that will help benefit the business. So all in, I mean, we think that there's fairly significant margin expansion here, margin growth, in FY'25 as we move towards getting closer to our mid-term growth algorithm or mid-term margin algorithm.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hi. Just one quick follow-up on the shelf space question. You've gained a lot of shelf space already. Can you maybe just give a sense of how much incremental space do you expect as we think about this spring? And then secondly, it looks like the strategic or I guess the evaluation on Wine & Spirits is complete. To what degree did you consider divestments as part of it, either for pieces of that business or maybe even for the whole thing? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure. As I stated, Kaumil, on our -- in my primary remarks, well, low-double-digit shelf space is what we expected to get, and that's in fact what we are getting in spring resets. Obviously, it varies all over the map depending, but that's roughly what the total number is in the aggregate. And again, that's at least as much as we expected. We're very pleased with where that landed. Relative to the Wine & Spirits business, we've made this comment a number of times. The person that drinks across all three categories, beer, wine, and spirits, spends six times as much as an individual that drinks only in one of those three categories. Therefore, we continue to feel that that's important, that we are accessing significant additional consumer occasions and consumer spending by being able to play in all three of those categories.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Nadine Sarwat: Thank you. Two interrelated questions from me. First, you obviously posted very robust beer volume growth this quarter. What are you seeing in terms of the health of the US consumer today? Any signs of the downtrading or shift in behavior? And then a second question also on the consumer. Some of your industry peers have highlighted dry January being more meaningful headwind this year. Other commentators are calling out different drinking patterns amongst younger legal drinking-age consumers. So I'd be really curious to hear what you are observing when it comes to these trends. Any changes in behavior from the consumer? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure, Nadine. We're very pleased with the health of our consumer. We've said many, many times, the brand loyalty that we have within our franchise is superb. And I think that's really important. I think when you put that together with the fact that, and Garth has mentioned this on a number of occasions, we've been judicious in our pricing strategy over the last few years, which is a little bit different from what some other people have done in CPG industries, but we think that's important to maintain that consumer base given the very strong loyalty that we have within our franchises. It's also important to note that the high-end, which is the only place where we compete in beer, continues to see an increase in buy rate. So that, again, speaks to the fact that the consumer continues to premiumize and we're in the perfect position to take advantage of that particular point. Relative to any consumer changes in January and so on, one of the things that we've noted a couple of times is betterment. We've done a number of things in our wine business to bring out light or lighter products like Illuminate and Kim Crawford and Bright in Meiomi. Similarly, our Corona Non-Alcoholic had a great start. It was the number one share gainer in the non-alcoholic segment and I think that does reflect some change in consumer behavior or people that are concerned about being the designated driver, but still want to enjoy an outstanding tasting beer. We're going to continue to emphasize the betterment trends as we go forward with a number of our product offerings and certainly expect Corona Non-Alcoholic to continue to grow here in this coming fiscal year as well.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Drew Levine: Hey, good morning. This is Drew Levine on for Andrea. Thank you for taking our questions. So just two for us, if we may. Just going back to one of the earlier questions, Bill, if you can comment maybe on depletion trends outside of California versus inside California during the quarter and how those progressed throughout the quarter. And then one for Garth. I think you mentioned roughly $200 million of cost savings for beer in fiscal '24. I think that implies a pretty meaningful step up in the fourth quarter. So if you could just talk about maybe some of the projects where you saw benefit and how we should be thinking about cost savings for fiscal '25. Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Andrea, your voice got a lot lower since the last time you asked a question. All joking aside, our trends were very, very strong really across the country. A significant place, let me use Pacifico as an example, the depletions across that brand for the year were up 17%, and obviously, the big stronghold is California. Modelo Especial continues to be the number one brand in the State of California. But we're also seeing really good success across the country. Places like Texas and Florida. And secondary markets. We've always said secondary markets are going to be an important element for us. And many, many, many of those showed double-digit increases over this past year. So we were very pleased to see a broad-based growth profile for our business as we closed out the year, and we think we're in position to continue to do that here in fiscal '25. Garth, I think, the second one was for you.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, just on the roughly $205 million of cost savings that came out of Beer Business throughout the year. Yeah, that ramped up throughout the year. We started right out of the gate very strong in Q1 and again that ramped up as we went through the year. It ramped up as we went through the year really based on two factors. One is, we identified or put in place new initiatives throughout the year. But then you also benefited from -- almost from a compounding perspective for those things that started earlier in the year as well. The kinds of initiatives that we undertook last year were procurement-related in terms of various RFPs around raw materials where we were able to address some of the outsized increases that we saw over the last two years due to global supply chain disruptions as well as the inflationary environment. There was a number of logistics initiatives in terms of rail cars and double stacking and also a number of operational initiatives that were underway.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. First, could you please just remind us what your gross dollar amount of expenses that are peso-denominated are? So that would be great. And then second, looking at the scanner data and this is Circana, your price/mix has been well below the beer category over the last four, 12 weeks or so. So I'm trying to understand why that's the case. And the most of the other players took pricing kind of before or after the Super Bowl. Kind of what is the timing on your price increases this year? And again, why is your apparent realization in the scanner data less than the market and most of the other big brands? Thank you.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, so on the first one, in terms of the amount of costs that are peso-denominated for our Beer Business is about 20% to 25% of our costs are peso-denominated. As I said, as we entered this year, we're hedged at about 80%.
Bill Newlands: And relative to price realization, as you know, a lot of what you see in these types of things depends on when pricing increases or pricing actions were taken. We consistently have said 1% to 2% is our pricing algorithm, and over the course of the whole year, we're still expecting to see 1% to 2% pricing actions. As you also know, Robert, we do that on a SKU-by-SKU, market-by-market basis, and therefore, you have reflections of different time frames across the year as to when that actually shows up. I don't think that's anything that we are concerned about nor any kind of an ongoing trend. And as we said, over the course of the year, we'll expect to get 1% to 2% as we've communicated we would.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Filippo Falorni: Hey, good morning, everyone. I had a question on the overall beer industry and your thoughts as we are about to cycle the big market share shift with the controversy around Bud Light in April of last year. Clearly, your business was growing at these rates well above before this controversy, but there are some concerns that you might have benefited from the market share shift, so maybe you can address some of the impact that you see on your business and how you're thinking about it as we start to cycle those impacts. Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Well, as we've said right along, we probably were not the single biggest gainer as it related to the controversy that you know, but I'd also, again, continue to point out something I said earlier, which is, we've got extraordinarily strong brand loyalty, and we only play in the high-end. The high-end is where the growth in the category is at the moment, and we're fortunate that that's exactly where we play. When you add in the fact that we've seen a significant increase in our shelf presence here during this spring reset program, we think we're in a great position, recognizing we are coming off the single biggest share gain in the history of Constellation Brands Beer Business. Two points in all total beer and 2.6 points in the high-end. It's an unprecedented gain and I think it reflects the sheer strength of our brands.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Gerald Pascarelli: Great. Thanks very much. Just going back to wine, Bill, the drivers you laid out in your prepared remarks were very helpful, but based on current trends, I think the outlook for the year came in above expectations, definitely above our expectations. So, I guess, in the context of two guide downs last year, if you could maybe provide some more commentary just on your level of confidence this early in the fiscal year in achieving flat revenue performance, that would be great. And then does your outlook embed the assumption that the wine category will ultimately start to improve from current levels this year? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: I think, obviously, Garth and I spent a lot of time with our wine colleagues over the last few months looking carefully at what we thought was critically important. The reflection of an improved performance has several variables involved. One, we're going to work much more closely and enhance our sales capabilities to support our distributor network. I think we've gotten much more aligned as to what our intentions and expectations are, both from distributor to us and us to distributor than where we had been as we came out of last year. Second, we've refocused our priorities. There are 11 or so critical brands that did not probably have the right amount of prioritization within our overall portfolio, and we have radically addressed that. Third, we're going after efficiencies within the business, and we think there are those to be had. As you know, that was a tremendous success last year in our Beer Business, and we're putting some of the same resources against our Wine & Spirits business that helped generate that very strong result last year. So there's a number of elements that we are putting in place recognizing this is going to be a bit of a reset year, particularly at the bottom line for the wine business. However, again, we've said, we think the strategy is sound, it's right, it's going to get us to our medium-term algorithms as we go forward, and at this point, it's all about execution. And I think Sam Glaetzer and the rest of the team are going to be crystal focused on execution against our strategy.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Please proceed with your question.
Carlos Laboy: Yes, good morning, everyone. Can you please expand further on the state of on-premise activity that you saw towards your end, and more important, currently?
Bill Newlands: You bet, Carlos. I think you saw some interesting volatility, depends on the particular time frame, and we saw some of that. We had an issue for a brief period during this year where we had some issues with kegs, which is now fully behind us. We're continuing to see strong development in the on-premise, and we're particularly excited about it heading into Cinco, which is obviously the next big time frame for us, and a time frame when we historically have done very well and made significant share gains, both in the retail and in the on-premise environment. So we're very optimistic that the on-premise is going to be an important part of what our results are this year. Both Modelo, Corona, Extra and Pacifico are all growing share in that channel and we expect that that continued share of growth is going to continue in this fiscal year.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I'll hand the floor back to Bill Newlands for closing remarks.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Rob, and thank you to all who joined today's call. As we wrap up, I want to, once again, thank our colleagues across Constellation, as well as our trade partners, for delivering another strong year of performance in fiscal '24. Your continued focus and discipline has made Constellation a top-performing growth leader among CPG companies for 11 consecutive years. No other company in recent times can say that, and we're extremely proud of this achievement. As we head into fiscal '25, we're confident in our ability to further build on our momentum and to create additional shareholder value by delivering low-double-digit EPS growth, fueled primarily by our Beer Business, which we expect to generate high-single-digit net sales growth and best-in-class operating margins. Heightened focus on our commercial and operational execution in our Wine & Spirits business, while maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation and continuing to serve as good stewards of our environment and the communities where we operate. As we approach the key summer selling season, we invite you to enjoy some of our great-tasting products as part of your festivities, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our next quarterly call. Thank you very much, and have a good day, everybody.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-01-05 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the Constellation Brands Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Joseph Suarez, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Joseph Suarez: Thank you, Darryl. Good morning all and happy new year. Welcome to Constellation Brands Q3 fiscal '24 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO, and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Following the call, we'll also be making available in the Investors section of our company's website, a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, I'd like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now, here's Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Joe, and congratulations on your recent promotion. And good morning all. Happy New Year to everyone, and welcome to our Q3 fiscal '24 call. I hope you all had a wonderful holiday season and were able to enjoy some of our great products with your family and friends. We have several topics to address on today's call. So let's start with the key takeaways for this quarter. First, I am pleased to report that our Beer business again delivered very strong performance that accelerated throughout Q3. We achieved depletion growth of over 8% for our beer portfolio with a particularly outstanding end to the month of November. We led Thanksgiving beer sales in US-tracked channels and continued to see accelerating momentum in the last week of the month, reflecting both ongoing strong consumer demand and restocking after the earlier Thanksgiving holiday this year. And once again, for another entire quarter, we achieved leading share gains in tracked channels with more than 2 point expansion in the US beer category and a nearly 3 point gain in the higher-end. This marks the 55th consecutive quarter of depletion growth for our Beer business and the 10th leading share gains. Secondly, in line with our consistent disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, we executed $215 million of share repurchases in Q3, while maintaining our net leverage ratio excluding Canopy equity and earnings unchanged from last quarter at 3.2 times as well as continuing to deliver cash returns through our dividend and advancing our organic growth investments at our Obregon brewery, a new brewery site in Veracruz to support additional production capacity for our Beer business. And thirdly, as noted at our recent Investor Day, over the past few months, our Wine & Spirits business, much like others across the industry, has seen a broader marketplace deceleration. In light of these and other near-term headwinds, we are further revising our fiscal '24 organic net sales guidance for Wine & Spirits to be down 7% to 9% and the operating income guidance for that business excluding gross profit, less marketing of brands divested last year, to be down 6% to 8%, which I will elaborate on shortly. Of course, we are not pleased with these revisions at both our leadership team and our Wine & Spirits teams remain fully committed to improving the performance of this business and to achieving its medium-term targets. In addition, as announced earlier today, Robert Hanson has elected to step down from his role as President of our Wine & Spirits business in a few weeks at the end of the current fiscal year. We have initiated a process to identify a successor for this role and I will step into lead the Wine & Spirits business in the interim, while of course, retaining my Chief Executive oversight across both the enterprise and our Beer business. Despite these revisions and leadership changes, as noted at our recent Investor Day, we continue to believe that over the medium term, our Wine & Spirits business should accelerate its net sales growth to 1% to 3% and improve operating margins to 25% to 26%, supported by the significant transformation undertaken over the last few years to better align our portfolio with broader consumer-led premiumization trends, expand our omnichannel capabilities and extend into targeted international markets. More importantly, in fiscal '24, we still expect our enterprise comparable EPS guidance excluding Canopy to remain within our previously stated range of $12.00 to $12.20. And over the medium term, we continue to expect low double-digit EPS growth as outlined at our Investor Day. Now let's step through these key points for Q3 in more detail. As noted, our beer team once again delivered remarkable results. Modelo Especial led to charge, achieving a roughly 12% increase in depletions and remained the leading share gaining brand in tracked channel dollar sales, strengthening its position as the number one beer brand in the US market having ultimately achieved that top spot now on a 52-week basis. The broader Modelo brand family also delivered phenomenal results. Cheladas achieved an increase in depletions of approximately 22% year-over-year in Q3. And on a rolling 12-month basis, the combined set of Chelada flavors and pack sizes reached the 20 million case milestone, which is over 350% more than that set of brands was doing just five years ago in fiscal '19. Additionally, Modelo Chelada Especial, our original flavor, which was recently launched in a 12-pack 12-ounce format was a top 15 share gainer in Circana in Q3, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead for our new Chelada flavor and pack size additions. Also in the Modelo family, Oro, continued its strong first year of going national with a third quarter as a top five share gainer in the high-end. We look forward to the growth opportunities ahead for Oro as awareness grows and we introduce new pack sizes next fiscal year. Beyond Modelo, our Corona Extra and Pacifico core beer brands continued to perform strongly in Q3. Corona Extra maintained depletion growth at about 1%, while Pacifico delivered an outstanding 19% increase. And on a rolling 12-month basis, Pacifico also reached the 20 million case milestone, double its volume from five years ago. In addition, both brands remained top 10 share gainers across the entire US beer market in tracked dollar sales. Our beer brands clearly continued to resonate strongly with the consumer, and I'm incredibly proud of and thankful to our entire beer team for their consistently strong execution. With that backdrop, we remain confident in our fiscal '24 net sales growth guidance of 8% to 9%. And from an operating income guidance perspective, we now expect our beer business to deliver 7% to 8% growth for fiscal '24 as we realize additional benefits this year from the marketing effectiveness actions discussed during our Investor Day. Over the medium term, we still see significant opportunities to continue to achieve net sales growth of 7% to 9% in our Beer business supported by the fundamental distribution, innovation and demographic drivers, as well as consumer-led trends also discussed at our recent Investor Day, as well as to continue to achieve best-in-class operating margins of 39% to 40% supported by savings and efficiency initiatives across our cost of goods sold, marketing, and broader SG&A. And last but not least, we continue to support the growth of our Beer business through modular investments in brewing capacity and productivity initiatives to unlock further production upside. Moving on to the Wine & Spirits business. As noted earlier, our Wine & Spirits business is operating amid a broader marketplace deceleration. As we have shared in recent quarters, we are actively working to address mainstream headwinds affecting our two largest volume brands Woodbridge and SVEDKA. However, we anticipate these efforts to extend beyond fiscal '24. More broadly, while we are maintaining a disciplined approach to taking price across our portfolio, the competitive environment is now getting pressured with more aggressive discounting and price points beyond mainstream. Again, we believe the broader deceleration in these higher-end categories to be temporary and have continued to execute strategic pricing actions instead of implementing reductions like certain competitors. In addition, we have made the decision to adjust some aspects of our US wholesale distributor agreements focused on improving mix, inventory, and state and channel level sales execution. We are actively engaged with our largest distributor partner to ensure that our portfolio continues to make progress against our vision of leading the higher-end as well as on the revitalization of our mainstream brands. From an international perspective, while we experienced a decline in the quarter driven by previously noted weakness in our more mature markets, inventory levels in Canada, our largest export market, seem to now be normalizing following the destocking from recent changes to inventory regulations. So we anticipate more balanced supply-and-demand dynamics for this market going forward. Importantly, despite the impact of these near-term headwinds on organic net sales, our prudent pricing and cost efficiency efforts enabled margin improvement for Wine & Spirits in Q3. Beyond these near-term challenges, our focus remains on driving growth across our higher-end brands. As shared during Investor Day, over the last few years, our Wine & Spirits business has established a stronger foundation to advance toward these targets. Since fiscal '19, we have doubled the number of fine wine and craft spirits brands in our portfolio and we have invested and expanded our footprint in higher-growth DTC channels in targeted international markets. With our structural transformation securely in place, I want to thank Robert Hanson for his contributions over many years including initially as a non-executive member of the Board. We wish Robert well and all the best in his future endeavors and look forward to announcing the appointment of our next Wine & Spirits business President in the near future. Lastly, I'd like to emphasize again our unwavering commitment to our consistent, balanced, and disciplined approach to capital allocation. As noted at our Investor Day event, we continued to target a strong balance sheet that supports our investment-grade rating and we are working toward a net leverage ratio of 3 times which we expect to achieve within fiscal '25. We expect to maintain a dividend payout ratio of approximately 30%, supporting continued growth of our dividend per share in line with our earnings expectations. We plan to invest approximately $5 billion in growth and maintenance CapEx from fiscal '24 to fiscal '28, primarily focused on brewing capacity expansions for our beer business. We continue to opportunistically buy back shares with $215 million repurchased in Q3, which leaves us with an additional $2.6 billion still within our existing share repurchase authorization. And finally, we continued to look at tuck-in gap-filling M&A opportunities with a highly rigorous transaction criteria. So to close, let's go back to the key takeaways for the quarter. First, we have a beer portfolio and team that consistently delivers industry-leading performance and we see significant opportunities as outlined at our Investor Day to continue to drive similarly strong growth over the medium term. Second, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders through consistent execution of our balanced and disciplined capital allocation priorities and third, our Wine & Spirits business is focused on realizing net sales growth and improved operating margins by leveraging its reshaped higher-end leaning portfolio as well as our enhanced DTC channel and international market footprints and capability. And lastly and importantly, we continue to expect our enterprise comparable EPS guidance in fiscal '24 excluding Canopy to remain within our previously-stated range of $12.00 to $12.20. And over the medium-term, we continue to expect low double-digit EPS growth as we outlined at our Investor Day. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results in greater detail. Garth?
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As usual, my discussion on our financial performance will mainly focus on comparable basis results and stepping through our P&L. However, as of this quarter, we will discuss enterprise results, followed by business segment detail to better address our performance against the outlook shared at our Investor Day at these different levels. Beginning with net sales. We achieved enterprise-wide top line growth of 1% for the quarter. This was the result of solid Beer net sales growth of 4%, partially offset by the Wine & Spirits net sales decline of 8%. Wine & Spirits net sales decline was 7% on an organic basis. As Bill noted, Beer business depletions for the quarter were above 8% as the year-over-year growth momentum from summer continued through the fall, supported by ongoing strong consumer demand of our portfolio. Again, we saw a particular acceleration in depletion volumes at the end of November as we extended our leadership across key holidays with outstanding performance during US Thanksgiving. Our on-premise channel realized modest growth in depletions of about 1% for Q3 and accounted for approximately 11% of our total volumes as we've been able to replenish inventories following the keg disruption over the summer and began to advance growth and drive performance in the on-premise. Shipment volumes for beer business grew 3.4%, and we achieved favorable pricing slightly above 1% as we began to lap the elevated pricing increases from last fall. These volume and pricing uplifts were partially offset by a shift in packaging mix. Altogether, these year-over-year shipment, pricing and mix changes drove the 4% or approximately $77 million increase in beer net sales for the quarter. For our Wine & Spirits business, organic net sales declined 7%, driven by lower shipment volumes due to the previously referenced category headwinds and the change in our process aimed at aligning shipments and depletions. As a reminder, per prior calls this year, we now make quarterly shipment adjustments to align with depletions versus our former practice of only doing one annual adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter. We believe this process change has partially driven less favorable comparisons for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. Now shifting to operating margins. For Q3, enterprise-wide operating income increased 7%, and operating margin increased 170 basis points to 32.3%. This was primarily a result of an increase in operating income of 7% for our Beer business, which also drove a 100 basis point increase in Beer business operating margin to 38.5%. Enterprise-wide operating margins also benefited from a 13% reduction in corporate expense. These Beer business and corporate expense tailwinds were partially offset by a 5% decrease in our Wine & Spirits business operating income, which still yielded a 60 basis point increase in operating margin to 25.4% for the Wine & Spirits business. Excluding the gross profit, less marketing, of the brands that are no longer part of the business following their divestiture, operating income and operating margin for the Wine & Spirits business decreased by 4% and increased by 80 basis points, respectively. Stepping through these drivers in more detail, starting with beer. The increase in operating income and margin were a result of benefits and cost of products sold as we continue to build cost efficiency and productivity savings. For the quarter, total cost savings were approximately $55 million. An $11 million or a 6% decrease in marketing costs as a result of shifts in timing of spend. Note that marketing as a percent of net sales was 8.7% for the quarter. A $4 million decrease in SG&A expense, primarily driven by lower legal fees, partially offset by higher compensation and benefit expenses and $6 million of favorability from the divestiture of our craft beer business. These benefits were partially offset by a $12 million unfavorable foreign currency impact as we still realized a higher Mexican peso rate year-over-year, inclusive of our multiyear hedging positions. Additionally, in line with our full year expectations and guidance we are still facing higher costs in our packaging and raw materials, which resulted in a $17 million headwind for the quarter. We have also faced an $11 million increase in depreciation as a result of our capacity expansions. The reduction in our corporate expense, which for the quarter was $10 million, was primarily driven by the reduction in third-party services, particularly in our digital business acceleration investments partially offset by increased compensation and benefits. Our Wine & Spirits operating income margin, excluding the gross profit less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following last year's divestiture had a year-over-year improvement as the volume declines and unfavorable mix were more than offset by reduced logistics and warehousing costs, favorable SG&A costs due to reduced third-party consulting expenses and lower compensation and benefits. More favorable material costs driven by our cost savings initiatives and reduced marketing expense as we continue to shift our marketing focus towards more efficient, high return efforts. Interest expense for the quarter was approximately $104 million, driven by higher average borrowings and higher weighted average interest rates. As a reminder, approximately 5% of our debt obligations are subject to adjustable rates. As Bill noted, we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.2 times excluding Canopy equity and earnings and remain on track to reach our target goal of 3 times within fiscal 2025. Our comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings for the quarter was 18% versus 18.8% last year. Our comparable EPS for the quarter, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, was $3.24, reflecting the consistent growth of our business and representing an 8% increase. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion through the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and a 10% decrease driven by a 33% increase in CapEx investments attributable to the expansions at our existing Obregon facility and the construction of our new brewery located in Veracruz. As we look towards the end of fiscal '24, our guidance for enterprise comparable EPS, excluding Canopy equity and earnings remains unchanged at $12 to $12.20 underpinned by the following expectations. First, an unchanged 8% to 9% net sales growth outlook but a higher 7% to 8% operating income growth expectation for our Beer business. As stated in our prior calls this year and at our recent Investor Day event for our beer net sales, we continue to expect pricing to be between 1% to 2% and mid to high single-digit volume growth in fiscal '24. And we still anticipate shipment volumes for the second half to account for approximately 45% of the full year total. Bill already addressed the drivers of the uplift in our beer operating income growth guidance but it's also important to note that we still expect beer operating margin to be approximately 38% for the full year. Second, for our Wine & Spirits business, we now expect a decline of 7% to 9% in organic net sales and a decline of 6% to 8% in operating income, excluding the impact of the divested wine brands that are no longer part of our results. Bill also already addressed the drivers for these revisions. Third, from a corporate expense perspective, we now expect that to be approximately $260 million to $270 million for the full year which includes a slightly lower end to the range versus our prior expectation. And similarly, our interest expense expectations are now slightly lower at approximately $450 million. And last but not least, we continue to expect our comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy, to be approximately 19% and despite the additional $215 million of share repurchases executed in the third quarter, we also continue to anticipate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $184 million. Beyond the P&L, for free cash flow, we expect to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for fiscal '24, reflective of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion in operating cash flow and $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of CapEx. In closing, we continue to deliver industry-leading results in our beer business and remain confident in our ability to achieve our stated EPS targets for this fiscal year despite incremental category headwinds affecting our Wine & Spirits business. As we look further ahead, we remain excited about continuing opportunities to build shareholder value over the medium term, which we hope to achieve by capturing the substantial growth opportunities that exist for our Beer business, executing against our consistent, disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities and delivering enhanced performance in Wine & Spirits, supported by the significant transformation that business has undergone and the actions that we are taking to improve this business. We encourage existing and prospective shareholders who have not yet had an opportunity to review our recent Investor Day presentations to access those through our Investor Relations website, ir.cbrands.com to gain further insights into our medium-term perspective on these topics. And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Nik Modi: Thank you. Good morning, everyone and Happy New Year.
Bill Newlands: Same to you.
Nik Modi: So, Bill, maybe you can provide some context. Obviously, you provided a few intra-quarter updates, one at the Analyst Day and one at the Morgan Stanley conference. Just regarding both the Beer and the Wine & Spirits business and obviously things came out a little bit differently. So I was hoping you can just kind of give us a perspective on what exactly happened to cause some of the delta. And if some of the clarity or perspective you gave us around the gaps between scanner data and your actual results, how we should think about that because I'm sure that's going to be something we're all going to have to start thinking about over the next couple of weeks?
Bill Newlands: Sure. Thanks, Nick. And again, Happy New Year to you. As we said in our prepared remarks, we're obviously very pleased with our Beer business in Q3 and we are particularly happy with the strong acceleration in the momentum that sort of came out of November. Interestingly enough, the delta between Circana and our numbers sort of changed about the minute Garth stopped speaking at the conference in November. So that was always interesting how that works. As we've noted, we expect about 45% of our Beer business volumes will be achieved in H2, which is in line with the normal seasonality of that business. And for Q4 specifically, we expect those shipments in depletes will end up being about 20% to 21% of our total fiscal year volumes. But we also expect that we're going to continue to drive mid to high single-digit volume growth annually, which is consistent with the depletion performance that we've now achieved for over a decade. And again, that's consistent with what we've also said, 1% to 2% annual average pricing increases, which supports the 7% to 9% annual net sales algorithm that we've said we will do in the medium term. On the Wine & Spirits side, obviously, we're further revising our guidance down, was not a decision we took lightly, and we're certainly not happy about it. We examined numerous scenarios and ultimately determined the adjustment was really needed to reflect a number of things. The broader category deceleration and other factors that affected our performance including gaps from our prior US wholesale expectations that we're actively addressing with our distributor partners and importantly, while making sure we maintain an appropriate inventory level for the remainder of this year, setting ourselves in good position to see sequential improvement in fiscal '25. Of course, as I said, we're not pleased with these revisions, and neither is our leadership team nor our Wine & Spirits team, but we're certainly committed to improving that performance in the medium term and expect that our net sales and operating margin targets will be consistent with what we said at Investor Day. As you've also seen, I'm going to be temporarily taking over that business, and I will be spending a fair amount of time with the Wine & Spirits division as we work through the process of appointing a new leader, which we have already started considering both internal and external candidates. As you probably know better than many, I spent several years of my career within the Wine & Spirits categories, and I look forward to working more closely with that team in the interim, particularly as that business turns its focus toward enhancing operational effectiveness and marketplace execution to build on the reconstituted higher-end portfolio and organizational structure that we put in place over the last few years. But ultimately, and I'd like to, Nik, reiterate this one more time. In fiscal '24, we still expect our enterprise EPS guidance to remain within our previously stated range of $12.00 to $12.20 and over the medium term, we also continue to expect low digit EPS growth, as outlined at Investor Day. Hopefully, that gives you some good perspective on those elements you asked about.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning and Happy New Year, everyone. I wanted to drill down a bit more on your beer margins. Bill and Garth, you raised your fiscal year beer operating income growth guidance. But this does still imply very low op margins in Q4. So I guess I'd like to better understand the drivers of this. And really how much visibility you have in terms of whether it's your marketing expense or commodities, hedges, et cetera, for the rest of this fiscal year? And then perhaps any color on how margins should be phasing next fiscal year would be helpful. Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Bonnie, just to start on the question for next fiscal year, obviously, we'll give guidance on next fiscal year at our next conference call in April. But as it relates to margins this year, I mean, obviously, margins are progressing in line with what our expectations are. And what you saw in the third quarter, this is the first time from a year-over-year perspective where we had margin improvement which again is what we expected at the outset of the year. What we've always said about margins is, and this ties back to what we've said about volumes and shipments and depletions is 55% of our activity will occur in the first half of the year and 45% in the second half of the year. And in Q4, specific to your question on Q4, that -- it's always typically one of our lower shipping quarters. And so therefore, margins are lower just by virtue of reduced throughput through our facilities. On top of that, we continue to have increasing depreciation costs that we referenced during our prepared remarks. But as I say, I mean, we do expect that Q4 margins this year will be better than they were of last year, continuing the trend of year-over-year improvement and which, obviously, we feel confident about our ability to get back into our 39% to 40% range as we went into very good detail at our Investor Day.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hi, guys. Good morning. You're depleting -- right now, you had a run rate of about 8%, or I guess you did 8% for the quarter. There's expectations for some pretty good shelf space gain in April. Could you give some context on what that might mean for a tick-up in depletion?
Bill Newlands: Well, here's what I'd say about that. As we said earlier, we were very pleased with the 8.2% that we got in the quarter, and we finished November very, very strong. And certainly, we were up, as you would have expected, that strong performance in late November continued into December. So we're very excited about our ability to continue to see exceptional depletions as we move into this calendar year and soon into the new fiscal year. The important thing to me is we continue to gain share. Our two share point gains that you saw in the overall category, nearly three in the high end, continue to be industry leading and are frankly an acceleration of what our share gains had been earlier in the year. So we're very comfortable again, 79% top line driven by mid-plus single-digit growth profile, which we've said we see the runway on that for a long time to come. And certainly this quarter and certainly our expectations for the rest of the year are consistent with that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Bryan Spillane: Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to go back, Bill, and just ask a bit about the management transition in Wine & Spirits. And I guess, a, what are you looking for? Like, what are the attributes or the skill set that you think is needed? And then if you could just maybe separate how much of the focus on wine or how much of the improvement path is going to be dependent on uncontrollable? So just the category improving and how much of it is, you think, things that are controllable, things that -- execution elements or things that the Constellation can do to improve?
Bill Newlands: Sure, thanks for the question, Brian. I'd say this, our transformation of that business is largely complete. As we've said now a number of times, it's a very different business than what it was several years ago, even though we still have a fair amount of business in the lower end of the business. What I would say is this. We will be focused on an individual who can bring great operating efficiencies and execution in the marketplace. We think it's critically important that we improve our wholesale performance in the United States, and we think there's going to be continuing opportunities for us to perform very well in DTC and international channels as we have developed that business over the last couple of years. All of those things, I would argue, are well within our control. A lot of work is being done on the mainstream portion of the business, particularly on SVEDKA and Woodbridge to enhance the performance of those businesses. I think that you will start to see that play out in the new fiscal year. And we believe that -- we believe some of the softening that's occurred in the overall business is transitory and will come back our way, given the real strength that we've seen in our higher-end business like Meiomi and Kim Crawford and the Prisoner and Mi Campo and things of that nature. So I'm always of the belief that a significant portion of your results are really within your control and we're going to focus on those critical factors that improve our business performance as we head into the new fiscal year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Nadine Sarwat: Hi everybody, thank you for taking my questions. A two-parter for me. First, you obviously have posted really good beer depletions this quarter, but looking at 2023 for the overall industry, US beer has been weaker than the historical plus or minus 1% that we've seen over the last decade. I'd love to hear your thoughts in your experience why you think that is. Any key takeaways to share on the health of the consumer? And what would you expect to see for the industry as a whole in ‘24? And then finally, just to come back to Wine & Spirits again, good to hear you reiterating that medium-term growth algorithm you disclosed at the Investor Day. But would it be possible for you to share more details as to how -- where that conviction and achieving that is given the guidance kept today, any building blocks. I appreciate the initiatives you mentioned, but clearly the gap between the guidance for this fiscal year and that medium growth algo is quite big now. So any color would be appreciated. Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure. So let's start with the overall beer market. One of the things that we've seen and it's accelerated a bit is the separation between the low end and the high end in the beer market. The high end continues to be where the strength is and we continue to be the leader in the high end, gaining almost 3 share points in the most recent period. Part of that is driven, I think, by a couple of things. One is we have such a strong base with the Hispanic consumer where beer remains a critical part of their consumption pattern. Our brands have great brand loyalty. And again, that's very valuable to us as time goes forward. But one of the things that we also noted, let's take the light beer category. While there's been a lot of movement within that category within brands, the overall sector is not overly healthy. It's down. And we've noted that continuously. So I think the important part as you think about the overall beer sector is to look at it bifurcated. The low end has not been successful and has been challenged on a volumetric basis, but the high end continues to perform well and we're fortunate that we are leading at the high end. As it relates to the Wine & Spirits, what I'd like to do on that particular point, given I'm about to do a major deep dive into that business, is we'll come back to you with more details on where we see our progress going to occur in that particular business when we do our next earnings call at the beginning of the new fiscal year. What I would say is this. We're going to be focused -- very, very focused, on execution and working closely with our distribution partners to make sure that we are outperforming the categories in which we play through our distributor network. That's going to be an important part of our ongoing success going forward, and it will be a critical part of where I'm spending my time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Carey: Hi, good morning.
Bill Newlands: Good morning.
Garth Hankinson: Hi, Chris.
Chris Carey: Garth, the beer savings number that you called out, which I believe was $55 million, is a big number, certainly in the context of the savings targets through fiscal ‘28 that you laid out at Investor Day. And so I guess, are you pulling forward savings into fiscal ‘24 from other years, or are you perhaps just getting better at the ability to drive savings in the near term and perhaps we should be thinking about over-delivery or maybe just building more confidence in your ability to hit those targets over time? So again, I'm just trying to get some context for your self-help capacity in the beer gross margin, which was quite strong this quarter.
Garth Hankinson: Chris, thanks for the question. And I guess the short answer to our question is no, we're not pulling anything forward from future years in FY ‘24. I do think that what you're seeing this year is a continuation of a couple things. One which we detailed at Investor Day, which is the shift from us from being builders of breweries to operators of breweries. And so we're getting more efficient, we're doing a better job from an end-to-end supply chain, and that's what gave us the confidence not just in this year, but in the cost savings targets that we laid out at Investor Day. Another thing that we're seeing benefits from is out of our digital business acceleration activities, which have been coupled with the discipline that we're creating on an end-to-end supply chain and it's driven significant savings in a whole host of areas as it relates to procurement. So again, it is somewhat new muscle that we're building, really more an extension of existing muscle as we, again, migrate from being builders to operators.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. Just two follow-ups probably on Nik's question. Just first on beer, just to understand the strength and depletions at the end of the quarter. Is that more underlying strength? Was there anything timing related there? Is it continued in December? Should we look at sort of the 8% result in the quarter as sort of a true underlying gauge of the business, at least short-term, understanding that's not the guidance, but how should we think about that? And I know it's tough to talk about the gap versus scanner data. Obviously, it bounces around. But just any specific thoughts on what that could be going forward? And then I also have a wine question, if I can follow up on that.
Bill Newlands: Dara, why don't you do that right away? Because usually once you ask a question, you don't have further access. What's your wine question?
Dara Mohsenian: Okay. I mean, just look, the comments on the revision were helpful in the longer-term portfolio transformation, but at the risk of being blunt, it's been sort of years of disappointment on that business. It's a pretty large negative revision after Analyst Day in a short period of time. So I just wanted to hear a little more about the response, Bill, and how you might manage that business differently from a strategic lens longer term, perhaps a greater focus on productivity or whatever the changes are. But how do you think about managing the business differently and maybe how it fits in the portfolio just juxtaposition versus what's a very attractive beer business as we saw again this morning from a growth and margin standpoint.
Bill Newlands: Sure. So let's cover the first one initially about the depletions coming out of the quarter. Obviously, there's always a little bit of benefit when you have an early Thanksgiving because you give retailers a chance to restock after Thanksgiving. But let's make no mistake, the takeout that we had around the Thanksgiving holiday was exceptional, which you wouldn't get the great restocking if you didn't have an exceptional takeout period. And obviously we're very pleased to see, without going into specifics, that the strong November is playing into December as we expected it would because the underlying trends for our business remain very strong. And as I stated at an earlier question, our actual share gains have accelerated during the course of the year, which I think is very positive as well relative to our continuing success in that business. As it relates to wine, as I said before, the thing that we were most concerned about coming out of this particular quarter is that we end our year in an appropriate inventory position and that we are preparing ourselves to work closely with our wholesale distributor partners to accelerate that business going forward so that we are winning in the categories and channels in which we participate. We've got a lot of work to do there, but we continue to believe the strategy work that's been done over the past few years to reposition our portfolio much more to the higher end is going to pay dividends. And again, as I said, I think, to Nadine a moment ago, I'll come back with some more specific thinking. We're going to do, as you can understand, a fairly deep dive into that business. And I'll have some more thoughts on that as we get to our next call.
Garth Hankinson: And, Dara, as it relates to the gaps in Circana versus depletions, and as you mentioned in your question, it can be a bit difficult to draw parallels between the two. Look, for the balance of the year going forward -- for at least the balance of the year going forward, and we'll give updates on this as we see fit, but I think you still have to think about that gap being in the mid-single-digits. That being said, I'll kind of remind everybody of the comments we made at [your] (ph) conference last month, which is, we think that looking at this, that syndicated consumer takeaway data is really best to gauge long-term trends as well as relative performance. Just as a reminder, for our own business, Circana only picks up 50% of our total volumes, and there are certainly gaps between the volume growth of different tracked channel data providers. And importantly, you don't see things picked up per se as it relates to differences in time periods, meaning there can be shifts between key weekends or holidays between period to period that make it hard to tie depletions with the Circana data. So again, this is not -- we don't use the syndicated consumer takeaway data the way that you do, and that's why we say it's not necessarily the best way to gauge our business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. So, with your comments just now on the cadence of the quarter and into the fourth quarter, I wonder why you haven't raised guidance for [the end of fourth quarter] (ph) in terms of top line? And the second part of your question, looking ahead into the strength, how much do you expect that the sharp resets on the back of the strength will come, will structure for that type of 7% to 9% algorithm? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Well, let's start with the second question first. We were quite pleased with the more limited changes that occurred on the shelf set in the back half of last calendar year. But we're expecting significant gains greater than our growth profile here as we get to the spring resets. You would notice that we fully expect that we're going to finish our year in a very strong performance. You will note that we raised the bottom of our guidance, as Garth noted, and I think I noted in my remarks as well. So we actually have raised our expectations around the income side. And of course that translates through into better cash and various other things as Garth noted. So I think you should take away what I hopefully we were trying to portray, which is our business continues to deliver exactly what we've told you what we would deliver on the beer side, 7% to 9% top line growth and strong bottom operating growth to match. And certainly I think our depletion rate coming out of Q3 reflects that strength.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Rob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you. Two questions. First, so wondering if you could talk a little bit about pricing. I know that you're talking about 1% to 2%. It was 1% here. So kind of two parts to this. One, what is the kind of the general environment for pricing in the beer industry now, the sense that you get? And second, I know that you do kind of a sporadic pricing, so it's -- a lot of the country is zero and then certain parts is maybe 4% or 5% percent and so then it averages out 1% to 2%. Can you talk a little bit about kind of the timing of your price increases? My understanding that your major competitors are pricing at the end of January and the beginning of February. So how does your pricing fit into that? So that's question number one. And then question number two is kind of hearing a little bit, reading about an innovation, Corona Sunbrew, I think Sunbrew's Citrus that's off to a good start. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that. Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on competitor pricing, but what I would say, Robert, is we said early on, and in fact, some of you probably questioned Garth and I on occasion about it, that we believe that 1% to 2% was the right approach. We've done that historically over the long run. We were a little bit higher than that during the really high inflationary timeframe around COVID which we fully acknowledged and recognized. But I go back to what we've always said, which is, we really want to keep our consumer. It's a whole lot more expensive if you chase them off and have to go reacquire a consumer than it is to never lose them in the first place. And the 1% to 2% algorithm has proven very solid for us over the long term and it's one that we're going to continue. I think certainly you see in other categories, people being careful about pricing. And I think that reflects just an understanding of where the consumer may or may not be in various categories. As it relates to innovation, Sunbrew is coming. We plan to talk mainly about that at our introduction for that, which will occur at the beginning of March. So I'm not going to spill all the beans on it, but we're particularly excited about that. We think it's going to be, again, another very interesting new product launch for our company on the heels of very successful Oro launch and very successful Aguas Frescas launch that has occurred in Modelo, which, as you know, is also expanding here in the coming years. So please stay tuned on that one. But I think we're very optimistic that that provides some great opportunity in the Corona franchise.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I know we've covered a lot of ground, but I was hoping you could just touch on the improved cash flow outlook for the year. It was a pretty material change and exciting. So I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the key drivers on that uptick in outlook. Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, thanks, Lauren. So there’s obviously a few drivers of the change in cash flow. And obviously I think that seeing the increase in cash flow just goes to further evidence the very disciplined approach we take to managing the cash of the company. Obviously, some of the drivers there will include things like the increase in beer margin, or I should say beer operating income that Bill referenced in his remarks. There, obviously will be some favorability in the taxes that I referenced in my remarks as well as some other favorability on things like tax rates there -- taxes and things of that nature. But those are the primary drivers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Filippo Falorni: Hey, good morning guys and Happy New Year. I want to go back to the on-premise channel for the Beer business. I think Garth mentioned we grew about 1% in the quarter. I was wondering if there's any more to recover from the keg issue that you guys had. And then if you think about next fiscal year, we talked a lot about the opportunity to gain share in off-premise, but can you comment on your ability to gain tap handles and gain more distribution in the on-premise channel as well? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Yeah, you bet. As we said, we had some temporary impact around kegs, which was largely in Q2 of this year. But I think it is important to point out that last year, both Modelo Especial and Pacifico were the number one and number two share gainers in draft despite some of those temporary issues. Remains a great opportunity for us when you think about it. I mean, let's use an example. Modelo Especial is number five on draft, but is the number one beer by dollars in this country. But it's certainly -- it’s not number one in the on-premise at this point. Again, a great opportunity. So interestingly, Corona Extra is the number one packaged beer on premise but again still having opportunity in the draft side. So we continue to think the draft is going to be an opportunity for us as one of the growth drivers for us going forward. And, Pacifico is a great example, even though it was the number two gainer, when you see just the real acceleration you have in that brand, I think there remains opportunities for both Modelo Especial and Pacifico in particular in the on-premise. And I certainly would hope to see both of those brands maintaining their number one share gainer status as we get into this calendar year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush. Please proceed with your question.
Gerald Pascarelli: Great. Thanks very much for the question. Just had a question on your measured versus non-measured channels within beer. So if we look at Nielsen, your price mix is moderated at retail. It looks to be currently running right in line with the midpoint of your 1% to 2% target. So if we compare this to non-measured channels, just curious if you've seen any near-term moderation in pricing. And if not, would you maybe expect trends to become a little more aligned as we look out over the near term? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: I think by and large the answer to your question is yes, that those are usually reflective. We don't see a lot of variation amongst channels on that particular thing. Although, you do have some very big markets that are not generally covered by some of those tracked channels, New York being an interesting one. So you do see some variation from time to time, but we don't expect that to be significant moving forward about what the tracked versus what the non-tracked channels look like.
Garth Hankinson: And the moderation that you referenced is really just attributable to the lapping of the incremental pricing that we took control of last year.
Bill Newlands: Absolutely.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. So, Garth, I may have missed this, but is the expectation still for beer depletions and shipments to be roughly equal for the year? And then I think it was mentioned that shipments in the fourth quarter would be around 20% to 21% of full year shipments. Is that quarterly mix similar for depletions as well? Just, we've seen a lot of changes in quarterly mix over the past few years that have resulted in differences in growth rates between depletions and shipments. So just trying to understand how we should think about it specifically for the fourth quarter. Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, so shipments and depletions, yes, those should be largely in line with one another for a full year. That's consistent with how we operate the business every year. And from a Q4 timing as it relates to shipments and depletions, yes, both of those are in that 20% to 21% range that Bill referenced earlier.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Strelzik: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Mine's about the competitive and promotional environment in beer. You've talked about your expectations on shelf space gains in the spring, the wider spread between light and premium beer and even some of the pricing dynamics in wine. So just curious, then what you're seeing across the competitive set now, how you're expecting that to evolve as the year progresses next year and maybe any plans or programs or levers should the environment intensify? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Certainly. We expect the promotional environment to be fairly consistent with what it usually is. We don't think there's going to be any radical changes around that topic. I think a lot of it goes back to what we've often said, which is the velocities that we have on our brands are superb. And obviously at the end of the day, the retail environment is very interested in having brands focused on those that deliver outstanding velocities and sales per point of distribution. We shared at our Investor Day that our sales per point of distribution is radically better than the competition, And I think that's going to continue to serve us well, especially when you consider the strong brand loyalty that we have with consumers. As we've also said on numerous occasions, our judicious 1% to 2% pricing actions, we don't pull back on our pricing in the marketplace, which I think is important also. So when we make those commitments to 1% to 2%, that's what we deliver.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk with Roth. Please proceed with your question.
Bill Kirk: Hey, just one for me, maybe for Garth. I heard the comment about $17 million higher in packaging and material costs for beer. I think that's the lowest year-over-year increase in some time. So is that the low level of inflation you'd be expecting there going forward or is deflation on those items even possible in calendar 2024? And I guess separately it'll probably be in the 10-Q later, but was the transportation cost line for beer, was that deflationary year-over-year in the period?
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, so as we said all year long, we would start to see benefits from easing inflation as we move through the year. And obviously we saw that in Q3. Going forward, you asked the question around whether this is at a low point or inflationary in nature. What I would say on that is we laid out a pretty good detail at our Investor Day around what the drivers are that we're expecting over the medium term that are going to result in us getting back in our 39% to 40% percent operating margins. And that includes low single-digit inflation net of our cost savings initiatives. And obviously there's some other offsets that can sound like depreciation, but those really are the drivers moving forward. And then logistics was a bit favorable in Q3 as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Bill Chappell: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Hey, just one follow-up on the acceleration of the beer in November and into December. I think I'm right in saying a year ago you had started to see a slowdown due to weather in California and the price increases had just taken, there was some elasticity. So was there more than I guess more favorable comps that you saw that drove the acceleration or is that a key part of it or were the comps maybe not as affected by weather and price increases last year as we had assumed?
Bill Newlands: Well, as you often know, lots of things go into why you see acceleration. I think you've pointed out some. I think weather in California was better than it was in prior year. You saw Thanksgiving being slightly earlier than it was in prior year. I think all those things are true. What I would emphasize, though, is that the takeout around our business, around Thanksgiving, was particularly strong. And our share gains that occurred during that period were as good as we saw during the entire year, which again, just speaks to the strength of the brand. There's gives and takes all the way along in the year, as you know, from various factors that occur. But when you see that kind of share acceleration that we've been seeing in the sort of the 2 point range in the overall category and 3 point range in the high end, that just speaks to the continuing strength of our Beer business, irrespective of the potential gives and takes that occur naturally over the course of the year.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Bill Newlands for closing remarks.
Bill Newlands: Thanks very much, and thank you all for joining today's call. Again, we're very pleased that our Beer business delivered strong performance in Q3 and is on track to achieve the higher end of our initial net sales and operating income guidance for the fiscal year. Our beer portfolio continues to deliver industry-leading performance, and we see a long runway of opportunities to continue to drive strong growth. In our Wine & Spirits business, we're fully committed to realizing net sales growth and improving our operating margins in line with our medium-term outlook for that business as we leverage its reshaped, higher-end leaning portfolio and enhanced DTC and international footprint. And from a capital allocation perspective, we continue to consistently execute against our balanced and disciplined priorities, which are maintaining our investment grade balance sheet, consistently returning cash to our shareholders through our dividend, and executing opportunistic share repurchases beyond those needed to cover dilutions, while advancing our organic investments to support additional production capacity for our Beer business and deploying excess cash to smaller acquisitions that fill portfolio gaps, but with a thoughtful and prudent approach. Altogether, we remain confident in our outlook for the full year and continue to expect our enterprise comparable EPS guidance for fiscal ’24, excluding Canopy, to remain within our previously stated range of $12.00 to $12.20. And over the medium term, we continue to expect low double-digit EPS growth as we outlined in our Investor Day. So, thanks again, everyone, for joining the call, and I wish you all a safe, happy, and prosperous new year. Thank you again for joining.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2023-10-05 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the Constellation Brands Fiscal Year 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Joe Suarez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Joe Suarez: Thank you, Darryl. Good morning all, and welcome to Constellation Brands Q2 fiscal '24 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Following the call, we'll also be making available in the Investors section of our company's website, a series of slides, which highlight the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 fiscal '24 call. In terms of key headlines for the second quarter, I'm pleased to report that our team once again delivered solid overall performance. First of all, our beer business led to charge as the number one share gainer with accelerating shares across the key summer holiday. We continue to invest in growth for this business as our team looks to seize opportunities to gain incremental awareness, shelf space, in household penetration for our brands in the back half and beyond. Secondly, our Wine and Spirits Business continues to progress along its journey to realize the full benefits of its transformation. Prioritized investments in our largest Wine and Spirits higher-end brands are yielding outperformance in their respective categories, while partially offsetting and helping to reduce headwinds from our mainstream brands as they continue to shift the mix profile of our portfolio. And third, our continued discipline around capital allocation priorities contributed to a strong overall performance in the quarter and sets the stage for fiscal '24, being another solid year of profitable growth and shareholder returns.  That said, let me provide a little more color around our key performance drivers in the quarter. As noted, our beer team once again delivered remarkable results. Not only did we remain the top share gainer over the entire critical summer season, we also extended our leading position from Cinco de Mayo to become the number one share gainer in tracked channels during the 4th of July holiday, and although, it falls slightly after our second quarter-end. I'm also pleased to report that we further accelerated our share gains during Labor Day. Modelo Especial remained the key driver of our strong performance, achieving double-digit volume growth in tracked channels and an 8.6% increase in depletions, ultimately strengthening its position as the top brand across the entire U.S. beer market and dollar sales fiscal year-to-date. The broader Modelo brand family also delivered phenomenal results, with Cheladas achieving 50% volume growth in tracked channels and an increase in depletions of over 40%, while Oro continues to build on a solid launch, increasing its share gains in the overall beer category and performing in line with our plans for the fiscal year. Beyond Modelo, our Corona Extra and Pacifico core beer brands also continued to perform strongly. Corona Extra delivered solid low single-digit growth in depletions and tracked channel volumes and was the number six share gainer in the category, while Pacifico achieved 15% depletion growth tracked channel volume growth of approximately 27% and was the number 11 top share gainer in tracked channels. Our beer brands continue to resonate strongly with the consumer, driving demand for our brands in the second quarter, which supported double-digit net sales and operating income growth in our beer business. This gives us confidence to shift our fiscal ‘24 net sales and operating income guidance for the beer business to the higher end of our initial ranges that is 8% to 9% and 6% to 7% growth, respectively. That said, it is important to remember that for our beer business, we indicated that only 45% of total volume for the fiscal year will be shipped in the second half, which aligns with the regular seasonality of beer demand in the U.S. and the timing of our brewery maintenance activities. Beyond fiscal ‘24, we continue to see significant opportunities to maintain the growth momentum of our beer business, particularly due to the resilience of key secular trends in the consumer landscape like ongoing consumer-led premiumization across beverage alcohol and the continued outsized growth of the Hispanic population in the U.S. as well as the relentless focus of our beer business on closing the distribution and awareness gaps that still exist across our brands and on developing and scaling new and exciting products aligned with consumer-led trends. We look forward to sharing more details on this compelling outlook at our upcoming Investor Day on November 2. Moving on to Wine and Spirits. Our Wine and Spirits business continues to make headway on its vision to become a bold and innovative higher-end market leader. In the second quarter, our largest premium wine brands, Meiomi and Kim Crawford outperformed their corresponding category segments in U.S. tracked channels. They both increased their respective share in the overall line category. Our largest Fine Wine & Craft Spirits brands, the Prisoner Wine Company and our Mi Campo tequila brand also outperformed their corresponding luxury wine and higher-end spirits category segments. Notably, all of the individual brands just referenced also delivered solid depletion growth rates in the second quarter. Our Wine and Spirits business also continues to advance the renovation of its mainstream brands to address the headwinds to corresponding category segments at faced over several recent quarters. While there is certainly more work to be done here, in U.S. tracked channels, the year-over-year dollar sales decline for Woodbridge improved relative to the first quarter and SVEDKA's overall share remained relatively stable when compared to the first quarter. All of that said, our Wine and Spirits business continued to face lower demand primarily for our mainstream brands, reflecting continued consumer-led premiumization trends noted in prior occasions, which in turn affected overall performance in the second quarter. Nevertheless, we are reiterating guidance for the full year and continue to expect fiscal '24 organic net sales to remain relatively stable and operating income growth of 2% to 4%. As we shared when we provided our outlook for fiscal '24, we see the year as a tale of two halves for the wine and spirits business, with 55% of planned volume is being delivered in the second half and operating performance projected to accelerate over the rest of the year due to other key factors. We expect to benefit from the more proactive quarterly shipment and depletion rebalancing actions we have undertaken this year versus our single downward shipment adjustment in Q4 of last year. We also anticipate an uplift in our direct-to-consumer channels and improved mix from incremental ASPIRA shipments in line with seasonality, as well as benefits from recent price increases. Ultimately, we also expect to see operating margins meaningfully accelerate due to the improved sales trends just described and the resulting positive operating leverage. Before I conclude, it would be remiss not to highlight our consistent execution against our capital allocation priorities. We continue to make progress towards our reduced net leverage ratio of approximately 3 times with a 400 basis point reduction since the increase resulting from the financing of our Class B common stock reclassification last November. Importantly, our proactive management of the incremental debt from the reclassification now puts us on track to deliver lower interest expense than initially anticipated for fiscal ‘24. And in turn, we now anticipate higher reported and comparable earnings per share, excluding Canopy, in the ranges of $9.60 to $9.80 and $12.00 to $12.20, respectively, for the full year. In terms of cash returns to our shareholders, our dividend payout ratio for the second quarter remained aligned with our 30% target. While we did not conduct any additional share repurchases in Q2, we have executed $35 million year-to-date in line with our goal to at least offset dilution. Lastly, our brewery expansions are progressing as planned, including Veracruz, and we continue to develop and bring these online with the flexibility enabled by our modular approach. Before I conclude, I also want to again take an opportunity during our second quarter call to highlight the upcoming release of our annual ESG Impact Report in a few weeks. This report seeks to provide a comprehensive review of our strategy, initiatives, targets and performance to address pressing environmental and societal needs that are important to our business, consumers, communities, employees and broader stakeholders. In particular, as noted in our last two calls, we have already surpassed our target of restoring 1.1 billion gallons of withdrawals from local watersheds and are looking forward to showcasing the initiatives in our beer business that drove most of this achievement and to share more details on our new target in our upcoming ESG impact report. I invite all of you to spend some time reviewing this report when it is released, which will be available through our company website. In closing, I'd like to leave you with four main takeaways from this quarter. First, our beer business continues to outperform the industry and the acceleration of its performance since the beginning of the year has given us confidence to shift our outlook for fiscal '24 to the higher end of our initial net sales and operating income growth expectations. And just as critical, we remain equally confident about the long-term runway for our higher-end brand portfolio. Number two, the benefits of our Wine and Spirits strategy continue to take hold, we expect the net sales growth and operating income growth of that business to ramp up through the remainder of fiscal '24. And as we look to the coming years, we anticipate our Wine and Spirits business to further gain momentum and achieve stronger results. Number three, we are persistently delivering on our capital allocation priorities, maintaining discipline and balance to yield value and returns, and we remain committed to building on the consistent track record we've established with these priorities over the past few years. And finally, number four, we are excited to be sharing more of these important topics with you at our upcoming Investor Day in four weeks' time. And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results for Q2 in more detail. Garth?
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect the ongoing disciplined execution of our strategic initiatives and our relentless focus on continuing to deliver growth while enhancing our performance. As Bill noted, we achieved yet another strong quarter with double-digit net sales and operating income growth in our beer business while our Wine and Spirits business delivered solid performance across its largest premium, fine wine and craft spirits brands, which partially offset the category headwinds affecting our mainstream brands. We also continue to generate strong cash flow results and execute against our consistent and balanced capital allocation priorities. Now let's review our Q2 fiscal '24 results in more detail where I will mainly focus on comparable basis financial results. To begin, our beer business increased net sales by 12%, representing an uplift of $253 million. This was driven primarily by volume growth of 8.7% as demand for our Beer brands accelerated through the first half of the fiscal year. This growth also benefited from favorable pricing, which contributed $59 million of the overall net sales increase. As a reminder, we continue to expect pricing to account for 1% to 2% of our net sales increase this fiscal year from the combination of the wraparound impact from the significant pricing actions taken in Q3 of fiscal '23 and targeted pricing actions we are taking in fiscal 2024. For the second quarter of fiscal '24, beer shipment volume and depletions were generally in line with one another, and I'm pleased to report that our inventories are at healthy levels to support the ongoing growth of our brands. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at 7.9%, reflecting a successful summer selling season, driven by ongoing consumer demand across our industry-leading beer portfolio as evidenced by our share gain acceleration; execution of our distribution and marketing strategies, including extending our category leadership across the key summer season and continued positive results from our Shopper-First Shelf initiative; and lastly, the accelerated growth in share gains across our core and emerging markets. Before moving to on-premise performance, I'd like to take a moment to explain a notable recent development in off-premise channel observation. As many of you are aware, Circana tracked channel volume growth has historically been above depletion growth by a low single-digit variance. However, more recently, that variance has expanded to the mid-single-digit range as independent retailers not captured by Circana data have lagged in reversing the additional pricing they took beyond our October fiscal '23 pricing actions. We believe this has led certain consumers to ship from these independent retailers to chain retailers offering more competitive consumer pricing. While the shift in these variances has no impact on the overall demand of our brands we continue to monitor channel performance and plan to provide further updates or insights needed to reconcile tracked channel data with our overall performance as warrant. As a reminder, Circana captures approximately 50% of our total beer volumes. Shifting back to the on-premise channel, depletions were essentially flat year-over-year and accounted for approximately 10.3% of our total beer volume. Please note that while we did have some minor disruptions in our supply of kegs during the second quarter, this Q1 to Q2 step down largely reflects a normal seasonal pattern that we have seen in previous years. Importantly, while there is some disruption in the near-term, we are currently producing and shipping tags and fully expect to offset the impact of the disruptions as swiftly as possible. Looking forward to the second half of the year, as Bill noted, approximately 45% of our volumes will ship in the second half of the year, as a result of it being our lower volume period. In addition, our Q3 shipment volumes are also normally more subdued due to routine maintenance activities. Lastly, from a pricing perspective, we will start to overlap the uplift we saw from significant incremental pricing actions taken in October of fiscal '23. Nonetheless, as we have previously stated, we fully expect our full year shipments and depletions to be largely in line, both on an absolute and a year-over-year growth basis by fiscal year-end. In regards to selling days, they were flat year-over-year for the quarter, please note, for the remainder of fiscal '24, Q3 sales days will be flat year-over-year, and there will be one more selling day in Q4. Now let me review beer margins. For Q2, operating margin decreased by 60 basis points to 39.9%. This decrease was driven mostly by the ongoing inflationary pressures in our COGS as we faced an overall cost increase of approximately 17%. The largest drivers of these cost increases came from packaging and raw materials, incremental costs related to a voluntary product recall of select kegs for quality assurance. And higher depreciation that amounted to $12 million or a 24% increase. To mitigate the inflationary and depreciation pressures, we continue to work across the business on cost efficiency and operational productivity programs that yielded meaningful and sustainable benefits. Building on the $30 million of net savings delivered by these initiatives in the first quarter, we realized an approximately $20 million in incremental net savings, in the second quarter. In addition to our cost-saving initiatives, we incurred margin benefits from the following. A $4 million or 2% decrease in marketing expense, primarily driven by the divestiture of our craft beer business. Marketing as a percent of sales came in at 7.1% for the quarter and a $3 million or 3% decrease in SG&A expense, which was primarily the result of favorable foreign currency impacts. Regarding Q2, our marketing spend as a percent of net sales was outside of our previously stated algorithm of 9% to 10%. As usual, part of this relatively lower percentage in Q2 and is a reflection of the strong volume and therefore, net sales performance of the business due to category seasonality. However, the impact of the reduction in marketing due to the previously noted exit from craft beer has further lowered that percentage. For the full year, we now expect to be closer to the lower end of our stated range of 9% to 10% of net sales due to the craft beer divestitures and our continued focus on ensuring our large marketing investments are prioritized to the highest return areas in our portfolio. As a result of the acceleration in the growth of Beer Business since the beginning of the year, we are shifting our expectations for fiscal '24 to the higher end of our initial ranges, resulting in an 8% to 9% expected increase in net sales growth and a 6% to 7% and expected increase in operating income growth. Now, moving on to our Wine and Spirits Business. In line with the reshaping of our Wine and Spirits Business to a higher-end portfolio of offerings, we continue to benefit from the solid performance of our largest premium wine, fine wine, and craft spirits brands. Meiomi, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner Wine Company, and Mi Campo, which as Bill noted, outperformed the corresponding categories in tracked channels and delivered solid depletion growth. While we are pleased with the results with these leading higher-end brands, our overall Wine and Spirits organic net sales were down 11%, driven primarily by the category headwinds we continue to face from the performance of our volumetrically larger mainstream brands, Woodbridge and SVEDKA. Our plans to renovate Woodbridge and SVEDKA, are underway, and our Wine and Spirits leadership team is looking forward to sharing updates on this progress at our upcoming Investor Day. Shipments on an organic basis decreased by 15% and depletions decreased by approximately 8%. As a reminder, approximately 55% of the Wine and Spirits sales are anticipated to occur in the second half of the year, where we also expect to see consumer-led premiumization mixed shift towards the higher end to continue, supporting what we believe will be a notable acceleration in the growth trajectory of the business for the remainder of the year. Wine and Spirits operating income, excluding the gross profit less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following their divestiture, was down 12% and operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 18.2%, also reflecting the same exclusion. The margin decline was primarily driven by the volume declines of our mainstream brands and partially offset by lower material costs, primarily from sustainable packaging projects, supply chain savings, and lower marketing spend as we continue to focus on higher return areas of our portfolio. As we look forward, we continue to expect the Wine and Spirits Business to significantly improve its net sales growth trajectory for the remainder of the fiscal year through a combination of increased contributions from our higher-end portfolio, as well as incremental pricing actions. We expect this acceleration in net sales growth, combined with our continued cost reductions and marketing efficiency initiatives to also support our operating income growth targets. As a result, we remain confident in the outlook for wine and spirits for the year and our guidance for that business for fiscal '24 remains unchanged. Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Corporate expense was approximately $67 million, an overall reduction of 19% when compared to the prior year, primarily driven by reduced spend in the second wave of our digital business acceleration program, lower headcount-related costs and lower compensation and benefits post our reclassification transaction. Interest expense for the quarter was approximately $111 million, a 17% increase from the prior year, driven by higher weighted average interest rates on the portion of our debt with adjustable rates, which is approximately 5% of our debt obligations and higher average borrowings due to the financing of the share reclassification. However, we now expect interest expense for the full year to be approximately $460 million roughly $40 million lower than our prior guidance due to refinancing actions for some of our higher interest debt and faster-than-expected deleveraging throughout the year. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.2 times excluding Canopy equity earnings and expect to continue to make progress towards our three times ratio target over the coming quarters. Our comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings for the quarter was 17.8% versus 20.3% last year. For fiscal '24, we continue to expect the comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings to be approximately 19%. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the second quarter year-to-date of fiscal '24, we generated free cash flow of $1 billion, a 15% decrease versus prior year, driven by a 34% increase in CapEx investments attributable to the capacity expansions at our Nava and Obregon facilities and the construction of our new brewery located in Veracruz. As of Q2, we have fully commissioned our latest additional brewing capacity project at our Obregon facility and now have approximately 47 million hectoliters of capacity across our two breweries. Looking ahead, we remain on track to bring our ABA facility online at Nava towards the end of this fiscal year. And the development of our additional expansion at Obregon and our third brewery site at Veracruz are advancing as planned. We continue to expect fiscal '24 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, reflective of operating cash flow between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion and CapEx of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. Our comparable EPS for the quarter, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, was $3.80 as a result of the continued profitable and disciplined growth we have seen this year, we are raising fiscal '24 reported EPS guidance to between $9.60 and $9.80 and comparable EPS guidance, excluding Canopy equity and earnings to be between $12 and $12.20. And finally, our announced dividend of $0.89 a share will result in approximately $163 million returned to shareholders for the quarter. In closing, I'd like to say that our entire team continues to execute and deliver against our strategic priorities. We demonstrated solid execution in the first half of fiscal '24 and as we enter the back half of the year, we plan to remain disciplined as we seek to drive long-term profitable growth and enhanced shareholder value. Our management team is excited to meet with many of you this coming November as we lay out our medium and long-term ambitions and vision for Constellation Brands at our Investor Day. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Vivien Azer: Hi, thank you. Good morning.
Bill Newlands: You bet.
Vivien Azer: So, obviously, very strong one half results in the year. I've been getting a lot of questions on why the positive revision to guidance wasn't a little bit more robust. And, obviously, Bill, you laid out some of the factors to contemplate from a shipment perspective as well as from the lapping of pricing that Garth called out as well. But is there anything incremental that you can offer in terms of your outlook for the category in the back half that might have informed a little bit more caution as well? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: No. We remain very positive about the back half of the year. The critical things that are important relative to our back half is normal seasonality. We only do 45% in the back half, we do our maintenance in Q3, which always limits Q3 somewhat. And we're going against pricing from last year that won't largely be repeated combined with the normal sales buildup ahead of price increases that occurred again in Q3 last year. But let's just keep in mind, when you look at the takeout data you see in tracked channels, our four-week numbers are very consistent with the 52-week numbers. This is an ongoing growth story that we have a lot of confidence in, which is why we raised our expectations for the year in beer. We expect to have a very strong second half.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping to see if you can comment a bit on the shelf resets in the category are large, how you're seeing consumers, I understand the CAG situation and the on-premise consumption. Just hearing, obviously, the shift in market share and you were a beneficiary and you have been doing a lot of work for a long, long time in the shelf resets. And so if you can comment on that, how you're looking at as you go into the spring resets in the large boxes as well as what's happening in the on-premise? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Certainly. We certainly expect to see a strong reset period. You know, there's some limited resets that occur here in the fall. Most of those occur in the spring. Our confidence around that drives primarily from the sheer velocities that we have within our key brands. No, our portfolio is second to none in terms of delivering against velocities. And those have been consistent year-on-year, which gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to continue to see shelf set gains. Retailers are very smart about this, and they recognize where the growth and velocity is coming from and that will work strongly to our advantage as those resets occur.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Nik Modi: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Bill Newlands: Hi, Nik.
Nik Modi: Bill, I was hoping you can -- hey, how are you? I was hoping you can just comment on systems and supply chain volume. And I ask this question because a lot of your growth is coming in areas that were not really driving your growth, let's call it, 5 to 10 years ago. So getting the right volume in the right place at the right time requires some adjustment and probably some systems overhaul. So I just -- I was wondering if A, if that is a valid point to be making; and B, if it is, what you're doing internally to make sure that you can actually have the most optimized supply chain?
Bill Newlands: Certainly. A couple of things stand out, Nik, around this. As you know, a few years ago, we literally had no redundancy in the system. We now do, and that certainly provides much greater flexibility in terms of our operations footprint to do a number of things. One is to make sure we're able to keep up with our increasing demand that we consistently see on our business and in a scenario where something is accelerating at a greater pace than what we had anticipated. We can react to that. I think, A, that's very strong. Secondly, as you know, we made some significant investments in our digital business efforts and those are really paying dividends in terms of our supply chain capability as well. That has significantly refined our ability to make sure we have the right supply chain capabilities all the way through the supply chain. So, I'd say both of those things have been critically important. In fact, and I know you'll be there -- you'll get a chance to hear about this in some depth during our Investor Meeting on November 2nd. We think this is a critical factor that's been important to our continuing ability to maintain and meet the significant increase in demand that we've seen and we'll go into that in a fair amount of detail on November 2nd.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Dara Mohsenian: Hi, good morning, guys.
Bill Newlands: Hi, Dara.
Dara Mohsenian: So just two quick clarity questions. The mid-single-digit gap versus Circana data that you saw in this quarter in terms of depletions, do you think that lingers? Might that close back towards the low single-digit gap going forward? Just conceptually, how do you think about that? And in your answer to Andrea's question around shelf space, is there more opportunity this year than a typical year, just given ABI's business is obviously falling off unexpectedly after the spring reset. So, do you think about the shelf space opportunity as greater than typical, just given those dynamics? And there may be greater shifts, even if your business doesn't compete as much directly head-to-head versus them?
Bill Newlands: Yes. Sure, Dara. On the first point, the question of whether or not the sort of mid-single-digit continues, I think, remains to be seen. Certainly, as Garth noted at Barclays, and we said during our prepared remarks, it's more than it has usually been so whether or not it refers to the norm of what we usually see, which is sort of lower single-digit remains to be seen, and obviously, one that we watch carefully. Relative to the shelf sets, yes, we think this is going to be a great opportunity for us for all the reasons I answered earlier, which is our velocities are second to none. And we fully expect that we're going to be able to expand our presence. That also impacts some of our new product development. If you think about Oro, I mean, Oro is off to an excellent start much in line with what our expectations were.  And that also gives us a chance to expand our shelf presence because we expect that, that particular brand using that example is going to get more shelf space. The last thing I would say, and I got to call out Chelada’s, because Chelada's has just been absolutely on fire. And our additional sizes and variety pack in those -- in that particular category, again, gives us chance outside of the core beer set to also gain more shelf space. So we need to think about this very broadly because we expect to gain both in what I would call the core beer shelf as well as the ancillary beer shelf as well with things like Chelada.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Gerald Pascarelli: Great. Thanks very much. It's a macro-related question. Bill, one of the questions we get a lot is on student loan repayments. They're going to resume this month after a three-year pause. So just how are you thinking about the impact from that, maybe the potential for down trading, just obviously given some of the premium price points on your beer products? Any color there would be great. Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Yes. That, again, is one of those things that I think remains to be seen. One of the important things that we see with our brands is the consumer loyalty that is attached to those brands. Taking Modelo as an example, we over-index with the Hispanic community and the Hispanic community has tremendous brand loyalty to Modelo. Also with Corona. Corona is a much broader-based demographic, but that we continue to say it's the most loved beer because it is. I think that's critically important. People make choices all the time about where they're going to spend their discretionary income. And brand strength is critically important about how people make those judgments. So specifically to your question, it remains to be seen, but we feel very confident in our ability to see our brands continue to gain traction simply because there's so much brand loyalty attached to them.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
Nadine Sarwat: Hi. Two questions for me, please. Coming back to Modelo Oro. Could you share some -- any updated data points that you have, especially, when it comes to cannibalization? And how would you characterize that incremental consumer? And then just one final question on that voluntary ad product recall. Can you quantify the impact that this has had in the quarter, both on top-line and on the margins? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure. As I noted earlier, we only had a couple of SKUs in Oro, but it's off to a really good start. And the cannibalization rates were less than we had anticipated and, frankly, less than they were in the three test markets that we had originally run. So we're very positive about that. One place where we're seeing disproportionate pickup on that particular sub-brand of Oro is in the Hispanic community. We've been very pleased by the takeaway in critical, large Hispanic markets, how Oro has done and as we continue to build that out, you'll see additional SKUs coming next year, which we believe will help to continue to accelerate that brand's growth. And if the cannibalization rates stay where they have been, it's going to be better than we had initially anticipated. Garth, do you want to handle the second one?
Garth Hankinson: Yes. And just on the CAG recall, the impact was entirely in the cost of goods as related to shipping and destruction of products as well as the initial cost to produce the product. It's -- it wasn't a material movement for us for the quarter. There'll be a little bit more detail in the 10-Q on that, and you can find it there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Bryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone.
Bill Newlands: Good morning.
Bryan Spillane: So I guess a little bit of perspective maybe on -- and this may be a little bit of a follow-up from one of the earlier questions, but just we're getting a lot of questions about demand elasticity, consumer tolerance of inflation. So can you just give us a little bit of perspective for both your beer business and also in wine and spirits, just what kind of economizing behavior might you be seeing? Again, is it like buying more in chain convenience versus independents or choices people are making on packaging. Just as you're kind of looking forward, just kind of where we are on economizing behavior and how you might have to adapt or adjust to that?
Bill Newlands: Yes. So I think this points out to where our judicious approach to pricing has been spot on. We've said consistently -- in fact, we got questions about that on prior calls at times about why we weren't taking more price. Our view has consistently been 1% to 2% annually. We were a little more than that the last couple of years, but 1% to 2% is the consistent way that we look at it, and we look at it market-by-market, SKU-by-SKU. The rationale for that is quite simple. It's much easier to keep your consumer than to have to go get them again, if you have lost them. I think in this particular instance, as you point out, people are careful. We're seeing less -- more trips, but somewhat less purchasing per trip than we used to see, which simply means people are being a little more careful about what they do, given the inflationary environment that exists. I think the important part for us is the fact that even though there are more trips, they are making more trips to purchase more of our brands, even if they might spend a little less on any particular trip, again, that speaks to what I just replied to on the prior question, which is about our brand loyalty and about the consistent consumer dynamics that really works to our advantage over the long run. So again, I think the critical element to that is our judicious pricing approach over time is one that's going to do us very well when you're in a consumer environment that people are a little bit more concerned or a little bit more nervous about the inflationary environment. And I think that's going to work to our advantage as we go forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your questions.
Chris Carey: Hi, everyone. Garth, can you just comment on how inflation is coming in relative to your expectations entering the year, puts and takes. I asked this in the context of your comments around marketing coming in at the low end of the historical range for the full year. And I would just be curious on how you view gross margin delivery in the quarter relative to expectations with any context on the back half of the year? But -- so anyway, high level, just trying to get some context around how costs are running relative to what you were thinking going and maybe you can frame how this delivery is coming in, again, relative to your going expectations? Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. Thanks, Chris. Look, as a reminder, we expect our beer operating margin for this fiscal year to be around 38%. That remains unchanged. And as it relates specifically to Q2, Q2 is historically traditionally our higher -- our highest margin quarter given the volume associated with Q2. And so in the second half of the year, obviously, we're going to continue to face inflationary pressures that we've had all year long. We are seeing some easing in inflation as expected as we've gone through the year. Unfortunately, while we've seen some improvement in inflation, we've also seen a strengthening peso kind of hold up. And so any improvement that we had due to inflation has been really offset by the strength of the peso. And then again, in the second half of the year, because of the historically lower volume that we have in that half, there will be an impact, obviously, to fixed cost absorption as well as COGS and marketing and additionally, incremental depreciation as we brought on over gone partway through the year. And then as Bill noted in his remarks, it scheduled maintenance that we traditionally do in the second half of the year as well as the overlapping and the pricing benefits last year. So all in, I mean, those are sort of the factors that will contribute to the 38% margin for the full year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Lauren, are you self-muted?
Bill Newlands: Hello, Lauren.
Operator: Lauren, unfortunately, we can't hear you. Are you muted? I will move on and Lauren…
Bill Newlands: I think come back again.
Operator: You got it. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.
Rob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on your productivity programs, the specific buckets that you've addressed that you're targeting? And is this something that is potentially a multiyear process of system optimization? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Thanks, Robert. Yes, I would say that our cost savings and efficiency initiatives certainly are multiyear in nature. Obviously, we communicated earlier this year in Q1, we had taken $30 million out and then this year, an incremental $20 million for this quarter, I should say, an incremental $20 million. We're always looking at ways to sort of prove productivity create efficiencies in the business, whether that's through supply chain and procurement or operations.  Examples of that over time have been things like double stacking rail cars and the use of plastic pallets optimizing the location of inventory, as Bill referenced in response to a question earlier, improved purchasing in terms of raw materials, through better contract management and negotiations, as well as more effective and efficient use of our marketing spend. So it's absolutely something that the organization is focused on a year-on-year basis. And certainly, we will share a lot more detail on our cost savings initiatives for both our beer and our Wine and Spirits businesses at our upcoming Investor Day.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Filippo Falorni: Hi, good morning, everyone. Bill, you mentioned that the last four-week trends has been very strong and consistent with the last 52 weeks. Can you give a little bit maybe more color on the performance of your business in September. And then at the industry level, one of your competitors, the Investor Day mentioned that September for the industry is particularly sluggish, particularly last couple of weeks as you cycle the shipments ahead of the price increases in the last year. So maybe some color on the timing of shipments into September into Q3 would be helpful. Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure. When I look at the most recent Circana data for four weeks, our total beer business is up 13.7%, which is very consistent with what the 52 weeks. That's what I was alluding to in my prior comments around that. Certainly, as we also noted, we expected that we would see some element of tightness during the course of the beginning of this quarter that we are in purely because we are lapping the October price increases that occurred last year and some of the prebuild that people do the retailers do ahead of any price increases that existed. All of that's consistent with what we've expected. And we expect, as we've said, the reason we raised the -- our guidance expectation around beer is because we expect to have a very strong back half of the year despite a couple of these headwinds that certainly exist.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Strelzik: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. My question is on capital allocation and in particular, around buybacks. And I think you noted no buybacks during the quarter but being on track for your target to offset dilution year-to-date. I guess, my question though is what's the appetite for buybacks in excess of that, particularly given the momentum in the business, the strong cash flow generation. How are you thinking about that now versus where you were at the beginning part of the year and moving forward? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Yes. So capital allocation is obviously something that we're going to discuss in greater detail at our upcoming Investor Day. But just broadly speaking, I would say, for this fiscal year, as we noted when we entered this year, we were going to at least buy back the dilution that occurred throughout the year. But this year, we are also prioritizing getting our leverage ratio back to our target of 3.0 versus where it was at an elevated state as a result of the reclassification. That said, we're always looking to be flexible and agile as conditions allow for. So something we continually look at. And just as a reminder, we do have $800 million remaining under our current board authorization. So in the event that we decide we want to be a bit more active, we have the ability to do so.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Lauren Lieberman: Hi. Can you hear me?
Bill Newlands: We do.
Garth Hankinson: We can.
Bill Newlands: Part two.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay, hooray. Okay, cool. Sorry about that, I don't know what happened, but just quickly, I was going to ask about wine industry growth. And just against the backdrop of your comments on Woodbridge/SVEDKA, obviously not wine, and then the higher end brands performance. But just as you think about the path forward, not just second half, but into next year and so on, how do you think about wine industry growth, wine versus beer versus spirits? I'm guessing we'll get into this a bit more the Investor Day, but I was just curious if you could preview a bit your view on kind of that long-term growth in wine? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Yes, certainly, Lauren. It's really the tale of two cities. The lower end piece of the business, what we refer to as mainstream, has been very challenged. It's down mid to high single-digits, which obviously is somewhat challenging for us because we do have significant involvement with that category still even though we have divested a number of brands that played in that category. So that certainly is a very different answer than what I would say to you about the higher end portion of the business, where brands like Naomi and Kim Crawford and High West and Booker and things of that nature are all significantly outperforming our plans and expectations and gaining share. You're right. We'll talk about that at Investor Day. The other thing I keep in mind, unlike beer, which is about 45% in the second half, it's directly the flip when it comes to wine. That's 55% in the second half. And as we do, and a disproportionate amount of our business comes from ASPIRA and which much more relates to vintage releases those all tend to occur in the second half which again weights our business toward the back half the year versus the first half the year. And the other one I would just point out which I think is important to recognize. We made the choice as we said early this year that we were going to balance our ships and depletes all year long, as opposed to doing it once in the fourth quarter which is what we did last year That creates a bit of a challenge in the early part of our fiscal year, but gives us a significant improvement proposition in the back half of the year, as that won't occur as it did last year, creating a disproportionate shipment number in the fourth quarter last year, which won't be the case and we will be going against a much better proposition this year. So all in I think the wine business certainly has seen some challenges, but much like we see in the higher end of the beer business. The higher end portion of the category is much stronger and certainly our business in that sector is performing very nicely against category norms. And you're right we will go into all of that in much more depth during our investor discussion on November 2.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Bill Newlands for any closing comments.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, and thank you all again for joining our call today. We're very pleased with our performance in the first half of fiscal 2024. As anticipated, our beer business further accelerated during its seasonally strongest period of the year to deliver excellent results. In our Wine and Spirits portfolio, our higher-end brands continued to outperform and track channels, and we're looking forward to an acceleration in the growth of that business over the second half. All told, we remain confident in our outlook for the full year and have tightened the expectations for growth in our beer business at the higher-end of the initial range, while increasing our overall EPS outlook as we drove interest expense lower due to our proactive debt management. In closing, I would like to encourage you to tune in for our upcoming Investor Day on November 2nd, where we will be sharing our latest perspective on the medium-term outlook for our business. You will find further details on how to access this event through our Investor Relations website at ir.cbrands.com. Thank you again for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing most of you, if not all of you, November 2.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2023-06-30 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Constellation Brands Q1 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Joe Suarez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Joe.
Joe Suarez: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, all, and welcome again to Constellation Brands' Q1 fiscal 2024 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Following the call, we'll once again be making available in the Investors section of our company's website, a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today's call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, I'd like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person as noted, which will help us end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2024, with a solid first quarter. Our Beer Business delivered net sales growth of 11%, mainly driven by continued strong volume growth in line with our medium-term algorithm. As anticipated, depletion performance accelerated throughout the quarter, resulting in a 5.5% increase for the period and acceleration that has continued into June, supported by our beer team's unrelenting push to increase distribution for our high-growth, high-velocity brands, continued incremental investments in marketing focused on the highest return opportunities and ongoing strong demand for our high-end Mexican beer brands aligned with consumer-led premiumization trends. Particularly in large markets with significant runway for Modelo Especial, like Texas, Florida, Illinois and North Carolina with the brand posted double-digit dollar sales growth in Circana track channels. And yes, also in California, where our share gains actually accelerated and as expected, demand for our portfolio did ramp up after the unseasonably cold weather in early March. All in, our Beer Business delivered strong growth for the quarter, while consistently advancing all four areas of our strategic initiatives. First, the business continued to propel its powerful core brands that people love. Modelo Especial remained the number one dollar share gainer in the entire beer category, delivered double-digit dollar sales growth in tracked channels, and as most of you likely already are aware, became the number one beer in America in dollar sales during the first quarter. Both Corona Extra and Pacifico also achieved share gains and delivered dollar sales growth of approximately 4% and 26%, respectively. Second, our beer innovations, which are still centered around the flavor and betterment consumer-led trends are off to a great start. Our Modelo Chelada brands remained a top 10 dollar share gainer with further support from our variety pack launched last year, the number four new product in Circana channels and from the launch of new Sandía Picante flavor, the number five new brand. Modelo Oro was also a top 10 share gainer and incrementally has actually been slightly above what we saw in initial test markets. And Corona NA was the number one share gainer in the non-alcoholic beer category in tracked channels. Third, the expansions of our beer brewing capacity continued to advance as planned. Our latest modular addition to Obregon successfully ramped up in Q1 and we are on track with the new ABA facility at Nava for Q4 of this fiscal year. At Veracruz, site development and construction work are underway, and we expect that to build up through this year and next. And fourth, the ESG efforts of our Beer Business further drove progress on our company-wide goals, particularly those on water stewardship. As noted in our last call, we recently surpassed our target of restoring 1.1 billion gallons of withdrawals from local water sheds. The initiatives in our Beer Business drove most of this achievement, and we plan to announce a new water target later this fiscal year. Building on our existing water and emissions targets, we also recently announced two new commitments focused on reducing waste and enhancing our use of circular packaging. In support of that commitment, within our Beer Business, we plan to attain a true zero waste to landfill certification for our breweries in Mexico and replace hi-cone plastic rings with recyclable paperboard for all applicable four and six pack SKUs. Similarly, within our Wine and Spirits Business, we also plan to attain the same certification for our key U.S. operations, as well as reducing our packaging to product weight ratio by 10% and ensure that 80% of the business packaging is returnable, recyclable or renewable. With that, let's turn more fully to our Wine and Spirits Business. As noted previously, over the last few years, the Wine and Spirits Business has strategically shifted its portfolio to a bold, innovative and higher-end product mix that continues to be driven by consumer-led premiumization. In Q1, the higher-end wine portion of the business gained share in the U.S. wine category and outpaced the dollar sales growth of the corresponding segment and tracked channels. Meiomi and Kim Crawford, the portfolio's largest premium wine brands and The Prisoner Wine Company, the largest fine wine brand group were main drivers of this strong performance. The innovation efforts across these brands also continued to deliver excellent results with Meiomi Bright, the brand's lower alcohol, lower calorie offering aligned with consumer-led betterment trend capturing the number one new brand spot in the category. In the main streamline portion of the business, the reinvention of Woodbridge is underway to address the growth headwinds and facing that segment of the category while keeping the brand's core consumers engaged. And while there is certainly more work to be done here, the brand's year-over-year dollar sales decline in U.S. tracked channels improved throughout the quarter. The overall spirits portfolio maintained its share in U.S. tracked channels with notably strong dollar sales performance across its higher-end tequila and RTD products. In particular, Mi Campo tequila and High West ready-to-drink cocktails, both delivered significant double-digit dollar sales growth. Beyond the evolution of the portfolio over the last few years, the Wine and Spirits Business has also been investing in capabilities to accelerate its performance in key growth channels. This omni-channel focus has provided additional pillars of consumer-led growth such as international and direct-to-consumer. The latter of which grew the channel's net sales 13% in Q1. And in fact, the e-commerce and customer loyalty portions of our DT business - DTC business, pardon me, were up over 40% in Q1. From a volume perspective, the Wine and Spirits Business continued to face lower demand primarily for our mainstream brands, reflecting continued consumer-led premiumization trends noted earlier, which in turn affected top line performance. In the higher end line portion of our portfolio, our larger premium and luxury brands faced softer segment demand in April, but we did see solid acceleration in May, and that has continued into June. Meanwhile, in our spirits portfolio, our higher-end craft brands posted very strong depletion growth of 40%. The Wine and Spirits Business also delivered significant operating margin expansion in Q1, adjusted for the contribution after marketing of the divested brands. This further demonstrates the benefits of the strategic refocusing of the portfolio to higher end, higher growth, higher-margin brands and channels. To sum up the shift of the Wine and Spirits Business toward driving growth and margin improvement through its pivot to the higher-end brands and broader channels and markets, remains well on track. All in, we are confident in our outlook for the Wine and Spirits Business in fiscal 2024 as performance is expected to continue to accelerate throughout the course of the year, in line with seasonality and the business' annual plan, particularly as the share of net sales from our Aspira, Fine Wine and Craft Spirits portfolio increases over the coming quarter. In closing, I once more want to highlight that our solid performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was anchored by the consistent execution of the annual plans and strategic initiatives across both businesses. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review in more detail our financial results for the quarter.
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill noted, fiscal 2024 is off to a solid start. We steadily executed against our annual plans, remaining both focused and adaptable as the economic and consumer backdrop continue to evolve and we remain on track to deliver against our stated financial performance goals for this fiscal year. As Bill noted, our Beer Business achieved double-digit net sales growth and the higher-end segment of our Wine and Spirits Business outperformed the higher end of the wine category. We also continue to execute and deliver against our capital allocation priorities, and we are reiterating our guidance for the year. Now, let's review our Q1 fiscal 2024 results in more detail where I will mainly focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with the Beer Business. Net sales increased by $200 million representing an uplift of 11%. This was driven primarily by our volume growth of 7.5% as strong demand continued across our industry-leading portfolio. We also benefited from favorable pricing, which contributed $60 million of the overall net sales increase. Staying on the topic of price for just a moment, the incremental pricing we realized this quarter primarily reflects the wraparound impact from the elevated pricing taken in fiscal 2023 that was above our typical 1% to 2% algorithm. As a reminder, we expect pricing to account for 1% to 2% of our net sales increase this fiscal year, which represents the combined uplift from the wraparound impact and the average of any other additional pricing actions to be taken in fiscal 2024 on a market-by-market, channel-by-channel and SKU-by-SKU basis. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at 5.5%, which reflects a slower start but strong finish in the three-month period between March and May as growth significantly accelerated through the quarter, driven by the disciplined execution of our distribution and marketing plans, including during the key Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays, ongoing consumer led premiumization trends including solid buy rates for high-end beer. And as Bill noted, significant growth in several of our top five markets and beyond as well as improving conditions in California. These results give us confidence as we head into the peak summer selling season. Our largest brands, Modelo Especial and Corona Extra delivered mid-single-digit and low single-digit depletion growth, respectively. While our emerging brands, the Modelo Chelada brands and Pacifico each delivered double-digit depletion growth. On-premise depletions grew 3.2% and accounted for approximately 12.4% of total volume, reflecting more normalized year-over-year performance following the distortions caused by the pandemic closures and post-pandemic reopenings. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, shipment volume ran slightly ahead of the depletion volume on an absolute basis. Shipments were in line with our plan throughout the quarter, and depletions ultimately ramped up over the course of the three months, as previously noted. This difference in timing was the primary driver of the variance between shipment and depletion volumes. Additionally, as it has been the case historically, strong shipment volume in the first quarter also reflects inventory preparations with distributors and retailers for the peak busy summer season. That said, distributor inventories remain at normal seasonal levels, so we do not expect this variance to generate any further distortion in Q2 and expect both shipment and depletion volume to be aligned for the full fiscal year. Importantly, we also – we are also well-equipped with capacity flexibility to meet any incremental demand as we move through the year. In regards to selling days, they were flat year-over-year for the quarter. Please note that for fiscal 2024, there will be one more selling day in Q4. Moving on to beer margins. Operating margin decreased by 220 basis points to 38%. This decrease was primarily driven by continued inflationary headwinds in our COGS as we faced an overall cost increase of approximately 4% for the quarter. As anticipated in our guidance for the year, we continue to face higher packaging and raw materials, freight and overhead costs. In Q1, we experienced low double-digit percent increases in packaging and raw materials as inflationary pressures continued throughout the period, albeit at a declining rate over the three months. We also continue to face higher overhead costs related to our brewery expansion as well as increased logistics costs, largely related to higher shipment volumes. As we have previously stated, it is important to note that for fiscal 2024 and consistent with recent years, roughly 70% of our COGS are subject to annual pricing adjustments. These are based on trailing indicators, such as producer price indices and, therefore, typically reflect inflation from the preceding year. The remaining 30% of COGS are subject to fluctuations throughout the year and we can manage the volatility for about half of that 30% through our multi-year hedging program. Will our full year COGS expectations currently remain unchanged, we are monitoring closely any potential favorability in direct commodity and pass-through raw material prices for the approximately 15% non-hedged portion still subject to intra-year adjustments and will provide any relevant updates in future quarters. Additional operating margin headwinds for the beer business were comprised of a $29 million or 17% increase in marketing expense, primarily driven by ongoing media spend to build awareness of our core products as well as recent investments to support the new Modelo Oro product launch and as a result, please note that marketing as a percent of net sales came in at 9.5% for the quarter. A $15 million or 18% increase in SG&A expense which was primarily the result of increased legal costs and an $11 million or 16% increase in depreciation, almost entirely associated with our brewery capacity investments. To help offset the increase in cost to our Beer Business, we are executing on various levers to partially offset the full year high single-digit inflationary headwinds in our overall packaging, raw materials and logistics costs through productivity initiatives. These initiatives have yielded savings of over $30 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, and are focused on unlocking efficiencies and cost savings across procurement, operations and supply chain. For fiscal 2024, our guidance for the Beer Business remains unchanged as we continue to target 7% to 9% of net sales growth and operating income growth of 5% to 7%, implying an operating margin of approximately 38%. Now moving on to the Wine and Spirits Business. As Bill noted, over the last few years, our Wine and Spirits Business has been effectively shifting its portfolio to be more focused on higher-end brands that are better aligned with consumer-led premiumization trends while broadening sales channels to also expand into higher growth avenues. To that effect, please recall that we divested a collection of primarily mainstream wine brands from our portfolio during our third quarter in fiscal 2023. Accordingly, during today's discussion, I will be referring to the top line of the Wine and Spirits Business on an organic basis, which excludes the contribution from the divested brands. Consistent with the strategic transformation, the Wine and Spirits Business has undertaken the higher-end brands of the wine portfolio continue to resonate with the consumer and outperformed the corresponding segment of the category in the U.S. tracked channels in Q1. More recently, we've seen even greater strength in our three largest premium and fine wine brand families with Meiomi, Kim Crawford and the Prisoner Wine Company, showing dollar sales growth and acceleration in tracked channels. Similarly, we were also pleased to see the overall spirits portfolio deliver strong dollar sales growth in tracked channels led by Mi CAMPO, and High West ready-to-drink cocktails. However, Wine and Spirits organic net sales were down 6%, largely as a result of the continued impact of ongoing consumer-led premiumization affecting the entire category and the lapping of a particularly strong prior year first quarter for our higher-end brands due to distributor inventory balancing actions. From a channel perspective, we continue to see success through our direct-to-consumer efforts, which delivered 13% net sales growth in our overall DTC channel. While still small compared to the rest of our Wine and Spirits Business, this channel accounted for 4% of total net sales, an increase of 100% versus just a few years ago. Shipments on an organic basis decreased by 9% and depletions decreased by approximately 6%. As noted earlier, this volume decline was primarily driven by our mainstream brands, Woodbridge and SVEDKA, as their respective segments of the categories face ongoing growth headwinds driven by consumer-led premiumization. Again, the Wine and Spirits Business continues to diligently work on the reinvention of Woodbridge and SVEDKA to address these headwinds. In particular, SVEDKA declines have stabilized, and we continue to look at incremental opportunities to revitalize the brand and accelerate improvements. And more broadly, in our spirits portfolio, our craft brands posted nearly 40% depletion growth driven by Mi CAMPO, posting depletion growth of over 80%. Wine and Spirits operating income, excluding the gross profit less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business following their divestiture were relatively flat, and operating margin increased 90 basis points to 19%, also reflecting the same exclusion. The margin improvement was primarily driven by the favorable impact of the pricing actions taken last year that primarily focused on our higher-end brands, lower materials and packaging costs, including great blend optimization, lapping of higher freight and warehousing costs and lower marketing expense as we have streamlined our approach to marketing, focusing on the highest return areas of our portfolio. Looking ahead, we expect the performance of the Wine and Spirits Business to accelerate throughout the remainder of the fiscal year through the combination of increased growth contribution from the portfolio's higher end brands, which are already seeing depletions improve in line with our sales efforts and seasonal trends, ongoing growth in DTC channels as well as a return to growth in international markets. Lower marketing spend as we shift towards higher growth areas, focusing on the Aspira portfolio, and continued work toward a revitalization of SVEDKA and Woodbridge in the mainstream category. Accordingly, we remain confident in the outlook for Wine and Spirits, for the year and our guidance for that business for fiscal 2024 remains unchanged. Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Starting with corporate expense, which for the quarter was approximately $50 million from SG&A and overall corporate expense reduction of 19% when compared to the prior year and $33 million from unconsolidated investments related to Canopy and our Ventures portfolio investments. The overall corporate expense reduction is primarily driven by reduced spend in the second wave of our digital business acceleration program. I want to take a moment to talk briefly about the next wave of our digital business acceleration program. For fiscal 2024, our DBA program will have three main goals: first, scaling our prior year's focus areas of marketing, procurement and supply chain across the business; second, introducing a new focus area, logistics, which will center around improving end-to-end visibility, and planning as well as enhancing our network capabilities across the business; and third, reducing third-party consulting fees as we begin to shift the support of our DBA program to in-house, increasing efficiencies and reducing overall cost. Interest expense for the quarter was approximately $118 million. This is a 34% increase from the prior year driven by higher average borrowings and rising interest rates on approximately 10% of our debt with adjustable rates. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.5 times excluding Canopy equity and earnings and expect to continue to make progress towards our approximately 3 times ratio target throughout the year. Our comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings for the quarter was 20.7% versus 20.6% last year. For fiscal 2024, we continue to expect the comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings to be approximately 19%. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we generated free cash flow of $388 million, a 31% decrease versus prior year, driven by a 41% increase in CapEx investments driven primarily by the capacity expansions at our Nava and Obregon facilities and the construction of our new brewery located in Veracruz. Our capacity expansions are underway as planned. Of the planned additions for this year, we fully ramped up 5 million hectoliters at our Obregon facility in Q1 and are planning on another 5 million hectoliters to support our ABA production to be online at our Nava facility towards the end of fiscal 2024. In total, by the end of fiscal 2024, we expect to have about 52 million hectoliters of capacity online, which, as you recall, includes nearly 3 million hectoliters of additional capacity from operational efficiency initiatives executed last fiscal year. Looking ahead, as we continue to consider incremental operational opportunities for our production facilities, we will seek to ensure that we align our additional modular capacity expansions to the timing that best balances both any further enhancements to our existing production footprint and our expectations for continued strong demand for our brands. Turning to cash flow. We continue to expect fiscal 2024 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, reflective of operating cash flow between $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, and CapEx of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. Comparable EPS for the quarter, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, was $3.04 with an announced dividend of $0.89, bringing our dividend payout ratio to approximately 30% for the quarter. Our fiscal 2024 EPS comparable guidance of $11.70 to $12 remains unchanged. In closing, we believe that this solid start to fiscal 2024 sets us up for a great year ahead. We delivered net sales and volume growth in our Beer Business while implementing cost savings and efficiencies to help counteract the continued inflationary headwinds we face. Our Wine and Spirits Business is honing in on becoming a multichannel global competitor primarily focused on the higher end segment. The growth in our core businesses and execution against our strategies makes us enthusiastic about what the rest of the year will bring and the shareholder value we will be able to create. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
Dara Mohsenian: Hi guys.
Bill Newlands: Hi Dara.
Dara Mohsenian: So, you sounded pretty bullish about beer depletions towards the end of fiscal Q1 in May and June so far. I was just hoping for a little more detail there. And more specifically, if you can sort of juxtapose that versus the slowdown we have seen in the November to April timeframe. It does seem like a fairly sizable inflection in the other way. So, more detail there would be helpful. And just if these factors driving the better May and June look more extendable and how you think about that? And if I can slip in a second part that I'll pretend is related to the first part, just if industry pricing worsens going forward, given there's obviously a lot of potential changes on the ABI side, how do you think about domestic beer pricing as sort of the risk factor to your volume trends as you look going forward, if, in fact, there's any change from an industry backdrop standpoint? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure Dara. Let me cover that one. As we have told you before, March was a particularly challenging month. But as we've also noted, there was great acceleration. I think the easiest way to look at it is to look at Circana data. The 12-week is better than the 26th week. The 4-week is better than the 12-week. And as I noted this morning, the acceleration that we saw coming out of the first quarter is continuing into the second quarter, which I think is very positive. To give you some other perspective that I think would be important and I think people often ask, if you think about Modelo Especial, we had 24 states in the first quarter growing double-digits. In our Chelada business, we had 47 states grow double or triple-digits during the first quarter. And as we've already noted, those things were accelerating coming out of the quarter. So, I think we're quite comfortable that the largely challenging issues that we faced in sort of that winter time period are now behind us, and we're looking forward to a very strong summer period. Relative to your question about pricing, we haven't seen any particular challenges around pricing. In fact, as we run our normal drivers and drags, the effect of pricing has actually decreased in our business as we've gone through the early part of this year. As we've noted other times, we have not seen much trade down at all away from our business and believe that trend is likely to continue, given the strong consumer engagement with all of our brands.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is now live.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about on-premise trends, the depletion call out of 3%. It seems as a pretty deceleration versus Q1. So, maybe you just talk specifically to what you've been seeing in terms of on-premise trends later in the quarter? And if you've been talking about this acceleration, in our – excuse me in Circana data, that also applies to the on-premise. Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Lauren, on-premise is still not quite back to where we saw pre-pandemic. As we've said before, it was roughly 15% of our business pre-pandemic, and it's still in that 12% to 13% range, as we have come out of the pandemic. And it's probably been a little more volatile, the hit and miss compared to what you see in tracked channels. We believe it's going to continue to do well, and it's going to continue to improve over the course of the summer, as we put the final touches hopefully on the pandemic behind us, but it's admittedly not back to quite where it was ahead of time. The thing that we've often been very pleased about is we've seen many accounts in the on-premise get much more focused on well-known recognized brands. And obviously, whenever that happens, it's to our advantage because of the strength of those brands.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Peter Grom from UBS. Your line is now live.
Peter Grom: Thanks operator and good morning everyone. So I kind of wanted to ask about beer margins, maybe two-parts here. Maybe first, I think marketing was up almost 17% this quarter. And I think the expectation in the initial guidance was for a low single-digit increase for marketing for the year. So I guess, how should we think about the phasing of marketing spend moving forward? And I guess has the outlook changed at all, given the high-teens increase in one or two? And then just related, you mentioned that monitoring some favorability across some of your key inputs and we'll provide an update later. But I guess, conceptually, should there be any capability in those in would you anticipate those benefits dropping to the bottom-line? Or would you look to take out marketing further? Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Well, thanks for the question. I mean, as we noted in our prepared remarks, the increase in Q1 marketing spend was largely supportive of the momentum behind our existing products as well as the support of the launch behind Modelo Oro. So marketing as a percent of net sales for the quarter came in at 9.5%. The outlook for the full year is unchanged. We will continue to spend in our normal algorithm, that 9% to 10% of net sales on a full year basis. And so again, nothing changed in that regard. As it relates to some of the improvement that we're seeing, obviously, we're off of some of the highs from a commodity perspective, with the exception of one or two things that have continued to be a little bit - they haven't quite come off their highs just yet. So we do think that there could be some favorability as we move through the year on the commodity side. However, some of that favorability could be offset with the strength of the peso. If we look at the outlook right now, the favorability we're seeing on some commodities is being somewhat or completely offset by the strength of the peso. So right now, we're not seeing necessarily when you take into account the peso and the improving commodity market, but we're not necessarily seeing a big change for the balance of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is now live. 
Bryan Spillane: Thanks operator. Good morning everyone. Just one quick one for me, Garth. I think back on the 4Q call, when you talked about cadence, it was 55% of your volume first half and 55% of Wine and Spirits in the back half. So just wanted to see if that was still directionally kind of where we should be thinking as we're beginning to kind of restack our models for the balance of the year.
Garth Hankinson: Yes, Bryan, absolutely. No changes in that. And obviously, that's one of the reasons why we think wine will continue to improve through the year. And again, no change that - the Beer business is pretty seasonal and tried and true. So that's absolutely what the outlook is for the Beer Business.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning everyone. I guess I had a question about the Bud Light issue and how it may be impacting your business as well as your distributors? And any changes you might be making there? And then also in light of this, wondering if there might be an opportunity for you to possibly secure more tap handles from Modelo, just thinking about the on-prem business. And then just finally, any changes that you might be making to your marketing strategy or possibly spend levels in light of all of this. Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Well, obviously, the single biggest change that we've seen, Bonnie has been that Modelo has taken over as the number one beer by dollars in the U.S. We - Jim Sabia has often said that, that was going to happen in the next few years. But obviously, it happened a little sooner than we had anticipated. I think one of the things that you're likely to see if some of that challenge continues is when we look at shelf sets in the back half of the year. Many retailers look at velocities as they are doing their re-shelf setting, which, again, often happens in the fall. And that always works to our advantage. I think when you - the retailing environment has gotten very, very sophisticated about seeing where the growth profiles are and the velocities against those. We're particularly excited in our Beer business, the fact that the buy rate, both on our core as well as our high-end beer, including the Hispanic consumer, went up year-on-year during the first quarter. I think that's going to continue to be positive for us, and I think it's going to help us accelerate expansion of shelf and again, some of that is coming because of the growth and velocities that you're seeing on our brands, but also the decrease that you've seen, as you know, from some of our competitors.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Nadine Sarwat from Bernstein. Your line is now live.
Nadine Sarwat: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned some commentary at the start on Oro. I'd be keen to get a little bit more color there in terms of either repeat rates, cannibalizations and feedback from consumers now that it's been out in the market for a while. Thank you.
Bill Newlands: You bet, Nadine. It is - the incrementality on the actual market has been better, a slight bit better than what we had anticipated coming out of our test markets. And we are quite pleased with it in the test markets. So we're getting very good response on that. It is already a top 10 share gainer, as I noted in my prepared remarks. And again, we've done this with, I would say, a careful approach. We only have two SKUs in that particular product at this point in time. Recognizing, as Garth pointed out in his remarks, should that continue to show the positive signs that it has to-date, we do have the capacity now to more aggressively go after that as the year continues, which I think, again, is very, very positive and speaks to the success that we've had in our operations in Mexico of creating some ability to go beyond what our initial plans are when those opportunities present themselves. But it's early days. I don't like to get too far over my skis too soon on any new product introduction. But so far, this is going at least according to plan, if not better, and we're very pleased with the incrementality that we're seeing. As I said, it's slightly better than we saw in our test markets. So, all thumbs up for us at this point on that product.
Nadine Sarwat: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So I wanted to go back to the marketing spend. I think you've mentioned for the year the 7% to 9% of the top line, you started well with 9%. So I was just hoping to reconcile, because you also said you expect it to be up to low-single. I mean not questioning, I think it's probably a great thing to start well, especially now with this commentary about, obviously, what's happening with Bud Light. And then related to - just a clarification on a bit on the gross margin side. And I think, Garth, you mentioned that obviously, you've got $30 million of cost benefit for savings. You also have some benefits from packaging. Is that - I believe we all in this call, we’re pleased to margins the way they came through for beer. So can you comment on a little bit what the lag room? Do you feel even more confident with your guide being conservative as the way I see it? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: So let me take the first half, and I'll let Garth take the second half of that. Our marketing approach has been consistent for years. That's one of the things that we think has been tremendous for our brands and why they continue to accelerate in the market. We believe in spending against our brands. We have refined it some. We're getting much more capable in the digital arena than what we were just a few years ago. And I think that's very positive. But we have the number one share of voice in the market and we expect to continue to be - to have that continue going forward. And we believe in it. It's shown tremendous success for our brands as we've gotten to this point, and we believe it's going to be an important part of our continued success moving forward. Garth, I'll let you answer the other, if you would.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. On the margin front, look, I mean the 38% for the quarter was roughly in line, maybe slightly better than what our expectations were as we entered the year. We certainly feel confident in our ability to deliver the margin profile that we laid out at the beginning of the year. As I said in my prepared remarks, and as we reminded everyone in the last quarter, roughly 70% of our total COGS are subject to annual adjustments that are backward looking and only 30% have any fluctuation, are exposed to fluctuations throughout the year. And so again, we feel really good about the position that we're in right now, and our ability to deliver the margin profile that's consistent with the - with our earnings guidance.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now live.
Chris Carey: Hi. Good morning. Just one clarification and then a question on Wine and Spirits. Just the clarification, Garth, you said that you didn't expect any distortion in shipments versus depletions going forward after Q1. And I think you were clear in response to Bryan's question about the mix of cases front half or back half but should the rate of growth of shipments be below the rate of growth of depletions in Q2 or any quarter go forward? And basically, what I'm trying to clarify here is the absolute cases versus the rate of change. So I would just give a clarification then. The question on Wine and Spirits would be - can you just perhaps just suppose the premiumization efforts with the margin delivery in the quarter and perhaps just reaffirm confidence in a way on the margin trajectory of the Wine and Spirits business go forward here? Thank you.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. So, on the shipments and depletions. So look, as we said, we expect the shipments and depletions to be on a nominal basis to be largely in line with one another on a full year basis. I think if you look and you go back to the years that are unaffected by the pandemic or weather-related operational difficulties, you'll see that there is some seasonal differences between depletions and shipments. Q1, as we noted, we typically do have some outpacing of shipments relative to depletions on a nominal basis as you're building for the summer season. So - and you're getting distributors and retailers in a position that they're able to meet the demand of that key summer selling season. So that's fairly typical. So I would just ask you to go back and look at some prior periods, again, pre-pandemic. As it relates to our Wine and Spirits Business, again, as we said on the call, we do expect to see continued improvement through the year on the margin front as we continue to see increased traction with our premium portfolio. Again, we're seeing good growth on brands like Meiomi and Kim Crawford and The Prisoner Wine Company. We're continuing to get the benefit of pricing on those. And there are a number of cost initiatives underway in our wine business. As well as seeing improvements there, as we said, on both logistics and on great input costs. So again, that's a business also that, as Bryan noted, we've guided will - the volume there is about 55 back end loaded. So, for all of those reasons, we're confident that we can deliver the year and deliver the margin profile that we previously guided to.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Your line is now live.
Filippo Falorni: Hi, good morning, everyone. A quick question on the health of the U.S. consumer, particularly, if you look about your core Hispanic consumer base, any changes that you see in terms of purchasing behaviors, in terms of package size, trade down or any signs of that? And clearly, your business has improved as the weather improved in California. But any signs there also in terms of changing consumer behaviors, particularly again, in the Hispanic consumer base in the states? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Yes. As you can imagine, that's something that we track very carefully as well. And we're pleased to report that the buy rate, which again is trips times the spend for high-end beer, and this includes the Hispanic consumer was up year-on-year in the first quarter. It's one we track very carefully. It's an important element to us. And it's one that we are very pleased to see in a positive vein. As you point out, we have continued to see acceleration of our share in California, which is an important market during the course of the first quarter as well. And in that particular market, as you would expect, the Hispanic consumer base is very important to us. It's also very important, for instance, in the state of Texas, which saw a double-digit growth profile in the first quarter as well. So we're pretty comfortable that the consumer side of our business remains very strong. And as I noted on the prior call from the prior question, excuse me, that we are continuing to invest heavily against our marketing approach to make sure that we continue to maintain that same consumer demand that we've enjoyed.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.
Andrew Strelzik: Great. Thank you for taking the question. My question is around opportunities around price pack architecture as a beer volume growth driver. And I guess what I'm hoping is you can help us understand exactly where you are in that process? Is that something that over the medium-term we should expect to accelerate as a contributor and maybe over the next 12 months versus over the medium-term, where the focus is within that strategy? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Yes. You're entirely right, Andrew. That's something that our beer leadership team is working on aggressively day in and day out. And frankly, we think we can learn a lot from some other players in the beverage arena, particularly in the soda area, where pretty much if you tell me what you've got to spend, there's a pack size or a pack appropriate for a particular price point. So a lot of things we are looking at, things like Modelo, we're looking at different quantities, ounce quantities against some of our packaging. So all of these things are critically important. Part of the reason you're seeing the massive acceleration in the high 40 percentile in the Chelada business, is what used to be only a 24-ounce can is now available in both multi-pack and 12-ounce opportunities. So again, we think – and that's been part of the big acceleration in the Chelada area. So this is an area that we're spending a lot of time on ourselves to make sure that whatever the consumer has available to spend against our brand, that we have something available to them within our portfolio to make sure that they can take our products home with them when they leave a store.
Operator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Bill for any further or closing comments.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Kevin, and thank you all for joining today's call. We're off to an excellent start in fiscal 2024. Our Beer Business delivered strong growth for the quarter with performance accelerating since the beginning of the year and into Q2. The higher-end brands of our Wine and Spirits portfolio continued to outperform and track channels and to drive margin improvement. We remain confident in our outlook for the full year and are building great momentum as we head into the key summer selling season for our Beer Business and the seasonally stronger second half for the Wine and Spirits Business. In closing, I want to wish you all a happy fourth of July for those of you celebrating that and hope you choose to enjoy your celebrations with some of our great products. Thanks again, everyone, and have a great summer.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-04-06 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Constellation Brands’ Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to, Joe Suarez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Joe Suarez: Thank you, Darryl. Good morning, all, and welcome to Constellation Brands year-end fiscal 2023 conference call. I’m here this morning with our Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the Company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Following the call, we will also be making available in the Investors section of our company’s website a series of slides with key highlights of the prepared remarks shared by Bill and Garth in today’s call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters, I would like to ask that, we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us end our call on-time. Thanks in advance. And now, here is Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I’m pleased to report that our team delivered another solid year of performance in fiscal ‘23, driving a 7% increase in net sales and a 3% increase in comparable operating income, despite elevated inflationary headwinds faced throughout the year. We delivered record net sales and comparable operating income of $9.5 billion and $3 billion, respectively. We were recognized as the number one growth leader among large CPG companies by IRI and Boston Consulting Group in calendar year ‘22. And we’re the only CPG company of scale in recent times to make their top 10 ranking for 10 consecutive years. Our performance was driven by strong execution of our strategy, which centers on continuing to build powerful brands that people love; to introduce consumer led innovations that address emerging trends and consistently shape our portfolio for profitable growth; to deploy capital with discipline, while balancing priorities; and operate in a way that is both good for business and good for the world. Here’s how each of our segments delivered against each of these objectives in fiscal ‘23. Our Beer Business delivered another year of double-digit net sales growth, and its 13th consecutive year of shipment volume growth, while maintaining best-in-class margins. We extended our lead as the number one high end beer supplier in the U.S. and as the leading share gainer in IRI channels with a 12% increase in dollar sales. We increased depletions by nearly 27 million cases, and delivered net sales and operating income growth well above the initial top end of our guidance range. We continue to build momentum for our anchor brands. Modelo Especial maintained its position as the top share gainer and the number one high-end beer brand in the category, increasing depletions by 9%; Corona Extra was the third largest share gainer and the number three high-end beer brand in the category, increasing depletions by nearly 4%; and Pacifico gained significant momentum as a top 10 share gainer in tracked channels, delivering depletion growth of over 30%. Several consumer-led innovations within our Modelo Chelada franchise served as growth catalysts in fiscal ‘23. Our Naranja Picosa flavor, a new variety pack, added over 1.6 million new cases of depletions to our Chelada brands. Our new Limón y Sal 12-ounce, 12-pack helped to more than double the depletions of that flavor to over 5.6 million cases. And in tracked channels, the Limón y Sal 12-pack was a top 15 new package SKU and a variety pack of top 10 new brands. We continue to invest in our beer business, deploying over $800 million in capital investments in fiscal ‘23, which supported the ongoing expansions of our growing capacity at Obregon, the continued development of our new ABA alcohol production line at Nava and the early stage work at our new site in Veracruz. As part of our commitment to water stewardship, we recently worked with local efficients and water authorities to complete a project that updated water infrastructure in the city of Zaragoza, near our Nava facility, which improved water accessibility for most of the families in this town that is approximately 13,000 people. This is just one of a number of efforts we have underway in Mexico as part of our water stewardship commitment. As we look to fiscal ‘24, we will continue to prioritize investments against our core brands in Modelo Especial, Corona Extra and Pacifico. We believe that the fundamental growth drivers for these brands, including awareness, distribution and demographic upside opportunities, remain as strong as ever. We’re excited about several consumer-led innovations that are currently hitting the market, including Modelo Oro, which exceeded both external and internal benchmarks in three test markets where we trialed it last fiscal year; and Corona nonalcoholic, which addresses the rapidly growing betterment trends. We’ll also continue to build momentum for our Chelada franchise with the introduction of a second 12-ounce 12-pack for our best-selling traditional Chelada flavor and with the new spicy watermelon flavor, Sandia Picante. And we’ll continue to deploying capital to enhance our growing capacity to meet the anticipated continuing robust demand for our products, both near and long term. Shifting gears. Our Wine and Spirits business has transformed from a U.S. wholesale business, mainly serving the mainstream segment to a global omnichannel competitor with a higher-end focused portfolio. And this strategy is working as the strength of our higher-end brands supported our outperformance against the broader market. While lower demand for our mainstream brands drove a 2.1% volume decline for our Wine and Spirits portfolio and IRI channels, we outperformed the 2.6% volume decline for the combined U.S. Wine and Spirits categories in fiscal ‘23. We continue to focus on the growth of our consumer preferred higher-end brands within our portfolio. Our Aspira portfolio, which includes our Fine Wine and Craft Spirits brands, delivered double-digit shipment growth. In addition, it significantly outpaced the Fine Wine and Craft Spirits segment, led by The Prisoner Wine Company, which delivered depletion growth approaching 10% and our Craft Spirits portfolio, which achieved depletion growth approaching 29% in U.S. wholesale. In addition, these brands delivered exciting consumer-led innovations such as The Prisoner’s, Blindfold, Blanc de Noir, Casa Noble’s ultra-premium Marqués tequila and our Mi CAMPO ready-to-drink cocktails, which are still in early stages of their life cycles, but are contributing to our expanded presence -- higher end of the market. Meanwhile, our Ignite portfolio continued to drive the momentum of our premium brands such as Meiomi and Kim Crawford, which delivered depletion growth of 5% and 7%, respectively, both gaining share in their respective segments. We continued to complement the growth of our core premium products with innovations that broaden the offerings of these consumer preferred brands. As an example, Meiomi’s new Red Blend remains the number two wine SKU since its launch and Kim Crawford’s Prosecco was the number two new wine brand. Within our Ignite portfolio, the performance of our higher-end premium brands was offset by our remaining mainstream Wine and Spirits brands, namely Woodbridge and SVEDKA, which experienced declines versus the market in the U.S. We continue to focus on stabilizing and revitalizing these brands. To further support our strategy to reshape our Wine and Spirits portfolio to the higher end, we divested several residual mainstream brands and acquired a smaller, higher-end wine brand and a ready-to-drink cocktail brand. Of note, our relatively recent acquisition of My Favorite Neighbor portfolio is delivering substantial growth and performing above our initial expectations. So overall, in fiscal ‘23, while net sales for our Wine and Spirits business declined just under 4%, a large part of that was due to the recent divestiture of primarily mainstream brands that I just referenced. And despite the strong performance of our higher-end brands, on an organic basis, net sales declined by 2%, mainly driven by lower demand for our mainstream brands, reflecting continued consumer-led premiumization trends, which I also noted earlier. We continued to build momentum for our higher-end brands and continued to accelerate our performance in key channels, such as direct-to-consumer and international markets, which grew net sales by 29% and organic net sales by 4%, respectively. Looking forward, we see an opportunity to continue to grow the DTC and international markets by investing in our Premium Wine, Fine Wine and Craft Spirits brands that tilt their growth toward DTC, international routes to market. Importantly, our Wine and Spirits business delivered operating margin expansion in fiscal ‘23, further demonstrating the benefits of its strategy and making additional progress towards its medium-term targets. Overall, we are exiting the year in Wine and Spirits on solid footing, and I remain confident in the pathway of that business. The solid performance driven by our beer and Wine and Spirits teams enabled us to return nearly $2.3 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends in fiscal ‘23, and we further demonstrated our capacity to conduct opportunistic share buybacks with an additional nearly $300 million of repurchases in the fourth quarter. This means our dividend payments and buybacks since fiscal ‘20 totaled more than $5.4 billion, well above our $5 billion goal. Moving forward, we plan to continue to deliver against our capital allocation priorities with our disciplined approach. Our fiscal ‘24 earnings and cash flow outlook should enable us to move closer to our net leverage ratio target to support dividend payments in line with our payout ratio target to continue to deploy capital to beer growing capacity additions and hospitality investments in Wine and Spirits business and to opportunistically pursue additional share repurchases and small gap filling acquisitions. Lastly, we remain committed to making meaningful progress against our enterprise ESG goals, which include reducing Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 15% in fiscal -- by fiscal ‘25 from a fiscal ‘20 baseline and restoring more than 1 billion gallons of water withdrawals from local water ships, while also improving accessibility and quality of water for communities where we operate between fiscal ‘23 and ‘25. Water stewardship in particular, has been a top priority for our team, and I’m pleased to announce that we have already surpassed our fiscal ‘25 goal related to water restoration. We’ll look to announce later this year new targets for our water stewardship efforts as well as other important areas that are part of our ongoing commitment to ensuring the long-term viability of our local communities and this environment. We have also significantly enhanced our ESG reporting getting references aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework and considering recommendations from the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. As we look ahead, we intend to continue to take steps to more fully integrate ESG into our core business planning process, establishing thoughtful, specific, measurable and time-bound targets supported by robust strategies and operating plans that we can map progress against. We believe this approach best serves the interest of our business, shareholders, other stakeholders and our surrounding communities as it seeks to integrate ESG into our business operations and helps ensure that we can clearly deliver on our stated commitments. So in summary, we delivered another solid year of performance, resulting in record net sales and comparable operating income, despite elevated inflationary headwinds faced throughout the year. Our performance was driven by strong execution of our strategy, and we continue to make good progress against all dimensions, building brands that people love, complementing growth of our core products with consumer led innovation, deploying capital with discipline while balancing priorities against our organization and continuing to operate in a way that is both, good for business and good for the world. With another strong year of execution against our strategy behind us, we’re quite confident in our ability to continue building momentum in fiscal ‘24. And with that, I will turn the call over to Garth.
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal ‘23 was another solid year for our company as we continued to relentlessly deliver on our operating plans and strategic initiatives. Despite the inflationary pressures that both our industry and consumers have been facing, we demonstrated yet again the strength of our adaptable businesses, higher end brands and resilient teams. We expect the same focus and dedication to further support our momentum in fiscal ‘24. So, let’s review in more detail our full year fiscal ‘23 performance and fiscal ‘24 outlook. As always, I will focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with the fiscal ‘23 performance of our beer business. Net sales increased $713 million or 11%, exceeding the upper end of our guidance range. This was primarily driven by solid shipment growth of approximately 7% as strong demand continued across our portfolio, supporting a $464 million uplift in net sales from incremental volumes. Net sales also benefited from favorable pricing in excess of our unusual 1% to 2% average annual pricing algorithm. As we previously noted, the incremental pricing actions taken in fiscal ‘23 were in response to cost pressures across the value chain due to inflationary headwinds. We introduced larger pricing increases and made pricing adjustments in certain markets ahead of our regular case. Depletion growth for the year was over 7%, which, as Bill noted, was driven by continued strong growth in our largest brands, Modelo Especial, Corona Extra, Pacifico and Modelo Chelada brands. On-premise depletions grew 15% year-over-year, and on-premise volume accounted for approximately 12% of total depletions in fiscal ‘23, nearing the mid-teen volume share from prior to the start of pandemic. As previously guided, our shipments and depletions were closely aligned on an absolute basis. Moving on to the bottom line for our beer business. Operating income increased 6%, also exceeding the upper end of our guidance range. This increase was largely driven by a $492 million benefit from net sales growth and yielded an operating margin of 38.3%, which was in line with our implied guidance range. As expected and noted over fiscal ‘23, operating margins were negatively affected by inflationary headwinds. For the import portion of our beer business, which represents nearly the entirety of COGS, we faced an increase of approximately 16% in our raw materials and packaging costs, which was largely driven by inflationary pressures that resulted in an 8% increase on a per case basis. This reflected some benefits from the lapping of the seltzer obsolescence charge in fiscal ‘22 as excluding any obsolescence impact, the increases in our raw materials and packaging costs would have been 20% on an absolute basis and 12% on a per case basis. Note that these two COGS categories, including the obsolescence impact represented just over 55% of the import portion’s COGS in fiscal ‘23. We also saw a 12% year-over-year increase in freight costs, mainly driven by incremental shipment expenses that were offset by efficiency initiatives. Freight costs were 5% up on a per case basis and account for just under 25% of import. And we faced a 14% rise in labor and overhead costs that was mainly driven by our brewery capacity investments. Labor and overhead were up 7% on a per case basis and accounted for just under 15% of import COGS. In addition, operating margins for the beer business were also affected by a $41 million or nearly 22% increase in depreciation, almost entirely associated with our brewery capacity investments. A $55 million or nearly 9% increase in marketing spend related to incremental investments in sports sponsorships and a $48 million or nearly 14% increase in our -- in other SG&A, driven by incremental sales support to align with the momentum of our beer brands. Note, however, that while our marketing investments increased when compared to the prior year, they were still within our 9% to 10% range as a percentage of net sales. All of that said, and it’s important to note that we still delivered best-in-class margins for our beer business in fiscal ‘23. Now shifting to our Wine and Spirits business. First, please recall that we divested a collection of primarily mainstream wine brands from our wine portfolio in fiscal ‘23. So during today’s remarks, I will also be discussing top line on an organic basis, which excludes the contributions from the divested brands. As Bill noted, despite the strong performance of our higher-end Wine and Spirits brands on an organic basis, net sales decline of 2%, ultimately landing in our guidance range. The decline in net sales, excluding the impact of the divestiture, was primarily driven by our mainstream brands as they faced challenging market conditions and lapping of prior fiscal year inventory build. Again, this decline was partially offset by strong growth in our higher-end brands, which outperformed in the U.S. in the higher-end category for both Wine and Spirits and total U.S. wine market. Our higher-end brands also had strong growth in our emerging and rapidly expanding direct-to-consumer channels and international markets. Over time, we expect our portfolio to continue to migrate toward the higher end and for these higher-end brands, channels and markets to support our top line growth acceleration. Shipments on an organic basis decreased by under 8% and depletions decreased by 3%. As just noted, this volume decline, which reduced organic net sales by $148 million, was driven primarily by our mainstream brands, as mix and price, largely driven by our higher-end brands provided a $111 million uplift to organic net sales. Wine and Spirits operating income, excluding the gross profit, less marketing of the brands that are no longer part of the business, following their divestiture in fiscal ‘23, increased 2%, and operating margin increased 80 basis points to nearly 23%, also reflecting the same exclusion. This margin increase was driven by a $12 million uplift from net sales flow-through as favorable product mix was supported by lower grade costs as well as a strong New Zealand harvest. Benefits from other cost savings actions primarily resulting in lower-grade costs that helped to partially offset higher logistics material costs and more efficient marketing expense from enhanced investment strategies, which increased focus the highest return opportunities which supported a $20 million tailwind to operating income. These benefits were partially offset by $17 million in higher SG&A from increased headcount as we continue to strategically invest in our growing DTC channels. We remain well positioned to continue to expand margins in our Wine and Spirits business over time with mix improvements and productivity initiatives in the future. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. In fiscal ‘23, our corporate expense included approximately $270 million from SG&A and $20 million from unconsolidated investments related to our ventures portfolio, all-in, landing at the low end of our guidance at $290 million. Within the SG&A portion of corporate expense, the implementation of our DBA program, which stands for digital business acceleration, accounted for $47 million. As a reminder, we introduced our multiyear DBA initiative in fiscal ‘23 and expect similar investments to carry into fiscal ‘24. Interest expense for the year increased 12% to approximately $400 million, coming in at the upper end of our guidance range. This increase was driven primarily by the financing of the stock reclassification, which took place in Q3 of fiscal ‘23 as well as the impact of rising interest rates on approximately 15% of our debt with adjustable rates. Our full year comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings, came in at 19.2% versus 17.5% last year as we lapped favorability in fiscal ‘22, primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation activity. Free cash flow for fiscal ‘23, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities, less CapEx, was above the upper end of our guidance range at $1.7 billion. CapEx totaled $1 billion, including over $800 million of investment in our beer business. CapEx came in below our guidance, primarily due to timing shifts in the spend for certain materials and equipment of our Mexico brewery investments at our Nava and Obregon facilities. As of the end of fiscal ‘23, our Mexico brewery operations had a total nominal capacity of approximately 42 million hectoliters. This includes 32.5 million hectoliters at our Nava facility and 9.5 million hectoliters at our Obregon facility. This represents 1 million hectoliter uplift at our Nava facility relative to the capacity we communicated a few months ago. This uplift is once again the result of our continued productivity initiatives that have unlocked additional production flexibility from the existing footprint of our breweries. As a reminder, earlier this year, we shared that these initiatives had unlocked additional capacity of 1.5 million hectoliters at Nava and 0.5 million hectoliters at Oregon. In light of the 2.5 million hectoliters of productivity capacity unlocked at Nava in fiscal ‘23, we have slightly adjusted the ramp-up plans for our new ABA production line at that facility, which I will discuss shortly. With that, let’s move now to our outlook for fiscal ‘24. We expect a comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $11.70 to $12, excluding Canopy equity earnings. For fiscal ‘24, our beer business is targeting net sales growth of 7% to 9%. As Bill discussed earlier, we expect continued strong volume growth momentum to be largely driven by our icon brands, Modelo Especial and Corona Extra and next wave brands, Pacifico and the Modelo Chelada brands. We anticipate our full year fiscal ‘24 shipments and depletions to track each other closely, both on an absolute basis and in terms of the year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, despite some fluctuations in the last few years in our quarterly shipment cases and year-over-year growth rates due to severe weather and pandemic-related impacts, we expect the cadence of our shipments in fiscal ‘24 to follow a more traditional seasonal pattern. We anticipate approximately 55% of our fiscal ‘24 wines to ship in the first half as we meet peak summer demand for our products. In addition, from a quarterly perspective, particularly when looking at year-over-year growth rates, we also expect shipment and depletion comparisons to still show some variability as they always have, as we manage inventory levels around seasonality throughout the year and our regular brewery maintenance activities in Q3. All of that said, we do not expect to have any incremental lapping variability in our shipment growth rate for Q4 as we did in fiscal ‘23. From a pricing perspective, at this stage, we are planning for average annual pricing within our 1% to 2% algorithm. We are mindful that consumers will likely continue to face challenging macroeconomic conditions for the foreseeable future and that our pricing increases in the last 2 fiscal years were above this algorithm. As we advance throughout the year, we will continue to monitor inflationary dynamics and potential recessionary risks to ensure our pricing is appropriately balanced to support the momentum of our brands. We will provide any further update in that regard as part of our future quarterly calls. In terms of operating income growth. Our beer business is targeting 5% to 7%, which implies a fiscal ‘24 operating margin of approximately 38%. As we have discussed, we continue to expect our beer operating margin to be negatively impacted by inflationary COGS headwinds. The majority of these relate to the year-over-year adjustments in our packaging and raw material costs, which, on average, represent a high-single-digit increase in absolute terms for these inputs in the import portion of our beer business. While prices for some of these inputs are off their peaks, most are subject to contractual terms that reflect annual adjustments based on trailing pricing data and some still remain significantly elevated relative to pre-pandemic prices. In fiscal ‘24, we expect packaging and raw material for our imports to account for approximately 55% to 60% of our costs. In addition, we expect freight to be approximately 20% to 25% of costs and reflect a high single-digit year-over-year absolute increase as we continue to face annual volume and contractual increases. And labor and overhead to be approximately 15% of costs and reflect a high-teens increase in absolute terms, largely driven by increased headcount and training tied to our brewery capacity investments. For our beer business, we expect incremental depreciation of approximately $35 million to $40 million as we continue to bring into production incremental growing capacity from our investments, particularly at Obregon, in fiscal ‘24. As noted earlier, the incremental capacity unlocked from our existing Nava facility footprint from productivity initiatives has given us additional flexibility on the ramp-up of our new ABA line. We now intend to spend a bit more time optimizing that new additional ABA production to better support the strong growth of our Modelo Chelada brands. Accordingly, we anticipate the ABA line will be ramping up in Q4 of FY24. Conversely, we have been able to accelerate the ramp-up of our next 5 million hectoliter investment at Obregon to Q1 of fiscal ‘24. This is being enabled by the move of brewery and package equipment that we had previously intended for use in Mexicali. Now, going back to operating margins. We plan to execute a number of productivity initiatives to help offset inflationary pressures. The expectations shared for our beer business COGS in fiscal ‘24 have operational efficiencies and cost-saving actions embedded into them. These initiatives include benefits from our ongoing hedging program and contractual negotiation efforts as well as from our fiscal ‘23 DBA program. To that end, it is relevant to note that only around 25% of our beer business COGS are subject to contractual pricing adjustments within fiscal ‘24, and then we expect our hedging program to reduce our exposure to those adjustments for about 10% to 15% of COGS. In addition, we expect to deliver marketing and other SG&A efficiencies, including an even greater focus on optimizing these types of investments toward our icon and next wave brands. So despite remaining slightly below our medium-term operating margin target we expect our fiscal ‘24 efforts to still yield best-in-class results for our beer business, and we expect all quarters within fiscal ‘24 to deliver operating margins above this latest quarter’s result. Moving to the outlook for our Wine and Spirits business. Our fiscal -- for fiscal ‘24, we are targeting organic net sales to be relatively flat within 0.5 percentage point from fiscal ‘23 net sales, excluding $38.5 million of net sales from the brands divested in fiscal ‘23. We expect to continue the strong growth of our Premium Wine, Fine Wine and Craft Spirits brands and in our DTC channels and international markets. These segments of our business will help to offset the headwinds we expect to face with our mainstream U.S. wholesale brands, which are facing challenging market conditions due to ongoing consumer-led premiumization. Conversely to our beer business, we expect our Wine and Spirits business to ship approximately 55% of our fiscal ‘24 volumes in the second half, again, in line with seasonal demand for our Wine and Spirits products. More notably, despite continued inflationary pressures, we are targeting operating income growth between 2% to 4%, exclusive of $19.5 million of gross profit, less marketing, related to brands divested in fiscal ‘23. This implies an operating margin improvement of at least 40 basis points. The primary margin improvement drivers for fiscal ‘24 include additional mix improvement, particularly with our further optimized portfolio, driven by ongoing growth in our higher-end brands from continued consumer-led premiumization trends, enduring growth momentum in our higher-margin direct-to-consumer channels and targeted international metro areas, primarily through our Aspira portfolio brands, additional innovation with new consumer-led products that help extend our higher-end offerings and stabilize our mainstream brands, reduced marketing spend relative to net sales with optimized investments increasingly focused on high-growth, high-return areas and additional SG&A reductions in cost management initiatives. Similar to our beer business, we expect approximately 25% of our Wine and Spirits business COGS to be subject to adjustments within fiscal ‘24. Now moving to expectations for the rest of the P&L in fiscal ‘24. Corporate expense, including just the SG&A portion, is expected to be approximately $270 million. We expect to see favorability from the termination of certain compensation and benefits that will not be payable in fiscal ‘24 following the retirement of Rob and Richard Sands from their executive roles for the reclassification agreement, approved by shareholders in fiscal ‘23, offset by the impact of inflationary pressures and merit-driven salary increases. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $500 million for the year. This is a 25% increase from fiscal ‘23 and is primarily due to the incremental interest expense associated with the financing of the reclassification. The comparable tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings is expected to be around 19%. Rounding up the P&L, we anticipate approximately $40 million in non-controlling interest benefits and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at approximately 184 million. Turning to cash flow. We expect fiscal ‘24 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, and CapEx of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. CapEx includes approximately $1 billion to support our Mexico brewery investment and most of the remainder will support our Wine and Spirits hospitality updates. To wrap up, I would like to reiterate that our refreshed capital allocation priorities that we have introduced and discussed throughout fiscal ‘23 and earlier by Bill remain unchanged. We remain committed to a disciplined financial foundation by maintaining an investment-grade rating as we move towards our net leverage ratio target, delivering returns to shareholders via both dividends in line with our payout ratio goal and through incremental share repurchases to at least cover dilution while remaining opportunistic for any additional repurchases, continuing to support the growth of our businesses through deployed capital in our beer brewing additions and in our Wine and Spirits hospitality investments. And lastly, through smaller acquisitions that will fill gaps or enhance our existing portfolio. We believe that this strong disciplined capital allocation strategy, combined with exceptional execution, will empower us to be a premier shareholder return generator for the foreseeable future. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. Can you comment on what you’re seeing most recently and that makes you feel confident about the 7% to 9%, your sales growth outlook and particularly in light of the broad deceleration in consumption called out by retailers in March? And related to that, are there any dynamics between shipments ahead of the Cinco de Mayo, start of the summer and the depletions as we move into the first quarter and throughout the year? And if I can squeeze on the pricing front, you mentioned the 1% to 2%, but I understand some of the competitors decided to just pushback. And given the dynamics that you had towards the fall last year, if you’re going to be mostly looking to do pricing for the fall? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure. Thanks for the question, and good morning to you. A couple of things that give us the confidence in the 7% to 9% range. First of all, we saw a very strong start to the year in markets like Texas and Florida, which have both seen double-digit increases in the first month of the year. Now acknowledging the state of California has been challenging, but I’ll tell you what I’m very excited about, about California. In Q4, we saw our distribution growth, our effective distribution grew by 3.6%, Q4 versus the Q4 prior, or simple distribution despite a very broad market capability there, saw a simple distribution grow up 2%. And our draft panels went up over 9%. What this says to me is that we are well prepared when California gets back into their normal weather pattern versus what we saw this year. So, we’re very comfortable. Obviously, we wouldn’t be giving you this guidance if we thought otherwise. But we feel very comfortable that we’ll be in that 7% to 9% range that we noted today. Garth, do you want to touch on the pricing point?
Garth Hankinson: Yes. So I mean, as we stated in our prepared remarks, we’re comfortable with the pricing at our 1% to 2% algorithm. Obviously, we will continue -- our approach to pricing gives us the flexibility throughout the year to monitor what’s the macroeconomic and the inflationary recession impacts -- potential recession impacts are on our consumer. It allows us to monitor competitor behavior and give us the flexibility to act agilely when we see a reason to move on price. So that will be something that I said in my prepared remarks that to the extent we make any changes throughout the year, we will provide updates on our regular quarterly calls.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.
Kevin Grundy: Just a quick cleanup. Bill, I’m not sure if you can comment on March depletion trends. I mean, presumably, given the importance of California, I suspect it’s probably running a bit below what we saw in the fourth quarter. Maybe you could just comment on that. But my broader question is on the Oro launch, and maybe just follow-up there on your expectations, comments on cannibalization risk. And then I think importantly, sort of context around how we should be thinking about this rollout relative to the premier launch several years ago and the degree of incremental spend? If I’m not mistaken, Garth, you can correct me if I’m wrong, I think that was in the $35 million to $40 million range of incremental spend behind that rollout, but just some context around there would be helpful. So, thank you both for that. I appreciate it.
Bill Newlands: Sure. So that I don’t step on myself after I just got done saying at CAGNY that I wasn’t going to talk about depletions anymore, I won’t specifically talk about March depletions other than to say they’re pretty much in line with what we expected. As I did note in my prior answer to Andrea, Texas, Florida were up double digits. Certainly, California was challenged this particular start to the year. But I think it’s safe to say that as we progress in the year, it’s extremely unusual to have rain, snow or flooding, once you get into May, June, July and August in the state of California. So much like we’ve seen many other times when there’s a dislocation of particular market, we expect that that would pass over time. Second, related to your Oro question, we’ve said we’re going to be very sensible about the rollout of Oro. I’m pleased to say that our beer group has done an extremely good job of getting distribution into the marketplace. As you know, we’re less than a month in on that particular project. But we were very positive about the cannibalization rates that we saw in the 3 test markets. We saw incrementality above 60% in those markets, which we are very pleased with. And we really think it fills a gap, particularly with our core Hispanic consumer, who has been looking for an alternative to some of the other light beer scenarios. So, we’re very positive about that, but we’re going to do it in a very sensible and approachable way. For those of you who watched March Madness, you would have noted, we had -- we started our media campaign during that particular event. And this launch will be supported by significant media over the course of the summer.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: On the beer depletion side, can you discuss a bit the trends you’re seeing on-premise? The gap looked better in terms of on-premise and some of the smaller store on track channels relative to track channels versus Q2 and Q3. So just would love to get an update there. And then, also do you think you’re seeing any broader macro impacts in your portfolio? Maybe give us a bit of update on trade down in general in beer and what’s occurring there and any impacts to your business? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: You bet. So in terms of on-premise, on-premise continues to grow, as we noted in our prepared remarks. We continue to see acceleration in the on-premise, which we think is very good. We’re not quite back to where we were from a normal standpoint that where we sat before the pandemic, but we continue to make progress against that as we are seeing more and more often that consumers are being out in the marketplace and consuming on-premise. So, we remain optimistic. Our growth profile in the on-premise really continues to accelerate. As I think many on-premise accounts are looking more and more for brands that resonate consistently with consumers. And obviously, we have those and that speaks very well. I used the example of a well saturated market like California seeing draft panels on our business were up 9% in the fourth quarter last year. And I think that’s a great reflection of the potential that still exists for us in the on-premise. Relative to your question about trade down, we have seen very little trade down against our portfolio. Certainly, there has been some, it appears, but it tends to occur at lower price points than ours. So there are some consumers that are showing some concern about general inflationary macroeconomic trends. But by and large, that has occurred at lower price points that where our brands compete. And that’s fairly consistent with what we’ve seen relative to the pure loyalty we see against our brands. It’s the benefit of having consumer preferred brands in our portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.
Rob Ottenstein: Just a follow-up on Garth on some of your guidance comments, and I don’t know if I -- just maybe I didn’t follow you. But I think you were talking about productivity measures that would help get to the margin target. And then you talked kind of very quickly or with some points on hedging programs and the amount hedged or not -- and I just -- I apologize, I lost you on that. But I was kind of trying to connect what hedging would have to do with productivity and trying to exactly the point you were trying to make.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. So sure, Robert, thanks for the question. And just so as Joe indicated at the beginning of the remarks, we are going to be posting some slides to our website immediately following this call specific to the efficiency -- productivity efficiencies and the hedging. The point on that is it’s just like in any given year, we have certain productivity goals, efficiency goals, savings to help offset the impact of cost increases related to inflation. So, that’s no different than any other year. And the point of the comment was that those increases that I had stated previously, those are net of those efficiencies. And then on the point around hedging is just that we continue to have a fairly robust hedging policy program. Typically, we are only able to hedge around 10% to 15% of what’s in our cost of goods. And so, we are hedging against those things right now. And as we enter this year, we’re at where we would normally be in terms of the percent of commodities that are hedged.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.
Nik Modi: Just a few follow-ups. So -- just curious on -- Bill, you mentioned some of the distribution gains you’ve seen in California. Just was hoping to get some context on your view on resets and kind of what you’re seeing more broadly, especially in the markets where you’re undershared relative to where you are in California? And then the second question is just there’s been a lot of discussion in the trade about some of the other brewers perhaps rolling back some pricing or promoting back some of the recent price increases. Just wanted to get some context on kind of philosophically how you think about if that were to happen, kind of would you need to react or not? And just would love your context and perspective on that.
Bill Newlands: Yes. You bet, Nik. Thanks for the question. One of the things that relative to resets, we are doing extremely well in reset situations. And I think it’s just simple, good business because with our portfolio representing more than 80% of the growth in the total beer category, it just makes sense for retailers to increase our shelf positions versus the competition. You see, as we said in our prepared remarks, Modelo being the number 1 growth driver and Corona being the number 3 growth driver and Pacifico being the top 10 growth driver, these brands demand more space on the shelf. And we’re very fortunate that our team is specifically focused on that very topic. Relative to pricing, as Garth noted, we carefully analyze the elasticities against our brands, and I’ve said this on many other occasions, we’re very mindful that we want to keep our consumer. And our pricing strategies over time have been to be sensible and approachable to ensure that we keep our consumers. We’re going to raise within our normal algorithm this year in the 1% to 2%, as Garth noted, but we should then expect no rolling back of any pricing scenarios from us this year because we have been judicious and sensible about keeping the consumer engaged with us as we move pricing in the past. We’ll continue to monitor to that carefully as the year goes on, as we always do. On a monthly basis, we analyze elasticities and drivers and drags, which you’ve all heard from Jim Sabia over time. But we see absolutely no need to be rolling back pricing in any market because we think we were very appropriate in what we have done historically, which should allow us to be right back in our algorithm going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: I had a question on your free cash flow guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion this year. It’s a fair amount below your historical run rate. So maybe you could highlight the key puts and takes that are going to impact your free cash flow this year? And then, you completed your share repurchase goals to date and your $5 billion return to shareholder target, but you didn’t necessarily announce a new return goal. So, curious how you’re thinking about your capital allocation priorities going forward? And then, maybe what’s realistic to consider for cash return to shareholders this year and beyond thinking about this in the context of the CapEx needs, your leverage targets, et cetera? Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Thanks, Bonnie. So, to start on free cash flow. I guess to start on free cash flow, we need to start at operating cash flow, right? So operating cash flow is a bit down this year versus last year. And the primary drivers of that are really a couple fold. One is there is the increase in interest that I referenced in my opening remarks pretty much at 25% increase on a year-over-year basis, and that’s really reflective primarily of the debt and the interest associated with the collapse, and then to a lesser extent, the remaining floating rate debt that we have on our books. Additionally, we’ll have higher cash paid taxes next year due to the U.S. -- and some nonrecurring tax benefits that we had in FY23 and then to a smaller extent some changes in working capital. Moving further down the list. We’ll continue to have significant investments in CapEx, as you heard. And so, that’s really -- those are the factors that are driving the free cash -- the operating cash flow and free cash flow ranges that we outlined earlier. As it relates to the share returns of capital to shareholders through share repurchases. We still have nearly $1 billion left under our existing Board authorization for share repurchases. As we mentioned in our comments, at the very least, we will buy back throughout the year, but we will continue to be agile and be able to take advantage of market conditions, just like we did in Q4, where, as Bill noted in his remarks, we aggressively bought back almost $300 million worth of shares as we saw some -- what we consider dislocations in price. So, that’s going to -- that will be how we continue throughout the year. We actually like the ability to have that flexibility. And so, it’s something that will obviously continue to be a very critical component of our capital allocation strategy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS.
Peter Grom: So I wanted to ask about the pricing cadence and the commentary that you’re going to be monitoring the health of the consumer. And you provided a lot of color in the response to both Andrea and Nik’s question. But I guess if you don’t plan to roll back prices, can you maybe just talk about what actions you would be willing to take if the environment were to deteriorate, would that just be pricing at the lower end? And I guess what I’m really trying to understand is if the pricing outlook were to really change at all, how would that impact your ability to achieve your margin targets? Could you lean in more elsewhere, or would it be more difficult to achieve?
Bill Newlands: Well, there’s a lot of negative what ifs in the question, which, frankly, we don’t see coming to pass. If you look historically what our beer business has been able to accomplish, we have maintained a very consistent approach to pricing over time, 1% to 2% year after year after year. The last couple of years, as you know, we’ve significantly gone beyond that in an effort to hedge against some of the strong inflationary pressures that all consumer companies have faced. Our belief is we are in a very good position to do our historical 1% to 2% pricing increase. That’s based on a lot of analytics and a lot of elasticity assessments that we do on an ongoing basis. We are very comfortable with that, and we feel like that’s going to be an appropriate play for the course of this fiscal year, which should allow us to do everything we said. I would also note, just as an adjunct to that, one of the things that I said at CAGNY was how strong the Modelo share was in its two strongest markets, which was California and Nevada, where we were double digit. I’m pleased to report that at this point that actually is now in four states, which includes both New Jersey and Texas, which again just continues to show that our growth profile outside of the state of California, it remains a tremendous growth opportunity for our business over the long term and also helps to support what we just talked about relative to our ability to price within our 1% to 2% algorithm.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.
Chris Carey: So just two quick ones for me. On the -- Garth, on the beer margin outlook, you gave a lot of great detail. I guess, you’re looking for flat operating margins for the year. Is there any way -- or flattish. Is there any way to frame expectations for gross margin relative to operating margin? And I say that in the context of productivity initiatives, which I suppose can play out in both line items. So I was just curious if you have any comment there. The second observation is Wine and Spirits just delivered what I think is the best operating margin in a few years. And yet the outlook would imply that you’re giving a lot of that back. So is that just conservatism, or is there something just missing in the bridge about some of this nice premiumization, which has really helped the margin structure there? And I sort of asked that in the context of prior margin targets for the Wine and Spirits business in general. So, thanks for those two on Beer margins and Wine and Spirits margins.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. So, on the Wine and Spirits margins -- and so again, I’ll reference you to the deck that will be posted to our website after this call. But we’re actually forecasting wine margins to increase by at least 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And so, you’ll be able to see that detail on the website. As it relates to operating margin -- or gross profit margin with beer, I mean, all of the headwinds that we’re facing really in beer this coming year will be in gross margin and not below the line. As we said, we’ll continue to -- we’ll continue to effectively manage our marketing and SG&A spend and focus on the highest return and highest priority initiatives, and we’ll manage that effectively. So, the largest drag for us, as we’ve said for the last several months now, it’s going to just be the inflationary impact. Again, we’ll hit through COGS as well as some incremental depreciation throughout the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein.
Nadine Sarwat: So just coming back to the beer margin point, if I take the midpoint up your beer guidance for top line and operating income, it comes a touch below your initial 38 that I think you discussed. Was there anything in particular that changed to the downside versus your previous commentary, or I mean, is this just a situation of rounding here? And then just a follow-up on the margin point, given the margins of last year and what we’ll be seeing on the back of your guidance for this fiscal year. Should we still be thinking about 39% to 40% as your medium-term margin for the business? And would it be fair to [Technical Difficulty] 25?
Garth Hankinson: So, we do apologize because you broke there at the end…
Bill Newlands: I think the back end of that was do we expect to get there in fiscal ‘25. You broke up, I apologize, but I think that’s what said. So go ahead.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. So I think as you’re working with the numbers that we provided, when we said 38% operating -- approximately 38% operating margin. So that if you kind of look at the various points within our range, you’ll come up with various different outputs as it relates to what the margin will be. So we fully -- we have full conviction that we’re going to deliver operating margins for our beer business on approximately 38%. As it relates to the outlook going forward, we’ve just provided our outlook -- our margin outlook for our beer business for FY24. We’re not providing any guidance for future years. We typically don’t do that at this point. That’s not part of our process. Certainly, the biggest driver again this year that we have for FY24 is again driven predominantly by inflation and the inflation that we’re seeing, which I outlined in my scripts as well as some incremental depreciation. Offsetting that, we’ll continue to take pricing as we have. And as we’ve said earlier, we’ll be -- pricing in our 1% to 2% range. We continue to drive incremental volume, which helps to offset fixed overheads and depreciation as we grow into our expanded footprint, and we’ll continue on with the efficiency drivers that I mentioned as well. So, that’s where we stand for FY24, and we’ll talk about FY25 as we -- closer to the end of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane: I wanted to touch -- just move back to Wine and Spirits. And maybe Garth, could you talk a little bit about how and SVEDKA and Woodbridge are affecting margin and maybe margin progression there? And I guess I ask in the context of they’re a much larger contributor to volume than they are to revenue. And I guess my assumption is the margins are lower than the average. So just trying to understand, is getting volume stabilization or volume growth in those 2 brands an important component sort of building margins there, or is that not really a big factor? So, really just trying to understand Woodbridge and SVEDKA and kind of the longer-term impact on profitability in Wine and Spirits?
Garth Hankinson: Yes. Well, you’re absolutely correct that given the size of those brands that they do have a bit of a drag on our overall margin profile, given the price points in which they compete and therefore, their margin profile, which is below the average profile for the entire business unit. On a positive note, the Wine and Spirits team has pretty aggressive revitalization plans in place for both of those brands so that we can stabilize those brands and continue to outperform the price segments that they participate in. And as such, as we continue to make those efficiency improvements, we certainly -- and revitalize those brands, we expect that we’ll be able to achieve our margin targets as laid out.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for closing remarks.
Bill Newlands: Thanks very much. Fiscal ‘23 was a big year for Constellation Brands. We achieved record net sales and comparable operating income and were recognized for the tenth year as a CPG growth leader, despite some of the most significant inflationary headwinds affecting our company and consumers in recent history. Our beer business outperformed our initial expectations and continued to lead in share gains, growth and margins. Despite some volatility across the year as we lapped distortions in our performance from prior periods and navigating incremental pricing actions beyond our annual algorithm intended to offset cost pressures across the chain. And we delivered many other transformational milestones, including our transition to a single share class structure and other important corporate governance enhancements. The start of our construction activities at our new brewery site in Veracruz, and some additional refinement of our Wine and Spirits portfolio as well as continued progress against the strategy of that business. Lastly, the performance of our business, coupled with our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities allowed us to maintain our investment-grade rating, despite the incremental financing associated with the transaction for our transition to a single share price structure to surpass our share repurchases and dividend cash returns goal by over 400 million and continuing to grow our beer production capacity while executing small growth accretive M&A. As we look forward to fiscal ‘24, we remain focused on delivering sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders through the execution of our annual plan and by continuing to advance our strategic initiatives. And we are confident in our ability to continue building momentum across our bigger portfolio and strong volume growth and targeted pricing actions. We are bullish on the future performance of our Wine and Spirits business as it continues to advance its strategy, and we are committed to our capital allocation priorities and our ESG efforts. Thanks again, everyone, for joining the call. We hope you will choose to enjoy your Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day celebrations with some of our great products, and we look forward to speaking with all of you in late June on our next quarterly call. Thank you very much, and have a great day.
Operator: This does conclude today’s teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-01-05 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Constellation Brands' Third Quarter Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Joseph Suarez. Thank you. You may begin.
Joseph Suarez: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, all, and Happy New Year. Welcome to Constellation Brands third quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. I'm here this morning with our CEO, Bill Newlands; and our CFO, Garth Hankinson. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, in line with prior quarters or like last, let me limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill..
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Happy New Year to everyone, and welcome to our fiscal third quarter call. I hope you all had a great holiday season and that our products were able to play a role in some of your special moments with your family and friends. Since our last call in October, Constellation Brands reached a notable milestone in its history as a public company. As most of you know, in November, our shareholders approved the elimination of our Class B common stock. With that came the transition of our company to a single class of publicly listed stock, our Class A common stock, which provides our shareholders with equal one share, one vote rights. I want to thank everyone who supported this important enhancement to our company's corporate governance profile and capital structure. We believe that our leadership team now has an even stronger foundation to continue to build shareholder value through the strategic initiatives we adopted and have steadily advanced over the past nearly four years since I assumed the role of CEO. Since fiscal 2020, we agreed to focus on and put in place plans to: number one, continue to build powerful brands that people love; number two, develop consumer-led innovations aligned with emerging trends and consistently shape our portfolio for growth; number three, deploy capital in line with disciplined and balanced priorities; and number four, operate in a way that is good for business and good for the world. I'm pleased to say that we continue to build on a strong track record we have established against all of these strategic initiatives. Starting with number one, building our powerful portfolio of brands. Our beer business, despite a more recent series of headwinds, which we'll address in a few minutes, delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of leading share gains across the entire U.S. beer category in IRI channels that was primarily driven by our two largest brands, Modelo Especial and Corona Extra. In the third quarter, Modelo Especial maintained its position as the top share gainer and is the number one high-end beer brand, and Corona Extra was the third largest share gainer and the number three high-end beer brand. In fact, our beer business delivered 3.5 points of share gains and 54% in dollar sales growth when comparing the 52-week period that ended with our latest fiscal third quarter against the 52-week period that ended with our fiscal 2019. And comparing the same periods, the business contributed the highest dollar sales growth in the category, amounting to over $2.5 billion. In our Wine & Spirits business, our largest higher-end brands Meiomi, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner and High West, all delivered dollar sales growth and share gains in the third quarter. And comparing the 52-week period that ended our latest fiscal third quarter, against the 52-week period that ended our fiscal 2019, these brands achieved 72% dollar sales growth. Moving on to number two, consumer-led innovation and shaping our portfolio for growth. Many of you may be surprised to know that in our beer portfolio, our SKUs introduced over the past three years have driven 20% of the growth delivered by the business since the start of fiscal 2020. An important part of this growth has come from our Modelo, Chelada brands, which have evolved from a niche business to a sizable platform. In fiscal 2023 year-to-date, it has delivered 13.6 million cases of depletions, which already exceeds the brand's total deflations for all of last fiscal year. And in the third quarter, Modelo Chelada Limon y Sal moved up nine spots to become the sixth largest share gaining brand in IRI tracked channels. Beyond the Chelada brands, we continue to build on the opportunities within the Modelo family with a clear focus on maintaining brand investments. We are excited about the national launch of Modelo Oro in March which has surpassed internal and external benchmarks in test markets. In our Wine & Spirits business, innovation has also yielded strong results, increasing its contribution to net sales from 1% in fiscal 2020 to approximately 8% in fiscal '23 year-to-date. This expansion has been primarily driven by extending our largest higher-end brand, once again, Meiomi Kim, The Prisoner and High West. Notably, extensions in The Prisoner brand family, Blindfold, SALDO and Unshackled have contributed significant growth, especially Unshackled, which has grown to be half the size of The Prisoner brand in just four years. In addition, since the beginning of fiscal 2020, we have added five brands through acquisitions, like Bronco Wines, My Favorite Neighbor, Empathy Wines, Halpern and Kings and Austin Cocktails, all of which are in the higher-end segments of the wines and spirits categories that are contributing to growth. And we divested 36 brands, the vast majority of which were in the mainstream segment, which has mainly been in decline due to consumer-led premiumization trends. Given this free shaping of our portfolio, including the recent additional divestiture 62% of net sales in fiscal '23 year-to-date were from our higher-end brands. This is a dramatic shift from the 34% higher-end brands represented at the end of fiscal '19. Now turning to number three, capital allocation. In fiscal 2020, we introduced a thoughtfully structured approach designed to consistently deploy capital with discipline and balance. We made maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, our top capital allocation priority and reduced our net leverage ratio, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, from 4.5x at the end of fiscal '19 to 3x by the end of the second quarter of this fiscal year. This was partly driven by a $3.2 billion reduction in our debt levels and partly by strong earnings growth in our beer business. And then in the third quarter, these efforts gave us the flexibility to both accommodate the $1.5 billion financing for the elimination of our Class B shares and to maintain our investment-grade rating. As our net leverage ratio remained in line with our prior 3.5x target. However, we recently updated that set target to 3x, given our ability to previously achieve that target and the continued strong cash flow generation capabilities of our businesses. Our second priority became delivering cash returns to our shareholders, and we set a goal to return $5 billion in dividends and buybacks between fiscal 2020 and '23. We virtually completed that goal ahead of schedule in the third quarter and we're now on track to exceed the $5 billion target with the fourth quarter dividend payment announced today. As to our third priority, we sought to advance growing capacity expansions to support the strong growth in our beer business. Since the start of fiscal 2020, we added approximately 9 million hectoliters of capacity through growth investments and another 2 million hectoliters through brewery optimization and productivity initiatives. We are also on track to further diversify our production footprint with the development of our new brewery in Veracruz, where we have recently broken ground. And last in our capital allocation priorities was M&A, and since the start of fiscal '20, we have judiciously deployed excess cash through acquisitions with a strict focus on small gap filling higher-end brands. And the key strategic acquisitions we have executed over the last nearly four years are delivering top line growth. All in, we believe we have unquestionably upheld our capital allocation priorities and have even exceeded some of the associated targets we set out to achieve. Moving on to strategic initiative number four, operate in a way that is good for business and good for the world by advancing ESG goals. Our ambitions are to protect the environment and natural resources by serving as a model for water stewardship in our industry while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to champion the professional development and advancement of women within our company, industry and communities, to enhance the economic development and prosperity in disadvantaged communities and to promote responsible beverage alcohol consumption. While we still have much work to do, I am proud to say we are making good progress towards our goals. To that end, in the third quarter, we released our 2022 ESG Impact Report, which included several enhancements on the information shared on these important topics and our work towards our targets, including, for the first time, references aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board framework and taking into consideration recommendations from the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. So as with our capital allocation priorities, we have been consistently working to deliver against our strategic initiatives. Net, we have done we have said what we do, and we have done what we said. And despite current inflationary pressures and the risk of recessionary headwinds we remain confident in our ability to continue to advance and create value through these initiatives. And on that note, let's move on to a more fulsome discussion of our performance in the third quarter. Depletion growth for our beer business decelerated to 5.7%, which, as I mentioned earlier, was largely due to a recent series of headwinds that developed towards the latter part of the quarter. First, as we shared on our last call, we decided to introduce all pricing changes above our usual algorithm due to cost pressures across the chain, and historically, the impact of these types of notable pricing actions take a few months to settle in. Second, distribution growth is returning to more normalized levels after lapping a softer summer period last year when we were managing supply constraints. That said, distribution growth remains at exceptionally healthy levels as well as aligned with our full year expectations. And third, some of these headwinds were particularly accentuated in a few key regions for our brands, such as California, where we lapped double-digit depletion growth rates and better weather in November of last year as well as more favorable economic conditions. All of that said, our beer business continues to perform strongly relative to the wider market and to resonate with consumers who continue to shift to higher-end brands. In IRI channels, we gained 1.5 points across the entire category and 2.3 points in the higher-end segment in the third quarter, which is higher, let me repeat that, which is higher than the share gains in the same quarter last fiscal year. And when looking at depletions fiscal '23 year-to-date, our beer business achieved growth of 7.8%, which continues to be in line with our annual expectations. Importantly, based on the prior activity we have seen in retail, as they adjust to the continued inflationary environment, we expect trends to return to more historical rates over the next few months. Now shifting to the performance of our beer brands. Modelo Especial delivered depletion growth of 4.4% in the third quarter lapping a tough 13.2% depletion growth comparison in the corresponding period of the last fiscal year. That said, the brand has achieved depletion growth of 9.9% over fiscal '23 year-to-date. In the recent quarter, it continued to strengthen its position in the five states where it is already the number one beer brand in dollar sales, delivering another approximately 0.2 points in share gains. Importantly, in the other 39 states tracked by IRI data, Modelo Especial delivered more than 4x the share gains at over 0.8 points. More broadly, Modelo Especial's depletion growth in its secondary markets outpaced the growth in its top five states by over 10 points. As such, we continue to see significant incremental opportunities to maintain the momentum of Modelo Especial, particularly through distribution gains in the states where it is under represented. Corona Extra delivered depletion growth of 1.3% in the third quarter and 4% in fiscal '23 year-to-date. As noted earlier, the brand has maintained its momentum as the number three share gainer in track channels. We continue to invest in the growth of Corona Extra through a thoughtful and authentic evolution of the brand's market such as the augmented reality addition to our O'Tannenpalm campaign, which is one of the more enduring holiday themed commercials running for over 30 years now. And we continue to see growth potential for Corona Extra with younger legal drinking age and multicultural consumers. Pacifico's depletion growth accelerated in the third quarter to 40.7%. And over fiscal '23, year-to-date, its depletion growth was 32.9%. The brand remains a top 10 share gainer in tracked channels in the third quarter, mainly supported by its growing footprint in states like California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado and Arizona. We continue to see fantastic growth runway for Pacifico as one of our new wave brands with significant distribution potential relative to Modelo and even more so relative to Corona Extra. Particularly as the brand also continues to build momentum by shifting East in the U.S., building on the 26% depletion growth delivered in our Eastern business unit in the third quarter. Lastly, our Modelo Chelada brands achieved depletion growth of 44% in the third quarter and 48% over fiscal '23 year-to-date. Our Modelo Chelada brand remained the number one set in the Chelada space, and the brands gained nearly half a share point across all U.S. beer and track channels. For perspective, that is as much as Corona Extra's gain. In fact, these gains were largely driven by innovations launched this fiscal year, including Naranja Picosa flavor, the Limon y Sal 12 ounce 12 pack, which is a top 10 new packaged SKU and our new variety pack, which is among the top 15 new brands. We continue to expect significant growth from the Modelo Chelada brands as we invest in marketing to the general market consumer to broaden the demographic appeal for this product. All in, the strong demand for our brands in the third quarter supported a net sales increase of approximately 8% for our beer business. And despite the impact of inflationary headwinds on operating income, we were able to maintain operating margin at 37.5%. This gives us the confidence to once again raise guidance for our beer business this fiscal year lifting the low end of our growth outlook. We now expect to achieve 9% to 10% net sales growth and 4% to 5% operating income growth for fiscal '23. Moving on to Wine & Spirits. Our Wine & Spirits business continues to advance its vision to be the high-end market leader. As noted earlier, our largest higher-end brands delivered strong performance relative to their categories in the third quarter. In our Aspira portfolio, which includes our fine wine and craft spirits brands, over the third quarter in track channels, The Prisoner brands grew dollar sales by 4.3%, while the fine wine segment contracted by 5.7%. And High West grew dollar sales by 22%, while high-end spirits segment grew by only 3.4% In our premium and mainstream Wine & Spirits portfolio, which we refer to as Ignite, both Meiomi and Kim Crawford gained share in the U.S. wine category. Depletions for our Wine & Spirits business declined by 5.5% in the third quarter, mainly driven by continued headwinds based across our mainstream brands. However, our Aspira portfolio delivered strong performance with 8.5% depletion growth in the quarter. And in fiscal '23 year-to-date, our Aspira portfolio has now achieved an overall 6.3% increase in depletions supported by strong double-digit depletion growth for The Prisoner and High West. Among Ignite brands, Meiomi and Kim Crawford have also delivered solid depletion growth in fiscal '23 year-to-date, supporting an overall 2.3% increase in depletions for our premium line portfolio. Our Wine & Spirits business also continued to expand its global omnichannel footprint, advancing its growth in direct-to-consumer, 3-tier e-commerce channels as well as international markets. Wine & Spirits DTC net sales grew 23% in the third quarter, and we continue to perform particularly well in 3-tier e-commerce which delivered dollar sales growth 9 points above the competition. These results were underpinned by our strategic DTC investments in both hospitality through facility upgrades and talent development and our own e-commerce website platforms as well as our continued leadership in 3 Tier e-commerce through marketing innovations like launching video ads on Instacart. And a strategic focus on major omnichannel national accounts, third-party marketplaces and digitally native retailers like Amazon, where we were the number one overall supplier and number one growth supplier in higher-end wine in the third quarter. International markets accounted for 9% of the total net sales in the Wine & Spirits business in the third quarter as our strategically focused approach continued to target select metropolitan markets, including London, Tokyo, Seoul, Sydney, Mexico City, Zurich and Toronto with some of our most renowned premium and fine wine brands like The Prisoner, the Schrader as well as more recently acquired brands like Lingua Franca and My Favorite Neighbor. And with our craft spirits portfolio, which includes brands like Casa Noble and the CAMPO high-end tequilas, that delivered international shipments 5x greater than the third quarter of the prior year. We are also pleased that our efforts to establish a leading global higher-end Wine & Spirits portfolio are gaining recognition with several of our brands receiving remarkable accolades including Schrader Cellars winning its 37th 100-point score and its Double Diamond brand being recognized by The Wine Spectator as its number one wine of 2022. Our To Kalon Vineyard was being recognized again as the top vineyard in North America for the fourth consecutive year among top vineyards in the world. And I'm pleased to report that our To Kalon Vineyard has now also is certified as organic, expanding the appeal of its wines to a broader set of consumers and adding to its differentiation. And in our spirits portfolio, our recently launched Nelson Brothers Bourbon Reserve was ranked among Whiskey Advocate's top 10 most exciting whiskeys of 2022. So all in, our Wine & Spirits business continues to make meaningful progress on its transformation. And while net sales and operating margins, net of recent divestiture, were slightly lower relative to the third quarter of last fiscal year due to volume shifts from shipment timing only being partially offset by mix and pricing benefits we did see a significant sequential uplift in operating margins of 55 basis points relative to the second quarter of this fiscal year. This gives us confidence to reaffirm our fiscal '23 guidance for our Wine & Spirits business of stable to 2% lower net sales and 3% to 5% operating income growth, which we are providing against the fiscal '22 baseline adjusted for the recent divestiture. Looking further ahead, we are also confident that over the medium term, both our beer business and our Wine & Spirits business remain well placed to deliver strong growth and best-in-class operating margins. That said, given continued inflationary pressures and the potential impact of recessionary environment, we remain mindful of balancing the momentum of our brands against near-term cost challenges. To that end, based on our current expectations of the pressures that the consumer will continue to face in the near term, we are giving even more careful consideration to our pricing actions for fiscal '24. In particular, we currently expect pricing actions for our beer business to be more muted in fiscal '24 as our pricing actions in the current fiscal year were ultimately above our medium-term algorithm. While input costs remain at historically elevated prices we strongly believe that additional consideration in our approach to pricing in fiscal '24 is warranted to sustain healthy growth for our brands. In addition, while some input costs are below the peaks from earlier this fiscal year, we now anticipate inflation to remain above historical trends in the high-end single-digit range for fiscal '24. As always, we will continue with our disciplined approach to manage these evolving conditions through cost-saving initiatives. But these persistent inflationary headwinds will be compounding on the double-digit cost uplift we have faced in fiscal '23. As such, we now expect operating margins for our beer business in fiscal '24 to be more in line with our anticipated margin structure for this fiscal year, and therefore, below our stated 39% to 40% medium-term range. We are still refining our outlook for '24 and will provide more detailed guidance at our next earnings call, but we wanted to share some context today now that our annual planning process is underway. With all that said, let me be clear. Our beer business continues to have best-in-class operating margins and our Wine & Spirits business continues to make progress toward achieving that same differentiation. We are also confident that over the medium term, our beer business remains well positioned to deliver leading operating margins, supported by the sustained momentum of our core Modelo Especial and Corona Extra brands, the significant opportunity being captured by our Pacifico, Modelo Chelada brands. The incremental upside from our broader existing portfolio and the continued development of our innovation lineup particularly from exciting imminent additions like Modelo Oro and we continue to expect our Wine & Spirits business to make progress on its operating margins supported by continuing to pursue the exciting runway for growth of our higher-end brands and ensuring these brands represent an even greater portion of our mix over time, enhancing the performance of our mainstream portfolio through a greater focus on brands and initiatives with higher returns, including through relevant and innovative products and growing our omni-channel and international leadership particularly as an incremental opportunity for higher-end growth. Now before I conclude, I wish to quickly touch on Canopy. We remain supporter of Canopy sellers to create an exchangeable share structure designed to support the consolidation of all its U.S. cannabis assets into a single avenue. And to that end, our intention continues to be to transition our existing common share ownership interest in Canopy Growth into new exchangeable shares once its shareholders approve this transaction. We believe that the conversion of our ownership interest will maintain our ability to realize the potential upside of our investment in Canopy. At the same time this transaction and the surrender of our warrants are expected to eliminate the impact to our equity and earnings, mitigate risk to our organization and further reinforce our intent to not deploy additional investment in Canopy in line with our capital allocation priorities. In closing, I'd like to reiterate three main takeaways today. First, nearly four years ago we committed to a series of strategic initiatives aimed at delivering profitable growth and shareholder value. And I'm pleased to say that we are delivering against those initiatives and in many cases even exceeding the goals we set out to achieve. Second, our third quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute against these strategic initiatives and that our company remains in a strong position to deliver best-in-class results. Despite the headwinds in the quarter due to macroeconomic pressures and tough comps versus prior year, the strong performance of our beer business has put it on track to deliver better-than-expected results in fiscal '23. And the transformation of our Wine & Spirits business is also yielding results. And third, we remain confident we will continue to build on our track record of solid growth and value creation through our strategic initiatives. And with that, I turn the call over to Garth.
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we delivered another set of solid results in the third quarter and continue to make progress against our operating plans and strategic initiatives. Our beer business achieved high single-digit net sales growth and continue to deliver best-in-class operating margins. Our Wine & Spirits business made additional progress against its strategy with an even more premiumized portfolio further aligned with consumer trends following our recently completed divestiture. Additionally, we generated strong cash flow results and with yesterday's declared dividend to be paid in February, we are on track to exceed our stated $5 billion goal of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases between fiscal '20 and fiscal '23. I will now review our Q3 performance and full year outlook in more detail, where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with our beer business. Net sales increased 8%, primarily driven by higher average price increases and solid demand across our portfolio. Q3 shipment volumes were up 3% reflecting a difficult volume lap given the focus of replenishing product inventories in the same period last year. From a depletions perspective, we achieved growth in the quarter of approximately 6%, driven by the demand of our Modelo family of products, including the Modelo Especial and Modelo Chelada brand as well as double-digit growth from Pacifico. As Bill noted, depletions decelerated sequentially from Q2 to Q3. This was primarily due to: number one, incremental fall pricing that, as expected, will put us above our targeted annual average increase. Notably the impact of our fall increases has been heightened by additional pricing actions across the value chain. That said, we expect the impact of incremental pricing will settle over the coming months as we have seen in prior similar circumstances. Number two, relatively lower distribution growth in Q3 versus Q2, where we lapped a softer prior year period when we were managing supply constraints. And while we are seeing distribution growth return to normalized levels, it remains aligned with our full year expectations. Importantly, it is worth noting that Q3 distribution growth remained well above the levels we achieved in Q4 last year and Q1 of this year. And number three, as Bill also referenced in the third quarter, particularly in the month of November, we lapped multiple tailwinds from last year such as double-digit depletion growth rates in key regions like California, which benefited from periods of warmer weather and a stronger macroeconomic environment. All of that said, we expect depletion trends to continue to normalize as we move into fiscal 2024, and we remain confident in our fiscal year expectations. Selling days in the quarter were flat year-over-year, but please note that in Q4, there will be one less selling day. Operating income for the beer business decreased 2% and operating margins declined by 380 basis points to 38%. As expected, operating income and operating margins were negatively affected by ongoing inflationary pressures across raw materials and packaging, particularly as more favorable hedges rolled off. Increased logistics expenses related to higher fuel and freight costs, incremental operating costs and increased depreciation as a result of our brewery capacity expansions, and increased marketing spend, particularly from our media investments in sports sponsorships with NFL, NCAA Football, Major League Baseball, the NBA and the NHL. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 160 basis points to 9.6% in Q3. For fiscal '23, we continue to expect that marketing as a percent of net sales will be in the 9% to 10%. More broadly, given the strong top line growth of our beer business year-to-date, we now anticipate it will grow net sales between 9% to 10% and operating income between 4% to 5% for the full fiscal year. This still implies an operating margin of approximately 38% for fiscal 2023. As expected benefits from our 2% to 3% average pricing increase for the full year and our cost-saving efforts will be more than offset by the same headwinds that have affected our margins year-to-date. I'd like to take a moment to reiterate some of the points Bill made earlier regarding fiscal '24. As mentioned, we are anticipating our beer business margins to be more in line with our anticipated margin for this fiscal year, and therefore, below our stated medium-term target range of 39% to 40%. This is driven by the fact that input costs remain at historically elevated levels due to ongoing inflationary pressures. As we have shared in some of our prior calls, we hedged about 10% of our beer business costs to help reduce volatility in the P&L. However, our commodity hedging program is managed on a multiyear rolling basis. So we currently do not anticipate our blended hedge rates to capture the favorability of recent declines in certain commodity prices until the second half of next fiscal year. In addition while prices have declined from their peaks earlier this year for commodities like aluminum and natural gas, which are part of our can and glass cost, they still remain above pre-pandemic levels. Beyond our hedging program, most of our beer business input costs have a greater exposure to inflationary pressures, including raw materials, such as wood pallets, steel crowns and cartons. The majority of these input costs are subject to contractual agreements that tend to reflect negotiated prices that are based on existing inflationary conditions. So as we move forward with our annual planning and supplier cost determination process, we will develop a clearer view of these contractual prices and on the resulting margin expectations. Against that backdrop, with these processes now underway, we have greater visibility into the high single-digit cost segments that will continue to build off the double digit unfavorable cost outlook that our beer business faced in fiscal '23. In addition, we continue to see ongoing macroeconomic pressures on the consumer, which are leading us to plan to take more subdued pricing actions across our beer portfolio in fiscal '24. That said, we expect a number of tailwinds that will partially offset some of these headwinds, including the continued momentum of our core brands, capitalizing on opportunities with emerging brands such as Pacifico and Modelo Chelada's, winning with new and future innovation such as Modelo or Modelo Oro and through our consistent and disciplined cost savings actions, nevertheless, as Bill mentioned, we will continue to refine our outlook for next year, and we will provide detailed guidance during our Q4 earnings call. That said, it is important to reiterate that our expected fiscal '23 and fiscal '24 operating margins remained best in class. And in fact, when considering our fiscal '20 through our currently anticipated fiscal '24 margins, we expect the average operating margin for that 5-year period to remain within our medium-term algorithm of 39% to 40%. Now shifting to Wine & Spirits. As a reminder, during our recently concluded third quarter, we divested a series of brands from our Wine portfolio. As such, third quarter of fiscal '22, included approximately $17 million of net sales and $11 million of gross profit less marketing, that are no longer part of the Wine & Spirits segment results. When presenting today's results, I will be discussing our top line results on an organic basis, excluding the contribution from those divested brands in the preceding periods. Starting with organic net sales. The Wine & Spirits business decreased 1%, primarily driven by a 13% decrease in shipments, partially offset by a favorable product mix, which both related to consumer-led premiumization and mix improvements of our portfolio. From a depletions perspective, while the Wine & Spirits business saw a decline of approximately 6% on an organic basis in Q3 as Bill noted earlier, our higher-end brand delivered strong performance with our Aspira portfolio, which includes our fine wine and craft spirits brands, delivering depletion growth of 9%, driven by growth in our Prisoner Wine and High West brands. Meanwhile, our Ignite portfolio, which includes our mainstream and premium Wine & Spirits brands primarily faced headwinds from our mainstream brands, which was down 8%. That said, in tracked channels, our largest higher-end brands continue to outperform their corresponding segments, and our peak premium brands portfolio actually gained share in the category with particularly strong performance from Meiomi and Kim Crawford in both volume and dollar sales growth. Moving on to Wine & Spirits operating income and operating margins. Wine & Spirits operating income declined by 7%, partly as a result of the divestiture and operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 24.8%. The decrease in operating margins was driven by higher transportation costs, including ocean freight shipping, unfavorable costs from higher drivers largely due to inflation and increased general and administrative expenses due to higher compensation and benefits primarily related to higher headcount from our continued strategic focus on expanding into direct-to-consumer channels and higher-end brands in our Aspira portfolio. For full year fiscal '23, we remain confident in our previously stated outlook for our Wine & Spirits business. We expect fiscal '23 organic net sales decline of 0% to 2% and operating income to increase 3% to 5% implying a full year operating margin of about 24%. Looking ahead to fiscal '24, we expect our Wine & Spirits business to continue to make progress on its operating margin. We believe our Wine & Spirits business is positioned to further improve its operating margins through growth of our higher-end brands, bolster performance from our mainstream portfolio through high-return brand initiatives such as innovation, and expansion of our omnichannel and international footprint. As I mentioned earlier, we are currently working through our annual planning process and we'll provide a more detailed fiscal '24 outlook during our Q4 earnings call. Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Corporate expenses came in at approximately $75 million, up 70% versus Q3 last year. This increase in corporate expense was primarily impacted by costs associated with increased compensation and benefits, primarily related to a third quarter fiscal '22 reversal of stock-based compensation and third-party services related to our ongoing investments in our digital business acceleration initiative. We now expect our total corporate spend to be between $290 million and $300 million for the full year, mainly driven by the incremental costs in Q3. Interest expense for the quarter was up 12%. Also, as we noted in our release, following the completion of the reclassification of our Class B common stock, we now expect interest expense for fiscal '23 to be between $390 million and $400 million. This includes the interest expense associated with the funding of the $1.5 billion cash consideration which is expected to be $80 million to $90 million on an annual basis based on current market rates. Our Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings, came in at 18.8% versus 14% in Q3 last year. The effective tax rate increased mostly due to the change in stock-based compensation benefits. As a result of these updates to our outlook, the increased interest expense due to the reclassification bonds, adjustments relating to our most recent divestiture in our Wine & Spirits business and increased corporate expenses that were only partially offset by the increased expectations for our beer business. We now expect comparable EPS guidance to be in the $11 to $11.20 range, which represents a $0.20 decrease to the bottom end and a $0.40 decrease at the top end of our prior guidance range. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.6 billion for the nine months of fiscal '23 reflecting strong operating cash flow partially offset by a 14% increase in CapEx investments as we continue to support the growth of our beer business through our brewery capacity expansion plans. And on that note, to echo Bill, we are excited by the progress we have made with our new sites in Veracruz in which we recently broke ground. Our fiscal '23 free cash flow is now expected to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion and CapEx is now expected to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. Operating cash flow for fiscal '23 remains unchanged and is expected to be between $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion. Related to our uses of these cash flows, as we recently noted in December, our capital allocation priorities moving forward following the reclassification remain fundamentally aligned with the priorities we introduced in fiscal '20. To achieve a disciplined and balanced and thoughtful approach to support growth and value creation. Our recently updated capital allocation priorities are as follows: first, we remain committed to our investment-grade rating and to targeting dividend growth in line with earnings as key elements of a disciplined financial foundation. We ended the third quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.5x when factoring in the financing for the cash payment associated with our recent transition to a single-class stock structure and excluding Canopy equity earnings. That said, we have set a target net leverage ratio on that same basis of approximately 3x, which we are confident we can return to. Another important element of our commitment to a disciplined financial foundation is targeting an approximately 30% dividend and payout ratio. Second, we will continue to balance investments to support the growth of our business and deliver additional returns to shareholders through share repurchases. As we look ahead, we continue to expect adding another 25 million hectoliters to 30 million hectoliters of brewing capacity between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026. This will be supported by $5 billion to $5.5 billion of investment over that same period. We are developing this capacity through a series of expansion waves which is consistent with the modular approach we have adopted to maintain capital expenditure discipline and flexibility. We remain committed to executing share repurchases targeted to at least cover dilution. While we also have approximately $1.2 billion of our repurchase capacity still under our current board authorization and plan to remain opportunistic, particularly since we achieved incremental cash flow flexibility. And third, we may deploy excess cash to smaller acquisitions. Again, we intend to remain disciplined in our pursuit of any M&A opportunities and we'll continue to pursue transactions that we believe fulfill one or more of the following characteristics: are consumer led, they deliver growth momentum, providing compelling returns, fill portfolio gaps, and offer synergistic benefits. Lastly, on Canopy. As it announced in October, Canopy plans to consolidate all of its U.S. cannabis assets into a single entity, Canopy USA. This U.S. holding company and new exchangeable share structure is designed to enable Canopy USA to trigger full ownership of Canopy's U.S. cannabis investments and capitalize on the U.S. cannabis market opportunities. Assuming the completion of this transaction and approval by Canopy shareholders of a charter amendment we intend to transition our existing common share ownership interest in Canopy into new exchangeable shares, which is intended to protect Constellation shareholder value while retaining an interest in Canopy through nonvoting and nonparticipating shares. This share ownership transition and the surrender of our Canopy warrants is aligned with our focus on core beer and Wine & Spirits businesses and capital allocation priorities. As a reminder, until this transaction is completed and we convert our holdings into exchangeable shares, Canopy will still be reported within our P&L consistent with past quarters. In closing, we continue to demonstrate strong execution in growing our core business and investments to enhance our portfolio of industry-leading brands. As we approach the end of the fiscal year, we remain committed to delivering against our stated goals to drive sustainable and profitable growth and build shareholder value. And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Lauren Lieberman: Thanks. Good morning. When you walk through the drivers of the change in trend for depletions that you saw towards the end of the quarter, one sort of mention was a comparison on macroeconomic trend versus the prior year and then also your comments on taking sort of more muted pricing as you look into '24. So I'd love if you could just spend a little bit more time talking about what you're seeing from your various kind of core consumer groups, it feels like I know you pointed out some share gain continues. But when we look at some of your brands relative to other high-end brands, core beer brands, not Seltzer, it does look like there's underperformance, it's specific to your brands. So just any further diagnostic you may have done would be really helpful to hear about? And then also, I wasn't entirely clear on why the slower CapEx spend, I know you just went through it across at the very end of your comments, but I was hoping you could just reframe that because I admittedly missed why is it $200 million lower this year?
Bill Newlands: Sure. So relative, Lauren, to the depletion trend scenario, we're still seeing in our -- all of our assessment and research suggests that we continue to have very strong support for our brands among our core Hispanic base as well as growing trends amongst the non-Hispanic community. I think a great example of that shows itself in that we actually had an increase in our share gain quarter-on-quarter from last year which reflects very well. Certainly, some of what we saw at the latter part of this quarter was driven by a couple of things. One is many businesses, including ours, took additional pricing over what we had planned. And that caused an overall softness in the market, particularly in the state of California. It wasn't limited to us. And frankly, that's not an unusual reaction. We've seen that many times before. Frankly, what we were very pleased about as we then look into December and to see if this thing is beginning to go back to some normalcy, we see that it has been, we saw a 7.5% swing to the upside in dollars versus where it was in November and that compares to a category swing of 4.5%. So again, we saw a significant improvement in the market that was primarily the cause of a bit of deceleration in our depletion performance as we got into December, and we continue to gain share in that overall mix of swing. So we're not -- we -- this is not an unusual event. It happens virtually every time you see significant pricing action taken and the fact that we continue to gain share at the clip that we are gives us great confidence going forward and the strength of the brands overall. Garth, anything you want to say.
Garth Hankinson: Yes, Lauren, just on the CapEx, it's important to note that we continue to progress with our expansion as planned. As we stated in the remarks, we've added 11 million hectoliters of capacity over the last several years, $9 million in growth, sort of $2 million through productivity initiatives. We are on track with our expansions at both Nava and Obregon. And as we mentioned, we've recently broken ground in Veracruz. So the reduction in CapEx for this year is not necessarily abnormal as we move through the year. It really has more to reflect the timing of when payments will be made and less to do with progress.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.
Nik Modi: Yes, good morning, everyone. Bill, I was hoping maybe you could talk about what's actually happening with some of the pricing as it goes through the supply chain? Certainly, we've picked up some commentary within the trade that pricing was taken on top of what you actually took in the market. And I'm just curious what the state of that is, if it's starting to get unwound? And have you seen any implication of that in some of the more recent weeks?
Bill Newlands: Yes. You bet, Nik. You're absolutely right. One of the things that we saw that occurred after our pricing increase is that other players within the chain took more price on top of what our pricing increase was. And frankly, this often happens as well. The Board tends to happen, and we've already started to see it in certain some markets is that, that moderates over time as well because an attempt is made to see what the consumer is ready to accept. And if we find a spot that's a bit more than they are ready to accept you see some moderation in that increase. You've already started to see that with some critical change in the state of California, which probably relates to my answer to Lauren a moment ago, which is why you saw the trends in December change quite a bit. So you're correct there was a lot more and it piled on, if you will, once it was out of us and into further down the chain, more was taken and as we often see that goes higher early and then moderates over time.
Operator: Our next question is from Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein.
Nadine Sarwat: I just want to stick with depletions here. I know you gave those explanations in your prepared remarks, but I have two follow-ups. So the first is that the reported depletion still meaningfully lag the trends in the Nielsen track channels, which I would have assumed would reflect a number of the factors that you called out, so could you help us understand this gap? And then the second question is, I know you've mentioned that you have confidence that your depletions would return to those normal levels. But we are still seeing weakness in the December Nielsen trends. So could you provide some color as to what gives you that confidence? And what are your quarter-to-date depletions at the moment?
Bill Newlands: Sure. So let's start with the question of track channels. One of the things that we have historically found is that you're in the roughly -- there's roughly 3-point delta, we use IRI, I realize you just said Nielsen, we use IRI. There's roughly a 3-point delta historically between the growth that you see in the tracked channels and the depletion rates. Interestingly, that got massively bigger when you're in the middle of the pandemic because the percentage of business that went through the off-premise trade increased substantially. That has now come back to somewhat of a more normalized level as you get to a little bit better positioned in the on-premise, not quite back to where it was, but it's directionally. So that is some of what you are seeing is you're back to a more traditional split between those individual things. Relative to -- and I quoted to the California, some other states are seeing a bit different. Texas on the other was also a market that was somewhat softer post price increase, and that one has not rebounded just yet. But that, again, is not unusual either. It's a little bit of a different channel mix than what you see in the state of California where you often see a more faster response to whatever impact pricing increases take. So this, in our judgment is all part of a normal process of when pricing actions are taken. It takes a few months for it to all work its way through the system. Relative to the depletes, we don't have the final numbers in. As you would expect, we're only in day five of the New Year and obviously, it included the New Year, which makes the reporting a little bit behind. What I would say is that we're comfortable with where we think the summer is going to land. Otherwise, we wouldn't have raised our guidance.
Operator: Our next question is from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hi, guys. Not to belabor the pricing conversation, but when you mentioned 2024 pricing to be more muted, could you maybe just talk a little bit more about what that means? And then Garth, when we think about the share price, not just the movement today but perhaps more recently and perhaps even the fact that it's been -- the share has been flat for a period of time. Does that change how you're thinking about share recalls?
Bill Newlands: Sure, I'll go for it. So relative to 2024 pricing, as we stated in the last quarterly call, we were going to go above what our expectations had been. And that reflects, obviously, in the October increase that has taken us above our traditional 1% to 2% guidelines. What we're suggesting relative to 2024 is that it's going to be much more in line with what our historical trend has been, which is 1% to 2%. We would not expect it to go beyond the top end of the range as we did in this particular year and late in this fiscal year.
Garth Hankinson: Yes, Kaumil on the share repurchase, I just want to make sure it's clear that we haven't necessarily deprioritized share repurchase activity. As we mentioned, we have $1.2 billion worth of capacity under our current board authorization. In the near term, we think that it's more important to focus on getting our leverage ratio back down close to 3%. That being said, we do have the flexibility to be able to take advantage of weakness in the marketplace, as we said in our prepared remarks and be opportunistic. So it's absolutely something that we have the flexibility and optionality to execute against.
Operator: Our next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Bonnie Herzog: All right, thank you. Hi, everyone. Just maybe first, a quick clarification on your pricing. I'm wondering if you're still expecting to be in your 2% to 3% pricing guidance range for the full year since I guess that would imply only around 1% pricing in Q4? And then, I guess, a question on your guidance, just in terms of your beer guidance, you raised your full year sales and op income growth, but it does imply shipments will be down maybe as much as high single digits in Q4. So I'm aware you're lapping the distributor inventory build from last year, but just trying to reconcile this with some of the key initiatives you have out such as the rollout of Modelo Oro that's shipping now. So maybe if you could touch on that? And then just finally, I wanted to clarify if you expect your full year shipments and depletions to be broadly in line with each other? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure. We do expect to be slightly above our 2% to 3% that we quoted in the last quarter, when all is said and done for the year. We also -- you should also recognize that mix is going to be higher and in large part because of the significant increase in the Chelada business, which is mix accretive in the overall portfolio. Garth, do you want to touch on the other piece?
Garth Hankinson: Yes. Just in Q4, right? I mean as a reminder Bonnie, as we said throughout the year, you need to focus on sort of full year performance as that we're going to -- it was going to be sort of uneven or choppy results throughout the year, given the fact that we had the difficult overlaps as we were in the first half of last year dealing with some production-related issues in the second half of the year, we were building back inventories. So Q4 will certainly be muted this year versus what it was last year as last year was sort of artificially high due to that, those rebuilding efforts.
Operator: Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: Hi guys, good morning. So I know we spent a lot of time on depletions already, but just a couple more specific follow-ups to drive a finer point on it. A, just as we think about the deceleration we've seen in nontrack channels, the untracked channels the last couple of quarters here. I wanted to get a little more detail on your perspective on what's occurring there. Is it more just look, there's less momentum from an on-premise recovery post-COVID as you cycle the more normalized post-COVID comps, might there be more of a macro slowdown on the untracked off-premise channels as theoretically volume shift to track channels in areas like Bodegas, et cetera, just sort of break down that nontracked channel mix a bit in terms of talking about on-premise versus the untracked off-premise. So sort of extended a bit beyond the answer to Nadine's question? And then Modelo does look like it's disproportionately slowed. Just to check on that, it seems like your mindset is more that it's related to some of the weakness in California, some of the pricing impact, less sort of more temporary factors. Is any of that sort of related to more longer-term factors? Maybe it's at a much larger base and you're having -- you're not going to see as much growth? How do you sort of think about the Modelo brand and its performance recently? And then last, sorry for the multipart question, but price/mix was obviously very strong in the quarter. Some of that is higher year-over-year pricing. But presumably, some of that is mix also. So are you seeing a big shift to smaller packages, might that also be part of the reason for some of the depletion weakness. So I just wanted to get a little more clarity on those points as it related to depletions? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure. Let's try to tackle those one at a time. Relative to Modelo, well, importantly, we are still seeing share gains in our five biggest markets. I think that's really important. But we're seeing several times those gains in the other markets with track channels, which we see as we've said many times before, a tremendous upside opportunity, this brand is still under shared, if you will, in terms of its household penetration compared to Corona Extra as an example. So there's just a lot of runway for growth for Modelo, and we remain very, very comfortable and confident in that brand's ability to continue to accelerate. Relative to the nontracked channels, we have continued to see on-premise get closer to where it had been, but it's still not quite to where it was before the pandemic, one. Two, it always takes a bit more time in some of the smaller Bodega style nontrack channels for pricing actions to work their way through. We've seen that happen before. And obviously, when you include and talk about the state of California, which is our single biggest share market, I'll remind you that Modelo Especial is bigger than Coors Light, Miller Light, Bud Light combined. When you see some of that happen it has a disproportionate impact in the short term until the pricing scenario plays itself through. So we don't believe this is any long-term trend issues. And our confidence in that is bolstered by the fact that as I stated earlier to one of the earlier questions, that we saw a very strong rebound in the State of California during December. Relative to price mix, a piece of that -- by the way, I should also mention, the number one share gainer in the State of California in the last four weeks happen to be Pacifico. I think that also speaks to the strength of our portfolio. Our portfolio is not a one-trick pony. We have a very strong place in the Corona brand, and the Modelo brand as well as Pacifico, all of which I think is very positive. Relative to the price mix question, right? We are seeing mix benefits. Some of that, as I stated just a moment ago is related to Chelada, given how big and important Chelada has gotten to be, that is mix accretive to our overall business. And therefore, the 40-plus percent growth profile that you see from that particular subsegment of Modelo does add significantly to the mix benefit that you observed.
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.
Kevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So my question relates to trade down in the category over the next 12 months, given the sort of obvious element in the room with the macro factors. And I wanted to tie that in your level of confidence on -- in your beer segment. So we are seeing trade down like we see it in the Nielsen data for economy beers, which, of course, have been donating share for a long period of time. So Bill, how concerning is that when we look at trade down behavior and we've seen it in past recessions as well. I just want to see how that's sort of informing the view. And I think relatedly, just given some of the concern that's out there in the market today, I think folks would be very keen on hearing your level of confidence, I guess, in your intermediate term, high single-digit growth outlook for the beer business. The color you guys gave on margins was certainly helpful. And it looks like you're taking a conservative tack there. Is it reasonable to take a sort of similarly conservative tack in your outlook for top line growth in the beer segment looking out to next year as well? So thank you for all that.
Bill Newlands: Sure. I'll go backwards there on that. Hopefully, I won't miss anything. We maintain our continuing expectation of our medium-term guidance that we've said before, we don't think there's any radical change to where that has been. And as you know, we've often beaten that in the past. Relative to trade down, we'd obviously watch this carefully. We are very fortunate in the alcohol beverage business that we tend to be recession-resistant, doesn't mean that there's no impact that we are -- it is certainly resistant. The interesting thing that's occurred at this particular time is we've seen variable trade down at our price points. It doesn't mean -- you're correct, there has been trade down, but it has tended to be from price points below us going even lower rather than trade down from our brands which I think speaks very strongly to this year's strength of those brands. We have seen some trading around within our brands. I know -- as I said a moment ago, the Pacifico scenario in the state of California is spectacular. And I think is reflective of the growth potential for that business but it also reflected some trading around within our portfolio that occurred. So we are less concerned. We also keep our eye on it. We are less concerned about trade down from our price points. And remember, we are continuing to market these brands in the same way that we have historically. Our share of voice at the consumer level has never been higher. And I think that's important as well. We continue to invest behind our brands to support those in the eye and the mind of the consumer. And I think that's going to be critically important during a time when there could be some trade down lower in the category.
Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Strelzik: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I'll follow up quickly and then another question. The follow-up is on pricing again. I'm just curious, obviously recognizing that you're making some of the commentary about '24 being a bit more muted, while you're seeing some volatility in the depletion trends. So can you just talk about how you'll be approaching that or what you'll be watching as you move through the year potential flexibility there, things maybe holding a little bit better? And then the other question is just on product innovation, which you mentioned all the growth that's been driven by product innovation in the last several years. How does the innovation pipeline look now versus the last several years? Are you -- where are you seeing kind of the biggest opportunities or where is the focus? And is that more or less relevant in this consumer environment? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Yes, you bet. So relative to pricing, Andrew, we believe we're going to be more -- we took more price now in October which will inherently have some rollover benefit within the P&L. But relative to new pricing taken in next fiscal year, we expect them to be back in that 1% to 2% range that we have consistently delivered. We think that's important, especially in an environment where the consumer is overly sensitive to pricing actions. We're in an inflationary environment across all areas in the consumer space. And our view is we need to be careful in balancing our growth profile with our pricing profile. And we're going to continue that thought and approach going forward because we think it's in the best long-term interest of our brands. Innovation is going to continue to be an important part of what we do. As you know, we're very excited about the launch here in March of Modelo Oro. Certainly, the Chelada business continues to be one of our great growth drivers. And many of those things, as I noted in my prepared remarks, are products that are relatively new. As you probably know, this fiscal year, we added a 12 pack, we added 12 ounce. We're putting a variety pack in. That's been very successful also. So we're reaching more consumers and more consumer occasions than what we have done. And therefore, we continue to expect innovation to be an ongoing part of our success, same through the wine business. You saw that with things like Unshackled with things like our Red Blend in Meiomi. You saw that with Illuminate, with Kim Crawford. We're -- and innovation has been a strength of our companies and that we can put outstanding liquids in the bottle or can as the case may be and continue to do so, and we think that's going to be an important part together with our core organic growth of our growth profile going forward.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Chris Carey: Hi, everyone. So I'm just trying to get a little bit more comfort with the outlook on beer operating margins for next year. If I just take this concept of muted pricing and high single-digit inflation, I'm coming up with a little bit of operating margin compression, right, and maybe modest operating income growth in beer next year. And so I'm just wondering if that logic is sound or whether there are other things going on here like incremental savings programs for less spending elsewhere, which gets you to, I think, what you're implying is operating margins are flat, and if not, I just wonder if there's a more important revision of estimates that's required here, so thanks for any clarification on that? And any help you can provide on the bridge math.
Garth Hankinson: Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. Look I think it's important to note that we will continue to deliver best-in-class operating margins, both this year and next year. As we said during the call, we're in the process right now of going through our annual planning review. And so we'll have a lot more detail to share on this with our Q4 earnings release and outlook for FY 2024. That being said, we did want to use today to acknowledge that next year's margin profile is going to be more in line with this year's margin profile for all the reasons that we discussed. Certainly, inflation continues to be enduring, and it's lasted longer than anyone had expected. And as we noted, many of our costs are contractual in nature, and those contracts when they get renegotiated, they get renegotiated at sort of the then inflation rate, not necessarily what the outlook for the year is. And we're going through that process again right now. So we'll have more clarity around where we land on those as we go through the next several weeks and months. We've talked about hedges in commodities, and commodities coming off their highs, but certainly, they certainly haven't reverted yet to where they were pre-pandemic, so they will continue to be a bit of a headwind for us next year. Depreciation will also be a bit of a headwind next year for us as we lay around the incremental CapEx that I referenced to Lauren's question, we will -- we do expect to go live with our ABA capacity expansion at Nava as well as that incremental capacity at Obregon. What's the impact to that depreciation on, again, we'll know better about that in the next few months because that's all dependent upon when assets are put into service. And then as you know, pricing will be a bit more muted. Again, we're still going to be within our 1% to 2% algorithm. We just won't be above 2%, like we have been not just this fiscal year but last fiscal year as well. And so those will be some of the headwinds. And again, we always have tailwinds for as well. The continued momentum of the brands, right? We'll continue to -- the brands will continue to grow and drive efficiencies, and we always have a robust set of cost savings initiatives that we will avail ourselves up. And again, we'll have more detail around what -- how each of those impact margins for FY '24 as we release our FY '23 annual results, but we wanted to acknowledge that on this call.
Operator: Our next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Just one quick one for me. Garth, I guess while we're talking about '24 there's a $26 million, I guess, gross contribution after marketing hit from the Wine & Spirits divestitures that affected fiscal '23. So does any of that spill into fiscal '24? Or are there still I guess drags from divestitures that we should be thinking about as we're just polishing up our '24 model today?
Garth Hankinson: There won't be any more necessarily more drags per se from that, as the cost will come out. I won't say that the impact that you'll have is that there will just be a comparability issued for the first sort of three quarters of the year, but no further drag as we move into the year.
Operator: And our final question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Vivien Azer: Hi, thank you very much. I was hoping we could pivot to the wine segment, given the conversations around down trading in beer Bill, I was hoping to get some perspective on what you guys think you're seeing in wine, the Nielsen data would suggest that there is down trading there? And if you could just remind us, given all of the divestitures that you guys have done, what percentage of your wine revenues are coming from $20 and above?
Bill Newlands: Sure, you bet Vivien. We have seen some more trading down in the wine business in the fact that private label has been tending to outpace branded sales by roughly 2.1 points in the last 12 weeks. So that has had some impact. What's interesting is you get a bit of a, I would say, a buying model scenario, meaning you're seeing some trade down at sort of mid- to lower price points. And then you're doing fine if you get into higher price points and a little bit in the middle has been a little shaky is some of what we're seeing. So -- which is a little different than what you have seen historically in these particular environments. As I said in my prepared remarks, there's been a pretty radical change in the amount of our business in the premium sector. I would -- I didn't categorize it as $20. But we're well over 60% of our total business now occurring in the premium and fine wine sector, which was 34% just a few years ago. So we're seeing a pretty radical move within our business as we thought what if we reshape the portfolio because over the long term that's where the consumer is going. And we believe that's not only where there's better profitability but there's better growth as well. So we believe the work that we've done is bearing fruit, and I think it plays itself out in terms of the growth profile of some of our higher end and critical brands.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for closing remarks.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Rob. Despite the ongoing inflationary headwinds affecting the concern in our business over the last three quarters, we're on track to deliver another strong year of growth and remain well placed to further build on the solid track record we have established against advancing our long-term strategic initiatives for nearly four years now. Our Beer business continues to lead in share gains, growth and margins and we're confident in our ability to capture the significant opportunities we still see for our core and our next wave brands. Our Wine & Spirits premiumization strategy continues to gain momentum as well advancing our higher-end brands, DTC channels and international footprint, all yielding noticeable results. Lastly, the performance of our businesses, coupled with our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities has allowed us to maintain our investment-grade rating, surpass our cash returns goal, grow our beer production capacity and execute small growth accretive M&A. With all that said, let me reiterate, looking ahead, we remain committed and believe we now have an even stronger foundation to deliver sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders. Thanks for everyone for joining the call, and I wish you a happy, safe and healthy New Year.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.

===== 2023 Q2  (2022-10-06 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. And welcome to the Constellation Brands Fiscal Year 2023 Q2 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It’s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Joseph Suarez, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Joseph Suarez: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning all. And welcome to Constellation Brands second quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. I am here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements made on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill in line with prior quarters, I’d like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now, here is Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Joe, and good morning all. Welcome to our second quarter call. I hope everyone had a good summer and enjoyed some of it with our great products. Before we get started today, I want to take this opportunity to say that our thoughts are with all those affected by Hurricane Ian. Thankfully, all Constellation employees living in Hurricane Ian’s path are safe and accounted for. We are also fortunate to avoid any adverse impact to our operations in the area to this point and we continue to stay in contact with our local distributors, retailers and other partners to best support their needs in this difficult time. Additionally, thousands of people in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia have been impacted by this natural disaster. So we are also supporting the American Red Cross with a significant contribution to help provide food, shelter and much needed assistance. We will also match employee contributions to the American Red Cross two-for-one as part of this effort and we hope it will provide at least some comfort to local residents as they work to recover and rebuild. I also want to remind everyone that we filed our proxy statement in connection with the Class B common stock reclassification a couple of weeks ago. We have called a special meeting of shareholders to vote on the reclassification next month on November 9th. At this point, we are unable to comment further or provide additional information on this topic during today’s call beyond what is available in the proxy statement and our other filings with the SEC. All of these filings are available through our Investor Relations website and I urge anyone interested in the special meeting or the reclassification to review these documents. Now, as usual, I would like to start by emphasizing a few key takeaways from our latest results. First, consumer demand for our products remained strong. Consumer led premiumization trends continue across beverage alcohol giving further confidence in the resilience of premiumization as a fundamental driver of demand for our brands. Buy-rate, which captures both the number of trips a consumer makes and the amount they spend per trip increased in the second quarter for both high end beer and total wine categories in tracked channels and buy rate for Hispanic high end beer consumers, which is particularly relevant to our core beer portfolio is also proving resilient. More specific to our brands, our beer business posted depletion growth of nearly 9% that is more than 9 million additional cases for the quarter. And in our Wine & Spirits business, our Wine portfolio gained share and outperformed the entire Wine category in tracked channels, while our craft spirits brands outperformed the higher end segment of the Spirits category. Second, our beer business also continues to outperform the entire category. In the second quarter, our beer business remained the leading share gainer in U.S. tracked channels across the entire beer category and now accounts for 28% of the high end segment. Importantly, we believe our beer business remains well placed to continue to support the steady growth of our brands with inventories across the supply chain at historical norms and production continuing for our operating plans to meet volume expectations for the fiscal year and incremental capacity unlocked from our existing brewery operations in Mexico through optimization and productivity initiatives and the expansion of our breweries at Nava and Obergon, as well as the construction process of our new brewery in Veracruz are all advancing as planned, all of which has given us the confidence to increase the fiscal 2023 net sales and operating income growth guidance for our beer business and continued conviction in our medium-term topline growth and margin algorithm. Third, the transformation of our Wine & Spirits business continues to yield results. Over the past few years, this business has been evolving from a U.S. wholesaler business focused mainly on the mainstream segment to a global omnichannel competitor primarily focused on the higher end. And in our latest quarter, our largest premium wine brands Kim Crawford, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Meiomi and Ruffino and our largest fine wine brand, The Prisoner Wine Company all delivered solid depletion growth. In our craft spirits portfolio, High West, Casa Noble and Mi CAMPO all achieved strong double-digit depletion growth. In addition, our International and DTC channels each delivered double-digit net sales growth year-over-year and we continue to gain share in three-tier ecommerce. Fourth, our capital allocation priorities remain firm, starting with our investment grade rating. We expect to remain investment grade including after funding the expected $1.5 billion cash payment for the Class B common stock reclassification, given the strong operating performance and cash generation of our business. Moving on to cash returns to shareholders, as of the end of the second quarter, we were over 97% toward meeting our $5 billion goal and we have now exceeded the share buybacks component of our goal by $300 million and upon payment of today’s declared dividend, which we expect to take place next month, we will have fully achieved our goal ahead of our fiscal year-end deadline. Shifting to our third priority of reinvesting to support the growth of our beer business, as noted earlier, our capacity expansions and construction processes continue according to plan. And lastly, our M&A focus remains on small acquisitions to fill portfolio gaps, particularly in our Wine & Spirits business. This included most recently the investment in a minority stake in Archer Roose as part of our focus on Female Founders initiative, which is an accessible premium wine brand focused on offering consciously crafted wines to a new generation of legal drinking age wine drinkers. We are proud to say that five years into our focus on Female Founders initiative, we have fulfilled 76% of our commitment to invest $100 million to Female Founded and Female led startups in the beverage alcohol sector as part of our efforts to enhance social equity within the industry. Now let’s move on to a more fulsome discussion of our performance in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our beer brands continue to resonate strongly with the consumer gaining 1.8 points across the entire category and 2.5 points in the high end segment in tracked channels. Modelo Especial delivered depletion growth of over 10% and was the number one share gainer in the entire U.S. beer category. It continues to strengthen its position as the number two beer brand in dollar sales and is the number one or two beer in 11 states, more than double the number of states from just three years ago. We continue to see further opportunities to maintain the growth momentum of Modelo Especial particularly given the resilience of premiumization trends and our relentless focus on striving to close the brand’s distribution and awareness gaps. Corona Extra maintained its momentum with 6% depletion growth and as the number three share gainer in tracked channels. It remains the number one most loved beer brand with both general market and Hispanic consumers and our La Vida Mas Fina campaign has maintained the number one spot and aid awareness across the beer category. We continue to expect modest growth from Corona Extra supported by distribution gains within certain pockets of the U.S., where it is underrepresented and the brands appeal and growth potential with younger legal drinking age and multicultural consumers. Pacifico achieved depletion growth of over 37% and was a top 10 share gaining brand in track channels. We continue to see a fantastic growth runway for Pacifico as an emerging brand, particularly as the brand has significant distribution potential when compared to Modelo and even more so when compared to Corona Extra. Lastly, our Modelo Chelada brands posted depletion growth of more than 60% for the second quarter and Modelo Chelada, Limón y Sal was a top 15 share gaining brand in track channels. Modelo Chelada remains the number one brand family in the Chelada space and owns nearly 60% market share of the Chelada segment nationwide. However, awareness for Modelo Chelada is still relatively low compared to other flavor categories and we continue to expect significant growth as we invest in marketing to broaden the demographic appeal and in additional flavors and package configurations to unlock new consumption occasions for this product. All in, the strong demand for our brands in the second quarter supported a net sales increase of 15% for our beer business and this in turn drove a 25% uplift in operating income, which also benefited from the lapping of higher obsolescence charges last year. This gives us confidence to increase guidance for our beer business, as we now expect to achieve 8% to 10% net sales growth and 3% to 5% operating income growth for fiscal 2023, which Garth will review in more detail shortly. That said, it is important to remember that in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023, we will be lapping elevated shipments from the second half of the last fiscal year that resulted from the rebuild of distributor and retailer inventories after supply shortages and severe weather-driven shipping disruptions that occurred in the first half of fiscal 2022. So while on an absolute basis, we continue to expect our shipments for the remainder of this fiscal year to be relatively in line with depletions, we believe the more comparable indicator for growth for our beer brands in the second half will be the depletion rate. Looking forward, we are also confident that over the medium-term, our beer business remains well positioned to deliver 7% to 9% net sales growth and 39% to 40% operating margin, supported by the sustained momentum of our core brands, the steady progress of our brewing capacity additions and the continued development of our innovation lineup, including the momentum of our Chelada brands, the recent launch of Fresca Mixed, the expansion of Modelo Oro from select test markets to the entire national market next year and the introduction of Corona non-alcoholic. The new non-alcoholic drinking age consumer is an attractive target as they also consume high end beer, as well as spirits and hard seltzers. So we are excited about the extension of Corona into this segment and we look forward to sharing more details as we approach the product launch. Moving on to Wine & Spirits. Our Wine & Spirits business is making headway with its vision to become a bold and innovative high end market leader. As noted earlier, the largest premium and fine wine brands and craft spirits brands of our portfolio delivered solid depletion growth rates in the second quarter and relative to the market, the higher end portion of our wine portfolio which includes our premium and fine wine brands outperformed the corresponding category segments in U.S. tracked channels. Our craft spirits portfolio delivered dollar sales grow significantly ahead of higher end segment of the Spirits category. Our Wine & Spirits business also continues to advance its mainstream strategy through a greater focus on brands and initiatives with higher returns, including through the delivery of relevant and innovative products. As we also announced this morning, we continue to further premiumize our business with a divestiture of a portion of our mainstream wine portfolio combined with a couple of select premium brands to the Wine group. When it closes, we believe this transaction will further enable us to focus our portfolio and efforts to deliver the industry-leading growth and margins that we continue to work toward. From an innovation perspective, we have several great examples of recently introduced products that are driving growth within our Wine portfolio. Woodbridge Box was the number two Premium Box share gainer in the second quarter, Meiomi Red Blend 750 was the number two wine SKU, Kim Crawford Sparkling Prosecco was the number four new wine brand and the recent launches of The Prisoner PINOT NOIR and Blindfold Blanc de Noir are respectively seeing early successes in priority accounts and the on-premise. Beyond product innovation, we continue to extend our growth in direct-to-consumer and three-tier e-commerce channels, as well as International markets. Wine & Spirits DTC net sales grew 15% in the second quarter, as our investments in these channels continue to yield strong performance. We also continue to outperform in three-tier e-commerce delivering dollar sales growth 16 points ahead of the competition in the second quarter. Importantly, we are also outperforming in three tier e-commerce with our beer business, which achieved a seven-point lead in dollar sales growth versus competition in the second quarter. Back to our Wine & Spirits business, International net sales grew 10% versus prior year showing the continued momentum of our brands in the select International markets that we are targeting, Going forward, we will continue to focus on growing our omnichannel and International footprint as we believe these channels will continue to grow as a portion of our mix over time and be an important opportunity for higher end growth. Now let’s move on to Canopy growth. While the impairment of our Canopy investment is clearly disappointing, it is not indicative of the significant long-term market opportunity that still exists for the legal cannabis market, particularly in the U.S., where the market was estimated at $25 billion at the end of 2021 and is expected to nearly double in size by 2026 as more states continue to legalize cannabis. In fact, the companies that Canopy invested in to establish its U.S. ecosystem continued to perform strongly and to scale. We also remain supportive of Canopy’s efforts to restructure its Canadian operations and its plan to further drive BioSteel’s growth, and believe these actions will also strengthen their business and ultimately provide an opportunity to enhance the value of our holding. Before I conclude, I also want to take this opportunity to highlight that we expect to release our 2022 ESG Impact report later this month. The report seeks to provide a comprehensive review of our ESG strategy and key initiatives designed to make a positive difference in our communities, safeguard our environment, and advocate for the responsible consumption of beverage alcohol. We will also for the first time be reporting with references aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Framework and taking into consideration the recommendations from the task force on climate related financial disclosures. We believe these planned enhancements to our reporting will be valuable steps intended to better align with stakeholder expectations on the information we provide on these important topics reflect our company values and better showcase our ongoing efforts to address pressing environmental and societal needs that are important to our communities, our consumers and our employees. I invite all of our stakeholders to spend some time reviewing the report when it is released, which will be available through our company website. In closing, I’d like to reiterate our main takeaways from this quarter. Number one, consumer demand for our higher end beer and higher end Wine & Spirits products continues to be strong and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of our portfolio and our runway for growth. Number two, our core imported brands continue to outperform the industry. Modelo Especial further strengthened its position as the number two beer in the U.S. market and continues to gain ground as the number one share gainer. And Corona Extra also maintained its momentum delivering solid growth rates and taking the number three share gainer spot in the beer catagory. The strong performance of our brands in the first half of fiscal year now puts us on track to deliver better than expected growth for our beer business in fiscal 2023. Number three, we continue to see the benefits of our Wine & Spirits strategy taking hold. Our largest higher end Wine & Spirits brands are delivering growth and we are also performing strongly internationally with our higher end brands and e-commerce and DTC channels. And number four, we continue to deliver on capital allocation priorities by maintaining our investment grade credit rating, delivering cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, advancing the brewery capacity expansion and construction processes in our beer business to support its continued strong growth and executing on disciplined tuck-in M&A to fill gaps in our portfolio. And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results in the quarter.
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, our business continue to perform well in the second quarter, delivering another strong set of operating results. We are making good progress against our operating plan and strategic initiatives, and we are now expected to exceed our previously stated fiscal 2023 net sales goals for the beer and Wine & Spirits businesses and our operating income goal for the beer business. Our strong Q2 results were led by 12% increase in net sales driven by growth in both our beer and Wine & Spirits businesses. Additionally, we achieved a 10% uplift in operating income underpinned by significant double-digit increase in the operating income of our beer business. Our strong cash flow results supported dividends and incremental share repurchases in Q2 that put us on track to exceed our $5 billion goal in cash returns to our shareholders by the end of this fiscal year. With that, let’s review Q2 performance and our full year outlook in more detail, where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 15% primarily driven by shipment volume growth of over 12% from strong demand for our core beer portfolio and higher average annual price increases. Q2 shipment volumes were generally aligned with depletion volumes and inventories across the supply chain remain at historical norms. From a growth perspective, depletions for the quarter were up nearly 9%, which was propelled by the continued strength of Modelo Especial, Corona Extra, Pacifico and the Modelo Chelada brands. Selling days in the quarter were flat year-over-year and will continue to be flat in Q3. Moving on to beer margins, we continue to experience headwinds driven by the inflationary economic environment, particularly in packaging material cost and shifts in mix. However, beer operating margin increased over 330 basis points to 40.5%, primarily driven by more -- up by favorable impact from pricing, lower obsolescence charges and lower marketing spend, as well as the favorable impact of fixed cost absorption and strong shipment volume growth. As you may recall, we reported higher obsolescence charges in Q2 of fiscal 2022 due to the slowdown in the overall hard seltzer category during the summer of last year. Marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 170 basis points due to the timing of our media spend. We continue to expect that marketing as a percent of net sales will be in the 9% to 10% range for the full year, as we anticipating -- as we anticipate marketing spend to ramp up in the second half of the year with the launch of new campaigns particularly from our media investments around college and NFL football. Given the strong performance of our beer business, we are now targeting full year fiscal 2023 net sales growth of 8% to 10%, and operating income growth of 3% to 5% for that business. Our updated fiscal 2023 outlook includes a 2% to 3% price increase, which is higher than the previously anticipated 1% to 2% expectation and medium-term algorithm range, as elevated cost continue to create pressure across the supply chain. However, we continue to expect an implied operating margin of approximately 38% for fiscal 2023. We anticipate second half operating income margins to be negatively affected as we expect the benefits from our pricing adjustments and cost saving actions will be more than offset by ongoing inflationary pressures across raw materials and packaging, particularly as more favorable hedges will continue to roll off, additional headcount and training, as well as increased depreciation from our brewery capacity expansions, and higher marketing spend as previously referenced. Now shifting to Wine & Spirits, Q2 fiscal 2023 net sales increased over 1% driven primarily by an increase in box sales and favorable pricing, and as Bill noted, Q2 depletion growth was solid for our largest premium wine brands Kim Crawford, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Meiomi and Ruffino, our largest fine wine brand The Prisoner Wine Company and our largest craft spirits brand High West, Casa Noble and Mi CAMPO. Operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 19.3%, primarily driven by the continued impact of inflationary headwinds and higher general administrative expenses. The increase in COGS was mainly a result of higher supply chain costs, particularly container surcharges and warehousing, and higher material costs, including grapes and glass, partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption as a result of the lapping of the New Zealand frost and the wildfires in the U.S. The increase in general and administrative expense was driven by compensation and benefits primarily to improve marketing effectiveness. Marketing was favorable due to the time -- timing of spend. For full year fiscal 2023, we now expect Wine & Spirits net sales to come in flat to down 2% and operating income to increase 3% to 5%. This implies operating margins of about 24% for fiscal 2023. Despite significant inflationary pressures and the inclusion of Cooper and Thief and the divestiture previously referenced by Bill, we continue to expect a considerable improvement in operating margins albeit at a lower point than previously anticipated. As noted in our Q1 earnings call, we expect to achieve the uplift in operating margins in the second half through the following key drivers; consumer led premiumization and mix improvement mainly in our fine wine brands; incremental pricing actions executed in Q2 that will be fully reflected in the second half; a bountiful New Zealand harvest, which will drive volume and enhance margins for Kim Crawford; lowering marketing as a percent of net sales; and finally, continued benefits from our cost savings initiatives. Now let’s proceed with the rest of the P&L. As we also discussed in our Q1 earnings call, increased investment in our digital business acceleration initiative was the primary driver of our higher corporate expense. The majority of the spend in our Digital Business Acceleration Program or DBA for short was incurred in Q2 and we expect to start to see some small benefits from these investments later this fiscal year, followed by larger benefits in FY 2024. As a reminder, the goal of our DBA initiative is to support our aim to become a digital leader and capture value. It is a combination of data, technology and operating models, including evolving ways of working organizational structures and acquiring talent. DBA builds on the implementation of our SAP platform, it was completed last year and we anticipate it will enable us to deliver cost savings and greater efficiency in a number of areas by taking our digital strategy to the next level. The first phase of our DBA program is focused on three key areas, supply chain, marketing and procurement each with their own objectives. The aim of these initial efforts is to maximize efficiency across end-to-end supply chain, to build a world-class procurement function with greater spend visibility and to unlock demand for our products by analyzing and connecting multiple consumer data sources. We continue to expect $35 million to $40 million of spend in our DBA program for fiscal 2023 as part of our total $265 million to $270 million of corporate spend anticipated for the full year. Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter was relatively unchanged. However, we now expect interest expense for fiscal 2023 to be between $360 million and $370 million as a result of the July equitization of the Canopy debt securities and rising interest rates. This excludes the impact of any interest expense associated with the funding of the $1.5 billion cash consideration payable in the event the Class B common stock reclassification closes. From a balance sheet perspective, should the reclassification be approved on a Q2 FY 2023 pro forma basis, our net leverage would increase to approximately 3.5 times when considering funding for the premium payment and excluding Canopy equity earnings. We ended the second quarter with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3 times excluding Canopy equity earnings. As Bill noted, we have nearly completed our goal of returning $5 billion to cash to shareholders. We will continue towards our goal through planned dividend payouts and opportunistic share buybacks throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. This remains a top capital allocation priority and we now expect to exceed our cash returns to shareholders goal by the end of this fiscal year. That said, we continue to expect our weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $186.5 million for fiscal 2023 including shares repurchased in Q2. As a result of the adjustments to our beer business growth outlook for fiscal 2023 and the partial offset from higher interest expense, we now expect EPS comparable guidance to be in the $11.20 to $11.60 range, which represents a $0.10 increase the top end of our prior guidance range. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion for the first half of fiscal 2023, which is a 4% increase versus prior year, reflecting strong operating cash flow, partially offset by 23% increase in CapEx investments, as we continue to make good progress on our brewery capacity expansion plans to support the robust growth of our beer business. In addition, our brewery optimization and productivity initiatives have enabled us to utilize incremental capacity from our existing footprint. We now estimate our current total capacity to be approximately 41 million hectoliters, giving us additional production flexibility and enhancing the returns of our prior capital investments. We continue to expect fiscal 2023 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion and unchanged CapEx of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Lastly on Canopy growth, we recorded a $1.1 billion impairment on our investment, which was excluded from our comparable basis results. This non-cash item was driven by the following factors, the period of time for which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and the uncertainty surrounding Canopy stock price recovery in the near-term, Canopy’s previously announced goodwill impairment for their cannabis operations and the uncertainty of U.S. federal cannabis legalization. In addition, we also recorded a $651 million equity loss from our share of ownership in Canopy, which includes $461 million of Canopy’s goodwill impairment. While disappointing, we continue to believe that Canopy’s focus on premiumizing its cannabis branded portfolio to improve their performance in Canada is appropriate and we also remain supportive of Canopy’s efforts in the U.S. to strengthen their emerging CPG brand distribution and build of a competitive THC ecosystem. In closing, we continue to deliver strong business performance and are proud of the continued progress we are making against our operating plans and strategic initiatives. Our beer business continues to outshine the market and our Wine & Spirits business is showing the benefits of its strategy to become a global omnichannel competitor in line with consumer preferences, primarily focused on the higher end. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. So on the beer…
Bill Newlands: Good morning, Dara.
Dara Mohsenian: …business, there has been a pretty nice halo the last few quarters between scanner data and the reported depletions just as on-premise recovers post-COVID. It wasn’t as much the case this quarter. So can you just give us some detail on on-premise and untracked channels in general in Q2 and what you are seeing there? And then on the beer margin side, obviously a big beat in the quarter versus consensus, that’s great news, but the implied H2 margins of 36% are well below what you saw in the first half, obviously there is some seasonality there? But just help us understand as we think about margins for fiscal 2024. Should we think about it more relative to a 38% full year basis and more relative to 36% the back half, again there’s some seasonality there, but just conceptually how you think about that would be helpful?
Bill Newlands: So why don’t -- Garth why don’t I take the first part. So relative to the on-premise, it’s very typical of us to see a stronger Q1 on-premise, because it includes Cinco, which is the single biggest event and occasion for our beer business in the on-premise. On-premise was roughly 11% of our volume in this particular quarter, which was slightly less than it was in the prior quarter. The other thing, I think, it’s always important to look at is, our depletion volume, it has been very consistent with what we look at in IRI trends. And as an example, in our beer business in the most recent IRI trends, the 26-week data showed in totality 7.5% growth and purely the import business showed 9.4% growth. That’s very consistent with our roughly 9% depletion growth in this particular quarter. The other place we will also see strength within our business is in some of the untracked channels in smaller Hispanic, particularly Hispanic accounts, particularly our West, which are not tracked by IRI or Nielsen channels. So, all in, I think, again our depletion growth profile looks exactly like what the take out trends in tracked channels are. And I think, as we have said many, many times, this year in particular that is really the way to look at our business due to the variance that we saw last year in weather-related activities in our and when we shipped and when we did maintenance and things of that nature, which I am sure Garth will touch on here in a moment.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah. Dara, on the margin piece. So, one, I would say that, you would expect that this year’s margin profile on a first half versus second half would reflect something if it’s more normal, which we really haven’t had the last couple of years due to sort of production issues that we had to contend with, which led to sort of a rebalancing of our shipments. Again, this will be more, because we are in a more typical production environment, you will see a more sort of normal first half versus second half margin profile. We are expecting margins in the second half to be negatively impacted as I said in my remarks as the benefits from pricing and some of the cost saving actions will be more than offset again by ongoing inflationary pressures. From a material’s perspective, we continue to see some pressure from corn, as well as cans and cartons and glass. As you know, we have a relatively robust hedging policy. But the way that we layer in those hedges and then the way that those hedges then roll off, we saw the greatest impact from those in the first half of the year. So while we are nicely hedged, they just won’t be at the favorable rates if you will, as we were in the first half. And then again as is typical -- and then it’s typical as we are laying out incremental capacity, we will be impacted by incremental costs as we bring on people to train in advance of the capacity coming online. And then, finally, we are expecting to see a significant increase in marketing in the second half versus the first half as we support new marketing campaigns around college and NFL football. For FY 2024, our guidance is continues to be clear on that. We continues to view the right way to think about our margins is in that 39% to 40% range and we are not coming off of that.
Dara Mohsenian: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your line is now live.
Kevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Bill, I wanted to pivot to the wine sale this morning, given the continued premiumization focus but you are holding onto Woodbridge, a more value-oriented brand, I think, the view there in the past has been that that brand offers scale. Just a little bit on how the deal came about, whether you can comment, whether you are done and generally pleased with the shape of the portfolio at the conclusion of this transaction? And I think, just kind of taking a step back, just given the change here, and I think, it’s sort of been in some state of transition for a period of time, it sort of begs the broader question, whether the wine portfolio albeit a narrowed down one and more focused on premium -- the premium end of the category, whether you think it still makes sense within the broader portfolio relative to a beer business, much higher growth margins and return on capital. So I’d love to get your thoughts there. Thanks so much.
Bill Newlands: Sure. Look, we are very pleased with the progress that we are seeing in the Wine business and the divestiture that you saw this morning again it helps to reshape the portfolio. What I -- the way I think you should think about our total business is we are increasingly focused our attention on the higher end. We have noted that for many, many years as it relates to beer. We have now specifically related that on our Wine & Spirits business as well. As you probably noted, most of the tuck-in work that we have done in our Wine & Spirits business has been focused on craft spirits, as well as higher end wine brands that fill portfolio gaps, all of which focus on the high end, where we believe the growth and margin profile are significantly improved. So I would think about this today as just a further step in the reshaping of our business. As we have said, we are very focused on seeing a growth profile and an improved margin profile on that business, and we believe we are well on our way to delivering that and today is just again one more step in the process of achieving that goal.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is now live.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks so much. Good morning. I was just curious on the second half outlook because some of the things - just in terms of the cost structure because some of the things you have called out in terms of rolling hedges and so on. I would have thought, you might have had some visibility into previously. So I was just more curious on the, what’s changed on the second half cost outlook rather than just why second half is different than first half? And then the second thing was, you made a pretty clear statement on the medium-term algorithm still looking for 39% to 40% margins on beer. So outside of the timing shifts that are impacting the second half margins, I was just curious if you can maybe look forward fiscal 2024 and beyond, like, do we get back to 39% to 40% in 2024 or is it a longer rebuild because of where you think that -- those relative hedge positions kind of roll through when we look into 2024?
Garth Hankinson: Yeah. So, Lauren, on the first half of that around what changed from Q or from the first half of the year to the second half of the year, and I would say that, really nothing changed in our mind. We give guidance on an annual basis, not on a quarterly basis, and we are going to deliver margins in line with where we said at the beginning of the year. Do you want to answer the second half, Bill?
Bill Newlands: Yeah. Sure. I think the way that -- I think we will obviously give specific guidance on fiscal 2024 when we get to that timeframe. But I think, what we are seeing is, we continue to see a long runway for growth in our beer business and we think that’s in the 7% to 9% range consistently. We think, we are going to see consistent delivery of 39% to 40% on the margin play. As Garth and I have always said, over the last several years, you have opportunities to be ahead or behind that in any one particular year. This year we are a little behind that algorithm because of a number of factors that we have touched on before. But we still believe that is a solid expectation for the medium-term and we will give specific guidance around 2024 when we get there. But we believe that’s a consistent approach that we are going to be able to deliver on with consistency for the next several years.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I…
Bill Newlands: Hey, Bonnie.
Garth Hankinson: Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: I was hoping for a little more color on your beer shipments versus depletions. I guess, first, it would be helpful to hear, how your quarter-to-date depletions have been tracking. And then second, you mentioned depletion should outpace shipments in the second half, but just really trying to think through how we should think about your shipment in the context of your new topline guidance, it does imply really any shipment growth in the second half. So, I guess, what I am really trying to understand is given you are lapping some of the brewery maintenance you had last year in Q3 and then you have the rollout of some really strong innovation such as Modelo Oro that will need to be shipped in Q4. So I am just kind of thinking through your new topline guidance and it feels pretty conservative. So I just want to make sure I understand that? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure. Well to answer your -- first part of your question, Bonnie. The start of the quarter, September was very solid and it’s consistently in line with what we expect our annual numbers to be. So we certainly think we are off to a good start in the -- in Q3. Garth said this at the beginning of the year that it was going to be a very lumpy year. The important part that I think everyone should think about is, our depletion, the actual volume of our depletions and our shipments year-to-date are almost on top of one another. However, because you are comparing to last year and because we had shipping disruptions last year, it looks very different on a percentage basis. One an actual volumetric basis, they are very similar and you are going to see the same thing for the rest of the year. But this is why we have consistently said, the best thing to do to look at the success of our business is the depletion rate and our depletion rate year-to-date on our beer business is in just under 9%, and obviously, that’s why we increased our guidance, because we have further confidence that we are going to outpace the growth profile that we set out at the beginning of the fiscal year. So that’s the way, we have consistently urged that people think about it around the depletion rate, because it’s just going to be lumpy this year on the shipment side, doesn’t take away one iota for the outperforming success that our beer business continues to have in the marketplace.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. So I just want to go back to this question, because it does imply though that, of course, you shipped more than you had in depletions in the 9%. So what you are seeing now, we should be seeing shipment volume negative in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, which is that’s what’s implying because we see it at flat revenues. If I understood it correctly, minus 2 to plus 2 giving your guidance and you have pricing. So you are just telling us to assume volumes will decline in the second half. I just want to clarify that. And then another question related to that, given the pressures that you had in commodities rolling over and all the hedges, isn’t it make sense to take another pricing usually in the fall to kind of like offset those pressures? Thank you.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah. Andrea, thanks for the question. So, first of all, just to reiterate with what you said, our shipments and our depletions for the first half of the year have been in line with one another, so we have not over shipped beyond the depletions. The issue between the first half and the second half is strictly due to the timing of shipments related to some production outages or we had to deal with last year. So that’s the differential. As it relates to your point on pricing, as we said in our scripts, we are taking more pricing this year, we update for this year from our normal 1% to 2% algorithm to 2% to 3%.
Bill Newlands: The other thing, I think, it’s important to consider is, we have seen significant mixed benefits in our business as well. There’s been a -- because in part from the growth of Cheladas, which are almost entirely single serve or we have added some innovation in different size and pack configurations, but the single-serve pieces of our business, have been very strong. It’s a great example of that’s mix accretive. So in addition to purely the fact that we are going to be taking a bit more price than we had originally anticipated, we also are seeing mixed benefits within the portfolio as well, which will be advantageous.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. Your line is now live.
Rob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. So wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about what’s going on with Modelo and Corona. Corona being somewhat stronger than we would have expected, Modelo still very strong, but slightly slower than it has been in prior years. Is there anything going on there in terms of the interaction between those two brands or the brand families that we should be aware of?
Bill Newlands: No, Robert. I don’t think so. I mean, again, when we look at the kind of growth profile that Modelo Especial using that as the example. In any of the volumetric trend timing, we are growing in double digits all the way along and that becomes, obviously, that the bigger it gets the more double digits is a very enjoyable proposition. We are very excited admittedly about Corona Extra. Corona Extra has grown a bit ahead of what we had expected. But I think that speaks to the just the long-term belief amongst both Hispanic and non-Hispanic consumers in that brand. It’s the most loved brand. We continue to benefit from that. And we continue to advertise against that business very heavily. So I wouldn’t read a lot into the fact that Modelo was continues to grow double-digit, but it’s slightly less than the last double-digit. I would view it as we have a comprehensive brand portfolio whether you talk about Modelo Especial, Corona Extra, the Chelada business, Pacifico, that just continues to radically outperform and that in combination allowed us to raise our expectations for the beer business for the year.
Rob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you.
Bill Newlands: You are welcome.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is now live.
Bryan Spillane: Thanks, Operator. Good morning, guys.
Bill Newlands: Good morning.
Bryan Spillane: I just wanted to ask a question about, I guess, beer inventories and given that you have had more supply this year and it seems like you’re in-stock levels are better in assortment. Has it just being more in-stock with your -- with a full array of assortment is that, how much of a benefit has that been to depletions?
Bill Newlands: Well, obviously, any time you have all the packages and you have all the availability that you expect, it certainly is beneficial. What I must say is our team has did an outstanding job of making sure throughout the challenging time, when we had some product outages to make sure that we had availability of the brand. Brand size switching, meaning package size switching within the beer business is very strong, because most consumers come into the store planning to buy a Corona or a Modelo, and therefore, will adjust their package size selection based on what’s available. We have seen that through in-depth consumer research. So, yes, it certainly helps some because it provides the wide array of selection that we own to consumers. But it doesn’t change the algorithm radically, because as you have seen, we continue to show high single-digit volumetric and double-digit topline growth within the business, almost throughout the entire thing. The other thing that I would say though, where you do see some real change by availability is Pacifico. We have said a couple of quarters ago, we had some challenges around brown glass, which significantly impacted Pacifico, but didn’t really change, in fact some of you on the call asked questions about that, are we concerned the Pacifico’s growth profile is what it once was and it comes roaring back with 37% and the IRI data shows over 50% take out increases. So I think it shows and confirms what we had said to you on prior quarters is that Pacifico is a tremendous potential brand for us going forward and it is a great example to your question of in instances where you -- we have had some challenges on inventory, what can really happen in the strength of our inherent brands.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Kaumil, perhaps, your phone is on mute?
Bill Newlands: Talk to us, Kaumil.
Kaumil Gajrawala: I am sorry about that, guys.
Bill Newlands: There you are.
Garth Hankinson: Carry on.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Can we talk a little bit about the price increases, you are looking for a little more pricing perhaps than you had expected for, are they in place, what’s the magnitude? And then on price gaps, you gave pretty compelling reasons in previous quarters on why you are going up perhaps less than the market, given kind of our outlook for inflation, most of which has come through. So can you maybe talk about kind of this new outlook and what has changed?
Bill Newlands: I think there’s two or three things that fall into that equation. You are correct, we have raised our expectation from 1 to 2, 2 to 3. I think there’s several things that are in play there. We have been very excited by the buy rates that we have seen across our business one. We obviously are doing our best to cover as best we can some of the inflationary pressures that Garth noted in his remarks. But we really haven’t changed how we do pricing. We do our pricing, SKU-by-SKU, market-by-market, all the way across the Board. But it will probably come into that 2 to 3 range, which again is up from what we expected. I think, an important part and I touched on a couple of questions ago is, we are also seeing mixed benefits, which does flow through in terms of how it presents itself when you have things like single serves doing better, which is a better mix item for us, you see Chelada which are all almost all single serve being a better mix item for us. So you have got a combination of, yes, we are going to take a bit more pricing. Yes, you are seeing better mix in the overall equation and yet we are still doing it the way we are doing it, which is SKU-by-SKU, market-by-market. And I believe it’s remains judicious, we always keep the consumer in mind as we think about what we are doing relative to pricing and that certainly isn’t going to change.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vivien Azer from Cowen and Company. Your line is now live.
Vivien Azer: Hi. Good morning. I want to touch on…
Bill Newlands: Hi, Vivien.
Vivien Azer: …cannabis, Bill. Hi. I wanted to touch on your comment on safe banking. I mean, I fully agree rate like so hard to know, but in the base case assumption is that Republicans flip the house. It seems like there’s maybe better than a 50% chance that they could pass. Historically cannabis indicated that the Constellation Board sensitivity in your lender sensitivity is the key determinant in terms of their ability to close their purchase obligation on acreage that would certainly be meaningfully accretive to their bottomline and in turn, how you guys are reporting that business. So could you just offer any updated insights on how the Board and your lenders are thinking about safe in the current kind of health version very narrow? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure. We feel miserably of predicting how that was all going to play out. So I would take my answer with a slight grain of salt admittedly. But we are cautiously optimistic that that there will be progress. What I am particularly happy about relative to Canopy, as I think they are positioned to be a winner in the U.S. There want jetty and acreage layouts which are all ready to go. I think are an important part of being a winner. We still believe that in the longer run brands are going to matter and I think they are positioning themselves to have the right brands that will matter over the long run here in the U.S. But look, we are optimistic, I think, everybody’s optimistic that we are going to start to see the legislation loosen up, although again being able to predict that, I would have feel miserably on that score, but we are hopeful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nadine Sarwat from Bernstein. Your line is now live.
Nadine Sarwat: Hi, guys. I’d like to kick off with the two long-term questions here. So sticking on the Canopy’s points in the past you have alluded to U.S. federal legalization has been one of the key factors behind your continued confidence in the Canopy investment, but it’s now one of the stated reasons for the meaningful impairment you took today. So how long are you willing to wait to see U.S. legalization happen and do you see the size of your stake changing in Canopy anytime soon? And then, similarly, a bigger picture question, you are super premium beer brands continue to perform strongly in the last quarter, but the consumer is seeing increasing pressure on their wallets from macro pressures. So are you seeing anything if any changes in consumer behavior quarter-to-date from that macro pressure? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure. Well, I will take -- let me take the wallet question, then we can decide who takes the other. No, unfortunately, we have. One of the things that we recognize is beer fortunately is a staple for many of our -- much of our consumer base. So we have seen some variation in terms of the pack sizes that have been taken out. But as I alluded earlier and we view this is a critical component. The buy rates that we have seen have been increasing and that’s one of the first things you look at is the number of times as people go to the store and when they take out when they are in the store. So, we are cautiously optimistic that this is going to continue to go well for us. I think it speaks to the strength of the brands and I think it speaks to the strength of the brand confidence that consumers have with us. Relative to cannabis, I wouldn’t expect you to see the size of our investment in that change.
Garth Hankinson: And as to outlook, I would just say that, in terms of the first part of your question around legalization. First of all, that was one part of a multi-part analysis to determine whether or not we need to take a -- to take the impairment that we announced today. Beyond that we continue, as Bill has said we continue to be pleased with how the cannabis category has unfolded. In the U.S. as Bill noted in his remarks, it’s now a $25 billion retail sales opportunity in those states where it’s legal. So it is starting to convert consumers, consumers are adopting to the category and we are happy with the position that Canopy has in the U.S. and with the improvements that they are making in Canada.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities. Your line is now live.
Bill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. Just couple questions on mix, I mean, Modelo Oro, I can’t remember, is that the shipments as you expand nationwide going to have an impact or a meaningful impact on the back half of the year kind of shipments or is that more into next year or is it did not meaningful. And then second and I know that I should probably understand this, but why isn’t just coming out, it’s Modelo Light. I mean it seems like with some of the confusion of Corona Premier that the consumer doesn’t always understand that it’s a light beer or it’s a low-calorie beer. So any clarification would be helpful. Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Yeah. You bet. Oro is going to be taken nationwide next fiscal year. So it will have no impact per se in the back half of this current fiscal year. It’s in three test markets now, and obviously, it will continue, but it will be taken nationwide next year. Look, we did a lot of study as to what we thought was the best answer. We -- if you actually look at the can that we are really talking about the gold standard of light beer. So I think the consumer will understand what they are going to get. Our understanding from the research is that they do understand what it is. And certainly, we were very pleased with the results of the test market and are anxiously looking forward to seeing how it does on a national basis next year. It was highly incremental and we are very excited about that as well. So we are very optimistic about what Oro can do when it -- when Modelo has a quote light version unquote.
Operator: Thank you. We have reached end of our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Newlands for any further closing comments.
Bill Newlands: Thank you again and appreciate all of you joining our call today. Hopefully, as you could hear, we delivered another quarter of strong growth performance. Consumer demand for our higher end beer, Wine & Spirits brands remain robust, giving us further confidence in their runway for future growth. Our Core beer brands Modelo Especial and Corona Extra continue to out shine the market and our next wave brands like Pacifico and Modelo Chelada are achieving very strong double-digit growth. We continue to see opportunity ahead for our beer portfolio supported by continued consumer led premiumization and our ongoing investments in brewery capacity expansions. The benefits of our Wine & Spirits strategy are also taking hold, as our higher end brands continue to resonate with consumers and our global and omnichannel efforts are yielding benefits. Our largest premium wine, fine wine and craft spirits brands all delivered positive depletion growth and we achieved double-digit net sales growth in both DTC channels and International markets. And we continue to demonstrate again that we are committed to capital allocation priorities to maintain our strong financial foundation, balanced returns and reinvestment and deploy excess cash with discipline. In closing, as our next earnings call is not for January, I’d like to wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season. And as always, we hope your celebrations will include enjoying some of our great products with your family and friends. Thanks again, everybody. I appreciate you are joining the call.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2023 Q1  (2022-06-30 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Constellation Brands First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for opening remarks. Please go ahead, Patty.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Constellation's Q1 Fiscal '23 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started today, I wanted to take a minute to recognize Patty, who, after 15 years with Constellation, has elected to retire next month. We appreciate Patty's commitment in helping shepherd our Investor Relations function since joining the company in 2007. And on behalf of all of our team here at Constellation, we thank Patty for her many contributions to our success over the years, including managing our relationships with a number of folks on this call. We wish her the very best in retirement. Effective July 1, leadership of our IR function will transition to Joe Suarez, who joined Constellation last November as Vice President of Investor Relations. Joe previously served as Managing Director at Teneo, a global CEO advisory firm. Prior to his time there, Joe also served in a range of commercial, governance, finance and investor relations roles for a couple of major players in the global resources sector. We look forward to the continued success of our Investor Relations function under Joe's leadership. With that, let's move on to a discussion of our first quarter results. We're off to a strong start in our new fiscal year, thanks to the solid fundamentals of our business, the disciplined execution of our strategy and the relentless commitment of our Constellation Brands team as well as that of our distributors and retail partners. Our performance in Q1 fiscal '23 continued to build momentum in 3 key areas tied to our long-term goals. First, our beer business once again delivered industry-leading share gains with Modelo Especial and Corona Extra taking the #1 and #4 spots among share-gaining brands across track channels. The business achieved an important milestone, having reached more than 5 full points in shares gained over the last 5 years. Coming back to Q1. Our beer business delivered net sales growth of 21% and added nearly 15 million cases in incremental shipment volume. As anticipated, these significant increases were partly driven by the lapping of supply challenges as a result of severe weather impacts in Q1 fiscal '22. For clarity, ships and depletes in our current quarter were roughly equal on an absolute basis. Importantly, our shipments mainly were underpinned by continued strong demand for our authentic Mexican beers, our consistent and balanced approach to pricing and the effective ramp-up of new brewing capacity from our organic growth investments. Second, our Wine & Spirits business outperformed the U.S. Wine & Spirits category in tracked channels, where we gained share supported by strong performance of our higher-end brands. Our Wine & Spirits business grew net sales by 2% and saw overall U.S. depletions increased by over 1% with the premium wine and fine wine and craft spirits portions of our portfolio achieving 8% and 16% depletion growth, respectively, with brands like Meiomi, the Prisoner, High West and Casa Noble delivering double-digit depletion growth rates; and third, our sustained and strong operating performance and cash flow generation enabled us to continue to deliver against our established capital allocation priorities. Our balance sheet remains strong. We continue to invest behind the momentum of our beer business with a focus on growth and flexibility, and we exceeded our planned $500 million accelerated share repurchase activity with an additional $800 million in buybacks. In fact, we have now fulfilled the share buyback portion of the $5 billion goal in cash returns to shareholders that we promised. Now let's discuss in more detail our beer business performance. We maintained our #1 position as the #1 supplier in high-end beer in the U.S. and achieved depletion growth of almost 9% in the quarter, consistent with our expectations and our growth profile target. As for Memorial Day, which celebrations took place within the quarter, we were the #1 share gainer for that holiday, capturing 1.5 share points of total beer and 2.3 points of high-end beer in the U.S. tracked channels. In the on-premise, our beer business achieved a 30% depletion growth rate across the portfolio and delivered double-digit growth for the Corona and Modelo brand families as well as Pacifico. As mentioned, Modelo Especial remains the number one share gainer in tracked channels, adding over 1.2 points in incremental share, nearly double the incremental share of the second largest gainer. Overall, Modelo Especial delivered the total depletion growth above 15% for the quarter. Our Modelo Chelada brand family grew in line with our medium-term double-digit CAGR expectations, achieving over 39% depletion growth in the quarter. The national release of our new Limón y Sal 12-ounce, 12-pack helped this popular flavor of our Chelada brand delivered the 15th largest share gain across the entire U.S. beer category in tracked channels. And although it is still very early days for our other Modelo innovations, we are encouraged by the initial data we're seeing in test markets, particularly for [Oro] (ph). We continue to be encouraged by the sustained healthy growth of Corona Extra. This brand delivered over 4% depletion growth for the quarter, and as mentioned earlier, was the #4 share gainer in the U.S. beer market in tracked channels. We continue to expect modest growth for Corona Extra in fiscal '23. And Pacifico delivered depletion growth of more than 20% for the quarter. We continue to expect Pacifico to grow in line with our medium-term 10% to 15% total annual volume growth forecast in fiscal '23. All in, our beer business delivered strong net sales growth for the quarter and this, in turn, supported a double-digit increase in operating income. Looking ahead, we're confident that our beer business remains well positioned to deliver against our net sales and operating income growth targets for fiscal '23 despite the ongoing inflationary pressures affecting consumers. We'll continue to take appropriate pricing and cost management actions to ensure we maintain both the growth algorithm of our brands and our industry-leading margins. We'll also continue to support our consumer-led innovation and brand building efforts throughout the remainder of the year. which will include the launch of our Fresca Mixed vodka spirits and tequila Paloma flavors in early September. And we continue to make progress with our brewing capacity additions including our new brewery to be built in the state of Veracruz. During the quarter, we were pleased to have formally announced the location of our new brewery with the President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, as well as with both the Governor of the State of Veracruz and the Mayor of the city of Veracruz along with federal, state and municipal authorities. The new brewery will be located in the port of Veracruz, one of the most prominent seaports in the region and will have ample access to water and necessary resources and a highly capable workforce as President Lopez Obrador himself has stated. We look forward to continuing the remarkable journey of our strong performance of our beer business with a focus on both growth and flexibility as we deploy the investments needed to meet steadily rising demand for our products. Now let's move on to Wine & Spirits. Our strategy to increasingly focus on higher-end brands, aligned with ongoing consumer-led premiumization trends, continues to enhance the commercial performance of our Wine & Spirits business. The premium wine, fine wine and craft spirits portions of our portfolio all significantly outperformed their corresponding categories in tracked channels. Meiomi, the Prisoner and Kim Crawford remain the driving forces behind our premium and fine wine growth with continued share gains in tracked channels and strong increases in depletions. And in craft spirits, our High West and Casa Noble brands delivered dollar sales growth ahead of the competition. We maintained share in mainstream wine with Woodbridge primarily driving that performance. Our innovation efforts also continued to produce excellent results with Meiomi Red Blend becoming the second largest new product growth contributor in the wine category in just over a quarter since its launch. And we are seeing incremental growth from the expansion of our Wine & Spirits brands into international markets with particularly significant gains of more than 60% in international shipment volumes for our fine wine and craft spirits products. As with our Beer business, we continue to closely monitor the state of consumer and remain disciplined in our approach to ensure we balance both pricing and growth across our Wine & Spirits portfolio as economic conditions further evolve. That said, while consumers are reporting increasing concerns about the economy, these concerns have not yet translated into significant behavior change for beverage alcohol shoppers, particularly for our major brands. In total, beverage alcohol servings per capita in the U.S. have remained and are expected to remain stable with growth of 1% to 2% based on population growth expectations. Against that backdrop, we are encouraged by the continued strength of our high-end beer and Wine & Spirits brands in the first quarter of this fiscal year and remain confident in our ability to drive additional growth for both businesses over the medium term. To that end, we are accelerating our investments in digital capabilities to further support future growth. These investments will be focused on securing the talent and enhancing the technologies needed to further optimize our marketing efforts and reinforce our leading position in 3-tier e-commerce and DT sales as well as unlock value from enhancements to our procurement, supply chain management, plant operations and back office activities. Online beverage alcohol sales remain over 4 point times the pre-COVID rates and we are seeing great traction with our DTC and 3-tier e-commerce efforts, having outperformed the competition by 3.5 points in these channels over the first quarter. We are now planning additional investments as part of these efforts this fiscal year and expect the total impact of this digital business acceleration program to ultimately result in incremental earnings to be realized over the coming years driven by more effective marketing as well as more efficient supply chain, procurement, data and analytics and operations platforms. Garth will provide additional details in just a few minutes. Beyond the growth, we continue to expect from our businesses which will be further supported by our digital business acceleration program. We also continue to believe that our ownership position in Canopy represents a compelling opportunity in developing -- in a developing industry with significant long-term growth potential. Within that context, we think Canopy's focused on premiumizing its cannabis-branded portfolio to improve performance in Canada is appropriate. And we are also supportive of its efforts in the U.S. to strengthen the distribution of its emerging CPG brands and build a competitive THC ecosystem as Canopy continues to gain traction. Canopy's agreements with Acreage, TerrAscend, Wana and Jetty, position it to quickly scale operations across the U.S. upon federal legalization. We continue to support Canopy through our strategic relationship sharing our experience and capabilities to support the continued advancement of their U.S. strategy, specifically in the areas of commercial sales, marketing and operations. And as announced yesterday, part of our holding in Canopy's convertible debt will be transitioned into equity, which will reduce Canopy's debt while maintaining our share of equity ownership without putting additional capital at risk. On a separate note, earlier today, we also announced that our Board of Directors has approved a proposal to eliminate our Class B common stock. After an extensive review and analysis by the special committee and with the special committee's recommendation, our Board agreed that it is in the best interest of the company and all Constellation shareholders to eliminate the Class B common stock. Under the proposal, owners of our Class B common stock, which are primarily the Sands family, would convert those shares into Class A common stock and receive $64.64 per share in cash, which equates to a total amount of $1.5 billion. The transaction requires shareholder approval, including approval of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock not held by the Sands family or their affiliates, executive officers of the company or Directors that also hold Class B common stock. Once shareholder approval is received, we expect that the proposal would deliver a number of corporate governance and other benefits, including the elimination of the higher vote Class B common stock, including the associated voting control of the Sands family and a reduction in the concentration of voting power; a simplification of the company's equity capital structure to better align the voting rights and interests of all shareholders; a broader appeal of our shares to a larger base of investors who prefer single voting class common stock structures; operating cost savings associated with executive salary and certain benefits as well as administrative savings from maintaining the Class B common stock. We expect the executive salary and benefits cost savings will be about $15 million to $20 million per year using the $17.5 million midpoint of that cost savings range and our current trading multiple of approximately 21x PE. That equates to roughly $300 million of value on a tax-effective basis. Other corporate governance benefits include a rotation of the lead independent Director position on the Board at the next available normal cycle opportunity. And finally, a shift to majority voting in uncontested elections from the current plurality standard for our Board of Directors and the adoption of a Board anti-pledging policy. We will be seeking the approval of shareholders at a special meeting, and a proxy statement, including all details of the proposal will be available ahead of that special meeting. In the meantime, the announcement we made this morning related to the proposal can be found on our company website, cbrands.com. And at this point, we will be unable to comment further or provide additional information on the proposal during today's call beyond what is available in that announcement. In closing, I once again want to recap the 3 highlights I shared earlier on our performance in the first quarter of fiscal '23. First, our beer business continued to achieve industry-leading share gains, driven by our high-performing Modelo Especial, Modelo Chelada, Corona Extra and Pacifico brands delivering overall strong financial results with double-digit growth for both net sales and operating income. Second, our Wine & Spirits business outperformed the U.S. Wine & Spirits category and tracked channels, particularly through the strong performance of our higher-end brands and also grew net sales in the quarter. And third, we continued to deliver against our established capital allocation priorities, including through the $1.3 billion return to shareholders and share repurchases through June and dividends for the first quarter of this year. We are now at over 90% of our $5 billion promised goal. We were very encouraged by the continued strength of our business in the first quarter of this fiscal year and remain confident in our ability to drive sustained growth over the medium term. And with that, I'd now like to turn it over to Garth, who will give you more detail of our financial results in the quarter. Garth?
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal '23 is off to a great start. We're executing against our business strategy, and we're on track to achieve our targeted financial performance goals for the year. Our beer business achieved double-digit net sales and operating income growth, and our Wine & Spirits business is progressing as marketplace momentum accelerates for the portfolio. In addition, our strong cash flow results enabled us to accelerate and complete our share buyback as we repurchased 5.3 million shares for $1.3 billion through the first 4 months of our fiscal year. As a reminder, one of our key capital allocation priorities has been to return $5 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases by the end of fiscal '23. To date, we've completed the share repurchase portion of this commitment well in advance of our year-end target. As such, we are now forecasting weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 186.5 million for fiscal 2023, which includes share repurchases through June only. As is typical, since we do not know the timing and cadence of future share repurchase activity, any additional share repurchases have been excluded from our guidance assumptions. Now let's review Q1 fiscal '23 performance in more detail where I’ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 21% primarily driven by shipment volume growth of over 17% from ongoing robust demand for our core portfolio and favorable price. As a reminder, we're seeing a favorable shipment volume overlap versus last year's Q1, which was impacted by supply shortages and missed shipping days as a result of severe weather events impacting Texas and Northern Mexico. Depletion growth for the quarter came in at nearly 9% driven by the continued strength of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra as well as the return to growth in the on-premise channel. Q1 shipments were generally aligned with cases depleted as distributor inventories remained at normal levels. The on-premise channel grew more than 30% in Q1 and now accounts for approximately 13% of our depletion volume versus 11% in Q1 fiscal 2022 when the on-premise channel continued to be somewhat affected by the pandemic. Moving on to beer margins. As expected, beer operating margin decreased 260 basis points to 40.2% primarily driven by the expected impact of inflationary headwinds, leading to increased COGS for transportation and material costs, including pallets, cartons, steel, corn and aluminum. Additional factors include higher depreciation and brewery costs associated with planned capacity additions at our Obregon production facility in Mexico. These headwinds were partially offset by the favor overlap from 2 items: one, fixed cost absorption related to increased production levels compared to last year's Q1 driven by the weather events I just mentioned; and two, decreased obsolescence primarily related to hard seltzers. On an absolute dollar basis, marketing investments increased versus prior year. However, due to favorable top line leverage, marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 40 basis points to 9% versus prior year. We continue to expect marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 10% range for the year. For full year fiscal '23, we continue to target net sales growth of 7% to 9%, which includes 1 to 2 points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio and operating income growth of 2% to 4%. This implies an operating margin of approximately 38% for the year. Throughout the remainder of the year gross margin will be negatively impacted as benefits from price and our cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by the following COGS headwinds. First, elevated inflationary pressures will continue throughout fiscal 2023 across numerous cost components but largely driven by aluminum, cartons, wood pallets and steel. In addition, we'll see increased logistic costs for fuel and freight rates for truck and route. Second, we're expecting incremental brewery costs driven by labor inflation in Mexico as well as increased head count and training expenses to support our continued capacity expansion initiatives at both Nava and Obregon. Third, as a result of these brewery expansion plans, the step-up in depreciation expense will continue as additional capacity is planned to come online throughout the fiscal year. Moving to Wine & Spirits. Q1 fiscal '20 net sales increased 2% driven by a combination of increased shipments and favorable price and mix. Q1 depletion growth was driven by double-digit contributions from Meiomi, the Prisoner brand family, High West and Casa Noble. Operating margin decreased 330 basis points to 19.6% as mix and price benefits, combined with a favorable inventory adjustment, were more than offset by higher COGS driven by inflationary headwinds, including higher material costs for grapes and glass, as well as increased transportation and warehousing costs. SG&A and marketing increased as a percent of net sales versus the prior year primarily driven by increased head count and marketing initiatives to support key growth areas of our business. For full year fiscal 2023, the Wine & Spirits business continues to expect net sales to decline 1% to 3% with an increase of 4% to 6% in operating income, implying operating margins of about 24% for fiscal '23. Despite unit Q1 margin results, we expect to achieve our Wine & Spirits margin goals for the year through a combination of the following initiatives that are primarily weighted to the second half of the year. We expect ongoing premiumization and mix improvement driven primarily by our fine wine business and the timing of the vintage transition for these products. We have planned incremental pricing actions beginning in the second quarter. A strong New Zealand vintage coming online is projected to drive volume and enhanced margins. And finally, we expect to see benefits from our ongoing cost savings initiatives. Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. This is a good point to provide additional detail regarding the digital business acceleration initiative that Bill outlined a few minutes ago. Constellation is already an emerging digital business today with impressive progress in key areas such as DTC, 3-tier e-commerce and digital marketing. The digital business acceleration effort will help to create a more cohesive digital strategy and is an entirely new way of doing business that is designed to enable us to become best-in-class initially in the areas that include procurement, end-to-end supply chain planning and marketing optimization. The implementation of our new SAP platform last year enabled a framework for us to proceed with this initiative, which is expected to add $35 million to $40 million in corporate expense this year. As a result, our initial corporate expense guidance increased from $230 million to a range of $265 million to $270 million. We expect to start to see some benefits from these investments later this year. Our fiscal 2023 EPS comparable guidance of $11.20 to $11.50 remains unchanged despite the lower share count. Corporate expenses as a percent of net sales remains at about 3%, which is at the level that had been trending during the SAP implementation. In fact, the Q1 increase in corporate expense of approximately $7 million was primarily driven by investment spending for our digital business acceleration initiative. You can expect to see the majority of the remaining fiscal 2023 spend for this project to occur in Q2. Comparable basis interest expense for Q1 increased slightly due to higher average borrowings, and we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 3.2x, excluding Canopy equity earnings. During Q1, we entered into an agreement that amended and restated our senior credit facility. This resulted in an increase in our existing revolving credit facility from $2 billion to $2.25 billion and extended its maturity to 2027. In addition, we issued senior notes and subsequently repaid the 2018 3.2% senior notes and the 2013 4.25% senior notes that were coming due next year. We believe that this was the appropriate action to take in a rising interest rate environment. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated free cash flow of $562 million, which represents a 7% decrease versus prior year driven by a 73% increase in CapEx investments to support planned capacity expansions and related activities in Mexico. We continue to expect fiscal 2023 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion and CapEx of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, including investments targeted for Mexico beer operations expansion. In closing, our excellent performance and strong business fundamentals demonstrate that we are committed to generating net sales and operating income growth while returning value to shareholders. Our path to impressive Q1 results were paved by great execution in growing our core business and supported by investments to enhance our portfolio and operations. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane : Just 2 questions for me. One is as we think about the -- assuming that the shareholder proposal gets approved and there's the $1.5 billion outlay, how would we finance that? And are there any offsets to offset the incremental cost of financing? And then second is just as we think about the incremental -- the accelerated investment in digital, should we think about that as being part of the kind of the cost base going forward? So is it a multiyear investment? Or you're just having a good year and you figured you'd spend -- you'd sort of pull forward some of the expenses. So really those 2 things, how we think about offsetting the incremental cost, I guess, of the $1.5 billion; and then how to think about the digital investments.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. Thanks, Bryan. So I'll take those in that order. First, on the funding of the $1.5 billion. First of all, we're in a very enviable position given the strength of our balance sheet and given our investment-grade rating. We're -- obviously, given the timing of this proposal, we're still thinking through exactly how we're going to fund the $1.5 billion, but likely will include some new debt and may or may not include some of our existing debt that we have available to us under the revolver. So there will be more to come on that as we move forward. That being said, whatever we do, we do remain committed to our investment-grade rating, and we intend to remain within our targeted leverage range and can do so as we support this commitment. On the digital business acceleration cost, so -- this is -- this will be a multiyear program that's in place. What the spend will be in future years? We will work on that as we move through this year and into next. But this is not a pull forward per se, this will be incremental investment, and so you'll see more about that, as I said, as we move through this year and into next.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. So I guess the key question this morning that we're hearing from investors is on your full year guidance and why you maintained it despite the significant outperformance in Q1 and also thinking about the significant repurchases. So I guess we're all trying to understand your level of conservatism, especially considering it implies that your beer shipments only grow about 3% for the balance of the year despite what I think is pretty darn good momentum behind your brand. So what are we all missing? I mean maybe you guys could sort of lay out for us some of the key puts and takes to help us better understand this.
Garth Hankinson: Yes, Bonnie. So Bill and I will probably try to tag team a little bit in response to your question. So I would say, first of all, Q1 was on our estimates for the quarter, keeping in mind, as we stated, as we entered the year that this year would be a bit lumpy just like last year was a bit lumpy as we've been overlapping the production issues we had last year. So you'll continue to see some of that lumpiness. For the balance of the year, I would say that we continue to expect that we're going to have strong depletions, and we will continue to have shipment growth that is in line with our long-term algorithm. So the business will continue very much going forward in a very strong manner. As it relates specifically to the guidance, I kind of alluded to this in my scripts, while we did get a benefit from the share repurchases, obviously, from retiring more shares and reduced share count, we also introduced today the incremental spend on the digital business acceleration initiative. And those 2 things kind of net out against one another. And for that matter, as we look again to the balance of the year, it's just a little bit too early for us to make any adjustments given that we're still monitoring macroeconomic conditions as well as what those economic conditions, including inflation, have on the consumer.
Bill Newlands: Yes. The only thing, Bonnie, that I would add to that is I always try to look at what our depletion rate looks like and to make sure that you're seeing the consumer takeaway. And as we stated, we're gaining significant share in our beer business. We're gaining share in almost every sector of our Wine & Spirits business. Both of those were very positive within the quarter. And don't get confused or fuddled, if you will, by the lumpiness of the shipment timing because, last year, as we know, because of weather-related events, was a bit unusual. And so therefore, the overlaps in particular, quarters of this year will be a little different. I look at the depletions, and our depletions were very strong, yielding share-gaining performance within the market. More importantly, we are continuing to see strong consumer demand throughout the year. And certainly, the consumers continues to be interested with our business despite an understanding that there's -- it's going to be an interesting year relative to questions around inflation and around recession. But we remain very confident in the performance of our business, and I think it was reflected in the quarter we delivered.
Operator: Your next question today is coming from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: So maybe we could just take a step back and talk about how you think your business is positioned if we do move into a recession and a period of weaker consumer spending both looking at past cycles and what you've seen so far this cycle. And second, maybe just an update on June depletions. Have you seen any trade down impact on your business so far? So maybe first conceptual and then be a bit more concrete. What are you seeing near term?
Bill Newlands: Sure. well, let's deal with a few facts that I think are very strong and supportive of our business. We are finding that 7 out of 10 shoppers who purchased beer have that as a planned purchase before leaving their home. I think that's very strong. It speaks very well to our business. We then look at a thing like buy rate. And buy rate, the way we discuss buy rate is equal to the number of trips times the spend that occurs during the trip. And that's actually up versus pre-pandemic levels and is actually accelerating in Q1 for beer versus the prior 3 months. I think those are very strong indications of the strength of our portfolio, particularly when you look at the share gains that both Garth and I have alluded to up to this point. June looks consistent with our yearly algorithm. I think it was another very solid month, and it's consistent with what our expectations are for the year, as we've said it earlier. So just to recap. Modelo continues to be on fire. We're continuing to see strong results in Corona Extra. Once we get over the supply chain issues in Pacifico -- you saw a very, very strong quarter in Pacifico. So our anticipation is that we are going to continue to see a very solid year in our beer business as the year progresses, recognizing there's a lot of unknown variables that are going to go on relative to the economy.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Nik Modi from RBC.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Philippe [indiscernible] on for Nik. Question on pricing, on beer pricing. You came in a little bit before expected and your 1% to 2% target for the full year. We are -- how are you thinking beer pricing will evolve in the balance of the year? And do you think the narrowing price gaps versus domestic beer could be a benefit, potentially accelerating your market share gains going forward as we get into a more uncertain macroeconomic environment?
Bill Newlands: So our -- we've been very clear that our long-term algorithm on pricing is 1% to 2%. As you know, last year, we were slightly above that result. And frankly, we think that it is particularly important to keep the consumer in mind as we make choices around our pricing algorithm. Our current algorithm works very well for us. And it's fairly flexible. And the benefit of that approach is it does provide the flexibility as we watch and see how things develop over the course of the year. So what I can assure you of is we are closely monitoring what is going on both from an inflationary standpoint as well as pricing, and we'll be ready to adjust our approach if that proves to be necessary or appropriate. But what I would say is it's not going to change our long-term algorithm. We still believe that 1% to 2% over time is correct for our business and helps us maintain our consumer base, which ultimately, at the end of the day is what it's all about.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities.
Chris Carey: Just to start, Bill, just a clarification. You said that depletions are consistent with your yearly algorithm. Were you referring to the beer growth algorithm of 7 to 9 or the volume component within that algorithm? So that's just a clarification. And the main question is I hear you in response to the resilience of the consumer. I was wondering if you could just maybe frame consumer risk within your portfolio. For example, do you see relatively higher consumer sensitivity in Modelo versus Corona, given different demographic exposure? And maybe just offer some thoughts on how you could evolve your strategy, as you just noted, should you start to see a change in the consumer habits.
Bill Newlands: Sure. So to answer the first question, it's both. Depletes and volume, we expect to be roughly equal over the course of the year. Because there is growth, shipments are always a little bit higher because you're working off a bigger base. So there's always a bit more shipment in any year because, unfortunately, we have a strong growth profile within our business. Premiumization rates, and I think this is an important one also relative to our portfolio, are continuing to hold. In fact, in beer, 59% of dollars are now in the high end. You remember just a few years ago, when we were predicting that we'd pass 50%. It's continued up to 59.5% as of this point in time, which is up 1 point -- 1.1 points versus prior year. You're also seeing similar activity in the wine business, where the premiumization that's occurring is continuing to occur there as well. All of those things speak very well to the sustainability of our growth profile for our business. And as we've said before, there's still plenty of room for growth within all of our franchises. But using Modelo as an example, Modelo is still growing substantially in a lot of secondary markets where there's a lot of distribution opportunity as well as gaining share in markets that have more sustained and long-term strength. So we're very comfortable that we have a long and sustained runway for growth across all of our brands, and certainly, the facts are backing that up.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. So I guess I'm trying a few different questions. From an industry volume standpoint, Bill, you've spoken very clearly to the strength of your brand momentum in your portfolio. But industry-wide in beer, I mean my understanding is there's historically a pretty strong correlation between gas prices and beer consumption. And so I think some of the industry data that's out there or anecdotal has been that there has been a deceleration in industry volume in recent weeks. So I was just curious if you could comment on that. If you guys are not seeing that, if you think something different, if you don't think there's a relationship with gas pricing. I'd be curious that broader industry perspective would be helpful because I have no doubt that within that, your brands are in a great spot.
Bill Newlands: Certainly, it's something that we're all watching. One of the benefits that you've seen in at historical times of recession or recessionary style trends is alcohol beverage tends to be an affordable luxury, and therefore, it tends to continue to be consumed during that window of time. Let me give you an exact fact around beer-drinking households. It holds an essential status for many, many consumers. In fact, if you look at 172 edible categories, beer ranks 15, about -- and therefore, what it says is the consumer is consistently wanting to continue to participate in this category. That doesn't mean that there won't be short-term impacts because of gas prices and other inflationary pressures. But overall, it tends to be a category that is -- that is a stable for a lot of people, and that's probably particularly true for our Hispanic consumer base, which, as you know, we over-index with that consumer base. So I think it speaks pretty well to our position at least of being able to work our way through a recessionary environment pretty -- in a pretty healthy way.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Nadine Sarwat from Bernstein.
Nadine Sarwat: Two questions for me, if I may. The first, could you just help us understand exactly why the Q1 price mix was above that longer term 1 to 2 that you mentioned? Is that the phasing of pricing? Is there a mix component we're not taking into account or perhaps some distributors taking pricing? Color on that would be appreciated. And then my second question on Canopy Growth. I appreciate your comments in the prepared remarks that you remain committed to that investment. But the company does continue to lose share in Canadian recreational cannabis, continues to face challenging -- challenges reaching profitability. U.S. scheduled legalization is looking increasingly less likely, at least in the short term. So could you maybe provide more color as to what gives you conviction that this business can meaningfully improve in the long term?
Bill Newlands: Sure. Let me take the first part of that because you are correct. If you look at the data, it certainly shows that the pricing scenario at the moment is above the 1 to 2 algorithm. There's a number of things involved in that. One is it only reflects tracked channels. So that's a piece of it. It is partly mixed. As you see different sizes and different products and different subcategories within beer affecting it, you see different scenarios. It's partly retailers making choices about hitting specific price points, which, in some instances, will drive the percentage higher but doesn't reflect the change in our pricing strategy. As I said earlier, I think this all goes back to our algorithm being particularly important and particularly flexible in our ability to see what's happening in the market and adjust as necessary as part of it. But all of those elements weigh into what is certainly some higher pricing than what we have noted in our words.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. And on the Canopy question, there's no doubt that over the past couple of years, Canopy has faced a number of headwinds. That being said, we remain very, very positive on the category and very optimistic for Canopy. The reason we feel that way, right, is that, number one, in Canada, we believe that the Canopy team, through its recent announced restructuring programs, have a renewed focus on driving the premium end of that business, which is profitable and that the team up there is on a path to profitability in the near term. In the U.S., we continue to see very good green shoots for the category in general in terms of consumer consumption. Whether you look at retail sales or you look at state-by-state tax income associated with cannabis sales, both are growing very, very quite nicely showing that the consumer is adopting the category. We also really like the approach that the Canopy team has taken in the U.S. If you look at some of the -- some of the options that Bill outlined in his prepared remarks, Canopy's position with Acreage and TerrAscend and Jetty and Wana have them very well positioned to take advantage of the U.S. market once it does open up and once legalization occurs. So that's why we remain -- that's why we continue to have conviction on the category.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI.
Rob Ottenstein: Great. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the pricing question. And that is if you can talk a little bit about your views about what appears to be happening based on channel checks, trade checks that retailers are essentially taking or increasing their margin given the much higher price increases for other brands and just the fact that distributors, right, have pressures in terms of their costs, and they're likely to want to see higher prices, so if you could talk maybe a little bit about that dynamic. And I think we all understand the long-term algorithm, why that makes sense, but these are extraordinary times.
Bill Newlands: They are extraordinary times. And I think the one thing that's important, Robert, in extraordinary times is to remain balanced, sensible and not sort of get caught up in the world wind at the moment and doing things that what I would describe as anti consumer. So that's why we are, again, saying that we are going to be judicious as to how we look at this, balancing the understanding that there are a lot of pressures that our consumers and all consumers are under because of inflationary pressures in the market. You have seen some increase in pricing as one of the prior callers asked that is being taken either at the distributor level or at the retail level to hit specific price points, and it's being reflected. So we're trying to walk the delicate line of what's appropriate, what is -- what can we do to reflect and address the rising costs that we are all facing while keeping our consumer base. We think that's in the long-term interest not only of our company but for the category as well. And as I said, we are going to be very judicious, we are watching it very closely. And as I said earlier, not to repeat myself, but we do have a very flexible algorithm that allows us to address questions in real time, and I can assure you we keep our eye on it almost on a daily basis.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: So as we all listen to what you said in terms of like how you exit consumption and depletions, it sounds as if you are -- you're still quite confident as you exit the quarter and enter the Q2, and correct me if I'm wrong on the beer side. So given you cast the guidance for the balance of the year, should we summarize and interpret that you're monitoring how volumes would flow through as you're shipping more than depletion and, at this point, you're helping wholesale that retailers take a larger share of the profits at this point? But if everything goes well in the summer, goes as expected, perhaps you could take pricing as you go into the fall, which is a typical pricing point, a pricing action point. And if you can comment on how you're going to balance because your low single-digit implied shipment volume for the balance of the year? Obviously, it [discouraged] investors. Is there anything we should be noting in terms of like the level of conservatives that you're assuming now? Or is that just a function of again, looking at how your typical consumer will behave, given higher oil prices?
Bill Newlands: So let me try to -- hopefully, I'll answer most of those here as I try to answer it. First of all, let me go back to something that I said in my prepared remarks, which is, while it looks like we shipped a lot more than we depleted in the first quarter, that is purely because of the overlap of last year where there was weather events. And the absolute -- on the beer side, the ships and depletes in the absolute were roughly the same, and we expect that to remain over the course of the year. As Garth noted a little earlier, it is going to be a little lumpy because we had a time in the first quarter where we went against weather-related activities. We obviously, in the back half of the year went against times when we were rebuilding the inventories for last year. So it will just be a bit of a lumpy year. Relative to pricing, most of our pricing, as we look at how we do it, is roughly 60% in the first half and 40% in the second half. That's just the way it has worked consistently. So we do have pricing moments. And as you know, we look at it SKU by SKU, market by market. We don't do broad-based pricing answers if it is a very micro view of pricing and how we look at it. So again, that gives us the opportunity to see how the year is developing, what opportunities exist in the marketplace. And we look at that, as I said, on an ongoing basis. So we think that, that remains the best way for us to proceed. It's worked very well for our company over the course of time, and we think it's going to continue to serve us well going forward.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Bill Chappell from Truist Securities.
Bill Chappell: So kind of the same questions that you've gotten on elasticity and market environment and that on beer but applied to why. Kind of any thoughts or what you're seeing or would expect to see kind of how this environment affects wine sales. And when I think of that -- I know there's as you said, affordable luxury but just wondering if you're seeing consumers go from $25 wine down to $20 wine or if there's a net benefit for the Woodbridge franchise, as more and more people are looking at popular price wine. Just didn't know if you were seeing that or expect to see that and how that would affect your outlook?
Bill Newlands: Sure. You bet. So in wine, and I quoted the beer example earlier, in wine, the entry levels of the high end are, frankly, the most robust growth profiles, and that's sort of in that $11 to $25 range. That represents about 28% to 29% of total dollars. And that's also, interestingly enough, it's the exact same number, 1.1 points versus a year ago. I quoted the beer one was also 1.1 points a bit earlier, but that's also up 1.1 points. And of course, that's perfect for us because we've got brands like Kim Crawford, Meiomi and Unshackled and various other brands that fit right into that price point. So therefore, it's not surprising that those brands are doing extraordinarily well. As I said earlier, our premium wine and our fine wine and craft spirits businesses had a very strong quarter with strong depletion growth of 8% and 16%, respectively. So we had a very strong start in wine. And certainly, the premiumization that you're seeing continues. It would be a different answer if we talked about mainstream wine where, frankly, it's been more challenged, even though we're very pleased that our Woodbridge brand is gaining share in a challenged subcategory. So overall, it's very similar in style to what I responded earlier in beer, and we're quite pleased that it is.
Operator: We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Bill for any further closing comments.
Bill Newlands: Great. Thanks again. Thank you all for joining our call today. As you could hear, we're off to a very good start to the year. We delivered excellent operating performance, underpinned by strong business fundamentals which provides us with great momentum as we head into our key summer selling season. Consumer demand and takeaway especially for our beer brands, remains robust as I've stated before, and we're well positioned to achieve our targeted financial goals for the year. Overall, we've demonstrated again that we're committed to pursuing our strategic growth initiatives while returning value to our shareholders. In closing, I'd like to wish everyone in the United States, a happy fourth of July holiday weekend and hope your celebrations with your friends and family include some of our fantastic beer, wine and spirits products. Thanks again, everybody, and have a safe and healthy summer.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-04-07 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Constellation Brands Fiscal Year 2022 Q4 Full Year Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Constellation's Year-end Fiscal '22 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to 1 question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Patty. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal '22 year-end call. Before I get started this morning, I'd like to comment on the announcement made earlier this week relating to the proposal from the Sands family to declassify Constellation's dual share class structure. According to the family's filing, the proposal brings significant benefits that will accrue to the company and its shareholders, including increasing market demand from investors who prefer single-class structures. The proposal is under consideration and will be negotiated explicitly by the Special Committee of our Board of Directors, and any agreement reached with the Sands family will require the approval of that Special Committee as well as our full Board of Directors. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the proposal, it would require the approval of holders of a majority of our Class A common stock that do not also hold shares of our Class B common stock. I'd like to remind everyone that the Sands family proposal was not made in connection with a corporate transaction. Constellation does not intend to comment further on the proposal unless and until a definitive agreement is reached, the proposal is abandoned or otherwise deemed advisable in connection with any further public disclosure by the Sands family. With that, let's proceed with the discussion of our excellent results and our guidance for fiscal '23.  As I reflect on our performance for fiscal '22, I'm extremely proud of how our team pulled together to deliver a year of double-digit organic net sales growth and strong cash flow generation. Our team accomplished this while battling through year 2 of the pandemic, including various supply chain challenges, adverse weather events, rising inflation, rapidly shifting consumer preferences and a host of other issues in the surrounding environment. Through it all, we stayed true to who we are and remain laser focused on our consumers and building brands that people love. We launched our consumer-led innovation while continuing to invest in future capabilities needed to win long-term. We continued to deliver on our commitments to return value to shareholders and to serve the interest of all stakeholders by making a positive impact on our communities and the environment. In fact, earlier this morning as part of our ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship, we announced our new targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by fiscal '25 and to restore 1 billion gallons of water withdrawals from critical watersheds and improved water accessibility in disadvantaged communities where we operate in each case by fiscal '25. With that as a backdrop, I'd like to frame up what we believe are key takeaways from our performance in fiscal '22 as we head into our new fiscal year. First, our strong overall performance continues to be headlined by our Beer business, which delivered its 12th consecutive year of volume growth. Our beer portfolio led by our Modelo and Corona brand families posted net sales growth of 11% and added 30 million cases of high-end growth, extending its leadership position as the #1 high-end beer supplier and the #1 share gainer across the U.S. beer market. Second, our Wine & Spirits business delivered strong organic net sales growth of 9% and solid gross margin improvement for the fiscal year. Our enhanced focus on consumer-led premiumization in Wine & Spirits continue to yield benefits as our high-end brands outpaced the overall U.S. Wine & Spirits category primarily driven by Kim Crawford, Meiomi and the Prisoner. Third, we continue to execute against our stated capital allocation strategy, returning nearly $2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends in fiscal '22. We continue to demonstrate this commitment with this morning's announcement of a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, which, when completed, will bring us to about 75% of our $5 billion goal. Our continued strong performance in fiscal '22 and the investments we continue to make in our core business provide a nice springboard for another successful year ahead. Now let's dive a little deeper into our business performance in '22 and our outlook for the year ahead. One outlook of our success -- one hallmark of our success has been our beer business over the years has been the strength and continuity of leadership. Earlier this year, we announced that Jim Sabia assumed the role of President of our beer business. As many of you know, Jim has played a key role in the success of our beer business for many years, and we look forward to further building on the momentum under his leadership.  Jim succeeds Paul Hetterich, who will continue to work with our beer operations team in Mexico to support our ongoing brewery projects in Nava and Obregon as well as the construction of our new brewery in the state of Veracruz. Paul has been a driving force behind the success of our economy, including our beer business for more than 35 years. I look forward to continuing to work with Paul, Jim and the rest of our beer team to accelerate traction of our high-performing beer portfolio in fiscal '23. There are several industry trends that provide a solid platform for our portfolio growth in the year ahead. Total beverage alcohol servings per capita are expected to remain stable with growth of about 1% to 2% annually based on population growth expectations. Premiumization in the beer category is projected to continue with the high-end segment taking share from the mainstream segment. Mexican imports, primarily driven by the Constellation portfolio, are expected to continue to drive traditional beer growth and will continue to be a key driver of gains in the overall beer segment. Significant growth is projected in the flavors category, including seltzers, flavored beer, RTD spirits, wavered malt beverages with all categories exhibiting strong future growth prospects. The on-premise segment has rebounded and is expected to continue to recover to drive incremental category growth. And finally, 3-tier e-commerce and digitally influenced sales have proven sticky for beer with revenue and share growing significantly. In fact, this channel is forecasted to deliver over-indexed growth relative to other channels. Each of these trends, combined with Hispanic demographic tailwinds that work in our favor, either aligns with the core strengths of our beer business, or our areas where we're investing to build capabilities needed to more fully compete and win. We have one of the most focused and highly efficient portfolios in the industry with a long runway for growth ahead. Our inventory position has been rebuilt, and we have plans to invest aggressively behind our brands in fiscal '23. We also got some exciting new consumer-led innovation on the way. Modelo Especial is the #2 beer brand in dollar sales in the country and has significant distribution runway over the medium-term to facilitate mid- to high single-digit total annual volume growth in the off-premise. Modelo Especial currently under-indexes with non-Hispanic consumers, but have strong momentum in group household penetration, 7% to 20%. I wish it was 70, but it was 20 with these consumers in the past 2 years, yet there's still significant opportunity to close the awareness gap in order to drive further household penetration. For reference, Modelo Especial currently has only 80% of the household penetration of Corona Extra. We believe increasing total market penetration for Modelo Especial to Corona Extra levels will enable access to more than 2 million incremental consumers. Modelo Especial is the #5 draft brand in the entire category, yet it only has 11% national distribution. This distribution opportunity, along with the velocity the brand delivers, makes Modelo Especial draft our biggest on-premise priority. In the F&B space, our Modelo Chelada brand family has become an important growth contributor to our portfolio as the #1 Chelada in the U.S. beer market. For Modelo Chelada, we're forecasting double-digit CAGRs in the medium term driven by extended channel distribution with new pack sizes, formats and flavors. Current awareness levels from Modelo Chelada are low relative to other flavor categories and large competitors.  We expect to improve awareness and accelerate growth of Modelo Chelada through maximizing social and digital media investments to broaden our demographic reach to general market consumers as well as Spanish language TV to stay connected to core Hispanic consumers. Within our Chelada lineup, we're aiming for additional growth for a product line that grew over 30% last year, has tripled in size over the past 5 years and where we own almost 50% of the market nationwide. In fiscal '23, we're introducing a 12-ounce, 12-pack of Limón y Sal and a new Chelada flavor, Naranja Picosa, an orange and chili flavor. We're also extending the Modelo brand into new spaces to bring authentic Mexican flavor to both lighter beer styles and favored cocktail-inspired beer. Modelo Oro is a premium, sessionable light Cerveza with low-calorie and carbs rolling out in 3 test markets, Charlotte, Fresno and Houston. This is a full-flavored beer that fits an active lifestyle. Another product aimed at the low-calorie crowd is Modelo Cantarito-Style Cerveza, a beer with fruit juice that mimics a popular Mexican beverage. It's rolling out in Atlanta, San Diego and Arizona and celebrates the strong Mexican culture and heritage we see throughout the U.S. Shifting gears. We're excited by the resurgence of Corona Extra, which continues to be one of the most loved brands in the U.S. beer market. While modest growth is projected for Corona Extra in fiscal '23, this brand has overindexed brand equity, indicating higher growth potential, both for the master brand and broader brand family, including younger and multicultural consumers, where we see significant opportunity to increase buy rates. Corona Extra also has a fairly high household penetration, yet it still lags behind some large competitors. Distribution opportunities also exist for Corona Premier as there are still significant effective distribution gaps versus Corona Extra. And while buy rates continue to grow for Corona Premier, it still trails behind competing brands, indicating a significant opportunity to increase velocity. Premier is currently underdeveloped in the can format relative to its competitors, as experience indicates that cans are the preferred format for light beer drinkers. And we see a significant unlock with the launch of new packages and format sizes. Finally, consumers have embraced Corona Premier in the on-premise, and our craft focus this year is designed to accelerate that trend. For the Pacifico brand, we're forecasting 10% to 15% total annual volume growth in the medium term from distribution alone. We're prioritizing growth in key DMAs for Pacifico to expand off-premise points of distribution in key cities, particularly in the West and Midwest regions of the country, which will be supported by digital media to reach target legal drinking age Gen Z consumers. We'll also activate consumer and customer-specific national accounts retail programs as well as steel marketing and sponsorship to support targeted investment markets. Pacifico had the hottest draft volume trend in the category during the last 52 weeks, followed closely by Modelo. That trend, along with planned unique activations, positions Pacifico to continue to gain awareness with consumers. We've been increasingly focused on upping our game in the spirits-based RTD space with unique and compelling new brands. Last quarter, we announced a new agreement with the Coca-Cola Company for the U.S. market to create a new to state-of-line of spirit-based ready-to-drink cocktails using the well-loved and fast-growing FRESCA brand. FRESCA mix will debut this fall in bottled strips and tequila Paloma labels. In support of our collective fiscal 3 portfolio initiatives, we will continue to leverage our efficient sponsorship of UFC, the college football playoffs as well as numerous NFL, NBA and MLB teams. You'll see a significant increase and media investments to drive sustained awareness and consumer demand. Overall, we plan to recruit new drinkers through advertising, investments in digital media and localized programming. In addition, our portfolio initiatives will be enabled by increasing adoption of our Shopper-First Shelf approach, which continues to drive results and gain traction. We completed 14,000 shopper-first shelf sets last year, our highest total to date. As you can see, our beer portfolio is well positioned to capitalize on compelling category and consumer trends by leveraging our core brands' competitive advantages for existing and new platforms to deliver our medium-term net sales growth target of 7% to 9%. Now let's move on to our Wine & Spirits business. Despite the confluence of factors impacting this business in fiscal '22, including a major distributor transition, migration to SAP, inflationary headwinds and COVID related to logistics and supply chain challenges, this business delivered strong organic net sales growth of 9% and solid gross margin improvement for the year. Marketplace performance for our higher-end brands continued to outpace the overall U.S. Wine & Spirits category primarily driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford and the Prisoner Wine Company. And our increased focus on our higher-end price segments yielded benefits as our fine wine and craft spirit portfolio achieved double-digit net sales growth driven by the Prisoner Wine Company and High West. Our innovation efforts also produced excellent results with growth contributions coming from Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon, Kim Crawford Illuminate Sauvignon Blanch which together both held the top 2 slots among new high-end products introduced over the last 2 years as well as the Prisoner [Indiscernible] extensions, High West ready-to-serve packed and Woodbridge's buttery chardonnay in 3-liter box. Heading into fiscal '23, our strategic focus includes commitment to continued premiumization, margin expansion, accelerated growth in DTC channels and continued growth in our international business. Our innovation strategy will be focused on prevailing consumer trends of premiumization, digital, betterment, convenience, sustainability and enhanced flavor profiles. We have a strong innovation pipeline planned for the coming year, which includes the launch of SVEDKA Gin, Meiomi Red Blend, Kim Crawford, [T-Wine Spritz], Unshackled Chardonnay and Pinot Noir and [Indiscernible] combo ready-to-serve cocktails. Today, we announced 2 small additions to our Wine & Spirits portfolio to complement our premiumization efforts in wine with Constellation's ambition to be the #1 player in fine wine and among the top 5 in ultra-luxury and icon wines. We have acquired the highly acclaimed Oregon wine brand, Lingua Franca. This demonstrates our commitment to building a strong omnichannel business that includes category leadership in DTC and 3-tier eCommerce while building our fine wine portfolio with a diverse collection of best wines from top wine regions around the world. We also acquired the remaining portion of Austin Cocktails, which began in 2018 as Constellation Ventures focus on female founders. Austin Cocktails is a leader in the fast-growing premium RTD segment of the U.S. beverage alcohol market. It currently is distributed in 28 states and posted depletion growth of 135% in calendar '21 as RTD trends continue to rise to popularity among consumers. Overall, we expect fiscal '23 to be a dynamic year in our Wine & Spirits business. A tighter focus on higher-end brand strengthens the business and strategically positions it for future success. Before I wrap, I'd like to provide a few thoughts on our investment in Canopy Growth. We continue to believe that the cannabis market represents a significant long-term growth opportunity. and we're encouraged by the work Canopy is doing to further sharpen its strategy, rightsize its operating expense structure and capital investments and achieve profitability in Canada while strengthening its competitive positioning in the U.S. In their most recent quarterly results, Canopy maintained the #1 share position in premium flower products in Canada and drove record performance for its BioSteel and Storz & Bickel product lines. We are encouraged by recent Canadian Government changes to beverage equivalency regulations, allowing consumers to purchase cannabis beverages in greater quantities.  And in the U.S., Canopy's THC strategy is anchored by strategic relationships with 2 profitable MSOs, Acreage and TerrAscend, both of which are positioned in high-growth northeastern markets. Canopy continues to progress their U.S. THC strategy by establishing a scalable footprint, best-in-class products and national distribution networks required to unlock the U.S. market upon federal legalization. In closing, I once again want to thank our team as well as our valued distributors and retailers for your efforts in delivering another strong year of performance, and we're just as excited about our prospects for growth in the year ahead. Our Beer business, led by our core iconic brands and consumer-led innovation, is poised to continue extending its leadership position in the high end of the U.S. beer market. Our continued focus on premiumization in the Wine & Spirits business is producing results, and we have plans to further focus our Wine & Spirits portfolio towards the higher end in fiscal '23. We remain committed to our previously stated capital allocation strategy, and we remain on track to deliver our $5 billion commitment by the end of fiscal '23. And finally, I'd like to leave you with this. We operate in a very dynamic and seemingly ever changing environment. But over the years, one thing has remained constant. IRI recently came out with its annual rankings of CPG growth leaders, and Constellation was recognized for being one of the top performers yet again. In fact, Constellation has been recognized as an IRI growth leader more than any other CPG company in our peer set over the last 10 years. That's something we're extremely proud of, and we look forward to continuing to keep this momentum going into our new fiscal year.  And with that thought, I would like to turn it over to Garth, who will review our financial results in '22 and our financial focus for '23. Garth?
Garth Hankinson : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2022 marked another year of solid financial performance and shareholder value creation despite a myriad of headwinds forming our fortitude and resiliency. Our strong operating results and powerful cash flow generation allowed us to return almost $2 billion in capital to shareholders for the year. Additionally, as Bill mentioned, this morning, we announced that we are entering into an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR agreement to repurchase $500 million of shares during Q1 of fiscal 2023.  Please note that the ASR agreement constitutes the $500 million share repurchase referenced in this morning's earnings release. Once we complete the ASR in Q1, we will be approximately 75% of the way toward achieving our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2023. More on fiscal 2023 in a minute, but first I want to review full year fiscal 2022 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 11%, landing in the upper end of our previous guided range driven by shipment growth of approximately 9% and favorable price, which, as expected, landed slightly above our typical 1% to 2% range. These tailwinds were partially offset by unfavorable sales mix primarily driven by a shift in package types and the return of on-premise draft SKUs. Depletion growth for the year came in at nearly 9% driven by the continued strength of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra as well as the strong return to growth in the on-premise channel. On-premise volume accounted for approximately 11% of the total beer depletions during the fiscal year and grew strong double digits versus last year. As a reminder, the on-premise accounted for approximately 15% of our beer depletion volume pre COVID and was only 6% of our depletion volume in fiscal 2021 as a result of on-premise shutdowns and restrictions due to COVID-19. When adjusting for 2 extra selling days in the year, the beer business generated approximately 8% depletion growth. As previously guided, cases shift continue to exceed cases depleted during the fourth quarter, which resulted in distributor inventories returning to normal levels at fiscal year-end. Moving on to beer margins. As expected, beer operating margin decreased 110 basis points versus prior year to 40%. Benefits from favorable pricing, marketing as a percent of net sales and mix were more than offset by unfavorable costs. The increase in COGS was driven by several headwinds that included the following: first, the previously announced obsolescence charge of approximately $80 million due to excess inventory of our hard seltzer SKUs resulting from a slowdown in the overall category; second, increased brewery costs driven by incremental head count, labor inflation in Mexico and increased spend related to capacity expansion; third, increased material costs due to rising commodity prices and inflationary headwinds that, on average, landed in the mid- to high single-digit increase range, predominantly driven by wood pallets, cartons, steel, corn and aluminum.  Please note that this range includes the impact of hedging where possible. And lastly, step-up in depreciation expense, largely due to the incremental 5 main hectoliters at Obregon completed in early fiscal 2022. These comp headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption driven by increased production levels in fiscal 2022 versus last year. On an absolute dollar basis, marketing investments increased versus prior year. However, due to favorable top line leverage, marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 40 basis points to 9.2% versus prior year. Moving to Wine & Spirits. Net sales declined 19% as shipments declined approximately 34%. Excluding the impact of the Wine & Spirits divestitures, organic net sales increased 9% mainly driven by shipment growth of nearly 3%, favorable mix, increased pricing and small tainted bulk wine sales related to the 2020 wildfires. Organic shipment growth was largely driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford and the Prisoner partially offset by a decline for some of our key mainstream brands. Depletions declined approximately 6%, mainly driven by SVEDKA, Robert Mondavi Private Selection and Woodbridge. These declines were partially offset by the robust growth of our higher-end brands, led by the Prisoner Wine Company of 16%; Meiomi and High West, up 13%; and Kim Crawford, up 9%. Shipment growth was ahead of depletion growth for the year, mostly reflecting impacts from our distributor transition. During the coming year, we expect to rightsize inventory levels in the business. Operating margin decreased 180 basis points to 22.7% as mix benefited from the divestiture and favorable price were more than offset by increased marketing and SG&A spend as a percent of net sales and increased costs. Higher costs were driven by increased freight and warehousing costs partially offset by net favorable fixed cost absorption, lower break raw materials and cost savings initiatives. Marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales increased versus the prior year largely due to a loss of top line leverage resulting from the divestitures. Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal 2022 corporate expense came in slightly higher than our previous guidance, finishing at approximately $238 million, up 4% versus last fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by higher consulting, T&E spend and increased depreciation. These headwinds were partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits and a favorable foreign currency impact. Interest expense for the year decreased 8% to approximately $356 million primarily due to lower average borrowings partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates. Our full year comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings came in at 17.5% versus 18.2% last year primarily driven by a higher level of stock-based compensation benefits. Effective tax rates on our 4 businesses came in lower than expected during Q4, driving tax rate favorability versus our previous guidance. Moving to fiscal 2022 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow, which reflects strong operating cash. CapEx totaled approximately $1 billion and was in line with our most recent guidance. This included approximately $850 million of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion. Pivoting to our full year fiscal 2023 P&L and cash flow targets. For fiscal 2023, we expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $11.20 to $11.50, which excludes Canopy equity and earnings. For fiscal 2023, the beer business is targeting net sales growth of 7% to 9%, reflecting 1 to 2 points of pricing benefit within our Mexican product portfolio, which is in line with our typical pricing strategy and operating income growth of 2% to 4%. This implies operating margin to approximately 38%. As previously discussed, the implied decline in operating margin is predominantly driven by gross margin compression as benefits from price and our cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by the following COGS headwinds. First, we are expecting elevated inflationary pressures to continue throughout fiscal 2023 and estimating inflation on the commodity spend component of raw and packaging materials to land, on average, in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, including the impact of hedging where allowed. These significant inflationary pressures are expected across numerous cost components but largely driven by aluminum, cartons, wood pallets and steel. Second, similar to fiscal 2022, we are expecting incremental brewery costs driven by labor inflation in Mexico is estimated to range between 5% and 6% as well as incremental head count and training expenses to support our continued capacity expansion initiatives. Third, as a result of these brewery expansion plans, we are estimating a step-up in depreciation expense as additional capacity is planned to come online throughout the fiscal year. For fiscal 2023, we are targeting total beer segment depreciation expense to approximate $295 million or an increase of approximately $45 million. And finally, we expect margin headwinds related to incremental logistics costs in fuel and freight rates for both rail and truck, which is expected to drive an increase in the low to high single-digit range.  As previously stated, we expect to execute against our aggressive cost savings agenda to help partially offset these headwinds, along with expected favorable fixed cost absorption driven by increased production models. As it relates to beer marketing spend for fiscal 2023, we expect marketing as a percent of net sales to land in the 9% to 10% range.  Shifting to Wine & Spirits. For fiscal 2023, the Wine & Spirits business is targeting net sales to decline 1% to 3%. While this range is outside our medium-term growth goal for the business, it is an anomaly driven by the significant overlap we have from our distributor transition as well as revenues associated with sales of smoke-tainted bulk wine. Both are anticipated to be onetime in nature, and thus, we do not expect them to be repeated in fiscal year 2023. Excluding these impacts, we expect an underlying Wine & Spirits business to return to its targeted goal of 2% to 4% net sales growth next fiscal year. On the bottom line, we expect operating income to increase in the 4% to 6% range. This implies operating margin to approximate 24.5%, which represents almost 200 basis points of margin expansion. This margin expansion reflects benefits from price, mix and cost saving initiatives to help more than offset significant COGS inflation headwinds mostly related to freight and packaging. Cost saving initiatives include optimizing the Appalachian mix across our portfolio and decreasing the weight of our glass bottles, which also has positive environmental impacts. This is a good spot to update everyone on our Wine & Spirits operating margin expectations in the medium term. Since we provided original targets back in 2019, the operational environment has changed considerably. Inflationary pressures have got significantly worse, driving increased freight and warehousing costs in fiscal 2022 and are expected to continue well into fiscal 2023.  Additionally, while we continue to remove stranded costs from the business, we strategically decided to reinvest more of these savings back into the areas of businesses that are driving growth. Specifically, in DTC, e-commerce, our fine wine and craft spirits portfolio and consumer-led products that are fueled by category tailwinds. As such, we've updated our operating margin goal to reflect these impacts and now expect medium-term operating margins to migrate to a range of 28% to 29% and EBIT margins at approximately 30%, reflecting a leading margin structure for our industry. Before we move on to guidance for the rest of the P&L, I'd like to highlight the new additions to our wine spirit portfolio that Bill mentioned earlier. As part of the evolution to the high end, we acquired Lingua Franca as well as the remaining interest in Austin Cocktails from our ventures portfolio, 2 businesses positioning categories with significant growth tailwinds behind it. From a finance perspective, these transactions collectively, along with My Favorite Neighbor, which was fully acquired in fiscal 2022, were almost entirely self-funded through the sale of one of our successful venture investments, which generated a significant return on investment. Other fiscal 2023 guidance assumptions include the following: corporate expenses to approximate $230 million, interest expense to be in the range of $350 million to $360 million and a comparable tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings of approximately 20%. The increase in our tax rate is mainly driven by a lower level of anticipated stock-based compensation benefits versus fiscal 2022. Rounding up the P&L, noncontrolling interest is expected to approximate $40 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at approximately $198 million. This share count assumes we execute a $500 million of share repurchases in Q1. We plan to repurchase additional shares throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. However, we do not know the timing of cadence, and as such, these expected share repurchases have been excluded from our guidance assumptions. We will continue to update our outstanding shares accordingly when we report quarterly earnings throughout the fiscal year. Additionally, this EPS guidance range does not reflect a prolonged impact from the volatility associated with the ongoing headwinds we've been experiencing on fuel prices and other commodities as the sustained impact of the recent geopolitical events remains unclear. Thankfully, we have no employees who live or work in Russia or Ukraine, and we have minimal commercial disclosure to this part of the world. That said, our thoughts and prayers are with those being impacted by this growing humanitarian crisis, and we wish for a quick resolution to this conflict and return to peace in the region. Turning to cash flow. We expect fiscal 2023 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion and CapEx of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, including approximately $1.2 billion targeted for Mexico beer operations expansion. To wrap up, I'd like to reiterate that our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. In fiscal 2022 alone, our strong operating results and powerful cash flow generation capabilities enabled us to return almost $2 billion in capital to shareholders as part of our overall goal of returning $5 billion by the end of our fiscal 2023. Our capital allocation priorities augment our organic growth strategy to enable strategic reinvestment where we see category tailwinds. We believe this strategy, combined with excellent execution and returns to shareholders, positions us to be a top-tier shareholder return generator for many years to come.  With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. I wanted to talk just a little bit about Corona. I was actually surprised that in your prepared remarks, you talked about expecting more modest growth in Corona Extra in '23. But the momentum on that brand has been so strong this year, my understanding of anecdotes around performance during the Super Bowl period has been tremendous. So just curious why expecting things to slow down a bit in '23.
Bill Newlands: Well, Lauren, we're actually very optimistic that we'll continue to see strong Corona Extra performance. Obviously, as you point out, it was a very pleasant situation for us this past fiscal year, and it significantly outperformed than we expected. But we also have a lot of other priorities in the Corona brand family, as you know. As I stated in my remarks, we expect Premier to be a heavy focus both in the on-premise as well as building out our distribution capabilities in the off-premise. So we're just trying to be sort of aware that we're going to have a lot of overall work across the family, but we expect to continue to see Corona Extra be a continuing growth driver in our overall business.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Dan Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: So I wanted to focus on beer margins First, just how much visibility do you think you have on the fiscal 2023 beer margin guidance given there's a number of moving pieces? There's also tremendous external volatility including how hedged or locked in on contracts you are on some of your key commodities and might. And what might be some of the bigger risk points in terms of margins? And then second, just on the pricing front, playing devil's advocate, why not be more aggressive than the long-term 1% to 2% algorithm? I'm just having a hard time believing that $1 incremental per case cost on beer is going to be that much of a factor in a trade down decision relative to consumers seeing much, much higher dollar pressure from other areas, whether it's grocery, gas or electricity costs. So just your thoughts around why not being more aggressive on pricing, particularly given the market share volatility and if you're seeing any signs of trade down so far?
Garth Hankinson : Thanks, Dara. I'll take the first part of that question on margin and then Bill will comment on pricing. So as we started selling in the second half of last year, the inflationary environment, obviously, have gotten a little bit deeper and more protracted than anyone expected. And so that's why we were focused in January as to the facts we're going to be facing some additional headwinds this coming year. Typically, we're seeing inflationary increases on a year-over-year basis in that kind of low to mid-single-digit range. And this year, we're expecting them in the high single digit to low to mid-double-digit range. You're seeing that across things like glass, which is our biggest component in beer, which is up 6%. Cartons are up 17%. Crowns were up 26%. Wood pallets are up 35%. So costs are definitely under pressure for sure. That being said, we think that we're fairly well positioned as we enter into the year. To be very proactive around this, we've gotten more aggressive with our hedging policy or our hedging practices, I should say. We typically enter a year somewhere hedged in the neighborhood of sort of 50% to 60% on any given line. But this year, we've taken a more defensive posture to make sure that we're really protecting the P&L. As we enter the year this year, we're hedged at about 75% on aluminum, 70% on natural gas, 60% on the core and 90% of diesel. So we're in a pretty good spot. That being said, as you articulated, there's a lot of volatility around commodities, and that's where we're watching as we go through the year, and we're being opportunistic to layer and even been further hedges as we see weaknesses on a day-to-day basis. So we think we're in pretty good shape. But certainly, there's still some exposure just given the depth and the duration of the inflationary environment we're currently in.
Bill Newlands: So relative to your question on price, we certainly understand the question, a lot behind it. So let me remind you how we price. We price on a SKU-by-SKU basis, market-by-market basis, and we're going to continue to do it that way. We also are probably a bit more judicious on price, and perhaps we could be. The reality is we need to be sensitive to our consumers. It's a challenging time for consumers across many, many industries. And it's our view that this is not the time to try to put extra burden out on one of the critical things that many people have in their basket, which happens to be our beers. So we're a bit probably more judicious than we might be able to be, but we think this is in the long-term interest. We always say it's a whole lot easier to keep your consumer than to lose them and have to reacquire them. And that's part of what drives our thinking.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: Maybe just a little bit of a follow-on question to Bill, what you were just mentioning. I was just hoping to get some color from you on the consumer and sort of the spending behavior so far this year. I certainly know your products are premium, but curious, are you seeing any signs of down-trading pressure? And then could you talk about how well you think your portfolio will hold up if or when we enter a recession? I know Bill, in the past, you kind of mentioned your portfolio is pretty defensive. So I'd just be curious to kind of hear you revisit that for us.
Bill Newlands: You bet, Bonnie. Fortunately, so far, things are holding up very well. One of the things that I've seen over the course of my career in the alcoholic beverage business, is many, many times, when there is recessionary environments, consumers are still interested in our category and almost view it as a small luxury that they can still experience where they might pass on buying a new refrigerator or something that's a bigger purchase. If they're having personal challenges, they still want to engage in some things that they enjoy in their life. And fortunately, our category is one of those. So so far, this continues to hold. And I think it speaks directly to my answer to Dara a minute ago, which is trying to be sensitive to our consumer and to make sure that that we continue to provide our great products to them at pricing that's reasonable given a tough environment.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo.
ChrisCarey: Just one follow-up on the pricing and then related question. Are you planning on pricing on Corona? Or is that all going in Modelo and the other SKUs? Can you just maybe comment on where the pricing is going to be going in? And then just specifically on Modelo, I think you said mid-single digit to high single-digit in the off-premise. Can you maybe review expectations for on-premise penetration for this fiscal year? And just in general, where you see that as far as kind of innings of developing the on-premise for that specific offering?
Bill Newlands: Yes, you bet. So I'll just remind you what I said earlier, which is we look at pricing on a SKU-by-SKU basis and a market-by-market basis. So it's not any individual brand, let's say, where we focus on pricing. It's really on a SKU by SKU, brand by brand. And so there's not in generality, as to your question, on a particular brand. Relative to Modelo, as I also stated earlier, one of our biggest arteritis is really on-premise draft. We're the #5 player in on-premise draft. We're only 11% penetration nationally in that particular format. That's a great opportunity for us to expand our reach, particularly on Modelo Especial. And interestingly enough, it was only beaten out of its growth last year by Pacifico, which I guess is not the worst thing. But certainly, Modelo, we think, has a great opportunity to continue to expand its reach, particularly as we continue to see much greater penetration in non-Hispanic households that's going to be both the on-premise and the off-premise numbers that both you and I quoted earlier.
Operator: Thank your next question today is coming from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Garth, can you maybe talk about the logic behind doing an ASR versus just buying in the open market over the course of the first quarter?
Garth Hankinson : Sure. Thanks, Kaumil. Look, we're going to use the same approach this year that we used last year, which is we're going to use all sort of the tools that are available to us to buy back the shares that we need to buy back in order to meet our obligations. So last year, we used an ASR in the second quarter. We also took advantage of a 10b5 and 10b18 program. So we're going to do that for the -- we can optimize the timing of the -- of our repurchases as well as appropriately dollar cost averaging, dollar cost average out here to make sure we get the best value for this. And we opted to use the ASR in the first quarter because we're going to get the benefits earlier in the year. And also, I think that it's a good time for us to buy it.
Operator: Thank your next question today is coming from Vivien Azer from Cowen and Company.
Vivien Azer: I just wanted to offer, I think it's really reassuring to investors how consistent you guys have been in terms of the commentary on capital allocation today. So thank you for that. In terms of my question, I also wanted to focus on pricing in the health of the consumer but perhaps pivoting to the Wine & Spirits business. Clearly, you guys have done a ton of work to premiumize your portfolio. So given the portfolio evolution in Wine & Spirits, how does that change your thinking around your ability to take price there?
Bill Newlands: I think it largely depends on the sector of the wine business in which we're discussing. As you know, mainstream is actually down, although we're gaining share in a down market. And that's the way we think about it. Let's gain share in the mainstream of the business. On the other hand, as you move up the price ladder, you're seeing significant acceleration, and many of our brands are performing extremely well, and it does give us some opportunity to increase our pricing and doing probably even a better job of covering some of the inflationary increases that we see in the beer business.  So I think you should expect them to see a bifurcated answer where we need to be sensitive to what the marketplace is giving us in the mainstream but there's probably some opportunity as you look at the premium and up sections to be a little bit more aggressive in the pricing arena.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.
Nik Modi: So just a quick housekeeping item, and then I have just a real question. Just, Bill, if you can just comment, given the rules around ASRs and material nonpublic information, can I presume that Constellation is not sitting on some news regarding a large M&A transaction? So that was just a clarification. And the real question is any update on how March depletions look. Some of the channel work that we did suggested some very strong results that look to be an acceleration sequentially from what you guys showed this February quarter. So any thoughts on that would be helpful.
Garth Hankinson : Nik, this is Garth. I'll take the first part, and then I'll turn it over to Bill. I think it speaks for itself that Constellation is fully aware of and comprise all of our obligations under state and federal securities laws. And relative to your question of how March was, Nik, we're pleased that it's at least consistent with our annual algorithm despite huge comps that we faced in March of last year. So we're pretty pleased that we got off to a good start.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane: So Garth, I had a question about just the Wine & Spirits margin outlook medium term. And one thing just in terms of, I think you gave kind of 2 sets of numbers. One was 28% to 29% operating margin and then the other was approximating a 30% EBIT margin over time. And just are those different? Or are we just saying that we still think we can get back to the 30% margin? I was a little just confused about the language there.
Garth Hankinson : Yes, sure. So on the operating profit margin question, yes, so we are coming in at 28% to 29%. The difference between operating margin and EBIT is the addition of our -- what we take in from equity earnings and Opus One.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Nadine Sarwat from Bernstein.
Nadine Sarwat: I want to touch on Corona Hard Seltzer for a little bit. So that brand continues to underperform the broader seltzer market. So what's your strategy going forward with the brand? And then maybe taking a step back, a broader question related to this. What lessons have you learned from launching Corona Hard Seltzer? And how is this going to influence your approach to rolling out innovation in the future? I think you called out a number of those in your prepared remarks.
Bill Newlands: Obviously, the seltzer market has developed very differently than what we had anticipated. And frankly, it's been more of a challenge than what we had anticipated as well. As you know, this year, we're doing a number of things. We're repackaging, as we said, in prior quarters. We are getting much more focused on where we bring differentiated products rather than me-too products into that particular sector. But we still feel that, that's going to be a growth segment of the overall beer business, and we're going to participate in it. So relative to lessons learned, I think a couple of things are always important. It's important to test. We're obviously doing tests as it relates to our Modelo franchises to make sure that we have consumer propositions that are best of class and that are going to win with consumers. And we're going to continue to operate under that approach going forward.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore.
RobOttenstein: Terrific. Just kind of swinging back to the question on seltzers and taking it a little bit broader. Clearly, a lot of the excitement on that segment is gone. From your perspective, is there actually a silver lining in that such that retailers and distributors will spend more time, energy on your brands, and that should be something that you should benefit from going forward? And then connected to that, are you starting to get a little bit more of the shelf space that you guys have earned given the tremendous brands and velocity that you've had and the fact that you've been undershelved in the past?
Bill Newlands: Robert, you definitely put your finger on a benefit of the scenario that the seltzer business has not been quite what we expected, which is -- it's very mix-accretive. So the more beer we sell, the better the mix. So that's the flip side of the seltzer business for us is not developed quite the way we had anticipated, as you point out. I think you make a very good point relative to shelf space. One of the things that occurred during the pandemic is many retailers just didn't redo their shelves to the degree that we would have expected or that you would see on a typical annual basis. And there's no question that the growth profile of our overall portfolio not only demands but really should have more shelf space. So this is going to be a critical part of what our sales organization is driving for this year, is to broaden our reach and package sizes and depth within stores.  I mentioned the Shopper-First Shelf initiative, which we actually had a pretty good year on last year. We expect to extend that this year. It's good for the category, it’s good for us. So a lot of work will be done on that very topic this year, as you point out. And we think it will be in everyone's interest, ours plus the retailer, to give our brands more shelf space. They've earned it.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.
Kevin Grundy: Great. First, a housekeeping question on the Sands proposal, which Bill, I think you can't comment on, when do you expect the Board to vote on that proposal before potentially putting it out to the Class A shareholders? And then the broader question, Bill, just your perspective on the slow start to the year for the U.S. beer industry.  So your data looks good. The results were obviously very good today. The Nielsen data continues to look good in the month of March for Constellation and probably even is a bit better, given some of the noise we understand in the Nielsen data in the last week of March. But I just wanted to get your perspective, more broadly, on what you think is driving that. I think there's some year-over-year comps at play, the seltzer slowdown, as you commented. But anything you're seeing that's potentially sort of concerning that you're watchful of, particularly around the consumer that may sort of play out here as it pertains to your portfolio? So your thoughts there would be helpful.
Bill Newlands: You bet. So just relative to your question about the Sands proposal, we've been advised that transactions of this nature typically takes 60 to 90 days. Beyond that, it's really out of our hands. The management is not involved in the discussion, the discussions between the Sands family and the special committee of the independent directors of the Board. So I don't have the exact answer to that question, believe that by 60 to 90 days is very typical. So we shall see. Relative to the start of the year, I think everybody recognized January was a bit of a tough month. It was for every -- I think everybody in the industry. A little bit of that was where New Year's fell, there were weather events, Super Bowl got pushed out an extra week versus what it was the year before. But I think the exciting part for us is it was a very, very strong February, and as I responded to Nik 2 questions ago, March has been very strong as well in the start of our fiscal year. So I don't think there's anything that's overarching as an issue within the category but certainly not as it relates to our business. We continue to be very pleased with how our brands are performing. And as Garth pointed out in his prepared remarks, we've gotten our inventories back in the right position. So brands like Pacifico, which we were a little challenged for a while on brown glass, we have gotten through that. Some of those kinds of things, which were sort of detrimental to an otherwise very strong performance here, we've now fixed. So we're in a much better position heading into this fiscal year than we were last year where there were just a lot of extraneous things that were not helpful to us.
Operator: Our next question today is coming from Andrea Texeira from JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: I just wanted to double-click on the opportunity to improve mix with the shift to on-premise. You had, I think, 3.8% price/mix expansion in the quarter. Can you still have around -- my calculation’s around the 100 basis points tailwind? And do you expect this to be -- price/mix to be embedded in your guide around 400 basis points? I just want to double check that. And on Wine & Spirits, I think Bryan, Vivien asked good questions regarding the outlook. Is there any reason why it was a bit disappointing? I know you're making a lot of investments to premiumize the portfolio. But anything to kind of give us more comfort that besides the Opus One impact, what is impacting there and if there is a better outlook towards the long term?
Bill Newlands: Sure. Let me touch on the second piece first. We're still very pleased with the development, particularly at the higher end of our Wine business. As Garth pointed out, we had 2 or 3 one-off items that were a bit challenging based around the distributor transition that occurred last year and some sale of smoke tainted wine from prior years. If you would exclude those things, we're in a growth profile for our wine business, and that's being driven by the higher end. The work that Robert Hanson and the rest of the team have done to refocus our attention towards the high end in the growth sector of the wine business I think is exactly what we expected to do. It's the strategy we began and undertook a couple of years ago, and we're continuing to execute against it. So despite the significant headwinds, as I said earlier, in the mainstream sector of the business, we're very pleased with how things are developing at the higher end. And we're comfortable that our longer-term algorithm of 2% to 4% in the wine business will be achieved sooner rather than later.
Garth Hankinson : And relative to your first -- the first part of your question, if I understood it correctly, you're pointing out that, in Q4, we had sort of a 4% points of pricing and whether or not that's going to continue. Our outlook for next year assumes that we're going to get our -- more in line with our typical 1% to 2% pricing. So that's sticking in line with our normal outlook.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.
Steve Powers: Great. I actually wanted to follow up on both those those 2 questions and your answers there. So on the beer side of things, the 1% to 2% pricing outlook, you're saying that that's inclusive of any mix impacts. I want to clarify that. And then on the wine, Bill, given the decision to reinvest stranded overheads towards additional growth, as you think about that 2% to 4% objective, are you biased, over time, higher within that range because of accelerated reinvestments? Or is the takeaway that the -- just sort of the cost of achieving that top line has just gone up a tick because of -- probably because of mainstream dynamics, but just your perspective there.
Bill Newlands: I think relative to the second piece of that, there's no question that there's obviously been an inflation, which is making a bit of that more challenging than what it had been prior. But I would like to point out something related to what Garth said in his prepared remarks, which is we've been very judicious, and thank you, Vivien, for your comment about our careful capital allocation. But I think this is a great example of it, we made 3 small purchases in the Wine & Spirits business almost entirely funded by the sale of one of our venture businesses, which was sold at a significant increase versus what we paid. So again, I think this begins to reflect a very judicious view of how we think about capital allocation and it’s very consistent with what we've promised externally. We do believe that we are going to see significant success going forward, particularly at the higher end of the business. I think the only thing that's going to potentially challenge that or be a challenge to it is where the mainstream business goes. As I said earlier, that's in the category that's been declining, and we're gaining share. So we're still winning in that category, but it's a tougher segment of the category. Certainly, we expect high single digits growth profile or even better at the higher end portion of our business. And you're seeing that in brands like Kim Crawford, Meiomi and the Prisoner and High West. So I think, over time, you're going to be pleased with what you see in the profile of our wine business. And this year will be a continued step in that direction.
Operator: We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Newlands for any further or closing comments.
Bill Newlands: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. In closing, I want to reiterate that I'm extremely proud of what our team accomplished in fiscal '22. We delivered strong financial results, continued to launch consumer-led innovation and reinforced our efforts to making a positive impact on our communities and the environment. Our beer business extended its leadership position with its 12th consecutive year of volume growth, and we are confident in our ability to maintain this momentum in fiscal '23. Over the medium term, we continue to see a strong runway for growth, supported by favorable industry trends for our portfolio and our ongoing investments in brewery capacity expansions. Our Wine & Spirits business also delivered solid performance in fiscal '22 with organic net sales growth and gross margin improvement. We are enhanced -- focused on consumer-led premiumization continued to yield benefits as our high-end brands outpaced the overall U.S. Wine & Spirits category.  Overall, we remain bullish on the future performance of our business, in our ability to deliver value for our shareholders, as reflected in our announcement of a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program.  Again, I thank you all for joining today. We look forward to speaking with you in late June during our next quarterly call. And before then, we hope you will certainly choose some of our fine products for your Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day celebrations. Thank you very much again. Have a great day, everybody.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-01-06 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands Q3 FY 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following prepared remarks, the call will be placed for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time.  I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Valerie. Good morning, and welcome to Constellation’s Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Conference Call. I’m here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO.  As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call.  Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now, here’s Bill.
William Newlands: Thank you, Patty, and happy new year to everyone on the call. I sincerely hope you were able to enjoy a safe and happy holiday season with family and friends.  Calendar year 2021 was another challenging year given the continued effects of the pandemic, a host of global supply chain issues impacting nearly every industry, inflationary pressures, and severe weather events. That said, I’m incredibly proud of the determination shown by our team at Constellation throughout the year. They’ve worked relentlessly, navigating a myriad of evolving dynamics to deliver a very solid performance year to date and in Q3, putting us on pace for another strong year of financial performance and shareholder value creation in fiscal 2022. That said, I’d like to highlight a few key takeaways from the quarter. First, our Beer business delivered a very strong performance in Q3 while lapping tough comps in fiscal 2021. We continued to see robust consumer demand, yielding a high-single digit depletion growth. We extended our leadership position as the top share gainer in the high-end of the U.S beer market behind the strength of our Modelo and Corona Brand families while improving our inventory position. Our strong performance to date gives us confidence to increase top and bottom line guidance for our Beer Business in fiscal 2022. Second, we continue to see significant runway for growth for our core imported beer portfolio in the years ahead, and we’re investing in the next increment of capacity additions required to sustain our momentum as this represents one of the most compelling value-creating opportunities for our company and our shareholders. Third, our Wine and Spirits business has made solid progress in transforming both its brand portfolio and financial profile. Q3 marked another step along our journey as we continue to shift to a higher-end wine and spirits business focused on delivering increased revenue growth and margin expansion. While our Wine and Spirits business continues to navigate through a series of headwinds impacting its year-to-date performance, our increased focus and investments behind our fine wine and craft spirits portfolio, margin accretion innovation, and e-commerce initiatives continued to gain traction and are enabling an increase in our net sales guidance for the business in fiscal 2022.  And finally, our strong overall total company performance in Q3 gives us confidence to increase our comparable basis EPS guidance for the fiscal year. Garth will provide additional details relative to our financial performance and fiscal year guidance in just a few minutes. Today, we are also excited about our announcement of a new agreement with the Coca-Cola Company in the United States to bring the Fresca brand into beverage alcohol through manufacturing and distributing a new line of Fresca Mixed Cocktails. Fresca is currently the fastest-growing diet soft drink in Coca-Cola’s portfolio, and over half of Fresca consumers already use it as a mixer with spirits. Building on this great foundation and in alignment with emerging consumer preferences around convenience, flavor, and a preference for high-quality products, we plan to launch Fresca Mixed later this year starting with cocktails using real spirits and inspired by recipes created by Fresca fans from around the globe. With that, let’s talk in more detail about our performance in the most recent quarter. Our Beer business posted depletion growth of more than 8% in the third quarter, outpacing the high-end of the U.S beer category. Modelo Especial continues to be our most significant growth driver, with depletions increasing over 13%. That is more than 5 million cases relative to the same quarter last year. It remains the brightest star in our portfolio as the top share gainer across the entire U.S beer category and IRI channels while maintaining its position as the number-one high-end beer brand. Our Modelo Chelada brand family has become an important growth contributor to our portfolio as the number-one Chelada in the U.S beer market and maintained its explosive growth, posting 35% depletion growth in the third quarter. We continued to build on this extremely successful innovation platform with a new entrant, Modelo Chelada Piña Picante, which was launched in August and is already a top share gainer among imported brands. Corona Extra sustained its reinvigorated growth trajectory and positioned as the second-fastest import share gainer and the number-three high-end brand in IRI channels with 11% depletion growth versus prior year. Similarly, Corona Premier continued its strong performance with 8% depletion growth which accelerated through distribution gains as supply conditions improved. From an innovation perspective within the Corona Brand family, Refresca and Refresca Mas are back in production and contributing nicely to growth in our ABA portfolio. Meanwhile, Corona Hard Seltzer remains a top seltzer brand in IRI following the dramatic slowdown in the seltzer category. We’re making good progress to enhance our flavor profiles and we’re on track to roll out the restaging of our variety packs, Tropical Mix pack and Berry Mix pack in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. And we are diligently working to address the brown glass shortage that is acting as a headwind this year, especially for our Pacifico brand which continues to see strong demand and has a long runway for growth ahead. Overall, our outstanding performance gives us confidence to increase guidance for our Beer business as we now expect to achieve 10% to 11% net sales growth and 6% to 7% operating income growth in fiscal 2022.  To fuel the continued growth of our imported beer portfolio, we plan to deploy an increased level of investment over the next four fiscal years to support construction of a new brewery in Southeast Mexico in the state of Veracruz as well as to expand and optimize capacity at our existing Nava and Obregon operations. Garth will give you additional details on that momentarily. Now, moving on to our Wine and Spirits business, we remain committed to our vision to become a full and innovative high-end wine and spirits business with distinctive brands and products delivering exceptional consumer experiences.  In an effort to make this vision a reality, we recently reorganized into two distinct commercial teams within the business, one focused on our fine wine and craft spirits brands, and the other focused on our mainstream and premium brands; while each team has their own distinct strategy, both remain aligned to our goal of accelerating performance by increasing revenue growth and expanding margins. Our fine wine and craft spirits business is delivering solid growth this year driven by brands like The Prisoner Unshackled, Robert Mondavi winery, and High West as well as strong gains in our direct-to-consumer e-commerce, hospitality, and international businesses. Our mainstream and premium business is focused on maintaining share in the mainstream wine segment while delivering and continuing to deliver growth through premium segment brands such as Meiomi and Kim Crawford, in line with our consumer-driven premiumization strategy.  While we’ve experienced recent headwinds on mainstream brands like Woodbridge, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, and SVEDKA, IRI trends for these brands have improved since overlapping the peak of the pandemic supported by an increased focus on more relevant branding, strategic pricing, and innovation. Throughout our wine and spirits portfolio, we’ve launched several innovations that are creating momentum and driving growth, including Kim Crawford Illuminate and The Prisoner Unshackled, both of which were among the top five share gainers in their respective price points in IRI channels this quarter. During the quarter, we also launched multiple initiatives. First, the Editor’s Collection, an exciting collaboration between our Simi Winery and the Hello Sunshine Book Club, the Book Club community founded by media mogul and innovator, Reese Witherspoon. Second, SVEDKA’s ready-to-drink vodka soda mix pack and third our new Woodbridge three-liter box; we’ve also experienced successful market expansion for our Woodbridge and Robert Mondavi Private Selection spirit barrel aged wines. Within our DTC portfolio, we’ve launched exclusive SKUs for the Robert Mondavi Winery and The Prisoner Saldo red blends as well as High West Midwinter’s Night’s Dram and their ready-to-serve Manhattan and Old Fashion Cocktails.  Within the three-tier e-commerce landscape, Constellation continues to outpace total US wine market growth by double-digits. In fact, Meiomi sales in the three-tier e-commerce channels increased 27% versus the prior year. Currently, about 10% of Meiomi’s sales come from three-tier e-commerce which is the highest level among leading U.S wine brands in IRI e-commerce channels. While we advanced our strategic agenda in wine and spirits, we continued to address a number of headwinds that have impacted our year-to-date performance. We continued to lap last year’s COVID pantry-driven loading where we experienced outsized growth. However, upcoming comparable growth rates are less challenging.  Throughout the year, we’ve experienced out-of-stocks and other operational challenges related to our SAP implementation, a difficult domestic and international logistics environment, and our route-to-market transition of 70% of our distribution to Southern Glaciers wine and spirits. The encouraging news, these issues are all stabilizing. We are rebalancing our inventories and expect more standard service levels for the balance of the year. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are raising organic net sales guidance from 2% to 4% to 4% to 6% for fiscal 2022.  And before I close, just a couple quick notes on Canopy Growth. Clearly, recent results have been disappointing and there are meaningful near-term challenges facing Canopy and the overall cannabis market in Canada as store openings have been slower than previously anticipated due to the pandemic. However, we continue to believe that the cannabis market represents a significant growth opportunity in the CPG space over the next decade given the predicted U.S market size of roughly 100 billion post-legalization, which is double the size of the spirits market and approaching the size of the beer category. We’re encouraged by Canopy’s innovation agenda, with more than 40 new SKUs launched globally during their recently reported second quarter. In addition, Canopy purchased the right to acquire Wana Brands upon a U.S triggering event which includes U.S federal legalization of cannabis. Wana Brands is the number-one share of the gummy market in Canada with more than 40% market share and the largest multi-market presence in the U.S gummy market. The gummies category is one of the fastest-growing segments in both the U.S and Canadian cannabis markets, accounting for over 70% of all edibles purchased. Wana’s asset-light licensing model approach will allow them to scale quickly in the U.S and provide Canopy a highly-distributed brand upon U.S legalization. In closing, I would like to reiterate our main takeaways from this quarter. Our Beer business continues to deliver impressive performance. Its growth remains ahead of the high-end of the U.S beer market in IRI channels and we now expect to achieve 10% to 11% net sales growth and 6% to 7% operating income growth for fiscal 2022. We remain confident in the robust longer-term growth prospects of our Beer business, and we’re securing our ability to capture the significant value creation opportunity by expanding and optimizing our production capacity over the next four years. Our Wine and Spirits business continues to move toward its long-term revenue growth and margin expansion vision which is further enabled by the clearer strategic focus of its newly-configured fine wine and craft spirits and mainstream and premium teams. And in spite of an ongoing challenging environment, our strong overall total company performance gives us the confidence to increase our comparable basis EPS guidance for the year. We look forward to continuing to build a portfolio of products that consumers love and delivering another strong year of financial performance and shareholder value creation in fiscal 2022. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Garth.
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. Q3 was another quarter of strong execution by our Beer business. This continued strength, coupled with tax favorability enabled us to deliver 8% comparable basis diluted EPS growth for the quarter excluding Canopy. As a result, we have increased and narrowed our full year fiscal 2022 comparable basis diluted EPS target to a range of $10.50 to $10.65 versus our previous guidance of $10.15 to $10.45. This range excludes Canopy equity earnings, includes an increase in Beer operating income guidance, and reflects a decrease in the tax rate for fiscal 2022. Now let’s review our Q3 performance and full year outlook in more detail where I’ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results.  Starting with Beer, net sales increased 4% driven by shipment growth of 3% and favorable price partially offset by unfavorable mix. As a reminder, we are lapping a significant inventory rebuild in Q3 of the prior year which generated 28% shipment growth.  Depletion growth for the quarter came in above 8% driven by the continued strength of Modelo Especial and explosive growth of Corona Extra as well as the continued return to growth in the on-premise channel. Again, keep in mind the difficult volume overlap we encountered during quarter as we faced a 12% depletion growth comparison driven by robust inventory replenishment at the retailer in the prior year. On-premise buying accounted for approximately 12% of the total beer depletions during quarter and grew strong double-digits versus last year. As a reminder, the on-premise accounted for approximately 15% of our beer depletion volume pre-COVID and was only 8% of our depletion volume in Q3 fiscal 2021 as a result of on-premise shutdowns and restrictions due to COVID-19. Selling dates in the quarter were flat year-over-year, and please note that in Q4 there is one additional selling day. Cases shipped exceeded cases depleted as distributor inventory levels began to rebuild during the quarter. Inventories are expected to return to normal levels by the end of the fiscal year as shipment volume is expected to continue to exceed cases depleted for the remainder of the fiscal year. Moving on to Beer margins, Beer operating margin decreased 130 basis points versus prior year to 41.3%. Benefits from favorable pricing and marketing planning were more than offset by unfavorable costs.  The expected increase in COGS was driven by several headwinds that included the following. First, increased material costs due to rising commodity prices and inflationary headwinds that on average are in the mid to high single-digit range predominantly driven by wood pallets, aluminum, steel and cartons. Please note that this range includes the impact of hedging where possible. Second, increased brewery costs driven by labor inflation in Mexico, increased headcount, incremental spend related to capacity expansion, and annual brewery maintenance that was performed during the quarter. As a reminder, the annual brewery maintenance took place during the fourth quarter last fiscal year. And third, a step-up in depreciation expense largely due to the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon completed earlier this fiscal year.  These COGS headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption driven by increased production levels.  Marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 130 basis points to 8% versus prior year as we have returned to our typical spending cadence which is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the fiscal year. In the prior year, a significant amount of marketing spend was shifted from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year due to COVID-19-related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and/or postponements. Additionally, we continue to expect full year spend as a percent of net sales to land in the 9% to 10% range which is in line with fiscal 2021 spend of 9.7% of net sales. For full year fiscal 2022, we now expect net sales growth to land in the 10% to 11% range and operating income growth to land in the 6% to 7% range reflecting continued the strength of our core beer portfolio. As previously communicated, we expect price increases within our beer portfolio to land slightly above our typical 1% to 2% range. However, we anticipate this incremental pricing favorability to be partially offset by unfavorable net sales mix primarily driven by a shift in package types and return of on-premise draft SKUs. We continue to expect our gross margin to be negatively impacted for the fiscal year as benefits from price and cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by cost headwinds predominantly driven by significant step-up in depreciation and increased inflation across numerous cost components as the inflationary environment resulting from economic supply chain and other by-products of the pandemic continues to be dynamic and variable. We now anticipate these elevated inflationary pressures to persist well into fiscal year 2023 and expect inflation on the commodity spend component of direct materials to land on average in the high single-digit to low double-digit range next fiscal year.  We will continue to maintain our disciplined approach to address these evolving conditions through our commodity hedging program, cost saving initiatives, and balanced price adjustments. However, due to a persistent and tough inflationary environment and incremental depreciation driven by our capital expansion plans, operating margins could land below our stated 39% to 40% range in fiscal 2023.  Let me reiterate that these are still best-in-class operating margins within our industry which reflects the strength of our core beer portfolio and efficiencies of our operations. We will continue to refine our outlook for fiscal year 2023 and will provide more details and official guidance during our Q4 earnings call in April. Moving to Wine and Spirits, Q3 fiscal 2022 net sales declined 25% as shipments declined approximately 39%. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales increased 3% driven by shipment growth of approximately 3%. Favorable price, incremental sales of crates to Opus One, and small wine sales, all partially offset by unfavorable mix. Depletions declined approximately 7% during the quarter and continue to be challenged by port delays for our international brands and distributor route-to-market changes in transition markets. Additionally, depletions faced a difficult overlap, especially for our premium and luxury brands which experienced robust growth during Q3 of the prior year. However, we expect depletion growth to accelerate during the fourth quarter driven by the continued strength of our higher-end brands led by The Prisoner Brand family, Meiomi, and Kim Crawford, a robust innovation agenda, and an easier buying overlap versus a year ago. From a shipment perspective, we expect shipment growth for the fourth quarter to decelerate versus Q3 as we continue to right size distributor inventory levels for our mainstream brands.  Moving on to Wine and Spirits margins, operating margin increased 140 basis points to 25.4% as decreased COGS, mix benefits from divestitures, and favorable price were partially offset by increased marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales and unfavorable mix from the existing portfolio. As expected, lower COGS were driven by net favorable fixed cost absorption, lower rate for raw materials, and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by increased transportation costs. The net favorable fixed cost absorption resulted from lapping the unfavorable impact of $20 million in the prior year which was a result of decreased production levels due to the 2020 US wildfires. This benefit for the quarter was partially offset by unfavorable fixed cost absorption resulting from decreased production levels in New Zealand due to a late frost during their harvest season earlier this year. Marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales increased versus the prior year due to the loss of top line leverage resulting from the divestitures. In the prior year, a significant amount of marketing spend was shifted from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year due to COVID-19-related cancellations and/or postponements. As a result, marketing as a percent of net sales for Q4 is expected to be lower than the prior year. For the full year, we expect marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 10% range. For full year fiscal 2022, we now expect net sales and operating income to decline 21% to 22% and 23% to 25%, respectively. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales is now expected to grow in the 4% to 6% range versus our previous guidance of 2% to 4%.  It is important to note that the increase in our top-line guidance is mainly due to incremental shipments to support our route-to-market transition earlier this fiscal year and revenues associated with sales of smoke-tainted bulk wine. Both are one-time in nature and thus, we do not expect them to be repeated in future years. As such, going forward, we remain confident in our medium-term top line growth algorithm for the wine and spirits business 2% to 4%. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2023, we expect significant cost increases for the business including supply chain disruptions, inflationary cost pressures on product, freight, and warehousing costs. However, in order to mitigate some of these cost headwinds, we intend to take incremental price that will be staggered throughout the first half of calendar 2022. We will continue to work through the puts and takes of our full year fiscal 2023 outlook and will provide more details and official guidance during our Q4 earnings call in April. Now let’s proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year to date corporate expenses came in at approximately $162 million, down 6% versus Q3 year-to-date last fiscal year. The decrease was predominantly driven by compensation and benefits due to the reversal of an accrual for performance share units which will not be earned due to not achieving the threshold level of earnings performance from our Canopy investment and a favorable foreign currency event. These tailwinds were partially offset by an increase in consulting services and T&E spend. We now expect full year corporate expenses to approximate $230 million reflecting the year-to-date compensation and benefits favorability. Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 8% to $88 million versus prior year primarily due to lower average borrowings. We expect fiscal 2022 interest expense to land towards the midpoint of our previous guidance range of $355 million to $365 million. Our Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate excluding Canopy equity earnings came in at 14% versus 17.7% in Q3 last year primarily driven by the timing and magnitude of stock-based compensation benefits partially offset by higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses. We now expect our full year fiscal 2022 comparable tax rate excluding Canopy equity earnings to approximate 19.5% versus our previous guidance of 20%. This half-point decrease primarily reflects the impact of increased stock-based compensation tax benefits received during the quarter. Additionally, stock-based compensation tax benefits were weighted toward Q3 versus our previous expectation of Q4 resulting in a sequential rate increase to our implied Q4 tax rate which is now expected to approximate 23%. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated free cash flow of $1.8 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2022 reflecting a 3% increase in operating cash flow offset by an increase in CapEx spending. CapEx spend totaled approximately $600 million which included approximately $500 million of beer CapEx primarily driven by expansion initiatives at our Mexico facilities. Our full year CapEx guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion which includes approximately $900 million targeted for Mexico beer operations expansions remains unchanged. Furthermore, we continue to expect fiscal 2022 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and the CapEx spend previously outlined. As Bill mentioned, our Beer business continues to significantly outperform the U.S beer industry driven by robust consumer demand and it is essential that we invest appropriately to support the expected ongoing growth momentum for our exceptional beer brands. As such, we have updated and increased our brewery expansion investment plans in Mexico. Total capital expenditures for the Beer business are now expected to be $5 billion to $5.5 billion over the fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 time frame with a majority of spend expected to occur in the first three years. In total, this investment will support an incremental 25 million to 30 million hectoliters of additional capacity and includes construction of a new brewery in Southeast Mexico in the state of Veracruz as well as continued expansion and optimization of our existing sites in Nava and Obregon. Please note that this investment includes the previously-disclosed beer CapEx guidance of $700 million to $900 million annually during the fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025 time line to support a 15 million hectoliter buildout between our Nava and Obregon facilities. As a reminder, our existing brewery footprint currently supports 39 million hectoliters between Nava and Obregon.  In closing, I’d like to reiterate our medium-term growth expectations for our Beer business. As Bill and I outlined, we expect continued momentum and thus continue to target top line growth in the 7% to 9% range over the next three to five years which includes one to two points of price and implies buying growth in the mid to high single digit range. This expectation provides us with the conviction to support incremental capital investments in Mexico. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Dara Mohsenian: So on beer depletions, another strong result. It was the best two-year average we’ve seen in recent history. So in regards to Q3, can you discuss the underlying strength behind the business and maybe specifically, the market share performance which we saw improve in track channels? And then also, on a go-forward basis on depletions, how sustainable do you think those trends are? Perhaps give us an update on December. You sounded bullish on fiscal Q4 and any updates specifically on December and any thoughts around Omicron variant impact and if that could pose any risk to your business as we look at the on-premise channel or overall to the business. Thanks.
William Newlands: Sure, we’ll try and up pack that, Dara. Obviously, we had a very, very strong Q3. As you saw, we saw acceleration during in IRI channels during the quarter as both a couple of things happened. First of all, acceleration of our brands; Modelo was up 13% depletions in the IRI take-out was up in the high-teens in the most recent four-week trends. Corona Extra has just been tremendous for us. It’s been great to watch and see that iconic brand do as well as it has. So we’re very excited about both of those. To your question about December, our year-to-date is up almost 9% in depletions, and I’m very pleased to say December was ahead of that trend and certainly it puts us in position to deliver the fourth quarter and the year that we had anticipated. Certainly the COVID scenario is different. You do see more consumers consuming more meals at home than what we probably saw before the start of the pandemic, and you do see a lot of variations depending on the individual market. Clearly, the on-premise is the one that gets nailed in these type of instances, and again, there’s a lot of variability there.  But consumers are going out more than they did certainly a year ago, and we’re all very hopeful that this particular variant of the virus comes and goes more quickly. It certainly appears that those who are heavily vaccinated have had less overall experience and concerns around that, which ultimately should help the entire country and our business as well as people continue to go out in the marketplace. As you know, we have a Chief Medical Officer who continues to guide us on these important topics so that we make sure we not only keep our people safe, but do everything we can to meet consumer needs while we’re at it. So all-in, we think that we hope we’re progressing against that, but we’re very excited about the position we currently hold across our business and certainly are bullish about how the rest of the year and the close of the fiscal is going to go.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen. Your line is open.
Vivien Azer: Hi. Good morning, and happy new year. In your prepared remarks, Garth, you noted that beer pricing is going to be I think you said specifically slightly ahead of your historical average. But as we observe the broader pricing backdrop across beverage alcohol as well as packaged food and beverage, it seems like the consumer is able to absorb a fair bit more pricing than we’ve seen broadly historically. So can you just kind of comment on your appetite to take incremental pricing and perhaps your views around your brand’s price elasticity specifically given your premium pricing? Thank you.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, thanks, Vivien. And as you know, our typical range for price increases on any given year is kind of in that 1% to 2%, so what we do is we go through the year, we’re looking at our portfolio, we’re looking at the competitive set and we’re looking at individual markets. We take our price increases on a brand-by-brand and on a market-by-market basis, and so we do this as I say in a very disciplined approach. Given the current economic environment this year, we’ve determined that we can take more pricing than we typically have, and that’s what’s driving us to say we’re going to be slightly above the 2%. Keep in mind we have to make sure that we’re balancing the right level of price increases with what’s going on with our consumer. As you know, we have a consumer set that skews a bit more Hispanic than some of our competitors, and in times of economic downturn, if you will, or weakness, they tend to get hit a little bit harder and they recover a little bit slower, so we want to make sure we’re not leaving any pricing on the table. We want to take as much as we can but we also don’t want to take so much pricing that we impair the performance of our brands or impair the growth of our brands.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hi. If I could just follow-up, Garth, on that, I think you explained how you take pricing in the market-by-market those sorts of things, but it seems pretty clear from everything that we’re seeing as it relates to inflation that the pricing you have in place now is covering it. But can you maybe just talk a little bit further out? It feels like that’s also likely to be the case for next year, so if you could just give some context on pricing for next year?
Garth Hankinson: Sure, and thanks for the question. Look, we’re in the middle of our annual planning process, and so we’re taking a look at what we think we can cover next year. As you heard in my prepared remarks, we continue to think that inflation is going to be a big factor for us next year and we still intend to take significant amount of pricing. Where that falls within our range that remains to be seen, but that pricing that we do get hit as I said in my script, it’s likely not to cover all of our inflationary headwinds next year, but just like we did this year, we’re going to look at this on a market-by-market basis, brand by brand basis and we’ll take as much pricing as we think the consumer can absorb.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, and happy new year. I actually just wanted to make sure I understand the different puts and takes for beer operating margins next year. You did mention you expect beer of op margins to likely be below your 39% to 40%, so just maybe wanted to make sure we understand the key drivers of this. First, I think you mentioned the higher cost pressures including depreciation expense, so could you guys maybe quantify a few of these buckets further for us? And then should we assume you’ll be able to generate your typical high single-digit Beer top line growth next year, with maybe possibly better-than-planned pricing that you just mentioned partially offset by negative mix. Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, so in general, or not in general, but we are sticking to our long term or mid-term growth outlook that is, so as I said in my script, we continue to target over the next three to five years in Beer to have top line growth in that high single-digit range, and as we’ve said historically, we think the right way to think about our margins is between 39% and 40%. However, we’ve also said that in any given year depending on market dynamics or what’s going on in the business that we could fall above or below that range. So I think what I referenced in my comments is pretty consistent with what the we said previously. We’re still, as I said, we’re still in the process of going through our annual planning process, so we’ll give a more update on margins as we close out the year and move into next year. But it is a tough inflationary environment. As I mentioned, we’re seeing inflationary and commodity pressures that are in the high single-digit to double-digit range, and again, we’ll absorb as much of that as we can with pricing and with a robust cost savings initiatives that we have in both wine and spirits and in beer, and we’ll alter our hedging strategy to take care or to take advantage of weakness in commodity prices as we see some weakness, as we recently have in aluminum and heating oil.  So those are all things that we’ll do to try to offset inflationary pressures, but we’ll have more details on the actual margins and outlook for margins at our Q4 earnings call.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Bryan Spillane: Hi. Good morning, and happy new year. I guess my question is around the brewery, the new brewery in Veracruz and maybe just tying, Garth, back to the 39% to 40% margins over time for Beer. I guess given that the distance that that brewery will sit relative to the border, is there any negative mix implication I guess to margins over time as you begin to produce more beer there, or are there other offsetting factors that would sort of mitigate that?
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, thanks, Bryan. Yeah, so we’re still going through the planning process there, but we do think that there are some offsets. So you’re right, it’s further away from the border than say Obregon or Nava. However, it does open up some really interesting shipping lanes to the Eastern half of the US going across the Gulf of Mexico, so we’re looking at those now to see what the impact is. We also, as we’re thinking about building the brewery up, what products we’re going to put into that brewery and what’s the level of complexity, what brands are we going to put in there, can it be highly efficient so that it offsets any margin impact. So still a lot of work to be done on that. I would expect we will have more details on that in our Q4 earnings call as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Chris Carey: Hi. Good morning. Can you just expand on the Fresca partnership, how it came about, envision the timeline of the rollout? I know you said this year, but pace of rollout and how distributed you think this can get, and whether you envision doing more partnerships with the Coca-Cola Company, can you go outside of the U.S? So just a little bit more perspective. Thanks so much.
William Newlands: Sure, Chris. This particular partnership around the Fresca brand was one that was very exciting to us. Fresca hits on a number of key consumer attributes, everything from convenience to flavor, and is the hottest diet soda in their portfolio. So the idea when you consider that more than 50% of Fresca consumers already mix it with spirits, it seemed like a natural one for us, and certainly, they felt the same way.  So we’re very excited about the potential for this. Obviously it starts in the United States. We’re still putting a lot of finishing touches on exactly how and what this will be as we get later in the year and certainly we’ll give you a lot more information about that as we get closer to the time where we will launch this product. But certainly, this opens a very interesting door and one that’s exciting, I think, for both companies.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Your line is open.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. I know we’ve covered a lot. I wanted to ask about Corona depletions because the brand has had building momentum, getting up to double-digit depletions this quarter. So I think when I’d asked it previously, you didn’t have a great sense for how much of this was driven by on-premise recovery versus the brand performing better in take-home channels, and if it’s the latter, kind of what’s really been driving that change in momentum for the brand. So would love any additional color on that you can offer. Thanks.
William Newlands: Sure, Lauren. We’ve noted a number of things as it relates specifically Corona Extra. First of all, as retailers have begun to address their shelving opportunity, we’ve taken advantage of that and improved our distribution profile versus what it had previously been. Second, our marketing effort is doing extremely well and it has been very, very well-received, and that’s driving consumer demand. So we’re very excited about that particular element. And we’ve said this many, many times before, but it remains as true as it ever has been. Corona is one of the most-loved brands in the beer landscape, so I think one of the things that you’ve seen a little bit of in this particular time frame is that the consumer is returning to many of those iconic brands that they love and trust, and Corona is really at the top of the list. We still saw in off-premise continued growth, as you’ve seen in the IRI channels that that continued to develop. On-premise has not gotten itself all the way back to where it was before the pandemic, but as we’ve always said, on-premise was a little bit smaller in the total profile of the Corona brand than it is for some other industry players. So overall, we couldn’t be more excited about it, and certainly, we’re going to continue the great work and the advertising sector. We have a very robust plan for advertising in the fourth quarter and we’re sure that’s going to continue to bear excellent results for our brands.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Nik Modi: Yeah. Hi. Happy new year. Good morning, everyone. Hey, just a quick follow up, and then my question. Just if you can give some perspective around the double-digit inflation, just kind of some of the builds there and what’s driving that. And then the question is, EBI recently announced they’re going to be launching a Corona non-alc beer, and I was curious if you guys have access to that innovation here in the US given how quickly that segment has been growing. Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, thanks, Nik. I’ll take the first part, and then Bill can respond to the second. So just on the inflationary front, as I mentioned, we’re seeing sort of a wide range of increases year-over-year from kind of low to mid-single-digit for things like corn and hops and glass, which obviously is a big driver of our cost build-up. But then you’re seeing some really large increases on things like cartons, which is up in kind of the mid-teens and wood pallets which is up sort of over 30%. And then there’s a number of other line items that range sort of in between those two bookends. So all of that is driving what we expect to be high single-digit inflation overall across for the beer portfolio.
William Newlands: And Nik, relative to your question about the particular launch, the IP would certainly be available to us in the United States, but keep in mind that the regulatory environment of what you can put in as additives in the United States is very different than it is in Canada and it would remain to be seen whether or not that would fly in the United States. So it’s sort of a yes and a who knows on that particular answer.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein of Evercore. Your line is open.
Robert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. So wondering if you could give us your updated view on the hard seltzer market, and in particular, the interaction between hard seltzers and beer and Corona specifically and maybe further thoughts in terms of where you look to take that business going forward. Thank you.
William Newlands: Obviously, Robert, there was a lot of change in the seltzer business over the course of the last calendar year, and certainly, the growth profile has slowed substantially. We still think that there’s going to be some growth in that particular segment. As you know, we have both reformulated and repackaged some of our variety packs which we’ll be bringing out in the first quarter of 2023. We still think that that’s going to be an important part of the overall beer sector, and we’re going to participate in it.  So we are optimistic that that’s going to continue to see growth, albeit it’s probably significantly lower than what everybody anticipated say a year ago, and so it remains to be seen. Most predictions have proven to be challenging, so we’ll not over-predict the question. What we will say is we think we’re putting the right products in the market that have the right flavor profiles that are going to attract consumers going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean King of UBS. Your line is open.
Sean King: Hey. Good morning. Sort of related to Bryan’s question, but how should we think about the capacity expansion CAGR to 2026 with the long-term beer algorithm? Is it safe to say that the capacity will be exceeding the utilization based on the 7% to 9% growth model, and I guess is incremental capacity typically more flexible or automated because part of your success in this company has been the high utilization of the capacity that you have in place, so just curious on your thoughts on that.
William Newlands: Yeah, certainly. One of the challenges that we’ve also identified in prior calls and it remains true today is we said we want to create some redundant capacity. Some of the challenges that we’ve had is we’ve had some one-off events that have caused us some inventory challenges. We think it would be highly beneficial to have some redundancy in the system and part of our expansion plan not only gets after, as Garth pointed out, high single-digit growth profiles for our business for the foreseeable near-term future, but also gives us some redundancy. So in the event that there are any external factors that are in play, it should have less impact on us going forward. We continue to maintain the 7% to 9% growth profile going forward that we’ve consistently said, and certainly we believe that our brands are going to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. So this is about investing in growth and it’s one of the very best value creation opportunities for our shareholders in our judgment.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy: Great. Hey, good morning, everyone. Bill, I was hoping you could spend a moment on your decision to split the Wine and Spirits segment into fine wine and spirits from mainstream and premium brands. Just the factors driving that decision, how you expect it to drive improved results. And then more broadly, taking a step back, your openness to further divestitures through this reorganization, not drive the results you’re looking for in the segment? Thank you.
William Newlands: So I think our thinking around that was in many instances, it’s very different approaches to how the consumer buys and engages with the fine wine and craft spirits sector. That area tends to be higher DTC. It tends to be higher on-premise, and in many cases it’s a little bit of a different skill set. And we realized by segregating those two things, it would give us a chance to both maximize the potential in the mainstream and premium sector as well as maximizing our potential at the very high-end where some of those different and evolving channels are becoming more and more important to us. I think both understand our strategy which is we want to grow our business, we want to improve our margin position to best of class margin structures, and we’re well on our way to doing that. But our view was this was an opportunity to maximize the potential to do that. It also matches up very nicely with how many of our distributors go-to-market where they separate their portfolio and their sales organizations in fine wine and craft sectors and mainstream and premium. So it also matches our organization with the route-to-market approach that many of our distributors take.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Steve Powers: Hey, thanks, everybody, and good morning. Maybe circling back on Bonnie and Bryan’s earlier line of questioning on Beer margins and just round it out, if I could; as depreciation presumably ramps further alongside the CapEx build over the next few years, do you think you can get back to that consistent 39% to 40% range beyond fiscal 2023 as you catch up on the current inflation dynamics, or is there a risk that the depreciation build could keep you at least toward the lower end of that range for the next couple years. That’s just kind of a follow-up, clean-up? And then I guess relatedly, as the incremental CapEx commitment just runs through the cash flow statement, just any commentary you have on how you think about capital allocation in terms of how it may impact M&A or further return of shareholders over the next couple years alongside that ramp. Thank you.
William Newlands: You bet, Steve. Garth and I have been very consistent about this now for years, quite frankly, of saying 39% to 40% is what we expect to do on a consistent basis. There will be individual years and times where we exceed that when things go in our favor, and there may be occasions where based on certain headwinds we fall slightly below that. But as Garth in fact pointed out earlier today, these remain best of class margins and we very strongly believe 39% to 40% is a very appropriate long-term algorithm for this business.
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, and just to put a final point on that, as I said, you’re right, depreciation will ramp up but we’re going through the process right now. We’re looking at the impacts of what’s the right sort of capacity to have or capabilities to have in our breweries and optimizing that. We’re looking at optimizing our transportation. So to the extent that we have any news on that, then we’ll share it with you at our Q4 earnings call. As related to capital allocation, with this increased investment, nothing changes. We continue to have the best portfolio in terms of growth and in terms of margins. That growth and margins generates a significant amount of cash flow. That cash flow allows us to continue to prioritize investment grade rating, return capital to shareholders, and to invest in the growth of our business. So our capital allocation strategy hasn’t changed.  And then the last piece of that is acquisitions, and we continue to say that acquisitions will be used as a portfolio gap filler, and in large part, we’re going to use our venture fund to fill those gaps.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Nadine Sarwat of Bernstein. Your line is open.
Nadine Sarwat: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Two quick follow-ups, if I may. First regarding the Fresca agreement, could you give us a sense of the economics of the agreement, what would the impact on margins be, and what edge do you think you and Coke can bring into win in an already-crowded space.  And then the second one on Pacifico. I know you mentioned brown glass bottles. What sort of initiatives do you have in place to mitigate this negative impact, and when can we expect Pacifico to return to its previous growth profile? Thank you.
William Newlands: Sure. Relative to the brand, we will be buying concentrate from the Coca-Cola Company and manufacturing, marketing and selling that brand through our network. We’re very excited about it, frankly, because of the strength of the Fresca brand. It’s, as I said earlier, it’s a growing brand. It’s a brand that’s already used. More than 50% of the users use it as a mix with an alcoholic beverage. We think it’s a natural play while also recognizing the low-cal and great flavor characteristics of that individual brand. So we’re very excited about that. We are making progress on brown glass. I think it remains to be seen when we will be back to full competition and obviously it had some bearing on our ability to deliver in the quarter. As we said, brown glass has been a drag against otherwise outstanding results. We expect as we get into the new fiscal year that that will balance out quite a bit and that we will see Pacifico get back to the double-digit growth profile that we’ve enjoyed for the last several years.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrea Teixeira: Happy new year. Just to ask the margin question a little bit different, if I may. Given the new top line depreciation, why not giving guidance on an EBITDA basis?  And related to that, can you please unpack the Beer operating margin assumption for next year landing below 39? If you’re assuming no additional pricing which you normally take I believe October/November and it only would impact the fourth quarter of 2023, and then if there’s any nonrecurring impacts of the depreciation of that on any of the hedges. And as a follow-up on the guidance for fiscal fourth quarter, I don’t think you’re implying any impact of the new variant above and beyond what you were expecting, so but if you can give us comfort on what you’re seeing on the trade and the ability for the distributors to get the beer on shelf and also on-premise. Appreciate those commentary.
William Newlands: Let me answer the second part first, and I’ll have Garth answer the first. As we said, we have had a very strong start to our fourth quarter. Our depletions in the Beer business are up ahead of our year-to-date trends in the month of December, and we feel very comfortable and confident in our ability to deliver what we’ve said around fourth quarter and the overall fiscal year.  Garth, do you care to take the first one?
Garth Hankinson: Yeah, so just on the EBITDA point. Yeah, so of all, that’s a good point. It’s actually something that we think about, do we want to provide that level of detail, very much in a frontal up-front way. Again, as we go through sort of the planning process here and we look at the impacts of inflation, we look at the impact of depreciation, we look at the effects of our capacity expansion to the extent that we think that’s a meaningful way to show our financial results, then we will add it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim. Your line is open. Please make sure your phone isn’t on mute.
Laurent Grandet: Oh, sorry. Sorry. Good morning, everyone, and wishing you all a very happy new year. I’d like to talk back on Fresca. I mean, first, will that be reported that brand will be reporting to the Spirits or Wine and Spirits segment or Beer segment? And at what level of margin should we think of, should we be concerned about the level of marketing you would have to spend to launch the brand? I remember you said to launch Corona Seltzer which was a much more known brand, you have to spend about $14 million. So I’d like to understand a bit more about the margin we should think of for that brand.
Garth Hankinson: Well, relative to the whole Fresca story, we will bring that to you in our next earnings scenario when we are much further along on the exact launch planning and launch timing, and we’ll give you a more fulsome view of what we plan to do. What we would say, as we said in our release today, this will be going through our distribution network which will largely be driven by the gold network on the beer side and in some states it will go through the wine and spirits network, depending on the regulatory environment of the particular state.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference. I’d like to turn the call over to Bill Newlands for any closing remarks.
William Newlands: Thank you, everyone. Appreciate your joining our call today. Despite the challenges faced thus far driven by the continued effects of the pandemic, some global chain issues, and a volatile and dynamic inflationary environment combined with severe weather events, we’re on track to deliver again another strong year of financial performance. Our Beer business continues to remain extremely solid as consumer demand for our core beer brands continues to be robust, while our incremental capacity investments in Mexico will position us to capture the ongoing growth opportunities we see within the higher-end of the U.S beer market well into the future.  Additionally, our Wine and Spirits business continues to move towards its long-term revenue growth and margin expansion vision. Overall, we remain bullish on the future performance of our powerful selection of consumer-connected brands which provides us with strong momentum as we head into the fourth quarter.  As a reminder, during our next quarterly call, we’ll be providing our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. So thanks again, everyone, for joining the call, and I wish you all a safe, happy, and prosperous new year. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2021-10-06 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands Q2 Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Josh and good morning and welcome to Constellation's second quarter fiscal 2022 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now, here's Bill.
William Newlands: Thank you Patty. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter call. Let's dive right into a discussion about the quarter. There were a number of puts and takes impacting our results in Q2 and Garth and I will spend time walking through them. However, the fundamentals of our business remains solid and consumer demand for our brands particularly our core beer portfolio remains strong. This gives us confidence to increase our EPS guidance for the year which we outlined in our press release earlier today and Garth will review in more detail shortly. In addition, we repurchased a significant number of shares in Q2 at prices that are favorable as we believe Constellation’s stock is undervalued at current levels. We've received some feedback from investors on this topic in recent weeks and we will address key themes that emerge from these discussions in our remarks.  As we walk through our Q2 performance and outlook for the remainder of the year there are several key takeaways we would ask you to keep in mind. Number one, the momentum of our core imported beer brands provides a point of competitive strength versus industry peers as we are the leading share gainer in the high end of the U.S. beer market. The majority of our growth continues to be driven by Modelo Especial supported by strong consumer demand for Corona Extra and Pacifico and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. We continue to believe that Modelo Especial in particular has a long runway for growth given the steadily increasing household penetration for this brand among non-Hispanic consumers and continued strong velocity.  Now we've admittedly had some supply challenges this fiscal year driven by several external factors, the most relevant being the ongoing robust demand for our beer brands. We do expect to return to more normal inventory levels by the end of Q4. Despite these challenges we continue to be on track to deliver a better than expected year for our beer business. In fact, our strong performance today gives us the confidence to increase guidance for our beer business as we now expect to achieve 9% to 11% net sales growth and 4% to 6% operating income growth for fiscal 2022. Our view is reinforced by recent 12 week IRI trends showing the Constellation’s beer business is significantly outpacing the high end and total U.S. beer industry.  Point two, as it relates to our Hard Seltzer business and building off our last point, we are unique in our position versus our competitors in this space as our primary growth is coming from our core beer portfolio and we're not reliant on the growth of Hard Seltzer and ABA’s to achieve the medium term growth goals for our beer business. The Hard Seltzer landscape has shifted considerably in recent months therefore we've lowered our growth expectations for Corona Hard Seltzer resulting in a sizeable obsolescence charge taken for Q2 which includes our view of the total impact for the fiscal year. But let's be clear, we continue to see the Hard Seltzer and broader ABA space as a meaningful sector in the beer market and we continue to believe it's important to participate in and gain our fair share in this segment to complement the growth of our core imported beer portfolio and to maintain our position as a leader in the high-end of the U.S. beer market. Going forward we plan to focus on competing in this space in ways where we offer meaningful points of differentiation and unique value to consumers. I'll have more to say on this topic in a moment.  Number three, while our wine and spirits business was challenged in the quarter by underperformance of several mainstream brands due to tough COVID comparisons, our recent route to market transition and supply chain challenges for our imported wine brands we continue to see the benefits of our premiumization strategy take hold. We are performing well in the high-end of the wine segment which represents the vast majority of expected industry growth over the next several years and we continue to strengthen our capabilities in emerging growth channels key to long-term success such as e-commerce and DTC.  Number four, we continue to enhance our approach to innovation with a more consistent, strategic, disciplined, and consumer led approach with a focus on high growth segments aligned with consumer trends. Our innovation agenda is designed to complement our organic growth and we're developing sustainable products that are incremental to our business while further premiumizing our portfolio into margin accretive price points. Over the years we've been able to extend some of our brands into new spaces recruiting new drinkers and expanding occasions and we've achieved a healthy balance between both from the core and from innovation.  Number five, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged since I assumed the role of CEO almost three years ago. Since then we've made significant progress in reducing debt and achieving our goal of returning 5 billion in value to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2023 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. In fact, to date this fiscal year we have repurchased 1.4 billion of our shares and when combined with our dividend we have achieved nearly 60% of our 5 billion goal. To be clear, our shareholder value equation is based on outsized growth combined with return of dollars to shareholders. One of the most important capital allocation priorities is to continue reinvesting in our beer business to keep up with robust demand for our products. Despite initial challenges associated with the build out of a third brewery in Mexico, we have moved on to other capacity alternatives in the country. Our expansions in Nava and Obregon helped ensure we have adequate production capacity for the medium-term and will create much needed redundant capacity that better enables us to manage through unexpected events like we've experienced these past two years. We continue to work with the Mexican government to solidify plans for a new brewery in Southeastern Mexico with adequate water supply and an available talented workforce.  Now let's move on to a more fulsome discussion about our performance within the quarter. During the quarter the McDowell brand family posted depletion growth of 17% for the quarter and single handedly drove total import share gains in the IRI channels on a dollar basis. As the number two beer brand in dollar sales in the entire U.S. beer category, Modelo Especial is the only major beer brand growing household penetration and is leading the way as the number one share gainer among high end brands. Modelo Chelada has become the number two brand family in the Chelada space posting depletion growth of more than 50% for the second quarter. Corona Extra continues its growth trajectory as the second best to share gainer and the number one loved brand in the import category driven by a return to growth in the on premise which currently represents approximately 11% of our beer business brand.  In addition to the comments I made earlier about our Hard Seltzers I'd like to discuss industry trends and our refreshed approach to this sector of the beer market going forward. In the short to medium term we believe that there will be consolidation within the Hard Seltzer/ABA space primarily due to the chaos of skew and brand proliferation with too many new entrants that don't have the velocity or consumer demand to warrant shelf space. We also believe this sub category will evolve beyond low calorie, low carb offerings and open up to more distinctive consumer value propositions that include things like more flavor, different alcohol bases, and functional benefits. We've already started to innovate in this way with distinct products like Refresca and Limonada. We've also discovered that consumers are looking for more robust taste and flavor in their Seltzers. As a result, we will be altering the flavor and taste profile of our Seltzer portfolio to better align with the changing consumer preferences while also introducing single serve packages to better serve the growing convenience channel, our largest trade channel. And we have a solid line up of innovation that we have yet to introduce.  We have several great examples of our innovation strategy at work within our wine and spirits portfolio. This business continues to drive growth from recently launched innovations including Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon, Kim Crawford Illuminate, the Prisoner Cabernet and Chardonnay all of which are amongst the top 10 innovations across high-end wine in IRI channels during the quarter. And our wine and spirits innovation pipeline is ready to go with further consumer led new products as we head into our peak selling period including the expansion of our Svedka Ready to Drink platform and the introduction of Woodbridge Wine Seltzer’s and boxed wines.  In addition to driving growth through innovation we're making progress with our core wine and spirits portfolio despite the previously mentioned challenges. We continue to take pride to further premiumize our mainstream portfolio as these steps are critical to maintain brand equity and to improve profitability which will serve our brands well over the long-term. We're putting points on the board in a number of areas where we're outperforming the U.S. wine market. Our high-end super premium plus portfolio grew net sales double-digits during the quarter. In on premise channels our investments are paying off with enhanced wine offerings at major restaurant chains. We're thriving in critical emerging channels like three-tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer which continued to drive high-end growth where we are outpacing category performance at key accounts such as Instacart, Amazon, and Albertsons with the resurgence of online shopping due to the COVID pandemic. For example, Constellation’s fine wine share has expanded significantly in the latest 12 weeks due to the robust growth of the Prisoner on Instacart and Robert Mondavi Winery online.com. In fact, e-commerce and DTC sales are up nearly three to four times versus 2019 and they comprise roughly 3% to 5% of our business versus 1% pre-pandemic. Going forward we will continue to focus on becoming a category leader in e-commerce and DTC as we believe these channels will make up a significant portion of our mix over time and will continue to be an opportunity for high-end growth.  I would also like to provide you an update on our U.S. harvest which is about 70% complete at this point well while our production facilities, wineries, and tasting rooms remain untouched by recent wildfire activity. This quarter our ventures activities included investments in adaptogen infused Hop Wtr and Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston's artisanal Dos Hombres mezcal. Hop Wtr is a non-alcoholic calorie free sparkling water infused with adaptogens and nootropics to provide the perfect balance of function and flavor for health conscious consumers. The non-alcoholic segment of total beverage alcohol grew almost 40% in 2020 in dollar sales through IRI channels and according to IWSR research 60% of consumers are switching between non-alcoholic or low-alcoholic and full strength drinks within the same occasion. Dos Hombres is an award winning hand crafted mezcal brand created by breaking bad co-stars who have developed an exceptional liquid that receives frequent praise from both the industry and consumers. The overall U.S. mescal category grew 14% in 2020 according to IWSR and super premium mezcal priced above $30 per bottle is projected to be the largest and fastest growing segment within the category.  Moving on to Canopy growth. We're encouraged by the recent introduction of the cannabis opportunity in Administration Act draft bill which was introduced by Senators Booker, Wyden, and Schumer in July. More than 90% of Americans are in favor of cannabis legislation for medical purposes and two thirds of those are in favor of legalizing for recreational use as well. In fact, nearly two out of three Americans already have legal cannabis access as 37 states have legalized for medical use and 18 states for adult use. While we're optimistic about Federal Legislation within this Congress, Canopy is now waiting for this reality to materialize. Canopy’s U.S. business grew 91% year-over-year in the most recent quarter driven by robust consumer demand for their CBD and CBG products including Martha Stewart branded products, quarto  beverages, storage and baked  products, and BioSteel's new RTDs. Over the coming years revenue for Canopy’s U.S. business is expected to grow significantly as it benefits from increasing distribution and new product introductions. Once THC permissibility becomes a reality in the U.S. Canopy expects their U.S. business to make a substantially greater contribution to their results. Canopy has scaled in multi-state route to market plan ready for legalization and has leveraged Constellation's distributor relationships to fuel their U.S. non-PHD business with more opportunities in a world post Federal permissibility. Overall we're comfortable with Canopy’s progress and we're looking forward to the growth and legalization prospects for the business.  In closing I'd like to reiterate our main takeaways for this quarter. First, continued strong demand for our core imported beer brands provides a point of competitive strength versus industry peers led by their number one share gainer in the beer category Modelo Especial which we feel has ample runway for growth well into the future given the steadily increasing household penetration rates among non-Hispanic consumers and continued strong velocity. The short-term supply disruption to our imported beer business does nothing to dampen our long-term prospects as we expect to return to more normal inventory levels by the end of Q4 and we're on track to deliver a better than expected year for our beer business.  Second, we continue to see the Hard Seltzer and broader ABA space as a meaningful sector within the beer market. Going forward we plan to focus on competing in this space in ways where we can offer meaningful points of differentiation in unique value to consumers and we have some upcoming innovation in this space that we're optimistic about. Number three, we continue to see benefits of our wine and spirits premiumization strategy take hold. We are performing well in the higher-end of the wine segment and we continue to strengthen our capabilities in emerging growth channels key to long-term success such as e-commerce and DTC. Four, we continue to enhance our approach to innovation with a more consistent, disciplined, and consumer led approach focused on high growth segments aligned with consumer trends to complement our organic growth while developing sustainable products that are incremental to our business at margin accretive price points. And fifth and certainly not least, our shareholder value equation continues to be based on the outsized growth combined with the return of dollars to shareholders and let me reiterate our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged.  We remain committed to our goal of returning 5 billion in value to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2023 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Our strong operational performance and cash flow generation allowed us to make significant share repurchases in Q2 aligned with our commitment which contributed to the increase in our EPS guidance for the year. At the same time, we remain committed to continuing to reinvest in our business with an emphasis on our beer business to keep up with the robust demand for our products. And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Garth who will review our financial results in the quarter. Garth. 
Garth Hankinson: Thank you Bill and hello everyone. Q2 certainly reflected another strong quarter of marketplace performance for our beer business. Due to continued robust consumer demand for core beer portfolio we now expect to exceed our initial top line and operating income targets for our beer business. Additionally, our strong cash flow generation enabled us to continue to repurchase shares during the quarter and through September we've repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock for $1.4 billion. As a result, we have increased our full year fiscal 2022 comparable basis diluted EPS target and we now expect to be in the range of $10.15 to $10.45. This range excludes Canopy equity and earnings impact and reflects the increase in beer operating income guidance and decrease in the average -- in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding based on shares repurchased through September partially offset by an increase in the tax rate for fiscal year 2022.  Now let's review future performance and our full year outlook in more detail where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer, net sales increased 14% driven by shipment volume growth of nearly 12% and favorable price partially offset by unfavorable mix. Depletion volume growth for the quarter came in above 7% driven by the continued strength of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra as well as the continued return to growth in the on premise channel. Depletion trends tempered in Q2 versus Q1 driven by out of stocks due to ongoing robust consumer demand as well lost shipping days for some of our distributors due to severe weather events including hurricanes and wildfires. We estimate that these factors hampered Q2 growth by approximately two to three points.  As Bill mentioned on premise volume accounted for approximately 11% of the total beer depletions during the quarter and grew strong double digits versus last year. As a reminder, the on premise accounted for approximately 15% of our beer depletion volume pre-COVID and accounted for only 6% of our depletion volume in Q2 fiscal 2021 as a result of the on premise shutdowns and restrictions due to COVID-19. Selling days in the quarter were flat year-over-year and will also be flat in Q3. Wholesaler depletions continued to outpace cases shipped during Q2 resulting in a lower than normal distributor inventory on hand at the end of the quarter. To rectify this gap, shipment case volume is expected to exceed depletion case volume throughout the second half of the fiscal year resulting in a gradual improvement of distributor inventories during Q3 and Q4 as inventories are expected to return to normal levels by the end of the fiscal year.  Moving on to beer margins. Beer operating margin decreased 530 basis points versus the prior year to 37.2%. Benefits from favorable pricing, mix, and foreign currency were more than offset by unfavorable COGS, increased marketing investments, and higher SG&A. The increase in COGS was driven by several headwinds that include the following. First, a Q2 obsolescence charge of $66 million. As a result of our production constraints earlier in the year we pre-built Hard Seltzer inventory in advance of the key summer selling season based on our best estimates for fiscal year 2022. Due to the overall slowdown in the Hard Seltzer category in the U.S. some of that growth is not going to materialize in the fiscal year resulting in excess inventory. Second, increased brewery cost driven by labor inflation in Mexico, increased headcount, and incremental spend related to capacity expansion. Third, a step up in depreciation expense largely due to incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon. And finally, as expected increased material costs predominately driven by increased commodity prices and inflationary headwinds on pallets, cartons, and aluminum. These COGS headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption.  Marketing a percent of net sales increased 150 basis points to 9.9 versus prior year as we return to our typical spending cadence which is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, marketing spend in the first half of the prior year was significantly muted resulting from COVID-19 related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and/or postponements. Lastly, the increase in SG&A was primarily driven by an increase of approximately $12 million in legal expenses as well as higher compensation and benefits. As mentioned earlier, we are increasing full year fiscal 2022 net sales and operating income guidance for our beer business. We are now targeting net sales growth of 9% to 11% reflecting the strength of our core beer portfolio and pricing actions that are higher than initially planned. Furthermore, we are now targeting operating income growth of 4% to 6% which implies operating margin in the low to mid-point of our stated 39% to 40% range. Please note that the updated guidance includes all obsolescence charges and legal expenses incurred in the first half of the fiscal year.  We continue to expect our gross margin to be negatively impacted for the fiscal year as benefits from price and our cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by several cost headwinds. However, the mix and magnitude of these headwinds have changed from our original assumptions presented at the beginning of our fiscal year. First, we're still estimating a significant step up in depreciation expense which began to accelerate in Q2. However, some of this depreciation started late which began to accelerate in Q2. However, some of this depreciation started later in the year versus plan. As such we are now estimating total beer depreciation expense to approximate $250 million, an increase of approximately $55 million versus last year or a $10 million decrease versus our original planned estimate.  Second, we still expect substantial inflationary headwinds across numerous cost components to continue during the second half of our fiscal year as commodity prices continue to rise specifically across aluminum, diesel, and pallets resulting from a rather volatile inflationary market. And third, due to the growth moderation within the Hard Seltzer market as well as lower ACB levels across the category on new items, we do not expect our Hard Seltzer skews to meet our originally planned volume expectations which results in a positive mix benefit versus our original estimate. Conversely due to the slowdown in the Hard Seltzer sector excess inventory resulted in a fiscal year-to-date obsolescence charge of approximately $80 million. Please note that these losses cover our Hard Seltzer obsolescence exposure and as such we do not expect to take any additional obsolete charges in the back half of the fiscal year for Hard Seltzers. From a marketing perspective we continue to expect full year spend as a percentage of net sales planned in the 9% to 10% range which is in line with fiscal 2021 spend of 9.7% of net sales.  Looking ahead to Q3 I'd like to remind everyone of the difficult buying overlaps we will encounter as we're facing a 28% and 12% growth comparison for shipment volume and depletion volume respectively. Additionally, we expect to reform our normal annual brewery maintenance during Q3 which will result in a less throughput versus Q2 as we have to shut down production for a few days. As such we are estimating low single digit shipment volume growth for Q3.  Moving to wine experience, Q2 fiscal 2022 net sales declined 18% on shipment volume down to 36%. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales increased 15% driven by organic shipment volume growth of nearly 6%, favorable mix and price, and smoke tainted bulk wine sales. Robust mix driven by the Prisoner brand family Meiomi and Kim Crawford accounted for approximately nine points of the year-over-year organic net sales growth. Shipments were negatively impacted by port delays for our international brands and route to market changes which also impacted depletions. Depletion volume declined 2% during the quarter and was additionally impacted by the challenging overlap in consumer pantry loading behavior especially for our mainstream brands that experienced robust growth during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as we head into the second half of the fiscal year we feel as though most of these challenges are behind us and expect shipment volume and depletion volume to generally align in the second half of fiscal 2022.  Moving on to wine and spirits margins. Operating margin decreased 620 basis points to 19.7% as mixed benefits from the existing portfolio and divestitures combined with favorable price were more than offset by increased marketing and SG&A spend, higher COGS, and margin dilutive smoke tainted bulk wine sales. Higher COGS were driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption and increased transportation costs. The unfavorable fixed cost absorption resulted from decreased production levels in New Zealand due to a frost during our harvest season earlier this year as well as decreased production levels at our wineries in California due to the 2020 U.S. wildfires. These headwinds were partially offset by lower grade raw materials and other cost savings initiatives. Keep in mind that we're lapping lower SG&A spend in Q2 fiscal 2021 due to COVID and have a smaller business post the divestitures resulting in significant marketing and SG&A deleveraging impacting operating margins.  For full year fiscal 2022, the wine and spirits business continues to expect net sales and operating income to decline 22% to 24% and 23% to 25% respectively. This implies operating margins to approximate 24% which is flattish to prior year on a reported basis which shows significant margin expansion on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures, organic net sales is expected to grow in the 2% to 4% range. From a Q3 perspective keep in mind that we are lapping unfavorable fixed cost absorption of $20 million in the prior year resulting from decreased production levels as a result of the 2020 U.S. wildfires. We expect this favorable overlap to be partially offset by a continued increase in transportation costs and incremental unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to the New Zealand frost. Also, we continue to expect marketing and SG&A deleveraging as a result of the wine and spirits divestitures. As such we expect marketing and SG&A to continue to be a significant drag to operating margins in Q3 fiscal 2022.  Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in approximately $170 million up 7% versus last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by higher consulting services and compensation benefits, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact. We now expect full year corporate expenses to approximate $245 million driven by increase in compensation and benefits. Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 4% to approximately 96 million versus prior year primarily due to lower average borrowings. We now expect fiscal 2022 interest expense to be in the range of $355 million to $365 million. This slight decrease versus our previous guidance reflects early redemption of higher interest rate debt as well as $1 billion of senior notes issued in July at attractive rates.  Our Q2 comparable basis affected tax rate excluding Canopy equity earnings came in at 21.8% versus 16.9% in Q2 of last year primarily driven by the timing of stock based compensation benefits and higher effective tax rate on our foreign businesses. We now expect our full year fiscal 2022 comparable tax rate excluding Canopy equity earnings to approximate 20% versus our previous guidance of 19%. This increase is primarily due to a higher effective tax rate on our core earnings than originally estimated. I would also note that we expect stock based compensation tax benefits to be weighted towards Q4. As a result, we expect our Q3 tax rate to be higher than our full year estimate at approximate 21%. We also now expect our 2022 weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate 192 million reflecting an impact of our September year-to-date share purchases previously discussed.  Moving to free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CAPEX, we generated free cash flow of 1.2 billion for the first half of fiscal 2022 which is flat to prior year reflecting strong operating cash flows offset by an increase in CAPEX. CAPEX totaled $353 million which included approximately $295 million of beer CAPEX primarily driven by expansion initiatives at our Mexico facilities. Our full year CAPEX guidance of 1 billion to 1.1 billion which includes approximately 900 million targeted for Mexican beer operation expansions remains unchanged. Furthermore, we continue to expect fiscal 2022 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, this reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and the CAPEX spend previously outlined.  In closing I want to iterate that while we had our fair share of challenges during the first half of our fiscal year resulting in several puts and takes impacting our results, the fundamentals of our business remains strong and consumer demand for our products particularly our imported beer portfolio remains robust providing us with strong momentum as we head into the second half of our fiscal year. And with that Bill and I are happy to take your questions. 
Operator: . Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. 
Dara Mohsenian: Hey guys, so on the beer topline front, first just a detailed question given the volatility here and the tough comp in Q3, can you give us an update on how September depletions are trending so far and also for the quarter are you expecting depletions to still be above that low single-digit shipment rate that you mentioned or is that tough with the difficult 12% depletion comp? And then second, the longer term question is, you raised your revenue guidance for this year how much of that is underlying demand strength and depletions maybe versus shipments and perhaps getting more supply into the balance of the year versus pricing and on the pricing front you've sounded more aggressive in terms of pricing expectations going forward publicly, a) I guess, is that correct and b) is that more just to combat higher commodity costs or is it more confidence in market share gains or that the consumer environment is conducive to taking pricing care? Thanks. 
William Newlands: Sure, Dara. Let me take a swing at that and if I miss anything Garth can fill in behind. So relative to depletes in September, we expect those to be fairly consistent with year-to-date trends. We're just about wrapped up for September. Keeping in mind that's going against the 20% increase that we had during September of last year. So, that's a pretty powerful start to the quarter. We do expect that depletions are going to continue to be above shipments for the reasons that Garth noted in his remarks. So we would expect that depletions would be above it for that window of time. The pricing environment remains relatively strong. As we've said, we expect to be slightly ahead of our usual algorithm driven more by taking to pricing on some skews that we had not anticipated earlier in the year, more than we're doing anything unique to take additional pricing where we -- over what we had already planned. Garth anything you want to add to that? 
Garth Hankinson: No, I will just say on the depletions for the quarter, depletion growth will absolutely outpace shipment growth in the quarter. But on an absolute basis, the shipments will outpace depletions which helps us get into a better position from an inventory perspective. 
William Newlands: Yes, keep in mind, as we've said, we have our inventory levels at our distributors below what we would like to see and what they would like to see on an ongoing basis. So we would be expecting to fill some of that as we get our inventory levels back to normal position by the end of the fiscal year. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. 
Bonnie Herzog: Hi, thank you. I actually had a question on your guidance as well. I just -- in thinking through it and thinking about the mid points of your new beer guidance for the full year, this does imply a pretty big step down in the second half. For instance, your new guidance implies around 4% to 4.5% beer shipment volume growth, 3% off income growth, and then beer margins of 39% for the second half, and that compares to your beer margins of 40% in the first half, which did include the $80 million obsolescence charge that you pulled out. So, I guess, I'm trying to understand your level of conservatism with your new FY guidance especially with margins given you mentioned there's going to be no more charges in the second half. You highlighted you plan to take in incremental pricing and then there are a few other net positives Garth that you called out. So just wanted to make sure I'm not missing anything or maybe what’s changed there? Thanks. 
Garth Hankinson: Thanks, Bonnie. I mean look let me try to give you the walk on margins right and you noticed -- as you noted, we've got some headwinds and we've got some tailwinds, right. And so just on the tailwinds, obviously, we said in my opening remarks we've got a bit of a benefit on depreciation just starting later than expected in the year and so that's a net positive. As Bill just articulated, we're taking more -- we're taking increased pricing across more skews than we had originally planned, so we'll be above our range there. So that's a net positive. We also have a mix benefit of Seltzers and again a net positive there and then the increase in core beer outlook is a net positive. So, those are all the headwinds. But we still have -- those are all the tailwinds. But we still have the headwinds that we've been talking about all year long, right. So, even though depreciation is coming in less than expected, we still have an uptick in depreciation in the second half of the year. We still are facing increase in commodity prices, including aluminum, diesel, natural gas, wood those will continue in the second half of the year. Now we think that the guidance we provided takes into account all of those cost increases, so we feel we have those covered. But again, I mean, we just continue to have these puts and takes and we feel confident that in the margin outlook that we provided. Keep in mind too that even though we're going to have a mix benefit from Seltzers, we still are going to sell Seltzers and those are margin dilutive as we've noted previously. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. 
Nik Modi: Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. So, I have two questions. One is a real quick one, just on the self-service formulation, still a bit -- I know you probably don't want provide too many details until it is in the market, but will this change the calorie or the sugar levels, so just curious on that? And then my broader question is Modelo is clearly doing very well. We see that in the data with non-Hispanic consumers. But as we look at some of the numerator data and we look at different cohorts, what we notice is that Corona has kind of leveraged to some of these demographics, so Modelo is doing much better so we are seeing some of those numbers in period. So just wanted to get a sense on incrementality of Modelo when you think about Modelo and Corona together and do you ever think that maybe there's a different merchandising scheme you can use instead of putting both brands right next to one another to kind of reduce some of that cannibalization?
William Newlands: Sure. So relative to your first quick point there won't be radical change in the core formulation of our Seltzer layout. Relative to Modelo and Corona, obviously, there's interaction between those two brands as you would expect. However, as we've said before, Nik, and I'm sure you're quite familiar our household penetration on Modelo is still significantly below where Corona is to say nothing of it is below other brands that it competes against. So while it is a true statement that as Modelo grows or as Corona grows it does eat into some of our brands, we still see it as largely positive as we see that growth profile. And as we have talked before, Modelo, it continues to grow velocity, there's a lot -- still a lot of runway to expand distribution. Household penetration which I touched on just a second ago, remains a massive opportunity for that. And we only started advertising to the non-Hispanic community about three and half years ago. So, we're really just getting started on Modelo and the opportunity that presents itself there. So, well you continue to see some interaction and clearly, I think, the idea of separating those at retail to some degree has some opportunity. I think overall, we're still focused on expanding our presence of both of those brands. As you probably saw Corona Extra had a very good quarter. And it just shows the ongoing strength of the core Corona franchise in addition to exceptional performance by Modelo. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. 
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. I wanted to know a little bit about Corona Extra since you called out the 5% depletion growth for that brand and how that kind of shakes out between on premise recovery versus track channels or sorry, I should say I'm off premise? And then I was hoping you could also talk a little bit at Nielsen /IRI versus what you guys saw in terms of off premise trends in total, including on track outlets? And then finally, do any kind of update on Pacifico, just continually intrigued to hear about progress you are making with that brand? Thanks. 
William Newlands: Sure. So probably 50% give or take of the growth profile that we saw in Corona Extra is the reopening of the on premise. As we said in prior calls, we were down as low as 3% of our business a few quarters ago during the sort of the peak of the initial COVID pandemic issue. That's now up to 11% and clearly with the Corona being one of the most loved brands that exist in the category, the increase that you would expect to see an on premise has been important. But don't underestimate, Corona actually has done very well at retail as well. Relative to Pacifico, we continue to feel like Pacifico is another great opportunity. It's like a baby Modelo. It's developing in a very similar way to what Modelo did say 20 years ago with extensive growth profile on the West Coast and it is starting to filter East. As you know, we're investing more against Pacifico than we have historically. We have a little bit of challenge in this quarter with Brown Glass, which had some impact on Pacifico during the quarter as it did with Modelo Negra as well. But those are ongoing supply chain challenges that we're working our way through. It does nothing, nothing to slow down what we expect to be another superb brand for us as time goes forward in Pacifico. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed with your question. 
Chris Carey: Hi, thank you very much. Just on Hard Seltzers. You had originally planned on investing pretty significantly behind the launch this year. Are you getting any savings from those investment plans now that the category has slowed or are those locked and presumably that can be a good story going into fiscal 2023? In addition, you had mentioned that you had plans to double capacity for your ABA’s and so how are you thinking about flexing that capacity towards beer, obviously you're looking at building a new brewery in Southeast Mexico, does this get to delay that new build out over time because you have capacity? 
Garth Hankinson: Yes, yes, thanks for the question. So on the capacity piece first, right as we announced last spring, we were investing in 5 million hectoliters worth of ABA capacity that is moving forward as planned and should come online earlier in our fiscal year 2023. That's still an important initiative for us because it's built outlined in his prepared remarks. Well the Seltzer category has slowed the ABA segment within beer continues to be a dynamic and meaningful part of the high end and it's one that we need to need to compete in. And by having dedicated ABA capacity that frees up capacity for our core Mexican beer portfolio. So that goes on as planned. And then furthermore on the investment that you referenced in the first part your comment and your question, we did indicate that we going to spend $60 million this fiscal year behind Corona Hard Seltzer. Most of that spend was slated to be spent in the first half of the year. So that has been spent and that, which wasn't spent is being redirected to invest behind our core Mexican beer portfolio. 
William Newlands: The only other thing I'd add to that on the last part of your question was about whether or not it causes any delay in what we would do to invest in the Southeast. As I said, we're continuing to work with the Mexican government. We feel the Southeast is highly likely to be where we put our next brewery position. And as we said, because of robust demand we're going to continue to invest to support our business. So, we would not expect to see any radical change of what our timeframe is all about. Demand has been higher than expected. We need to create some redundancy in our system as we've noted on prior calls and our brewer in the Southeast will be an integral part of that strategy. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. You may proceed with your questions. 
Vivien Azer: Hi. Good morning. I was hoping you could comment please on intra quarter trends in on premise, whether you saw an evolution or a softening there around the delta variant? And as well, perhaps from an industry perspective, are you observing any changes in consumer alcohol preference across kind of TBA, and across category switching as consumers central back out and deposit in restaurants? Thanks. 
William Newlands: Sure. We saw a lot of variation in on premise and at the risk of saying yes, no, yes, no, and yes no it is largely depended on where you were geographically and what was going on in particular markets. So, while we would sit here and say, State X is coming up and we're seeing more on premise if you saw a wave of COVID challenges and in another market, you saw stuff go the other way. So what that basically I think there was an over overarching answer to that question, it was really on a localized basis that you saw many of the movements within the quarter. Again, in the aggregate, on premise was better than it was in the prior year and it continues to be increasing as a percentage of our business but it's still not quite where it was before the pandemic. So, hopefully that helps. It's very hard to give a real aggregate of the thing because it's really made up of a lot of individual answers rather than something being an overarching trend across the marketplace.  I think relative to your question about across category, I think the overarching thing that you see there is the premiumization trends continue, whether you think about it in ready to drinks or ABA’s, you continue to see people premiumizing, you see it in the wine business where the higher end of the wine business continues to outperform the mainstream sector of the business and you continue to see that in spirit. So, I think that is an over overarching trend, that you see. You also see what we found for many years now, which is consumers are more interested in having and array of beverages depending on the exact occasion in which they are consuming product and are less likely than they used to be to consume only one type of product at any anyone occasion than what was perhaps the case historically. So hope that helps. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question. 
Kevin Grundy: Great. Thanks, good morning everyone. Bill, just picking up on the last question, but really kind of lasering in I guess a little bit on wine and broadly for the industry, because there's been some discussion in the marketplace about the recent slowdown and it's not limited to the on premise and we have seen the Nielsen data. So your point is extremely well taken, the premiumization trends are still in place, obviously broadly based across total beverage alcohol but even on a two-year average basis this is -- we're seeing the trend slowdown here. So, I'm not sure how much more you can add to your comment previously. Do you view this as transient at this point on this deceleration we're seeing in the category, is there a bigger maybe bit more difficult to quantify dynamic going on around ready to drink beverages in a way there hasn't been with wine before, if you could comment on that? And Garth just sort of a cleanup up, but I think important, the 30% operating margin target in the wine segment, is that still the target and is fiscal 2024 over the next couple of years, is that sort of enough of a timeline line to take out the stranded overhead, so your comments there would be helpful? Thank you, both. 
William Newlands: I think you got to keep in mind relative to the higher end of the wine business, you're also seeing some what I'll call channel evolution and things like three tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer. Those are for us three to four times what it was in 2019 and you're seeing that as sort of 3% to 5% of our business today where it was 1% before. So some of what you're seeing in that is a difference in the way the consumer actually acquires and it may or may not be reflective of some of the IRI/Nielsen data because it's not picked up in those channels. Some of it is with three tier e-commerce, but certainly the direct to consumer channel is not. So, you've got some of that dynamic in place and of course, almost all of that tends to the higher end. That's where that consumer purchasing behavior occurs. So, I do think there's ebbs and flows on all of those things. I think you saw probably more consumption behavior at home during COVID so you're probably seeing a little bit of more challenging comparable versus prior year. So, I think as we get hopefully back to a bit more normalcy, I think you'll continue to see what the long-term trend is which is that the higher end of the business continues to outperform, and then it's a strong growth of play for that sector. Garth. 
Garth Hankinson: Yeah. On the wine margins, certainly the target margin for wine is still 30%. As we've said all along that it was going to take us about two years post divestiture of the low end for us to be able to achieve that 30% operating margin. So, by the time we get to the end of our fiscal 2023 wine should be in that zip code. Obviously the progress on that is underway. We're making some good progress as we've said before in order to get there. There's a number of initiatives that that we have to make progress on, that's pricing mix footprint optimization, making smart design to value choices. And like I said, we're making good progress and we're confident that we can get that 30% by the end of 2023.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. You may proceed with your question. 
Robert Ottenstein: Right. A couple of questions. First, obviously the low inventories hurt depletions. Can you give us a sense of where you think depletions would have been if you had full inventory levels and I'm hearing it hurt Corona most, can you verify that? 
William Newlands: Obviously, that's a little bit of a tough question to answer, because unlike a year ago where we were very selective a what we produced this year we've been producing all skews. We've just had trouble keeping up with the demand. Our best estimate would probably be in the 2 to 3 percentage points that we lost in this process. But again, in most instances the consumer is looking for our brand, they may have an issue out of particular point time finding a skew, but they don't have trouble finding our brand. So, I think that's probably the way to think about it. 
Robert Ottenstein: Great. And then second question, as you kind of do a diagnostic on what happened with Corona Seltzer, I think I heard you say that flavor was an issue, that the consumer wants more flavor. So, as you think about it, was it a question of the taste not being differentiated or is there an issue with having a brand that's associated with the beer or are there other factors in addition to obviously the sector slowing a little bit, just like to hear a little bit more of your diagnostic on the situation?
William Newlands: Well, I would put more emphasis on your very last point, which is the sector changed a lot versus what everybody anticipated. I think we were probably a bit on the conservative event compared to some of the competition as to what they expected going into this year where some of them were predicting in excess of 50% growth, we projected less. But even as it was, we were wrong. So that is the fundamental issue. When you combine that with the fact that we pre-produced, which again at the time was about production scheduling and our judgment was the right thing to do at the time, that in hindsight did not work out for us as well either. But you got to keep in mind, despite all of that, it's a relatively small percentage of our overall growth profile. It is additive to our growth, it is not the majority of our growth. The majority of our growth continues to be the robust demand against our core beer portfolio, and that's where we expect it to continue to be. So, now relative to the formulation, we just -- we obviously do a lot of consumer research and we track consumer perspectives and we have found that consumers are desiring a bit more flavor and a bit more differentiation within their Seltzer preferences and we plan to address those consumer needs. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean King with UBS. You may proceed with your question. 
Sean King: Great, thanks for the question. Thinking longer term on the margins front and some of the long-term exposures you have and hedges you have in place, is the second half fiscal 2022 the right way to be thinking about margins for 2023?
William Newlands: Okay, I think the right way to think about margins over the near and medium term is consistent with our long-term growth algorithm, which is that we're going to achieve margins in the range of 39% to 40% and as we say in every call, those are best in class margins and we're not apologetic about those. In any given fiscal year margins might be slightly higher than that due to tailwinds and in some years they might be slightly lower than that just due to too many headwinds. But the right way over the medium term is to think about those in the range of 39% to 40%. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein. You may proceed with your question. 
Nadine Sarwat: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I want to circle back to Pacifico and you had called out the Brown Glass challenges that you faced. So obviously that brand saw weaker Nielsen off trade trends this quarter and I noticed that you didn't call out its depletion figures in the release. So, could you provide this and maybe give us some color as to if there were other issues outside of the glass issue you already called out? Thanks. 
William Newlands: Sure. We had mid-single-digit depletion growth in that brands during the quarter. And obviously it was constrained. We would have expected it to be higher without any supply chain issues that revolves around Brown Glass. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan. You may proceed with your question. 
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. So I wanted to go back to the depletion in shipments commentary. You said depletion should outpace the low single-digit shipments you have guided in the 3Q which would imply a sequential acceleration in 3Q from the 12% on a two-year stack that you achieved in the second quarter. So given that you're facing a tougher comparisons, as you do depletion the same amount of our 12% in the third quarter of last year, is that acceleration on the two year coming mostly from on premise and at home decelerating, but still growing, is that the way we should be thinking, in other words, should we think about the depletion growing around mid-single-digits when you said, I think you said it emphatically that the third quarter depletions would outpace shipments as well? And then related to -- and just a clarification on the pricing front, should we think that you will have about 2% price mix realization already in 3Q and what are you seeing playing out so far? Thank you so much. 
William Newlands: Sir just on Q3 shipments and depletions. What we said in terms from a growth perspective, shipments will grow in the low single digits and depletions will grow higher than that. We furthermore said that on a volume basis, depletions -- shipments would outpace depletions and therefore we made progress in returning inventory to more normal levels by the end of our fiscal year. On the pricing question, what we said on that was is that our typical pricing algorithm has us gaining one to two percentage points per year. Given the pricing environment that we're in this year, we're able to be a little bit more aggressive on products that we wouldn't otherwise take pricing on. And so we're going to be -- we're going to take pricing on those skews and as a result, we will be slightly lump above our 2% this year. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. You may proceed with your question. 
Laurent Grandet: Yes. Good morning everyone and thanks for the question. So, I'd like to come back on the Seltzer category. So first, what is the gross  for the category and really I am interested in the rationale behind it and thinking about the next let's a year or so? And then as you mentioned, there will be a consolidation with the elimination of lower velocity SKU, do you see a risk potentially for the Corona Seltzer, the white can as that SKU has been severely underperforming the category, so do you see a risk here that you could lose ACV? And finally, how are you planning to gain the fair share of the Seltzer category especially as Mexican brand I mean, Top Chico is really becoming more national beginning of next year and they are also launching a margarita flavored, more flavor than that SKU, so would like to understand how you will play that? 
William Newlands: Sure. If I understood the first part of your question correctly, I mean, keep in mind that the beer category has been roughly flat at a time when we are up roughly 8%. So there is a significant delta between what the overall category is performing and what we are performing. We're radically outperforming the category. Relative to our desire in the Seltzer/ABA space, there's a number of things. First of all, we're going to focus our attention on where we think we bring differentiated products that are distinct. Given what we have today, I would use Refresca and Limonada as two examples of that that meets specific needs and are not what I would describe as need to products. We also have as we noted in our scripts some innovation agenda items that we think are going to be distinctive and will bring unique value to the table as well. So, we continue to believe this is going to be additive portion of our growth, but certainly not the largest portion of our growth that will continue to be our core beer portfolio. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with Truist. You may proceed to your question. 
Bill Chappell: Thank you. Sorry to belabor the Seltzer questions. But I mean I guess two things, one simple, one bigger picture. I mean, two quarters ago like you said, you have a lot of market research, you and everybody else was very bold up about the market and it seems like it was a soft summer. But it didn't seem like the category was a fad or it's over. But in kind of redirecting, marketing and advertising and moving to kind of focus SKUs, it seems that is what you're kind of saying so, I guess, is that what you're saying, I mean do you see this as kind of a small niche permanently and everybody was kind of wrong, it was going to be a bigger place or is this just a pause for the category? And then the second question is with you directing kind of advertising marketing towards your core beer portfolio, does that result in -- I know it's small, but Seltzer falling off a cliff over the next two quarters and creating kind of headwinds for your growth on beer? Thanks. 
Garth Hankinson: Sure. Relative to the category, our view of it is this, we still think that the overall ABA space is going to be a growth category. Whether or not the Seltzer sub segment of the beer category is -- how much of that is going to be driven by the Seltzer sub segment remains to be seen. Quite frankly, clearly it is going to be a lot less than what everyone anticipated coming into this year. But again, for us, it's a relatively small percentage of our overall play. So, we are not entirely reliant on success in the Seltzer category. In fact, we expect to achieve our algorithm through our core beer business.  Relative to the question of will this put a damper on our growth in the beer business, if Seltzer is challenging, not really. I mean the fact that we are able to raise our guidance is largely driven by the fact that we're able to make more beer. And we're able to make more beer because we're making a little less Seltzer and that is margin accretive and it's a very high growth category. So I realize there is a bad side and good side to that answer. But the reality is, it's not inconsistent with what we've always seen, which is our core business portfolio of beer from Mexico continues to radically outperform the industry and we continue to be the leader in the high end and the high end growth. So, is it going to be any different going forward? I think it's a little bit remains to be seen. We're going to have a little bit more of a watch and see efforts than we had before. I think everyone got a little bit excited about Seltzer. And frankly, the category has slowed significantly. So I think we will probably do a much better job of being guarded in terms of our expectation around that while continuing to leverage our outstanding portfolio of core beer brands. 
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for any closing remarks. 
William Newlands: Alright. Thanks very much. And thank you all for joining our call today. Despite some challenges impacting our results this quarter, as you can see, we remain very confident on the strength and underlying fundamentals of our business. Our beer business in particular continues to be a tight growth driver within the industry while we continue to see the benefits of our wine and spirits premiumization take hold. We remain bullish on the future performance of our powerful collection of consumer connected brands, which provides us with strong momentum as we head into the second half of our fiscal year. Our next quarterly call is scheduled for early January so we hopefully wish everyone a safe, happy, and holiday season. Please remember to enjoy some of our great products during your celebrations, and please remain safe. Thanks for joining the call. 
Operator: Thank you. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. That concludes today's conference call.

===== 2022 Q1  (2021-06-30 11:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands Q1 Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions, instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Jiji [ph]. Good morning, and welcome to Constellation's first-quarter fiscal '22 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now, here's Bill.
William Newlands: Thank you, Patty. Good morning and welcome to everyone to our first quarter conference call. Picking right up where we left off in Q4, our Constellation Brands' team with the help of our distributors and retailers delivered another strong performance in Q1 of fiscal '22. While we overlap the pantry-loading phase of the pandemic, which led to record trends in off-premise tracked channels last year, our continued focus on brand building, aggressive investments in growth, and the continued efforts of our team and trade partners positioned us to deliver another strong year of performance consistent with our long-term goals. As Garth and I detailed some of the highlights from Q1, there are several key factors we'd like you to keep in mind that constitute our points of differentiation, our competitive strengths, and reasons to continue to believe in the future growth potential of our business and our ability to drive industry-leading, total shareholder returns over the long-term. Number one, our strong portfolio of core brands across beer, wine, and spirits continues to gain momentum while offering significant runway for growth in the years ahead. Nowhere is this more evident than in our beer business, which is off to an exceptional start delivering double-digit depletions, shipments, net sales, and operating income growth due to ongoing strong consumer demand. Number two, we continue to be relentless about keeping consumers at the forefront of our decision making, and this is nowhere more apparent than in the strides we're making to strengthen our innovation capabilities and ensure we're capturing our fair share of growth in emerging categories. Number three, our investment in Canopy Growth along with the continued efforts of the Canopy team are positioning this business to emerge as a leader in the global cannabis market as it comes to fruition and we inch closer to legalization in the US. And number four, our continued strong operating performance and cash flow generation enabled us to resume share buyback activity with significant repurchases of more than $500 million during the first four months of our fiscal year. In addition, we announced this morning that we will execute an accelerated share repurchase program throughout the remainder of the second quarter to repurchase an additional incremental $500 million of shares. We believe this demonstrates our strong commitment to maximize shareholder value, and we are on our way to achieving our $5 billion goal of which about 50% will be in the form of share repurchases. This activity is also driving an increase in our EPS guidance for this year. Let's transition to a more detailed discussion of our performance in the quarter. As mentioned, our beer business is off to an exceptional start, delivering double-digit net sales and operating income growth as well as depletion growth of almost 11% in the quarter. Excellent execution during the Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays led to market share gains as Constellation remains a leading growth driver in the high end of the US beer market. Modelo Especial led the way as the number one share gainer in the entire US beer category and solidified its position as the number one brand in the high-end. It also became the number two brand in dollar sales in IRI channels, posting depletion growth of 12% for the quarter. Modelo Especial continues to fire on all cylinders with no signs of letting up driven by ongoing strong execution of retail, impactful execution of high-profile marketing activations, and a significant increase in digital, social, and e-commerce media for properties like UFC, Gold Cup soccer, and the Summer Olympic Games to name just a few. Corona brand family growth was driven by a return to growth in on-premise channels, which now represent approximately 11% of our beer business volume, which accelerated and nearly doubled since fiscal '21. During the quarter, we launched Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #2, which continues to gain shelf space and is already more than half the size of Variety Pack #1 in dollar sales and appears to have about the same incrementality as Variety Pack #1 has to the entire portfolio. Meanwhile, Variety Pack #1 has held its distribution and velocity levels since the launch of Variety Pack #2, and our Hard Seltzer family remains in the number four market position. Earlier this month, we launched Corona Hard Seltzer Limonada, and while it's early in the launch cycle, initial consumer response has been very favorable. Ultimately, we believe the Hard Seltzer category will be dominated by a few large brands in the long run, similar to the light beer category, and we are positioning Corona Hard Seltzer to be one of those brands. We have plans to more than double our Seltzer and ABA capabilities this fiscal year and expect to bring another 5 million hectoliters of capacity online next fiscal year giving us the flexibility to continue to expand with new flavors, new packages, and even new platforms in this space. Overall, the Seltzer category remains competitive. We believe it's an important part of the high-end, and we plan to drive for success with our ambition to ultimately be a top-three player in this space. Pacifico continued it's strong momentum posting depletion growth of more than 35% for the quarter as the number four share gainer within the import segment driven by our focus on Gen Z consumers. As expected, during the quarter, Constellation's consumer takeaway trends in the off-premise IRI and Nielsen channels were muted due to lapping last year's pantry loading behavior at the start of the pandemic. Conversely, we experienced robust growth, especially in some of the more sizable, non-tracked channels, including the on-premise which grew depletions 250% versus last year when this channel was essentially closed and the liquor chains, which grew almost 13% in the first quarter. These levels of robust consumer demand are impacting availability for certain packet sizes and certain geographies. We are working with our distributor partners to ensure consumers can continue to find our brands on shelf throughout the summer, and we plan to make up some of this impact beginning in the third quarter. As a reminder, beginning in April of last year, our beer business had to significantly slow down production in Mexico due to COVID-19 restrictions. This led to out of stocks in the US marketplace during the summer month. Therefore, as we progress through our second quarter, which runs June through August, we'll start to lap these out-of-stock issues, and we're already beginning to see improving IRI trends. Despite the short-term supply challenges we're facing, the momentum of our portfolio is stronger than ever, and our outlook for the remainder of the year remains extremely bullish. Our view is reinforced by recent four-week IRI trends that show Constellation's beer business is outpacing the high-end and continues to significantly outpace the total US beer industry. Now, moving on to wine and spirits. Our transformation of this business to a higher growth, higher margin operation continues to gain traction, and we made additional progress during the first quarter on a number of fronts, including furthering our fine wine and craft spirits strategy, building a robust innovation pipeline, advancing our DTC e-commerce and digital capabilities, while also implementing disciplined pricing actions, taking out stranded costs and executing other cost and efficiency improvements. During the quarter, we made progress with the evolution of our fine wine and craft spirits business, especially as consumers returned to bars and restaurants in the on-premise channel. Our fine wine and craft spirits performance in the quarter was driven primarily by The Prisoner Wine Company, Robert Mondavi Winery, and High West. And we expect our enhanced capabilities in this space to begin to meaningfully inflect our wine and spirits business towards the higher end. Impactful innovations were also a driving force for growth during the quarter, including Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon, Kim Crawford Illuminate, and The Prisoner Unshackled which were among the top 10 innovations across the high end of the US wine segment in IRI channels during the quarter. And we have a strong innovation pipeline planned for the remainder of the year, which includes the introduction of Woodbridge wine seltzers, The Prisoner's Saldo, Red Blend, and Unshackled Sauvignon Blanc plus Robert Mondavi Private Selection 100, a new lineup composed of 100% Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay varietals. We've also been investing to build a world-class three-tier e-commerce team by expanding our sales and marketing resources, building new selling capabilities, investing millions of dollars where consumers shop, and integrating our teams to put focus and expertise closer to our accounts. While our three-tier e-commerce business is cycling the tremendous acceleration that was experienced last spring at the beginning of the pandemic, it is still growing 3 to 4 times compared to the spring of 2019 across beer, wine, and spirits. And the DTC portion of our e-commerce business saw impressive growth of 45% versus last year in the first quarter. We continued to forge partnerships with existing and emerging pure-play retailers like Amazon, Gopuff, and Wine.com. Omnichannel retailers like Walmart, Kroger, and Albertsons. And third-party marketplaces like Instacart and Drizly so that our consumers can shop whenever and wherever on their own terms. In addition, as part of our commitment to invest $100 million over 10 years and Black, Latinx, and minority-owned small businesses, we recently made investments in La Fete du Rose and Sapere Aude Sparkling Wine, both of these brands aligned with Constellation's premiumization strategy and present significant growth opportunities with differentiated high-end brands in growing sectors of the market. La Fete du Rose has taken a consumer-first approach to building a distinctive, authentic Rose brand that appeals to multicultural consumers. And Sapere Aude has taken an entrepreneurial approach to build a uniquely Californian sparkling wine with no residual sugars, low alcohol content, fine bubbles, and a refreshing brand identity that is simple and clean. We look forward to working with these brands and their dynamic founders to expand our access to key markets and consumers, and to help realize their full potential. At the same time, our Wine & Spirits results for the quarter were impacted by a convergence of isolated factors. First, our international brands like Kim Crawford and Ruffino, which are produced in their respective regions but sold primarily in the US are experiencing global supply chain logistics issues, including shipping delays and transport interruptions like so many other imported products. Second, we've experienced some start-up issues in certain markets associated with our route to market transition to Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits, which now has distribution responsibilities across 70% of our US Wine & Spirits brand portfolio. This transition became effective April 1, and we expect the transition issues to be resolved in the second quarter. Lastly, like many ERP system implementations with a cut over to SAP, we have encountered a few transitional challenges which we don't see as a prolonged issue. Collectively, these issues caused some supply challenges in retail for some of our larger key brands which drove the negative depletion trend during the quarter. And while we are seeing lower inventory levels than normal for Kim and Ruffino, they continue to drive growth. Despite these temporary challenges, we are confident in our ability to accelerate the growth and profitability of this higher-end portfolio of industry-leading brands and achieving our targeted goal of 2% to 4% organic sales growth for the fiscal year. Moving on to Canopy Growth; the synergies between Constellation and Canopy Growth continue to create value for both companies. Canopy recently signed a US distribution agreement with Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits for Canopy's Quattro CBD beverage portfolio which will be launched across seven US states with additional states to be added later this year, as well as their Martha Stewart CBD product lineup, which has seen early success extending into top-selling gifts for occasions, including Mother's Day and Valentine's Day was sold out prior to the holidays due to high consumer demand. Constellation and Canopy will continue to work closely together to develop Canopy's route to market strategy in the US. We remain optimistic about the prospects for federal US legalization during this congressional session and are bullish about Canopy's growth prospects and their ability to achieve profitability by the end of their fiscal year. As I close, I want to take a minute to thank our Constellation team members and our distributors and retailers for an excellent first quarter of business performance. Thanks to all of you, our strong portfolio of core brands across beer, wine, and spirits continues to gain momentum and we are well-positioned to deliver another strong year of performance consistent with our long-term goals. Our beer business continues to be a top growth driver within the US beer market and will delivering market share gains and accelerating depletion trends as consumer demand and take away remains extremely strong. Our higher-end Wine & Spirits brands continue to outpace the overall US market. We continue to strengthen our innovation capabilities to ensure we're capturing our fair share of growth in emerging categories. Our continued strong operating performance and strong cash flow generation allowed us to make significant share repurchases in line with our commitment to return $5 billion to shareholders by fiscal '23 and drove an increase in our EPS guidance for the year. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results in the quarter. Garth?
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill. And hello, everyone. Our fiscal 2022 is off to a great start demonstrated by our strong segment operating results and cash flow generation. As Bill highlighted, our Beer business achieved double-digit depletion volume, top-line, and operating income growth. Our Wine & Spirits business is nicely positioned to drive accelerated growth and profitability from its portfolio of higher-end industry-leading brands, and our robust cash flow generation enabled us to resume share buyback activity, reaffirming our commitment to execute our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through our fiscal 2023. As Bill outlined, through June, we've repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for $523 million. In addition, this morning we announced that we entered into an accelerated share repurchase or ASR agreement to purchase $500 million of incremental shares which is expected to be completed no later than October of 2021. Please note that the ASR agreement constitutes of $500 million incremental share repurchase referenced in this morning's earnings release. As a result, we've increased our full year comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $10 to $10.30. This range excludes Canopy equity earnings impact and reflects the decrease in weighted average diluted shares outstanding, driven by the year -- the June year-to-date share buyback activity as well as the ASR agreement or approximately $1 billion of share repurchases. As such, we are forecasting weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately $193 million for our fiscal 2022. We plan to repurchase additional shares during the back half of the fiscal year in excess of the $1 billion of share repurchases previously outlined. However, we do not know the timing and cadence, and as such, these expected share repurchases have been excluded from our guidance assumptions. We will continue to update our outstanding shares accordingly when we report quarterly earnings throughout the fiscal year. Now, let's review our Q1 fiscal 2022 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with Beer, net sales increased 14% driven by shipment volume growth of over 11% and favorable pricing. The increase in beer net sales was impacted by some miss shipping days and supply shortages as a result of severe weather events impacting Texas and Northern Mexico, early in the first quarter of our fiscal year. Depletion volume accelerated from fiscal 2021 year-end trends and achieved nearly 11% growth for the quarter despite overlapping the peak of last year's pandemic-related pantry loading behavior, driven by continued strong demand in both tracked and non-tracked off-premise channels, as well as the return to growth in the on-premise channel. On-premise volume accounted for 11% of total beer depletions during the quarter, which accelerated and nearly doubled since fiscal '21. As a reminder, the on-premise accounted for approximately 15% of our depletion volume pre-COVID and accounted for only 3% of our depletion volume in Q1 fiscal 2021 as a result of on-premise shutdowns due to COVID-19. Lastly, when adjusting for one extra selling day in the quarter, the beer business generated nearly 10% depletion volume growth, and in Q2 depletion selling days are flat year-over-year. Due to continued robust consumer demand and muted shipment volume driven by supply challenges due to severe winter weather early in the quarter, depletion volume exceeded shipment volume during the first quarter, resulting in lower than normal distributor inventory on hand at the end of Q1. Let me assure you, that we are fully producing and shipping products out of our breweries, however, inventories will remain tight throughout the second quarter as we enter our peak summer selling season. As a result, we expect distributor inventory levels to return to more normal levels during the second half of the fiscal year. Moving on to beer margins; beer operating margin increased 110 basis points versus prior year to 42.8%. Benefits from favorable pricing, SG&A as a percent of net sales, and foreign currency were partially offset by unfavorable logistics and operational costs and increased marketing. The increase in logistics cost was driven primarily by increased obsolescence resulting from initial conservative expiration dates on new SKUs, partially offset by the transition of a portion of our co-packing capabilities to our Nava Brewary. The increase in operational costs was driven primarily by brewery costs, largely due to labor inflation in Mexico and increased headcount and incremental spend to bring the additional 5 million hectoliters online at Obregon. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption related to the overlap of reduced production in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19 safety measures. Depreciation expense had a minimal impact during the quarter as we began to depreciate the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon late in Q1 but expect depreciation expense to ramp up during Q2. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 70 basis points to 9.4% versus prior year as we have returned to our typical spending cadence which is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, marketing spend in the first half of the prior year was significantly muted resulting from COVID-19-related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and/or postponements. As communicated last quarter, given the current state of activities in Mexicali, we will be unable to repurpose this site for future use. As such, an impairment of approximately $665 million was recorded for the quarter, which was excluded from our comparable basis results. For full year fiscal 2022, we continue to target net sales growth of 7% to 9% which includes 1 to 2 points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio and operating income growth of 3% to 5%. This implies operating margin to land in the low to mid-point of our stated 39% to 40% range. As previously discussed, we continue to expect our gross margins to be negatively impacted for the fiscal year as benefits from price and our cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by the following headwinds. First, a significant step up in depreciation expense and other brewery expansion costs relating to the incremental 5 million hectoliters that was completed at Obregon earlier in the fiscal year. Second, substantial inflationary headwinds across numerous cost components. And lastly, negative mix as we expand our ABA and Hard Seltzer portfolios. As it relates to timing and cadence, as mentioned earlier, during the second quarter we will begin to see an impact from depreciating the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon, which will be a significant margin headwinds for the balance of the fiscal year. Additionally, due to benefits from our commodity hedging program, we did not experience the expected cost inflationary pressures during this quarter. However, we expect significant inflation headwinds to ramp up during the second half of our fiscal year as current hedges roll off. In addition, we believe the depth and duration of inflationary pressures are becoming more uncertain as the year unfolds. Lastly, we continue to expect marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 10% range for full year fiscal 2022 which is in line with fiscal 2021 spend of 9.7% of net sales. We expect to invest significantly during Q2 of fiscal 2022 to support strategic initiatives and continue generating strong marketplace performance throughout the key summer selling season. As such, 2Q marketing as a percent of net sales is expected to be in the range of 10% to 11% versus Q2 fiscal '21 which came in 8.4%. Moving to Wine & Spirits; Q1 fiscal 2022 net sales declined 22% on shipment volumes down 38%. Excluding the impact of the Wine & Spirits divestitures, organic net sales increased 16% driven by organic shipment volume growth of 6%, smoke-tainted bulk wine sales, and favorable price and mix, while depletion volume declined approximately 8%. There are several dynamics to point out as it relates to organic net sales as well as shipment and depletion volume trends for the quarter. Starting with organic net sales and organic shipment volume; growth of 16% and 6% respectively was impacted by the following. First, smoke-tainted bulk wine sales accounted for approximately 4 points of the year-over-year organic net sales growth in the quarter. Second, from an organic shipment volume perspective, we under shipped depletions in Q1 fiscal 2021 as we were unable to fulfill excessive consumer demand driven by pantry loading, creating easy shipment volume compared to Q1 fiscal 2022. Conversely, we over shipped in Q1 fiscal 2022 as a result of the distributor transitioned to Southern Glazer's in order to ensure that they had ample inventory during the quarter as there was a delay in transitioning Constellation inventory from canceled distributors to Southern Glazer's. Moving to depletion volume trends; down approximately 8%, which were impacted by the following. First, we are experiencing a challenging overlap to the last year's pandemic-related consumer pantry loading behavior. Second, as a result of the SAP transition, we experienced challenges that impacted the shipping process early in the quarter. While we were able to rectify the situation during the quarter, the timing of shipments throughout Q1 negatively impacted depletions and created out of stocks for some of our larger key brands. Lastly, global supply chain logistics issues, including shipping delays and transport interruptions have also created out of stocks in certain areas for Kim Crawford and Ruffino which are imported from New Zealand and Italy respectively. As Bill mentioned, we believe these challenges are temporary and continue to improve, and we expect to refill retailer inventory in Q2. Moving on to Wine & Spirits margins; operating margin decreased 540 basis points to 22.9% as mixed benefits driven by the Wine & Spirits divestitures and favorable price were more than offset by margin dilutive smoke-tainted wine -- bulk wine sales and increased marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales. Keep in mind that we're lapping lower marketing and SG&A spend in Q1 fiscal 2021 due to COVID and have a smaller business post the divestitures resulting in significant marketing and SG&A deleveraging impacting operating margins. For full year fiscal 2022, the Wine & Spirits business continues to expect net sales and operating income to decline 22% to 24% and 23% to 25% respectively. This implies operating margin to approximate 24% which is flattish to prior year on a reported basis, which shows significant margin expansion on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the Wine & Spirits divestitures organic net sales is expected to grow in the 2% to 4% range. Lastly, please keep in mind that we will continue to lap significantly reduced marketing spend during Q2 as many of our planned media and event sponsorship investments were suspended or canceled in Q2 fiscal 2021. Furthermore, we continue to expect marketing and SG&A deleveraging as a result from the Wine & Spirits divestitures. As such, we expect marketing and SG&A to continue to be a significant drag to operating margins in Q2 fiscal 2022. Now, let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Q1 corporate expenses came in approximately $55 million, up 8% versus Q1 fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher consulting services and compensation and benefits, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact. We continue to expect full year corporate expenses to approximately $235 million. Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 13% to approximately $87 million primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continue to decrease our net leverage ratio and ended the quarter at 3.06 times, excluding Canopy equity earnings. Our previous guidance assumed free cash flow would be used to pay down debt versus share repurchases. However, as discussed earlier, updated guidance now reflects approximately $1 billion of share repurchases through the first half. As such, fiscal [ph] interest expense is now expected to increase and be in the range of $360 million to $370 million. Our comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings, came in at 21.1% versus 19.3% last year, primarily driven by higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses. We expect our Q2 fiscal '22 comparable tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact to approximate 20%. However, we continue to expect the full year to approximate 19% as expected stock-based compensation benefits are weighted more towards the second half of the fiscal year. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated free cash flow of $602 million, which represents an 11% increase versus prior year reflecting strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. CapEx totaled $114 million or 21% last year spend. This included approximately $86 million of beer CapEx, primarily driven by expansion initiatives at our Mexico facilities. Lower CapEx spend is primarily due to timing, as we have significant spending plan for the balance of the fiscal year. As such, our full year CapEx guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, which includes approximately $900 million target for Mexico beer operation expansions remains unchanged. Furthermore, we continue to expect fiscal 2022 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion and the CapEx spend previously outlined. Moving to Canopy; in Q1 we recognized an unrealized loss of $745 million from the decrease in the fair value of our Canopy investments. This was excluded from our comparable basis results. The total pre-tax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $366 million. In closing, I want to reiterate our expectations to continue to have significant capital allocation flexibility throughout our fiscal 2022, which will enable ongoing progress in returning cash to shareholders, while making strategic investments to support long-term growth opportunities. We believe the combination of strong cash flow and future growth prospects in both our Beer and Wine & Spirits businesses positions Constellation for success. The growth and margin profile of our high-end beer business is best in class and we expect it to remain as such well into the future while the transformation of our Wine & Spirits business is underway and we expect to continue to achieve margin expansion as we migrate to operating margins of approximately 30%. And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Bonnie Herzog: Thank you. Hi, everyone.
William Newlands: Hey, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. I was actually just hoping to get a little more color on the out-of-stock pressures you've been facing. We're aware that you guys had temporarily paused [ph] orders during the end of May given how strong demand was in relation to your forecasted supply. So, first, are these caps still in place? And then specifically, have you seen these pressures maybe get better or worse in June? And finally, are there any specific impacts on certain SKUs or pack sizes or was this just more broad-based in your portfolio? Thanks.
William Newlands: Sure. Obviously, the two main things driving the tightness of inventory are first and foremost, robust consumer demand. Our consumer demand has been well in excess of what we anticipated. And in my opinion, that's always good news. The second piece of that obviously was the point that Garth made and I made in my script, which is the power outage that occurred at the end of February, which has made for a somewhat tighter inventory position than we would normally want to hold. With that said, all of that will take care of itself over the course of the fiscal year. It's quite different, quite frankly, from last year where we mainly produced the SKUs that represented 75% of our total portfolio. This year, we're producing all of our SKUs. So, it's very different from what we saw last year, and while we do expect tightness during the course of the summer, we're working actively with our distributors to make sure that we are providing the right mix of product to make sure that we continue to supply the very strong demand we're seeing against our portfolio.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Nik Modi: Yes. Good morning, everyone. So, just quick housekeeping, Bill, you wouldn't mind sharing perspective on June depletions. I know the month isn't over yet, but any early color would be helpful? And then, the broader question is, during the pandemic, many brands including Constellation's portfolio of beer brands gained a lot of new households, and I was just wondering have you done a postmortem on what those new households look like? Have you recruited new consumers into the portfolio that you weren't recruiting prior? I mean any context around that would be really interesting.
William Newlands: Certainly. So, first -- your first part of your question regarding June, and you're correct, well it isn't over yet. We're very enthused by how June is setting up and is certainly consistent with our long-term algorithm assuming we finished the last couple of days strongly. So, we think June is going to look pretty good. Secondly, relative to households, Nik, we obviously are continuing to develop and broaden our reach across our core brands, particularly in beer. If you think about Modelo, and Garth I think said this in prior quarters, we are rapidly increasing our penetration in the non-Hispanic community. It's a little difficult for us at this point to break that out of how much of that was COVID versus non-COVID because we're just seeing such an acceleration of Modelo not only in its core Hispanic market but in the broader market as well. So, it's a little difficult for us to put an exact percentage on any of those things. What I would say is, we are gaining consumers in our portfolio that has been obvious, and we expect that trend to continue. Part of that has been driven by our innovation agenda. We are meeting more consumer needs, more consumer drinking occasions than we ever have before because of our successful innovation agenda across the whole portfolio, across the company. So, I would expect that we're going to continue to see some acceleration of bringing new consumers in because we are opening up occasions for those people to come into our franchise.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Lauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I was curious about the beer pricing. It’s price mix was north of 2%, and I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about how much of that was driven by mix or if there is some greater pricing starting to come through in the market and your thoughts broadly on pricing for beer this year? Thanks.
William Newlands: Sure. We continue to keep our algorithm about beer pricing as we have said on prior calls. We see it as a 1% to 2% growth profile over the course of the year, and we're sticking with that. We think that's appropriate given all the factors that we weigh when we decide about what we're going to do with our pricing. I think it's also important to say our number one growth driver in our business continues to be Modelo, which is very accretive on a mix basis. So, as we continue to see all of our businesses grow, when you see that kind of acceleration in Modelo, it certainly is mix accretive to us as well. So, I think both of those things were additive in the quarter, and we would expect them to be additive over the course of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hey. Thanks, everybody. Digging into the supply or maybe connecting the supply issues with depletions and how you're thinking about inventories getting better in the back half, does that -- think that you being running at a 10, looks like you are continuing to run at [indiscernible] adjusted, do you need depletions to really start to come off, maybe back to that high-single-digit range to get inventories back to where you want them to be or do you feel like just the abatement of any of the supply pressures will be able to get you to where you want to be? Thanks.
William Newlands: We'd expect that the abatement of supply issues to take care of themselves over the course of the year. Remember, I think we probably made this reasonably clear. We lost several points of top-line growth because of the power outage that occurred at the end of February in Northern Mexico and in Texas. So, we certainly had a muted shipping scenario. We will expect to pick that up over the course of the remainder of the year. And we're still expecting demand to be very solid. So, we are fully expecting to meet the demand that we'll see in the marketplace, which we continue to say will be in that 7% to 9% range over the course of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean King from UBS. Your line is now open.
Sean King: Great, thanks for the question. Yes, I appreciate the color you gave on the on-premise at 11% and I guess that's greater than 250% growth for beer. But was that at the close of the quarter? Is that like the average of the quarter overall? And inside that, what are you seeing in terms of draft amount [ph]?
William Newlands: Yes, that's the average over the course of the quarter. As Garth pointed out in his remarks, that still is below what we were pre-pandemic but it's a really big increase to what it was last year. So, we still think certain markets are developed more quickly than others as we've said in prior discussions, as well. So, we certainly expect that's going to continue to be an accelerator over the course of the summer. And let's face it, I think it would be fair to say there's a lot of pent-up consumer demand to simply go out of your home, that people are looking forward to the opportunity as some of the COVID restrictions come off. We would expect to see some continuing acceleration in the on-premise channel as we progress through the summer, recalling that the on-premise channel was a fraction of what it was last year versus the prior year. So, we think that's all are going to take good care of itself as the year goes on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Bryan Spillane: Good morning, everyone. A question for Garth. Just wanted to follow-up on the commentary around inflation becoming more uncertain. So, just maybe if you can comment on two things related to that. What areas -- so what types of inputs are becoming more certain, is that freight, is it packaging, labor cost? Just trying to understand kind of where the potential pressure points could be? And then, if you could tie to that as well, if we step back today versus where we were at the beginning of the fiscal year, can you give us a sense of just how much flexibility has been eaten up by inflation coming higher? Or are you in the same place in terms of just flexibility to hit your profit growth goals this year? Thank you.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. Thanks, Bryan. And just as a reminder, when we issued our Q4 guidance, we talked about inflation and we said that, overall, we are expecting inflation kind of in the low to mid-single-digit range. And that was taking into account that on any given line item within our cost structure we were seeing the inflation kind of the low-to-high single-digit range. We have -- as we talked about at that time, we have a pretty effective hedging policy in place and we entered the year in a good position as I said. So, as we look out this year, first of all, the outlook for inflation still kind of remains the same. Our outlook as well as sort of the external advice we get on this is still that inflation is going to have a bit of a spike but it's going to be temporary in nature. The question just is like how temporary, right? It seems as though that kind of blip, it might take a bit longer to kind of come down from there. And so, the things that we're watching mostly right now really are around as you indicated, logistics and transportation, and labor, and those things are somewhat intertwined if you will. The labor market has made it difficult to get dedicated trucking lines and so, that's becoming more and more competitive. So, that's absolutely a concern. We continue to watch aluminum and then we look at natural gas to -- or glass, right? Glass, because glass is impacted by natural gas. So, those are the areas we're kind of most watchful for as we go through the year. I said it, as we sit here today, we're feeling like we're in a similar position to be able to cover our inflationary headwinds as long as they don't get significantly worse as we go through the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Serotta from Evercore. Your line is now open.
Eric Serotta: Great, thank you. Bill, hoping to get a little bit more granularity as to what you're expecting from the Hard Seltzer category and the broader ABA category or the ABA category more broadly? And related to that, you reiterated that you're more than doubling Corona Seltzer's capacity this year and you'll have the additional 5 million hectoliters of ABA capacity at Nava I believe for next year. If your forecast on ABA growth don't pan out, how flexible is that capacity to produce traditional beer?
William Newlands: So related to the Hard Seltzer capacity point, we're still expecting that the Hard Seltzer category is going to grow somewhere in the 30% to 50% range, somewhere in that range this year overall. And obviously, we did roughly 10 million cases last year with one SKU. We've introduced our second Variety Pack. We're very excited about that process so far and Limonada is just hitting the market really as we speak. I got to remind you again, what I said earlier, which is despite doubling the size of our ABA and Hard Seltzer capability for this year, the number one growth driver in our portfolio will remain Modelo, irrespective of that significant growth. So, we are very comfortable with our growth profile across the business. What I would say is, this is -- we do have significant flexibility around the capacity that we put in and how that can be used within the business. And many of the things like packaging and so forth, really serve as the entire business anyway. So, we do have a fair amount of flexibility depending on if there's any changes in any of the particular sub-segments of the beer category at any point in time. We've worked very hard to make sure there is flexibility within our production capacity capabilities so that we can adjust to any change in consumer demand.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Chris Carey: Hi, thank you. So, I actually have a question just about Wine & Spirits. Price mix has been a good story in the business, that's accelerated this quarter, obviously, margins got hit. I'm just trying to frame where you think we are on the path to the medium and longer-term margin targets here? We knew there was always going to be a step back before recovery and certainly, it seems like the price mix and premiumization of the portfolio can deliver what you think it can. But we also have a much more inflationary backdrop and things are evolving. So, I wonder if you can just maybe take a look at this quarter and how it informs how you're continuing to look at the capacity of this business to deliver those margin targets over time and perhaps the timeline on what you think that can happen?
Garth Hankinson: Yes, Chris. Thanks for the question. So, as you indicated, the topline is doing quite well. So, we're very pleased with our transformation as it relates to top-line growth. In terms of the margins journey, what we've always said around that is, it was going to take us about two years post divestiture to get to the 30% operating margins. And in order to get to about 30% operating margin, it was going to take a number of different things. There was pricing, there is mix, there is the cost takeout that we've talked about previously, stranded cost takeout of around $130 million, not all of which will fall to the bottom line. Some of that, we will reinvest behind the brands to make sure that we have strong brands that can generate the topline growth, as well as other initiatives around footprint optimization as a result of that the Gallo divestiture, not only did we share a large number brands but we also shared seven wineries, seven facilities with that transaction. So, there is a footprint optimization, as well as doing some cost optimization to make sure that the products we're putting in the bottom-most reflect what the consumers are looking to get when they pick up those brands. So, that -- we're well underway. We certainly didn't sit back and wait for the transaction to close to identify those cost savings, those initiatives. So, we're just now executing against those. But as you say, we're at that interim period where the business is a bit deleveraged. And so, until the rest of those cost comes out, we -- you will see that kind of -- that downward blip as you noted this year as we move to the 30% operating margins at the end of sort of two years post divestiture.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is actually Greg [ph] on the line for Kevin. Just one quick follow-up question on some of the on-premise channel trends that you guys have been seeing. Many of your peers have noted that it's been running in front of plan so far in terms of the number of reopenings, the velocity that they've seen. You guys gave some helpful context on what you've seen over the last quarter, but maybe could you talk about how your expectations for the full year have changed? Have you seen the reopening phase faster than you thought it would be? And maybe how you think that would impact full year results? Thank you.
William Newlands: Sure. Let me take that one, Greg. The -- we have seen it accelerate tremendously. But as we've seen over the course of the last 18 months around the pandemic, you often see some things where you get starts and stops and things improve in certain states and don't improve in other states, and so on and so forth. I think the important thing from our perspective to look at is, while we've seen 250% growth in our depletions in the quarter versus prior year, the overall percentage of our business that the on-premise represents is still a bit less than it was in fiscal year wherein calendar -- excuse me, calendar year '19. So, we still think there's still some opportunity and acceleration to come. We also have had an exceptional -- and our distributor network does an exceptional job of winning the times that matter, things like 4th of July, Labor Day. We did it with Cinco de Mayo, we did it with Memorial Day. So, we still think there's going to be some good opportunities for acceleration. The challenge to predict how much of the channel shifting that occurred? There was a massive amount of channel shifting that occurred a year ago when you went heavily to the off-premise. You're now seeing the on-premise comes back on and the IRI and Nielsen data has been somewhat muted. So, we also have seen, as we noted in our scripts, a significant increase in our three-tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer across the business. So, how all those channels sort of shake out is a real question. I think the encouraging part remains. The consumer demand against our business across all channels that we can track has been extraordinarily strong and we're excited and we think that will continue irrespective of which channel the consumer chooses to engage in.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Andrea Teixeira: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. So, I wanted to just follow on this one, this last commentary Bill on where consumers are engaging. And it seems like, as you said -- you just said now that it's still below the calendar '19 level. So, can you comment a little bit of how you see that transition? Like your consumers are still engaging at home and the consumption of your -- obviously, your big brands is still very stronger at home despite the shift and how you're seeing that? And then, just a clarification on also on the inventory and shipments. Is it fair to say that given that you have a very easy comp on the production in April, right? So, going to have a lot of like inventory that you haven't built yet, but is still on transit from Mexico. Is that something that gives you some comp for that? Even though you said you only see the normalization by the third quarter, that the second quarter is still going to be a very strong shipment quarter.
William Newlands: Sure. So, let's start with question around the on-premise. Keep in mind, based on what we can see, per capita consumption has remained pretty steady throughout the pandemic. It's just that where and how people consume has moved around quite a bit. So, it's really difficult to precisely predict how consumers are going to operate. And I think it's going to vary, as I said a moment ago, quite a bit by state depending on the individual restrictions and whether or not certain states are still allowing takeaway from a restaurant environment for alcoholic beverages, some are not. So, until all this dynamic plays itself out, I think it's going to be very difficult to predict exactly how the consumer will land. Other than I would say some of the sheer shopping behavior where you see three-tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer changes are going to continue. As we've said in prior calls, we have made major investments to increase our capability in three-tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer, and I'm very glad that we did. It's playing out well and it's showing tremendous takeaway in those sectors which have grown around the pandemic. As it relates to inventory, we continue to believe we're going to have a very solid year. We're in a good position to make up the challenge that was the one-time challenge around the power outage that occurred in February, and we expect to have, as we've said, a very strong year and that I would expect would include the second quarter which is upon us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Steve Powers: Hey, guys. Thank you very much. I know you've got a lot of questions already, Bill, but just to round out that last topic on beer supply. I guess is there a ceiling we should think about in terms of how much you're just physically able to ship in 2Q? I think consensus has you shipping around 100 million cases in the second quarter relative to the 85 million in the first quarter. And I guess just given all that you said, I'm just trying to understand or dimension whether that kind of step up is doable in broad brushstrokes or in the back half? And then, I -- what I really wanted to ask about was for Garth, just -- you ran through a number of items, very helpfully that will kind of weigh -- explain the beer margin trajectory sequentially and what will weigh on beer margins over the remainder of the year. If you could provide any more detail there, may be a rank order just in terms of the items we should be focusing on is having the biggest impact there, that would be very helpful. Thank you. Thank you to both.
William Newlands: Yes, you bet. So, let me start with the first half, and then Garth will cover the second half. The one thing that we haven't mentioned today, but it's an important one is -- but we did mention it in prior quarters. Our Obregon, opening of the extension of Obregon was delayed roughly a quarter last year -- at the end of last year, because we weren't able to construct during COVID. So, that is certainly going to help our inventory position as we move forward as that's now up and running. It's not running as efficiently as it will once we get everything locked and loaded because it's just a normal startup. But it's certainly helping the situation and we certainly expect to be able to meet consumer demand during our key summer selling season as I said earlier. We're being -- we're working very carefully with our distributor network and our retail partners to make sure that we are able to meet the demand. Admittedly, the demand has been robust and continues to be very strong, but we are expecting to be able to meet that demand, and certainly, Obregon is a big helper in that area. Garth, you want to take that out?
Garth Hankinson: Yes. Just to follow-up on the margin question. So, as we stated in Q4, really, it's those three big drivers of depreciation, inflation, and mix, and those are really kind of equally weighted in terms of the impact on margins. So, on the depreciation front, that was -- we have an increase of about $65 million this year, and that's comprised of Obregon full year [indiscernible] in the glass joint venture [ph], depreciation as well as some other things. Inflation, I think we've covered, and the fact that it's more in the second half of the year as our hedges kind of roll-off. And then mix, I think mix is also something that's going to impact us again more as we go through the year because we started the year really with kind of one SKU in Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #1, Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #2 was just launched at the beginning, and then we launched Limonada here in June. So, there will be a more mix impact as we go through the balance of the year as well. But really it's equally -- the impact is equal across those three buckets.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet from Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
Laurent Grandet: Thank you. And hi, everyone, and thanks for squeezing me in the queue. Up to recently [indiscernible] penetrate most from these spending household about 15% for the right kinds were to a record as a test was not pleasing [indiscernible]. So, now with new bolder flavors, Seltzer and brown/black [ph] targeting specifically Hispanic, we are seeing household penetration within Hispanic going up to 25 to 35. So, my question is do you see that as a risk to your portfolio of Mexican beer? And if not, why? And what are you doing to reach more Hispanic consumer with your current Seltzer portfolio? Thank you.
William Newlands: Certainly. Well, as you know, we are very fortunate with our Mexican beer portfolio to have the strength of brands that we do. These are iconic, authentic brands from Mexico that our Hispanic community is very much behind. And we continue to see strength and growth. As I've said you, I think -- not to you, but I've said in prior calls, we continue to see opportunities with Modelo/ The household penetration with Modelo despite the rapid growth of Modelo is still not at the level of Corona as an example. We're also seeing over-development in the Hispanic community with our Corona Hard Seltzer. So, we are reaching into that community by again meeting new occasions and meeting new consumer needs with those particular products. So, we are very comfortable with the growth profile that we see in the Hispanic community with our iconic portfolio from Mexico and we think the Seltzer element is going to be an important and hopeful part of continuing the relationship with the Hispanic community, recognizing that we're also doing a great job of expanding those brands into the non-Hispanic community as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Stirling from Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Trevor Stirling: Hi, good afternoon, Garth, and Bill. Two quick questions from my side, please. As you sit today and you compare with three months ago, have anything changed to change your point of view either for F22 or the outlook? I think the second thing related to that, given the cadence of inflation you talked about given the aluminum spot price staying as high as these and those hedges rolling off, historically, you've had that 1% to 2% pricing algorithm. Do you think that might need to change 12 months out?
William Newlands: I'll take the price part, Garth. Maybe you take the first part. Relative to the price, we continue to believe 1% to 2% is going to be our long-term expectation. We think that balances appropriately the dynamics that occur with price sensitivity when you raise your price and recognizing, it does obviously help you cover any inflationary effects during the course of the year. So, we're pretty comfortable, that algorithm of 1% to 2% is the right answer, that balances all of those factors and we would see that continuing well into the future.
Garth Hankinson: Yes, in terms of the first part of that question, the Q1 changed our point of view for the full year. I would say that at this time, it's too early for us to make any changes to our outlook for the year given one-quarter end. The one thing that I would highlight, right, as Bill noted in his script, depletions in our beer business exceeded our expectations as well as the expectations of our distributor, our retail partners. So, that's something that we'll watch very, very closely as we move through Q2 and through the balance of the year. And look, when -- as we go through the year and we do see changes to our business, we'll be sure to update you all on our guidance expectations. But as of right now, we're very comfortable with the guidance that we provided and reaffirm today with a bit of a tick-up on our EPS related to the share repurchase program.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for closing remarks.
William Newlands: Thank you, everyone for joining our call today. I think it should be clear, the fiscal '22 is off to a strong start, providing us with continued momentum as we head into our key summer selling season. Our powerful collection of consumer connected brands across beer, wine, and spirits continues to gain traction and we are well-positioned to deliver another strong year of performance consistent with our long-term goals. Our robust cash flow generation allowed us to make significant share repurchases in line with our commitment to return $5 billion to shareholders by fiscal '23 and we look forward to updating everyone throughout the fiscal year, as we expect to make continued progress during fiscal '22. In closing, I'd like to wish all of you a happy 4th of July and hope that your celebrations with family and friends include our fantastic beer, wine and spirit products. Thank you, again, everyone and have a good summer.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2021-04-08 11:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello and welcome to the Constellation Brands Q4 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be open for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I would now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Joanna. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's year-end fiscal '21 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.
William Newlands: Thank you, Patty. Good morning and welcome to our year-end call. It's now been a little more than a year since the onset of the pandemic and for many it's been one of the most challenging years in recent memory. At this time last year, we outlined our philosophy for managing the business and navigating through this period of uncertainty. We committed to making decisions that prioritize the physical and economic safety, health and well-being of our employees. We committed to remaining consumer obsessed, relentlessly focused on doing all we can to meet consumer needs. We pledged to continue managing our business with discipline ensuring appropriate balance between short-term needs and positioning Constellation for sustainable long-term success and we pledged to continue making decisions aligned with our long-term strategic vision. This is what best of class companies do in periods of uncertainty and I'm extremely proud to say that is exactly what our team delivered over the course of the physical year and then some. Working together with our distributor and retail partners, we overcame numerous headwinds posed by the pandemic to achieve strong earnings growth and record free cash flow, while significantly reducing debt. This strong performance was led by our beer business, which delivered double-digit operating income and organic net sales growth for the fiscal year. Looking forward, we not only have an exciting innovation lineup for the coming year, but we expect our core portfolio to generate robust growth well into the foreseeable future, and therefore have plans in place to execute our next increment of capacity expansion in Mexico. Our Wine and Spirits premiumization strategy gained significant traction during the fiscal year and the divestiture of several lower end wine brands positioned this business for enhanced growth and profitability going forward. In addition to the strong performance of our business units, our company also stepped up to help industry partners and communities impacted by COVID and natural disasters and to lend our voice and support in combating social injustice in the U.S. This commitment continues through our additional 1.75 million contribution to the National Restaurants Associations Education Foundation, announced earlier this week to support on premise recovery efforts, as well as our recent 10 million contribution to the Clear Vision Fund, designed to invest in minority-owned businesses, primarily those operating in underserved black and Latinx communities and through our most recent efforts to address the disturbing trend of violence against people of Asian descent across the country. In this regard, let me once again extend our deepest sympathies to victims of these deplorable acts and our continued support of members of the Asian community in this difficult time. Our strong business performance coupled with learnings from the past year and planned investments to enable growth, along with our continued commitment to making a positive impact on the world around us positions Constellation for continued success in fiscal '22 and beyond. Now, let's move to a more detailed discussion of our results and our plans for this year. Fiscal '21 marked the 11th consecutive year of growth for our beer business and reinforced our leadership position in the high-end of the U.S. beer market. We drove exceptional performance across our beer portfolio, led by our Casa Modelo brand family, including Modelo Especial, Modelo Negra and Modelo Chelada, which remains one of the biggest forces in the U.S. beer industry, delivering more than 13 million cases of growth to the beer category last year. Modelo Especial achieved yet another year of double-digit growth and now stands as the number three selling beer in the U.S. in dollar sales with more than 145 million cases sold last year, the only imported beer to ever surpass 10 million barrels in volume. Modelo Negra continues to be the number one dark beer in the U.S. category. While Modelo Chelada once again achieved double-digit growth and remains the number one Chelada brand in IRI channels. The Modelo brand family is on [fuego] [ph] but we're far from done. We have a tremendous amount of momentum with Casa Modelo and we continue to have huge growth opportunities in front of us. Our core Hispanic drinker remains the foundation of our business representing more than half of our volume, yet we're still growing volume, penetration and by rate with them. We're also making great progress with the non Hispanic consumer, where we've grown penetration by 25% over the last two years. And while we continue to grow simple distribution, our effective distribution levels remain below industry leaders. All this represents a massive opportunity to continue our momentum and double-digit growth for this brand family well into the future. During fiscal '22, we will continue to focus on making Modelo more top of mind with all consumers as we execute more high profile activations to further engage our drinkers and expand portfolio options to appeal to new consumers and unlock new occasions. These efforts will be supported by a 50% increase in digital, social and ecommerce media. Modelo will once again be an official sponsor of the Gold Cup soccer tournament, and will be a major advertiser for the brand throughout the high profile 2021 Summer Olympic Games. We will also be delivering high profile activations, to our biggest sponsorship as the official beer of the UFC. UFC's increasing popularity is allowing us to reach more young multicultural drinkers than ever. This past year, UFC reached over 41 million viewers on TV, grew their social following by 70% and became the number two largest sports property on YouTube. Modelo Chelada has been an extremely successful platform for us as well and in fiscal '22, we will take our next step on the path to growth by launching our newest flavor Modelo Chelada Piña Picante. Beyond Cheladas, we also have an opportunity to expand into the rapidly growing consumer trend of betterment by launching Modelo Cantarito styled cerveza, a refreshing better for you lighter lager made with a hint of real grapefruit, orange and lime juice. With only 100 calories it delivers lower calorie beer, but with a flavorful and authentic experience, as it was inspired by the traditional Cantarito cocktail from Jalisco, Mexico. And to top it off, consumers love the idea. This is the highest scoring Modelo new product concept we've ever had. As you can see, Modelo is poised for another great year in fiscal '22. Moving on to our next powerful brand family, the Corona brand family is thriving and embracing a new year full of possibilities. Our flagship Corona Extra brand remains the number six U.S. beer brand, growing IRI dollar sales by 11% and surpassing 2 billion in retail sales last year. In fiscal '22, you'll see a refreshed Corona, which will be enabled through a master brand strategy where Corona equities unite the entire family and each sub-brand delivers unique benefits to play to distinct occasions, consumers and motivations while staying true to Corona's DNA. We have a full year of master brand retail initiatives on-premise programs ready to go as markets reopen and experiential plans to play to consumers' passion points, like music and live sports. For Corona Light, our focus is on general market consumers, particularly females who seek important tastes with fewer calories. For Familiar, our focus is on acculturated Hispanics who shop in Hispanic dominant accounts. To ignite are Corona Originals, we will invest in national media spending across digital and social channels, as well as national English and Spanish language TV with a significant presence in major live sports properties such as March Madness, the NBA Finals, Gold Cup soccer and the NFL. The hotline will return to support our sports programs with Kenny Smith and Tony Romo covering the lines. Last year Corona's new La Vida Más Fina campaign was a smashing success and brought Corona back to the center of cultural conversation. With its Snoop and Bad Bunny content, generating an impressive 1 billion impressions across TV, digital and social. Snoop and Bad Bunny will be back this year to share their fine life wisdom along with new friends. This brings us to Corona Premier; Corona's answer to capturing growth in the exploding betterment segment. In fiscal '21, Corona Premier route depletions volume almost 20% and increased its penetration at a faster rate than its major competitor and other domestic lights, demonstrating we're successfully trading up consumers. Our golf and active lifestyle platforms for this brand will be supported by a retail program, continued strong media investments in key tournaments and are distinguished sponsorship of the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines in June. Moving on to Refresca which is Corona's answer for flavor seekers. Because of Refresca's unique flavor experience, it has been incremental to Constellation and the category bringing in a different consumer from beer and hard seltzer with a Hispanic index of 205 versus the FMB category. So we are happy to be able to bring the Corona Refresca variety pack back in fiscal '22 after a hiatus last year during the pandemic. We will also build on the initial success of Refresca by extending the brand into the growing high ABA F&B space with the launch of Refresca MÁS 24 ounce single serve cans with 8% ABA in mango citrus flavor. And this brings us to Constellation's most successful innovation yet, Corona hard seltzer. With only one SKU, the Corona hard seltzer became a number four brand family in a very short period of time, while consumers have flocked to this category, Corona's iconic image, multicultural consumer base and reputation as the number one most refreshing beer has allowed Corona hard seltzer to recruit new drinkers and expand the segment. In fact, Corona hard seltzer's year one volume delivered approximately 90% incrementality to our portfolio and continues to be the second fastest moving hard seltzer for brands with significant distribution. With no signs of slowing down, the Corona brand family expects ABAs to be a significant component in its future growth by expanding its base seltzer proposition and launching incremental innovation. We will continue to focus on growing distribution on variety pack number one, while introducing new SKUs to satisfy different tastes, occasions and channels. Our second variety pack is now in market with pineapple, strawberry, raspberry and passion fruit flavors. We tested a variety of flavors and consumers told us they wanted familiar great tasting flavors that pair well with a lime from Corona. In keeping with this theme of authenticity, amplified flavor and natural betterment attributes, we're excited to announce Corona hard seltzer Limonada, which is launching in June in a 12 pack variety pack, and will be line priced with Corona hard seltzer. Inspired by traditional Mexican recipes, Limonada will break the mold by delivering authentic flavor with a splash of real lemon and lime from Mexico juice and only 100 calories. To support the expansion of all Corona hard seltzers including Limonada, we plan to invest approximately 60 million across all marketing touch points to maintain the number one share of voice in seltzers during the critical summer months and will include investment in premium sports properties, like March Madness and the NBA. The plan also includes significant levels of Spanish language support to lean into Corona strength with Hispanics. Last year, nearly 20% of Corona hard seltzers volume came from Hispanics, an index of 136 versus the seltzer category. While we're on the topic, let me address the recent lawsuit filed by one of our competitors in opposition to our use of the Corona trademark for Corona hard seltzer. Earlier this week, we filed a motion to dismiss this lawsuit, as we find these claims to be completely without merit, a blatant attempt to restrain a strong and well established competitor in a high growth segment of the U.S. beer market. We have fully complied with the terms of our sub License Agreement, and we will vigorously defend our rights under our sub License Agreement and applicable law. We expect it will take several months for a court ruling on our motion to dismiss. In the meantime, we continue to operate business as usual, as we expect our plans in the ABA and hard seltzer space, where we fully expect to further build on our momentum for many years to come. Bottom line, the Corona family growth roadmap is focused on three strategic priorities in fiscal '22. First, we will reignite the core with a refresh Corona complete with new packaging best-in-class advertising, leadership levels of media and marketing investment and culturally relevant activations. Number two, we will execute breakthrough innovation which includes accelerating growth and betterment beer. And third, we will establish a beachhead in the ABA category. But let's not forget Pacifico. Let me repeat that. Let's not forget Pacifico, which is the fastest growing major Mexican import beer brand in the U.S. on a dollar sales basis and is on its way to becoming the next scalable national beer brand in the Constellation portfolio. We're doing things differently this year with the Pacifico with a focus on Gen Z consumers whose attitudes over index with Pacifico's independent spirit. Our action sports and cause initiatives resonate strongly with their passions and values. For the first time, we'll have national coverage on major Gen Z relevant digital and social platforms, including Hulu, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter and Twitch. This will be year four of Pacifico being the official beer of the X Games, both summer and winter. 2021 is also an Olympic trials year and we'll continue our strong partnership with the U.S. ski and snowboard teams with activations at competitions across the U.S. and robust media support on NBC. I'm also excited to introduce Pacifico's first ever innovation created for Gen Z consumers with our first for new flavors. Pacifico's Citrus Agave Lager, [indiscernible] inspired and made with a hint of agave, sea salt and lime flavor. We're launching this month in two test markets San Diego and Dallas with three SKUs. We look forward to sharing these results and showing how innovation can grow the entire Pacifico portfolio. From an operational perspective, I'm pleased to announce that we recently completed the 5 million hectoliter expansion of our Obregon facility, which when added to our existing capacity provides incremental flexibility. As is typical, it will take some months to fully optimize this operation over the coming months. Because our beer business continues to significantly outperform the U.S. beer market driven by ongoing robust consumer demand, we are absolutely committed to satisfying this growing consumer demand for our iconic brands, including Corona, Modelo, Pacifico and Victoria. As such, we have developed plans to invest in the next incremental capacity in Mexico that will provide long-term flexibility to equip us with the next necessary production to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, which has consistently grown in mid-to-high single digit range and is expected to continue to grow at these levels into the foreseeable future. It will also provide incremental flexible capacity that will allow our breweries to operate at sensible utilization rates and deal with unplanned challenges from things like weather related issues that impacted the business during our recent fiscal year end. These have been key learnings from the pandemic. Our investments will not only support the expected future growth of our core portfolio, but for the emerging ABA or alternative beverage alcohol space and hard seltzers. Meanwhile, in addition to these initiatives, we continue to engage in constructive conversations with the Mexican government as it relates to our long-term plans for production in Mexico. Together with government officials, we're exploring options that include finding an alternative location in the southeast of Mexico that has adequate water supply and a skilled workforce. Garth will provide additional financial details in just a few minutes. To sum it up, the U.S. beer category is healthy and exhibiting strong growth led by the high-end segment. Last year off premise channels within the beer category grew 15% with the high-end growing more than 25%. The velocity of our portfolio as well as the growth and margin profile of our high-end beer business is best-in-class. We're deliberate about our innovation efforts to ensure they're focused and disciplined and we're well positioned against where the consumer is going and the future of this industry. We have significant distribution runway for our healthy core portfolio, we will continue to capitalize on the growth of the Hispanic population and the premiumization of the U.S. middle markets. And we are focused on ABA growth leveraging our core brand equities because we see this as a significant growth opportunity as well. As a reminder, our fiscal year started March 1 and our first quarter runs through the end of May. As most of you know last year, this coincided with the beginning of the pandemic when we experienced robust consumer demand for our products that lead to record trends in off premise tracked channels as consumers were in the pantry loading phase of the pandemic. In addition during the spring of 2020, we slowed production in Mexico due to COVID which led to some out of stocks in the U.S. marketplace during summer months. As a result should expect to see muted IRI and Nielsen trends early in our fiscal year due to the year-over-year unfavorable overlap until we start to overcome last year's out of stock issue when we expect our scanner data to improve significantly. However, recent four week IRI trends show the Constellation's beer business is significantly outpacing the total U.S. beer industry and is outperforming the high end of the beer market. Let's now move on to results of our Wine and Spirits business. Fiscal '21 was a year of significant progress for our Wine and Spirits business. The Gallo deal and related divestitures allowed us to sell several lower end brands; we established category leading digital capabilities. We optimized our route to market to accelerate performance and built a robust innovation pipeline while driving solid results in the face of a very challenging external environment. In fact, our retained Wine and Spirits portfolio excluding divested brands delivered net sales growth of 5% for the year, driven by double-digit volume growth from Meiomi, Kim Crawford and The Prisoner brand family. These same brands also achieved double-digit distribution gains in off premise channels last year. Impactful innovations were also a driving force for growth and included Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon, Kim Crawford illuminate and the Prisoner Unshackled, which became the number one high-end new brand in IRI channels in fiscal '21. The Wine and Spirits business is well positioned to consistently grow net sales low to mid single digits and produce operating income growth ahead of net sales to achieve a 30% operating margin over the medium term. This will be achieved by the business delivering a margin accretive mix, implementing disciplined pricing actions, taking out stranded costs and executing other cost and efficiency improvements. In the near term, we expect fiscal '22 organic net sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. And what gives us confidence in these goals, we have solid plans in place to assure that our Wine and Spirits transformation focused on premiumization continues to gain traction. Our high-end brands are well positioned to drive mix in margin expansion. And we plan to continue to take price on select products within select markets throughout the year. We'll leverage the strong equity of these key core brands while building momentum through fully integrated marketing campaigns and partnerships to drive distinctive and consistent messaging that creates demand for these brands, including Kim, Meiomi, Woodbridge, Ruffino, the Prisoner, High West and Svedka. We remain committed to driving mix in margin accretive, scalable innovation by successfully addressing consumer trends, including the convenience RTD and betterment categories. We have a strong innovation pipeline planned for the coming year that includes the introduction of Woodbridge wine seltzer, the expansion of Svedka RTDs after a successful first year launch, and New Prisoner family innovation that includes the launch of the Prisoner Pinot Noir, Saldo Red Blend and Unshackled Sauvignon Blanc. We also plan to benefit in year two. From this past year successful innovation launches of Meiomi Cab, Kim Crawford Illuminate and the Prisoner Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon. Our Wine and Spirits brand continued to outpace the ecommerce category fueled by our outstanding performance in Instacart, Drizly and Amazon, and our wine DTC growth continues to outpace the market by close to 2x. In fact, Svedka has become the number one mainstream vodka on Amazon, while Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc and Meiomi Pinot Noir claim number one positions in their respective categories on Drizly, one of the largest online marketplaces for beverage alcohol. The early investments we made in this space has given us a key first mover advantage, and will continue to invest in DTC and ecommerce initiatives as consumers shifts where and how they purchase beverage alcohol. The evolution of our Wine and Spirits strategy includes a critical next step to build category leading dedicated fine wines and craft spirits business which will strengthen our portfolio and capabilities in this space to meaningfully inflect our business towards the high-end. We believe that dedicating the proper focus and attention to our fine wine and craft spirits business will complement our leadership in our mainstream and premium businesses and will accelerate our goal to drive incremental profitable sales growth. As we pursue industry leading growth for our Wine and Spirits portfolio, we are constantly assessing our route to market strategies to ensure we stay ahead of consumer trends and maximize our growth opportunities. Our distributor partners play a significant role in achieving our goals and creating value for the market. To that end, we recently announced the evolution of our Wine and Spirits wholesale structure, whereby Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits assume distribution responsibilities across approximately 70% of our U.S. Wine and Spirits brand portfolio effective April 1. Southern is a proven brand builder, with advanced capabilities in growing consumer segments, including digital commerce, fine wine and craft spirits and ready to drink. And they have category leading sales capabilities across on and off premise channels. We plan to leverage their strengths in these areas to help accelerate our category leadership. We are confident they are the best partner to help us achieve our strategic ambitions and we believe this move best positions us for long-term success and accelerated growth. Moving on briefly to Canopy growth. Over the past year Canopy has made significant progress in strengthening their position in core markets and taking steps to prepare for the inevitable legalization of Cannabis in the U.S. Canopy successful rollout of Cannabis beverages as well as other [indiscernible] 2.0 products has helped the company gain momentum. Currently, Canopy has the top three beverages in the Canadian recreational market and they recently introduced their popular Quatreau CBD beverages in the U.S. Over the coming year, we look forward to benefiting from Canopy's continued March toward profitability, the rollout of Canopy branded products in the U.S. through Canopy's arrangement with acreage and the improving legal landscape for cannabis in the U.S. In closing, let me reiterate how proud I am of the performance delivered by our Constellation team, along with our distributor and retail partners during a tumultuous year. Because of their grip, passion and determination, we're operating from a position of strength as we head into the new fiscal year and we're poised to deliver a solid year of performance again, in fiscal '22. We will continue to invest aggressively to accelerate growth for our strong portfolio of industry leading brands. We have exciting innovation in-store for the coming year. And we're building capabilities in emerging channels, such as three-tier ecommerce, while adding production capacity to fuel our growth over the long-term. Make no mistake, we have bold ambitions for the future and look forward to delivering on our long-term vision, which includes generating industry leading returns for our shareholders over that timeframe. And with that, I would like now to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results for fiscal '21 and our financial focus for fiscal '22.
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. Despite a volatile environment and various headwinds experienced throughout the year due to COVID-19, fiscal '21 marked another great year for Constellation brands demonstrated by a robust financial results and solid business performance with pretty strong beer operating performance and cash flow results, with our Wine and Spirits premiumization strategy continues to gain momentum and is well positioned to execute growth now that the Gallo transaction is finally closed. Specifically, in fiscal '21, we achieved strong EPS growth and delivered comparable basis EPS excluding Canopy growth of $10.44. In addition, we generated record operating cash flow and free cash flow of 2.8 billion and 1.9 billion respectively, which enables significant debt reduction of $1.7 billion and reduction of our net leverage, excluding Canopy equity earnings as we ended the year at 3.1x. And lastly, we returned 575 million of cash to shareholders in dividends. Now let's review full year fiscal '21 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer, net sales increased 8% on shipment volume growth of approximately 7%. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divesture, organic net sales increased 10% driven by organic shipment volume growth of 8% in favorable price and mix. Our full year organic net sales slightly outperformed our previously communicated expectations primarily due to incremental shipments made during the fourth quarter in order to return to normal levels of distributor inventory at fiscal year end. Depletion volume growth for the year came in above 7% driven by the continued strength of the Modelo and Corona brand families. As throughout the year, strong performance continued in the off premise channel and more than offset the impact of the 51% year-over-year reduction in the on-premise channel due to COVID-19. When adjusting for one less selling date in the year, the beer business generated 7.5% depletion volume growth. Moving on to beer margins, beer operating margin increased 110 basis points versus prior year to 41.1%. Benefits from marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales, pricing, the Ballast Point investiture and foreign currency more than offset unfavorable operational and logistic costs and mix. The increase in operational costs was driven primarily by higher material costs and brewery compensation and benefits. While, the increased logistics costs predominantly resulted from strategic actions taken to expedite beer shipments in order to accelerate inventory replenishment across the network. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption related to increased production in fiscal '21. While, marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 30 points to 9.7 versus prior year, this result landed above our previous guidance in the 9% to 9.5% range driven by incremental strategic investments made during the fourth quarter to provide continued momentum as we head into fiscal '22 and the spring selling season. Moving to Wine and Spirits, net sales declined 7% and shipment volume down 16%, while our retained portfolio for the year achieved net sales growth of 5% driven by double-digit volume growth and robust mixed benefits from Meiomi, Kim Crawford, the Prisoner brand family, as well as pricing benefits from Woodbridge and Svedka. Full year net sales results outperformed our previous expectations, primarily due to stronger mixed benefits and some incremental shipments of our retail brands in the fourth quarter. Depletion volume declined approximately 3% mainly driven by the brand's that recently divested, while depletion volume for our retained portfolio declined approximately 1%. The slight decline in our retained portfolio depletion volume was largely driven by strong fiscal '20 Woodbridge volume buy-in ahead of the price increases that went into effect on March 1, 2020 as well as their strategic efforts made throughout the year to right size inventory on hand at several chain retailers in key states. While, this resulted in negative impact of depletion trends for the fiscal year, this will allow for better inventory management going forward. Moving on to Wine and Spirits margins, operating margin decreased 150 basis points to 24.5%, has benefits from price and mix are more than offset by higher COGS, Wine and Spirits divestitures and increased marketing and SG&A spend. Higher COGS was mostly driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption of approximately $29 million resulting from decreased production levels as the result of the wildfires. Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Corporate expenses came in slightly better than our previous guidance, finishing at approximately $229 million, up 2% versus last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits, unfavorable foreign currency losses and an increase in charitable contributions, primarily driven by COVID-19 support, all of which were partially offset by a decrease in insurance related costs and T&E spend. Couple of the basis interest expense for the year decreased 10% by approximately -- to approximately $386 million, primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continue to decrease our leverage ratio. Our comparable basis effective tax rate excluding Canopy equity earnings impact came in at 18.2% versus 16.1% last year, primarily driven by a lower level of stock-based compensation benefit and higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses. Stock-based compensation benefits came in slightly better than expected during Q4, in addition, we realized some small miscellaneous benefits. As a result, this drove tax break favorability versus our previous guidance. Moving to Canopy, in fiscal '21, we recognized an $802 million increase in the fair value of our Canopy investments, of which $270 million was recognized in Q4. These were excluded from comparable basis results. The total pre tax net gain, recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $1.1 billion, which increased significantly during the fiscal year driven by Canopy's robust share price movement. Now let's briefly review Q4 results. Beer net sales increased 16% primarily due to shipment volume growth of nearly 16%. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture organic net sales increased 18% driven by organic shipment volume growth of approximately 17% and favorable mix. Depletion volume growth for the quarter came in above 6%, however, when adjusting for one less selling day in the quarter, the beer business generated 7.5% depletion volume growth, which is in line with full year trends and our medium-term growth algorithm. As you're all aware, inclement weather affected the South, predominantly Texas during the last few weeks of February. These abnormal and severe conditions did have a slight impact to our Q4 depletion trends as we're estimating that we lost approximately 50 to 100 basis points of depletion volume growth in the quarter. As previously guided, shipment volume continued to significantly outpace depletion volume during the quarter and as mentioned earlier, this resulted in distributor inventories returning to more normal levels at fiscal year end. As expected, beer operating margin decreased 250 basis points to 36.8% as higher marketing spend and increased COGS were partially offset by benefits from favorable SG&A as a percent of net sales, the Ballast Point divesture and foreign currency. Marketing as a percent of net sales was 12.5% or 380 basis points higher than Q4 last year, driven by the shift to spend from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year and incremental marketing investments. Wine and Spirits net sales were down 19% for the quarter, while shipping volume was down approximately 33% reflecting the brands divested during the quarter. Our retained portfolio net sales were up 7% driven by strong shipment mix benefits as discussed earlier. Operating margin decreased 900 basis points to 19.9% primarily reflecting the negative impact of the wildfires on COGS, increased marketing and SG&A spent. In Wine and Spirits divestitures partially offset by benefits from favorable mix. Keep in mind that for approximately two-thirds of the quarter, we had a smaller business posted investitures that was burdened by the full impact of stranded costs on that smaller business. During the quarter, we also recognized a net loss of approximately 46 million in connection with smoke damage sustained during the wildfires, which was excluded from our comparable basis results. Moving to fiscal '21 free cash flow, which we defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated a record 1.9 billion of free cash flow, which reflects strong operating cash flow. CapEx totaled 865 million and was in line with our most recent guidance. This included approximately 700 million of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion primarily to support the Obregon 5 million hectoliter expansions. Moving to our full year fiscal '22 P&L and cash flow targets. For fiscal '22, we expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $9.95 to $10.25, which excludes Canopy equity earnings impact. For our beer business in fiscal '22, we are targeting net sales growth of 7% to 9%, which includes one to two points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio and operating income growth of 3% to 5%. This implies operating margin migrating to the low to middle end of our range of 39% to 40% driven by several costs headwinds we expect to encounter in fiscal '22 due to the following. First, we are estimating a significant step up in depreciation expense, driven primarily by the incremental 5 million hectoliters at Obregon that was recently completed. For fiscal '22, we are targeting total beer segment depreciation expense to approximate $260 million or an increase of approximately $65 million. Second, similar to previous years, we're expecting substantial inflation headwinds in the low to mid single digit increase range, largely related to glass and other packaging materials, raw materials, transportation and labor costs in Mexico. Third, as the growth of hard seltzers and alternative beverage alcohol categories continue to rapidly expand, we expect to continue to experience unfavorable mix impacts as their margins are diluted from a gross profit perspective, due to the incremental packaging costs and flavor additives. Furthermore, we also anticipate a negative mix impact driven by incremental keg volume versus prior year driven by the continued reopening and return of business to the on-premise channel. And lastly, we expect margin headwinds related to the brewery expansion costs which include increased headcount and training expenses. To help partially offset these headwinds, we expect to execute against our aggressive cost savings agenda. And as stated earlier, expect pricing benefits in the 1% to 2% range. As a result of staggering our fiscal '21 fall price increases throughout the back half of fiscal '21 and in some instances into fiscal '22, we expect to shift more pricing from the fall to the spring in fiscal '22. Lastly, as it relates to beer marketing spend from fiscal '22, we expect marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 10% range, keep in mind that marketing spent during the first half of fiscal '21 was significantly muted resulting from COVID-19 related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and or postponements. For fiscal '22, we expect to return to our typical spending cadence, which is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the fiscal year. Moving to Wine and Spirits, for fiscal '22, the Wine and Spirits business is targeting net sales and operating income to decline 22% to 24% and 23% to 25% respectively. This implies operating margins to approximate 24%, which is flattish to prior year on a reported basis, which shows significant margin expansion on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the Wine and Spirits divestitures, organic net sales is expected to grow in the 2% to 4% range. The transformation of our Wine and Spirits business is underway and over the next few fiscal years, we're committed to removing stranded costs and executing against other cost savings, mix and price and efficiency improvements and we expect to continue to achieve margin expansion as we migrate to operating margins of approximately 30%. Other fiscal '22 guidance assumptions include interest expense in the range of $350 million to $360 million, corporate expenses to approximately $235 million, comparable tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings of approximately 19%. Non-controlling interest is expected to be approximately $40 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at approximately $196 million, this assumes no share repurchases for fiscal '22. We expect fiscal '22 free cash flow to be in the range of 1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of 2.4 billion to $2.6 billion in CapEx of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, which includes approximately $900 million target for Mexico beer operation expansions. I think this is a good spot to elaborate on our capital expansion initiatives for our beer business that Bill touched on earlier. As Bill outlined, our beer business continues to significantly outperform the U.S. beer industry driven by robust consumer demand, as such it is essential that we invest appropriately in order to support this growth for our core beer portfolio, as well as the emerging ABA or alternative beverage alcohol space. These investments include a 5 million hectoliter expansion at Nava dedicated to ABAs, including hard seltzer that is expected to be completed in early fiscal '23. And we are in the process of expanding Obregon to 19 million hectoliters to be completed by the end of fiscal '25. As a result, you should expect our annual CapEx spend for the beer business to be in the 700 million to 900 million range to support this 15 million hectoliter capacity expansion during fiscal year '23 to fiscal year '25. These projects are expected to generate solid returns as our beer business has a high operating ROIC and a best-in-class margin profile, despite the incremental depreciation expected from our CapEx investments. Even with the capital expenditures associated with these initiatives, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth allow us to remain focused on operating below our targeted leverage range, which provides us with the flexibility to execute our $5 billion cash return commitment over the next two years. Our brewery operations in Nava and Obregon have long been part of the fabric of these communities. As part of our expansion efforts and commitment to making a positive impact on the communities where we operate, we will continue working with local authorities and community based organizations on sustainability initiatives that benefit local residents. For instance, over the past several years, Constellation has helped support local infrastructure investments in Obregon that have enhanced water efficiency in the region, more than offsetting our water use at this facility. This is in addition to other benefits we provide including local job creation and fueling economic development. We are working with local partners in Nava on similar initiatives. Lastly, given the current state of activities in Mexicali, we will be unable to use or repurpose this site for future use. Therefore, we expect to take an impairment of approximately $650 million to $680 million in Q1 of fiscal '22, which will be excluded from comparable basis results. However, as Bill mentioned, we actively continue to work with government officials in Mexico to pursue various forms of recovery for the costs we have incurred in constructing the brewery and determine next steps in Mexicali. In closing, I want to reiterate our expectation to continue to have significant capital allocation flexibility as we head into fiscal '22, which will enable ongoing progress in returning cash to shareholders, while making strategic investments to support long-term growth initiatives. Fiscal '21 was a challenging year, yet one that provided key learnings resulting from operating in a volatile environment due to the pandemic. First and foremost, the growth and margin profile of our high end beer business is best-in-class and we expect it to remain as such well into the future. In order to maintain this momentum, we are committed to an exciting innovation agenda, which includes capitalizing on the robust growth in the ABA space while continuing to support the strong growth momentum of our core beer business. This requires us to expand and optimize our production footprint, which not only sets us up for long-term growth, but provides us with contingent capacity to operate sensibly utilization rates will providing us with much needed flexibility. We believe this is the right strategy in order to support our beer business that continues to outperform the market driven by robust consumer demand and we are absolutely committed to satisfying these demands. With that Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open. Check to see if you are on mute Lauren, your line is open. I don't think we have her here. Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: So on the beer demand side, I guess short-term, we've now cycled COVID. Maybe you could just give us an update on March depletion trends and what you're seeing in April so far? And then longer term, can you touch on the growth opportunity from here on Modelo Especial, it seems to be defined the growth slowdown that happens to a lot of other brands as they get much larger. So it would just be helpful to take a look forward at the key drivers from here in terms of incremental distribution, expansion, innovation, contribution, demographics, et cetera, some of the key drivers that happened in fiscal '21 and your thought process going forward in terms of the growth drivers with that brand? Thanks.
William Newlands: Absolutely. We're very pleased to say that March has gotten off to an excellent start. And March was certainly ahead of what our trend line was coming in. So we're very pleased with the start of the New Year, April, obviously, it's a little early to judge. Relative to Modelo, there's really no end in sight for its double digit growth profile. It continues to grow with the Hispanic community and obviously, it is a nice tailwind because of the growth in the Hispanic community. But we still have great distribution opportunities. We continue to grow our velocities on that brand. And when you think about the penetration increasing in the non-Hispanic community 25% over the last couple of years, we're barely scratching the surface. As you probably know, we really only started to advertise outside the Hispanic community over the last few years. So the upside within that community we think is tremendous. And as you also know, we nearly never done any innovation in that other than watching the Chelada line, which of course is quickly become the number one Chelada. We think there's just a tremendous opportunity for Modelo to continue to grow for a long time to come. It's only number three at this point. There's plenty of room still to go up.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.
Kaumil Gajrawala: If I may just ask about buybacks and you reiterated your $5 billion commitment, but it wasn't included in the release, I guess in terms of what buybacks are going to be for fiscal '22. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about that?
Garth Hankinson: Sure. Thanks, Kaumil. We are absolutely committed to meeting our $5 billion commitment over the course of the next two years. And as you know, that includes a significant amount of share repurchases $2.5 billion worth of share repurchases. As we entered this year, we said we were going to have two real commitments as it relates to capital allocation, one was paying down debt and then second was making significant progress on that return of capital. Throughout the year, as we noted, we did pay down debt quite a bit. We started the year at about 3.92x and we've ended at about 3.1x. And, we paid down the -- the Gallo transaction closed in early January, we didn't pay down the last tranche of debt, the $5 million redemption in early February. And at that point, we had some things that we were doing that we had to clear up most notably, finalizing our analysis on Mexicali, and then the subsequent, further investment in capacity. So that's why we didn't make any progress in fiscal '21. But we fully expect to make meaningful progress this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: I guess I had a question on your guidance. I understand the headwinds you guys called out that are going to pressure your operating income this year, but I guess I'm trying to think through some of the levers you might have to offset these pressures, beer pricing for one comes to mind, as you called out, your pricing was softer last year, it was under 1% for the fiscal year, which is below your typical 1% to 2% range. So how should we think about your willingness to take more pricing this fiscal year to offset some of these incremental cost pressures? Would you be willing to go above your typical range? And then, finally, how much visibility do you have with some of the commodity and transportation headwinds that you're facing? Curious, are you fully hedged, for instance, on some of these commodities?
William Newlands: Sure. Bonnie, I will take the first half of that. We believe the 1% to 2% pricing actions that we take pretty much on an annual basis is the smart way to approach it, it balances the opportunity to get improved revenue scenarios with the recognition that, you do have some price sensitivity within certain consumer groups that consume our brands. So you always walk that delicate balance of where you go. And our view is 1% to 2% is a good amount that allows us to continue to maintain the strong momentum within our business that we have. As you know, we continue also to aggressively increase our spend overall against our marketing platforms. And that will only be expanded when you think about some of the innovation agenda. So we're very optimistic about the whole platform. But we're getting much beyond that, I think in any one year, it is probably not the best way to approach that question. And Garth, you might answer her second please.
Garth Hankinson: Sure. Just on the opportunities on the hedging, Bonnie, so first of all, every year, our ops teams and our production teams are looking for ways to take costs out of the business, still continue to look for those as we go through the year. So those are possible levers as we move forward. But quite candidly, those cost savings get harder and harder as time goes on. As it relates to our hedging position. As you know, we have a fairly robust and sophisticated hedging policy that allows us to layer in hedges on both commodities and on currencies over the course of many years to take advantage of favorable rates. So we've done that in order to mitigate what otherwise may have been higher inflation this year. That being said, we're not fully hedged in any one thing, whether that's currency or commodities. And so to the extent that there are any improvements as rates, we could benefit from those as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane: My question for you just related to Mexicali and I guess, just trying to think through, of the -- I guess roughly $800 million that we've spent there, in terms of just cash back -- what are the sort of opportunities to maybe recapture some of that cash, whether it's repurposing the equipment, the land – maybe selling land? Also, will there be any cash tax benefit? You basically wrote that off as a loss and then there's a cash tax benefit, just trying to understand how much of that cash we could think about you recouping over the next year or two?
William Newlands: So obviously, Bryan, we continue to work to mitigate that impairment, but obviously we felt it was time to take that impairment. We have repurposed a number of the equipment things that we have there into other facilities as part of our expansion of the other facilities. And we're going to -- we're continuing discussions with the government as well, relative to mitigating the impairment for the future as well. But I do think it's important to note one thing, though, we're not going to let this setback and admittedly, we're not happy about it. We're not going to let this get in the way of focusing on our growth and meeting the growth and high demand that we have for our brands over the long-term. The reason where we're doing the capacity expansion that Garth talked about previously, is because our demand continues to be aggressive, A, on our core business, and B, we're going to get after the ABA/seltzer space, in an even more aggressive way than we have up to this point. So we're not going to let this get in the way of us meeting consumer demand for our brands in the future. Garth, do you want to comment on that one?
Garth Hankinson: Yes. Just as it relates to further recovery. So first of all, the impairment kind of is net of what we think we've recovered to-date, right. So we have been moving equipment out of Mexicali and over to Obregon, in support of the 5 million hectoliters that just went live. We continue to do that to support further expansion at Obregon. And really taking the impairment is -- and making the decision to move on is the first step in further evaluating what our next options are, which, as you indicated, could include things like selling the land and whatnot. And then, just further as it relates to any the negotiation of the conversations, I should say that the Bill referenced, we do expect that there will be some additional recovery in that --recovery could come in many different forms, it could come in cash payments, it could come in tax credits, it could come in infrastructure credits, things of that nature. So, we're certainly not done, as it relates to trying to recover any lost costs.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen.
Vivien Azer: My question is on your margins, understanding that there some very clear structural headwinds that you're contending with and even to offset with cost savings. I am a little bit surprised that your E&P guidance is not a little bit higher, given the substantial amount of new product activity. So I was hoping you could just elaborate on kind of what informed the range in order of magnitude how you're thinking about prioritizing that spend.
Garth Hankinson: I'm sorry, Vivien, I was trying to understand the question. So I think what I heard you say you're asking the question around what's driving the, or trying to get a sense for that the scale of what's driving the margin dilution. So as we said, about a third of the dilution is driven by the inflation, which we discussed, about a third of that is coming from the increase in depreciation. And then, a third of that is from the mix impact moving towards seltzers and ABAs.
William Newlands: Well, advertising is going to be consistent going forward with what our historical trends have been in that sort of mid nine's range. We're obviously in a growth business like ours, that's still a significant increase year-on-year on what the total spend is, because it's coming off a very much higher top-line than it was in the prior year. So we're actually spending a lot more in our marketing spend than we had in prior years.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.
Kevin Grundy: I wanted to drill down on your views for the hard seltzer category, if I could. Three part question. So one, has the category slowdown that we're seeing in the Nielsen data in the first quarter? Is that in line with your expectations, obviously, very difficult year-over-year comparisons, but that being said, still moderating. Two, what are you forecasting for the seltzer category this year? What's embedded in your outlook? And then, the last piece is maybe touch on your level of satisfaction with your market share at this point, understandably, you're leaning in now, you talked about the $60 million ad campaign. That being said, as we look at the Nielsen data your market share is hovering in the 3% area. How is that relative to your expectations? Where do you expect that to go here over the next 12 months?
William Newlands: Sure, two or three of those things, we'll try to get them all. It's not unexpected in a category that's continuing to bring in new consumers that you have some seasonality effects. We certainly saw greater seasonality effect over this recent period than we saw a year ago as an example. Our view is, that's likely because you have a significant higher percentage of either early or less consistent user. So it wasn't really a surprise, it still remains a growth sector within the beer industry. Our forecast it's going to continue to grow and continue to be a very important part, which is why we're more than doubling our capabilities against hard seltzer for this particular year coming, that we're just starting. We believe this is going to be an important part. And it also provides an interesting entree for people into the overall beer category. Relative to the market share, as you know, as we expanded our capabilities that allowed us to do additional SKUs, we did almost 10 million cases this past year with one SKU, which is kind of an outstanding launch, if you will. But the expansion that we are putting in place is going to allow us to more than double that we've already introduced SKU number two and number two variety pack, and we have Limonada coming online, here this coming June. So our expectations is, you'll see a significant increase in our share proposition, in part because we'll have more available to the consumer. And we'll have more shelf space on the warm shelf and more cold back space in the cold box as well. So we're very optimistic about what our profile will look like as the year goes on.
Garth Hankinson: Yes, Kevin, just to follow up on that really quickly, so that the growth that you're seeing so far is, fairly well, in line with what we're expecting. We're expecting growth in the category this year to be in that 40% to 50% range.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean King with UBS.
Sean King: I guess with your fiscal year ending, since then, seems like the market has opened up quite a bit, I guess, I'd love to know a bit more about what you're seeing in the on-premise. And also within that any change in distributor inventory level, then the more markets reopen?
William Newlands: You're starting to see difference and obviously, it varies by state. So for instance, it got a little tighter in California in the early part of this calendar year than we had anticipated, but overall, we're starting to see some increase in the on-premises, you would expect recalling that sort of it's going against the time last year when it was off more than 50%. So we certainly would expect some of that. I think that the open question, it's very difficult to predict, quite frankly, is where the all the whole channel mix ends up going. It's an open question. As you know, we are somewhat less susceptible to the on-premise channel than some of our competitors, because our overall profile is SKUs more to the off-premise anyway. But certainly, we're optimistic and as more of the U.S. population gets vaccinated, we're hopeful that in the summer months, it begins to look a little bit more like what a typical year would be. But it's still a little early to make that call.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.
Rob Ottenstein: Just two follow ups, one for each of you. Bill, can you talk a little bit more about Pacifico, on every call, you get progressively more excited about it, which is great. Can you talk maybe, sort of the reasons to believe that it's going to be a major national brand? And then, Garth maybe touch on how you're thinking about the mix between share buybacks and dividends? It seems evident from the release just a 1% dividend increase. Why so little and is that just, the way you're looking at things is that you'd much rather prefer share buybacks particularly at the depressed valuation of the equity.
William Newlands: Well, Robert, Patty always warns me about being too giddy, but I must say it's tough not to be giddy when you look at some of the results around Pacifico. Consistently you're seeing four week trends in IRI that are up in the 30 plus percent range. That the core business in Southern California continues to do extremely well and it's developing across the country. Again, we really just are scratching the surface of building out with this brand to be. But my old friend Bill Hackett always said Pacifico, starting to look a lot like Modelo looked about 15 to 20 years ago in terms of the development and how it really started out in the California bases. Modelo is now the number one brand in the state of California. I'm not making a prediction that Pacifico will be the number one brand, but it wouldn't be the worst thing that ever happened. So I certainly -- there's just a lot to be excited about you, you then add in that we're starting to do some innovation and some innovation testing in that brand with Gen Z consumers. This brand very much over indexed with Gen Z consumers. So we're bringing in a somewhat different audience than what we have with some of our other franchises. So, again, it's early days, but there's just so much to be excited about with Pacifico. We really think this could easily be the next big franchise within our overall portfolio. Garth, over to you.
Garth Hankinson: Sure. And on the sort of capital allocation question regarding share buybacks and dividends. I mean, look in the construct of everything we're trying to do from a capital allocation standpoint is, we want to make sure that we maintain investment grade, we want to make sure that we return to shareholders what we previously said we would return to shareholders, which was about 2.5 billion of share buybacks and 2.5 billion of dividends. And we want to make sure that we have the flexibility to invest in our business, as we talked about investing significantly in Mexico to support the robust growth of our portfolio. So all of that goes into the mix when we're trying to decide where to spend the money. And as it relates, specifically to dividends, versus share buybacks, we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of our payout ratio right in the target of what we've set for ourselves. So that's why we didn't increase it more. And by keeping it where we are, we're able to do all those other things that I said, return a significant amount of money in share repurchases, invest behind the brand, maintain our investment grade rating.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.
Chris Carey: I just wanted to follow up on a couple of the prior answers. I guess, just one, I'm trying to understand what's embedded from an off-premise and on-premise standpoint for next year, it seems like, even if you get half of the on-premise back, you're looking for only low to mid [teen digitally] [ph] off-premise. And if on-premise comes back and full, off-premise basically, implies did not grow next year. And I guess what I'm trying to understand is, is that just a construct of difficult comps, in the off-premise? Or is there something else in play? Because clearly, commentary from the trade seems positive, Nielsen scanner was good even on, COVID comps, you get innovation coming through. So I'm just trying to understand that. And if I could sneak one and just on distributor inventory, you mentioned that inventory seemed back at the levels where you want to but at the same time, the trade would suggest that you're still trying to catch up. Can you just add a little bit more perspective around that?
William Newlands: Sure. So let's start with the inventory, our inventory levels came out last year at roughly a normal level. And we expect that it will stay roughly within that range, we have no major change in expectations about changing inventory. Relative to on-premise, remember, today, it's only 6% of our business as it currently stands, because of the significant decrease that's occurred based on COVID. So our expectation is, we're still going to see very robust growth in the off-premise, during this fiscal year. And as you've seen, we're consistent with our long-term growth algorithm that we've seen already stated March is off to an excellent start. So we're very optimistic about that algorithm. But with that said, it's also going to be difficult to exactly predict what will happen with the on-premise, because we've already seen as markets have opened and then closed a little bit and reopened, there's just a lot of variability that's hard to predict. Again, while there is an over expression in the off premise, that isn't the worst thing for us, our business is over skewed into that area. And we continue to expect robust growth within the off-premise channel for this for this fiscal year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: So I wanted to just -- since we've covered a lot of grounds on beer, a bit on Wine and Spirits. What are you seeing with the reopening and also anything in terms of the switch between at home and on-premises, anything about promos and how you're going to position your focus brand?
William Newlands: Well, the biggest switching that we've seen is a significant increase in three tier ecommerce. As we said in my prepared remarks, we were quite pleased the fact that we got way ahead of that we were already investing against that capability. And we've accelerated that investment, which really in our view gives us a first mover advantage in this particular area. And you're seeing that change, I'm sure just as a shopper, we've all seen in-store a significant increase of Instacart, click and collect and some of those alternate ways of people buying considering how they used to buy. Direct to consumer is also up, we're pleased that we are performing at more than 2x the growth profile of DTC and we've also invested in that area, you'll recall earlier, last fiscal year, we bought Empathy, in part to radically improve our capabilities in the direct to consumer. And we are now leveraging that across many of our other brands. So we're very excited about those opportunities and that being an increasingly important part of the future of the Wine and Spirits business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with DB.
Steve Powers: Maybe just to round out and build on the capacity expansion discussion. You start early with Bryn, if I think just out beyond the fiscal '23 to '25 plans at Nava and Obregon. Is it fair to assume that additional expansion would take shape outside those two facilities? Or is there more room to expand those locations? And I guess in terms of those new locations, Bill, I think you mentioned exploration of future sites in the southeastern part of Mexico, which I think is consistent with preferences that have been expressed by the Mexican government. But just can you elaborate on your considerations there because if does play out, you'd be shipping long distances to get to the southern border of the states. And just thinking -- just want to think through how you're thinking about overcoming those dynamics just to preserve overall efficiency?
William Newlands: Well, let's put a little bow on the whole scenario about building out our capabilities. One of the things that we've been quite good at over the last several years, is running our plants at hyper efficiency. But I think one thing is learning from the pandemic. And I think any good business should have an element of learning when something hits you in the face and the pandemic certainly did that across many, many, many industries. One of the things we learned is, well, our efficiency was tremendous; we didn't have a lot of flexibility in the event that something didn't go well. And so one of the pieces that we are doing with this expansion is not only to meet the hyper growth that we have within our business, but also to create some increasing flexibility and some redundancy within our business. So that if you have weather challenges, or God forbid, we had another pandemic, but if you had weather challenges, or some other curveballs that occurred, it would have minimal to no impact on our ongoing supply. So that was very important. Relative to the southeast, we are considering that it's critically important to have water supply, it's actually a lot of shipping capabilities to some of the areas that we are looking into. So we're pretty confident that could very well be a future location for a brewery for us. Admittedly, that's a bit out, it takes two to four years to even get that process going and underway. But we're certainly evaluating it because we think it could be a long-term very viable solution for our business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.
Laurent Grandet: So like to actually follow-up on Kevin's question on the seltzer category. So last year, when you launched Corona seltzer, you said you will spend about [$40 million] [ph] to use the brand. So a year later Corona seltzer is about 2.5% of market share in the last four weeks and SCV is down 60%. So what makes you believe that with two new SKUs, one being launched late in the season just in June, and spending about $50 million, which by the way, we'd be happy share of voice of last year, you will be more successful. And actually what success would look like for you in the fiscal year 2021 in seltzer?
William Newlands: Sure. Well, let's keep in mind that 60 million, that'll be the number one share of voice in the seltzer category during the critical season. So, our view is that's a very important and loud efforts against that particular sector. Secondly, again, you got to keep in mind, we produced everything we could possibly produce last year and we sold it. It was probably the most successful introduction the company's ever had with the corona hard seltzer. So we were very pleased with our position. What we did see is there remained a lot of opportunity, it remains a growing sector in the beer business, we only have one SKU expanding our footprint to meet more consumer needs and occasions and flavor profiles was going to be very important. And it also gives us the chance to get expanded reach and velocity at both warm shelf and in the cold call box. So we think having the number one share of voice in this particular category, coupled with our new introductions that are coming this year, we're very excited about what our share profile will look like as the year goes on.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Newlands for closing remarks.
William Newlands: Thanks very much. And thank you all for joining the call today. I know it was a bit longer than some of them. As a result of our continued robust performance and financial discipline this past year, Constellation Brands achieved strong earnings growth generated record cash flow and significantly reduced our debt providing solid momentum as we head into fiscal 22. Our beer business has an exciting innovation lineup for the coming year and we expect our core portfolio to continue to generate robust growth as well as we've talked earlier today. In order to satisfy this robust consumer demand, we have plans in place to execute our next increment of capacity expansion and we are pleased to be in the position to continue investing in Mexico and enhancing our operational platform. Our Wine and Spirits premiumization strategy gained significant traction during this past fiscal year and the divestiture of several lower end wine brands positions this business for enhanced growth and profitability going forward. We look forward to speaking with all of you again in late June when we will share the results of our first quarter of our new fiscal year. Before then, we hope you'll choose some of our fine products for your spring celebrations, including Cinco Se Mayo and Memorial Day and let us all hope they are a bit more normal. Thanks again and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-01-07 11:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands Q3 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be open for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's third quarter 2021 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the Company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.
William Newlands: Thank you, Patty. Good morning and happy new year, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter call. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had an opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products in whatever form your celebrations took. Before I jump into my prepared remarks, let me first acknowledge the disheartening and tragic events that unfolded in our nation’s capital yesterday. I join other leaders across the country in condemning the violence that occurred, instead calling for a peaceful transfer of power that upholds our democracy and calling for peace, unity and stability as we move forward as a nation. Now, let’s move on to a discussion of our business performance. 2020 was certainly a challenging year, and like many of you, we are happy to turn the page. As we do so, are mindful of the words of American novelist, James Lane Allen who said, “Adversity does not build character, it reveals it.” This is certainly the case for us. Our team rose to meet many challenges that surfaced in 2020. This included overcoming many negative impacts from COVID, most notably a significant volume reduction in the on-premise, a slowdown in production of our Mexican beer portfolio heading into our busiest selling season, and threats to the safety, health and wellbeing of our team members. Despite all that, we continued to build momentum for our high-performing beer brands and launched Corona Hard Seltzer just as the pandemic started to gain steam in the U.S. Impressively, this remains one of the most successful new product launches in our company’s history. We continue to transform our Wine and Spirits business, leveraging innovation to drive higher growth and margin performance, while investing in capabilities needed to win long-term, such as DTC and 3 Tier e-commerce and successfully working through the complexities of our transaction with Gallo, which now that it is complete positions our Wine and Spirits business to become a more meaningful contributor to our overall growth profile. And we have also supported our communities by providing much needed assistance to those impacted by COVID and West Coast fires, by taking steps to achieve greater racial equity within our company, our industry and our surrounding communities, by once again earning recognition from the Corporate Equality Index as a great place to work for members of the LGBTQ community and by improving our Carbon Disclosure Project ratings for climate and water stewardship. While 2020 will be remembered for many things, what I will remember most is the character that was revealed by our leaders and team. Preventative measures implemented across our business helped mitigate impacts related to COVID, while maintaining full employment resource levels. I continue to be impressed by the – inspired by their resilience, focus and determination for driving the success of our business, and this bodes extremely well for our future. Thanks to the tireless efforts of our team, our business partners, we delivered excellent third quarter results. As Garth and I run through the highlights of the quarter, there are three things that I ask you to keep in mind. Number one, our beer business, the biggest catalyst of our growth remains extremely strong with accelerating trends in IRI. Consumer demand for our core beer brands continues to be robust. The introduction of Corona Hard Seltzer has exceeded our expectations and we are back to gaining share in IRI as we continue to recover from the slowdown in production earlier this year due to COVID. Number two, the completion of our transaction with Gallo to divest a number of our lower-end wine brands priced at $11 and below in retail has set the stage for accelerated growth and profitability, driving focus more fully on a tighter set of powerful brands that already have traction with consumers. And number three, despite the challenges faced in 2020, we are on track to deliver another strong year of growth, consistent with our long-term goals. I’m proud to say that our business remains healthy, allowing us to provide fiscal 2021 guidance that I am sure you will agree reinforces our strategic growth priorities and strong cash generation capabilities. This is truly a testament to the strength of our team and our brands. So let’s dig a little deeper with a more fulsome discussion of our beer business performance in the quarter. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, including the continued partial closure of the on-premise, which was down about 35% year-over-year, Constellation’s beer business continues to be one of the largest contributors to U.S. beer industry growth, delivering depletion trends of plus 12% in the quarter. And while some depletion growth we saw this quarter included benefits from inventory restocking, the portfolio delivered accelerating underlying trends that align with our sales growth projection of 7% to 9% for the foreseeable future, as consumer demand remains exceptionally strong for our products across the majority of the portfolio. In fact, Constellation’s beer portfolio posted IRI consumer takeaway dollar growth of more than 15% for the third quarter. As you know, the COVID-related slowdown of our beer production in Mexico earlier this year has impacted this year’s shipment and volume net sales trends. The good news is that we’ve returned to a position of gaining share in IRI-tracked channels, as we continue to replenish inventories to more normal levels, which we expect to accomplish by fiscal year-end, a process that’s actually taken a little longer than originally planned due to continued strong consumer demand for our brands. So let’s take a deeper dive into the key brands that drove these excellent trends for our beer business. The Corona Brand Family grew nearly 12% in IRI channels, led by particularly strong contributions from Corona Premier, Corona Hard Seltzer and Corona Extra. With the launch of only one SKU to date, Corona Hard Seltzer continues to exceed our expectations and remains in a strong number-four position in the Hard Seltzer category. It also has the distinction of being the second fastest moving Hard Seltzer among major seltzer brands, while continuing to maintain strong incrementality levels at nearly 90%. Early next fiscal year, we plan to launch Corona Hard Seltzer Variety Pack #2, which will offer consumers the same great Corona taste and refreshment attributes while expanding to new flavors, including pineapple, strawberry, raspberry and passion fruit. Variety Pack #2 will be followed shortly thereafter by the introduction of another exciting new hard seltzer initiative. We believe these product launches will help further strengthen our competitive position in the fast-growing hard seltzer category, broaden our distribution reach and enhance our market share in the high-end of the U.S. beer market. These initiatives will be supported with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build upon our hard seltzer portfolio. 2020 marked the 30th consecutive year of Corona’s iconic O’ Tannenpalm commercial that was airing on TV during the holiday season. As the longest-running beer commercial of all time, O’ Tannenpalm demonstrates the strength and resilience of the Corona brand, including Corona Hard Seltzer, which continues to resonate with consumers and remains one of the most beloved consumer brands in the world. Modelo Especial was the most significant growth contributor within our portfolio for the quarter. This exceptional brand has excellent marketplace momentum and achieved the number one spot as the top share gaining imported beer in the U.S. beer category, with depletion growth of almost 20%. Modelo continues to gain traction with general market consumers, while sustaining momentum with its core Hispanic consumer, driven by the authenticity of the brand and our marketing efforts. The success of Modelo has been driven in part by impactful marketing initiatives that include high profile sports programming with the NFL, NBA, NCAA Football, Spanish language soccer, as well as an ongoing presence on Facebook and Instagram. Finally, Pacifico was also a top share gainer within the import segment during the quarter, continuing its strong momentum with depletion growth of nearly 20%. We remain excited about the future growth prospects for this brand, as we continue to increase awareness and expand distribution beyond its core market of Southern California. As we said before, Pacifico has all the makings of the next big brand in our beer portfolio. From an operational perspective, we plan to complete the 5 million hectoliter expansion of our Obregon facility in early fiscal 2022, which is a slight delay versus our original plans due to pandemic-related construction slowdowns for this project last year. After the completion of the Obregon capacity expansion, we believe we will have ample capacity at the Nava and Obregon breweries to meet consumer demand over the medium-term, which includes more than doubling our seltzer production capacity heading into the next fiscal year. Overall, our excellent year-to-date results provide confidence in our ability to achieve 7% to 9% net sales growth for fiscal 2021. In addition, we have increased our operating income growth target to 8% to 10% for the year. Now let’s move on to the quarterly results for our Wine and Spirits business. As I mentioned earlier, the closure of the Gallo deal and other pending transactions will include a series of actions which positions our Wine and Spirits business for accelerated revenue growth and operating margin performance going forward. We are grateful for the dedication of our Constellation team and the support and collaboration from Gallo and our business partners as we ensure a smooth transition. With the completion of the divestitures, we believe the Wine and Spirits business is positioned to grow net sales low-to-mid single digits, while producing operating income growth ahead of net sales growth as the business works to take out stranded costs and execute against other cost, price mix and efficiency improvements to achieve a 30% operating margin over the medium-term. In the near-term, we expect the remaining portfolio post the Gallo deal to generate fiscal 2021 net sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. With these transactions now behind us, our team can more fully concentrate resources and focus behind a smaller set of more premium brands that better align with consumer-led premiumization trends. During the quarter, we continued to see the staying power of these trends as premiumization continues to drive elevated growth across the total beverage alcohol segment, further reinforcing the transformation strategy for our business. Our higher-end wine Power Brands, at the greater than $11 retail price point outpaced the U.S. high-end wine category IRI channels, driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner Wine Company portfolio, all of which posted double-digit growth in IRI channels for the quarter. Overall, we expect these brands to be key growth drivers of the business long-term and we are extremely bullish on the future runway for these higher growth higher-margin brands. During the quarter, successful new innovation initiatives also contributed to topline growth with Power Brand introductions like The Prisoner Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay varietals, along with Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon, which has become this year’s biggest ultra-premium wine introduction in IRI channels based on dollar sales. In addition, several other innovation initiatives launched earlier this year continued to gain traction and drive growth, including brands like Unshackled from The Prisoner Wine portfolio, Kim Crawford Illuminate and Woodbridge Spirits Barrel Aged varietals just to name a few. And let’s not forget, Woodbridge wine go-packs, which became the number two innovation this year in IRI channels based on dollar sales. We are also successfully driving our digital commerce initiatives which are gaining momentum. Since our acquisition of Empathy Wines, we have continued to make significant progress in leveraging their unique platform and capabilities across our portfolio within the DTC and 3 Tier e-commerce space. We have launched several new DTC sites, leveraging the Empathy platform, including The Prisoner Wine Company, Double Diamond and Simi. We believe this category will be a meaningful pillar of growth for Constellation in the future. In fact, our Wine Power Brands competing in the e-commerce space are outpacing the overall wine category as our early investment in the category is providing us with a meaningful first-mover advantage. During the quarter, we became the first CPG company to partner with Instacart to feature our products on Facebook ads, propelling Constellation to the next level of 3 Tier e-commerce media by enabling us to refine and optimize our ad creative and targeting based on real-time data. Furthermore, it is important to our growth and margin profile that we continue to invest in this space, since DTC is heavily weighted towards the higher end of the wine category as wines priced $20 up, make up nearly 90% of total DTC sales. Now moving on to a discussion of our investment in Canopy Growth. We are pleased with the progress the Canopy Growth team has made in defining and strategically positioning themselves in the U.S. CBD and legal THC cannabis markets, which will be beneficial upon U.S. federal permissibility, which was probably enhanced with the change in the Senate that’s occurred in the last 48 hours. Canopy’s core BioSteel beverages are now the official sports drink of the Dallas Mavericks, The Philadelphia 76ers and the Toronto Raptors and has several standout athlete and influencer partners, including the reigning NFL and Super Bowl MVP, Patrick Mahomes. In fact, Canopy predicts that CBD beverages can grow at a 35% CAGR through 2025 as consumer realize the compelling benefits from CBD beverages. In addition, BioSteel now has two exclusive partnerships with Manhattan Beer and the Reyes Beer Division, two key Constellation distributors, which will give Canopy the ability to gain traction in the U.S. market well ahead of its competitors in the emerging CBD space. In September, Canopy launched Martha Stewart branded CBD product line, which is available on shopcanopy.com and several other outlets, including its new national distribution agreement with The Vitamin Shoppe retail locations, just in time for the holidays. Canopy will continue to seek strategic partnerships like the one with Martha Stewart to drive consumer awareness of these products. Overall, we believe that Canopy will be a significant long-term growth opportunity for Constellation, and we believe they remain best positioned to win long-term in the emerging cannabis space. In closing, I want to take you back to the key takeaways mentioned earlier. I am extremely proud of the results of our team and what they have driven in the face of continued adversity. Our beer business, the biggest catalyst of our growth remains extremely strong with accelerating trends in IRI. The completion of our transaction with Gallo to divest a number of lower end brands priced at $11 and below at retail has set the stage for accelerated growth and profitability. Despite the challenges faced in 2020, we are on track to deliver another strong year of growth consistent with our long-term goals. Our excellent third quarter performance drove strong cash generation, which coupled with the finalization of the Gallo deal, enhances the financial profile of our business, enables further debt reduction and allows us to continue to execute our commitment to return $5 billion in value to our shareholders through fiscal 2023. Our business remains extremely healthy and these strong results are truly a testament to the strength of our team and our brands. And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Garth, who will review our financial results for the quarter. Garth?
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. Constellation Brands continues to demonstrate its resiliency by generating robust financial results and continuing to focus on debt paydown despite a volatile environment and various headwinds driven by COVID-19. Specifically, during our third quarter, we generated comparable basis EPS, excluding Canopy Growth of $3.16, an increase of 32% versus prior year, delivered strong operating margin and accelerating double-digit depletion growth for our beer business and increased operating cash flow and free cash flow by 14% and 23% respectively, resulting in ongoing debt repayment and achievement of target net leverage, excluding Canopy equity earnings as we ended the quarter at 3.3x. As Bill mentioned, we are very pleased to have closed the transaction to sell a portion of our Wine and Spirits business to Gallo, including the Nobilo wine brand, as well as closing the transaction to sell our concentrate business to Vie-Del. As an update, we expect to close the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy transaction within the next several weeks. Post transaction closing, we are left with a more focused and premium portfolio which nicely positions our Wine and Spirits business to produce low-to-mid single-digit topline growth, while migrating to an operating margin of 30% in the medium-term. In total, at transaction close, Constellation received cash of approximately $560 million and the opportunity to receive up to $250 million in earnouts if brand performance targets are met over a three-year period after closing. We also received approximately $130 million related to the closing of the Nobilo deal and expect to receive approximately $265 million from Sazerac upon closing the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy deal. In total, from all transactions, we expect to receive approximately $955 million before tax and we expect the overall tax payments related to the transactions to be approximately $50 million, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2022. The cash proceeds from these transactions will facilitate further debt reduction, so we can continue to execute on our commitment to lower our leverage ratio and to return $5 billion in value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through fiscal 2023. The cash proceeds received from Gallo reflect a significant inventory adjustment. Due to the prolonged timing of the Gallo deal, we were able to sell through a significant amount of finished goods inventory that was originally slated to go to Gallo. Also, as indicated last quarter, we have flexibility in how we source grapes to mitigate any shortages due to wildfires. As a result, we decided to retain a portion of bulk wine inventory as we had a higher and better use for it is a replacement for smoke-tainted bulk resulting from the wildfires. Those two factors resulted in substantial cash flow for Constellation throughout the fiscal year. Before we jump into the quarterly financial results, I’d like to provide an update on guidance. Due to the continued resiliency of our business and further clarity of the operating environment, we have issued fiscal 2021 EPS guidance and are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to range between $9.80 and $10.05. This range excludes future Canopy equity in earnings impact and accounts for the respective timing of the previous mentioned deal closures. Now let’s review Q3 performance and our full-year outlook in more detail, where I’ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 28% and shipment volume growth of 27%. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales increased 30% driven by organic shipment volume growth of 28% in favorable price and mix. Depletion volume for the quarter accelerated and achieved 12% growth as inventory levels improved and strong performance continued in the off-premise channel, which more than offset the impact of approximately 35% year-over-year reduction in the on-premise channel due to COVID-19. Depletions in the quarter benefited by approximately three to four points driven by inventory restocking. While underlying consumer demand for our products remained strong, the robust shipment and depletion volume growth experienced during the quarter was enhanced by inventory replenishment at both the distributor and retailer level. As product inventories begin to rebuild from a COVID-related slowdown of Mexican beer production earlier in the fiscal year, this resulted in Q3 year-to-date organic shipment and depletion volume growth of approximately 6% to 7%, which is in line with our medium-term goals and accounts for volume timing between quarters. Due to continued robust consumer demand, product inventories are now expected to return to historically normal levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as shipment volume is expected to continue to outpace depletion volume for the remainder of the fiscal year. Moving on to beer margins. Beer operating margin increased 330 basis points versus prior year to 42.6%. Benefits from marketing and SG&A as a percent of net sales, foreign exchange and the Ballast Point divestiture more than offset unfavorable operational and logistics costs. The increase in operational cost was driven primarily by higher material costs, brewery compensation and benefits and depreciation, while the increased logistics costs resulted from strategic actions taken to expedite beer shipments from our breweries in order to accelerate inventory replenishment across the network. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption. On an absolute dollar basis, marketing dollars spent during the quarter increased versus prior year. However, due to favorable leverage driven by increased throughput at our breweries, marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 170 basis points to 9.3%. We now expect full-year fiscal 2021 marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9% to 9.5% range. Now let’s discuss balance of your expectations and full-year fiscal 2021 beer guidance. We expect net sales growth of 7% to 9%, which includes one to two points of pricing within our Mexican product portfolio. Excluding the impact to Ballast Point, we expect organic net sales to land in the higher end of the 7% to 9% range. We now expect fiscal 2021 operating income growth of 8% to 10%, which is an increase versus our prior guidance provided during the quarter. Furthermore, we expect full-year operating margin to range between 40% and 41%, achieving margin expansion versus prior year operating margin of 40%. Looking at Q4, a couple of items to touch on from a margin perspective, as the beer segment will experience some headwinds during the quarter. First, as a reminder, we took selective price increases this fall as we decided to stagger our annual price increases, and in some instances, these increases will shift in the beginning of our fiscal 2022. As a result, we saw pricing favorability muted in Q3, which will continue in Q4. Second, from a COGS perspective, we will continue to incur incremental shipping costs due to actions we are taking to accelerate the replenishment of inventory across the network. We also expect margin headwinds related to incremental headcount driven by the 5 million hectoliter expansion at Obregon, which is now expected to be completed in early fiscal 2022. Lastly, we expect increased marketing spend to be the largest headwind to margins in the fourth quarter, driven by the shift in spend from the first half to the second half of the fiscal year. Our Q4 investment will focus on incremental media in both the NFL and NBA, incremental digital media, and continue to support behind Corona Hard Seltzer, which includes a holiday spot, leveraging the equity of the iconic Corona Extra O’ Tannenpalm ad. These incremental investments made during the holiday season and into the beginning of the calendar year will provide continued momentum as we head into fiscal 2022 and the spring selling season. Moving to Wine and Spirits. Q3 Power Brand depletion volume accelerated and achieved nearly 4% growth as these brands continue to win in the higher-end and across the majority of price segments in the U.S. wine category. Overall depletion volume declined 1%, which reflected the brands recently divested. Wine and Spirits net sales increased 10%, and shipment volume up 3% driven by our Power Brands, as well as strong innovation contributions. Excluding the impact of the Black Velvet divestiture, organic net sales increased 13%, reflecting shipment volume growth of approximately 7%. Q3 net sales results outperformed our previously communicated expectations, primarily due to incremental shipments from the brands recently divested, driven by the timing of the Gallo deal. Operating margin decreased 200 basis points to 24% as benefits from price and mix were more than offset by higher COGS and increased marketing, driven by the shift in spend from the first half. Higher COGS was mostly driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption of $20 million resulting from decreased production levels as a result of the wildfires. This came in slightly favorable versus what we originally anticipated and guided for the quarter. However, we still expect to incur approximately $10 million of costs in Q4 associated with unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to the wildfires. During the quarter, we also recognized a $26.5 million loss in connection with the write-down of certain grapes as a result of smoke damage sustained during the wildfires. However, these costs were excluded from Q3 comparable basis results. We have insurance coverage that partially covers losses from grapes from our own vineyards and we are actively pursuing reimbursement from our insurance carriers. As we continue to work through our processes, additional write-downs of certain bulk wine inventory maybe needed for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, which would be excluded from comparable basis results as well. As a reminder, we do not expect a material impact to our ability to meet consumer demand for our excellent portfolio of products. Even though margins for the segment took a step back during Q3, the underlying fundamentals of our consumer-led premiumization strategy continue to shine through as significant mix and price were generated during the quarter. Strong shipment volume mix was driven by some of our fastest moving Power Brand such as Kim Crawford, Meiomi, The Prisoner Brand Family and we are continuing to see benefits from the pricing actions we took on both Woodbridge and SVEDKA at the beginning of the fiscal year. Moving along to balance of the year expectations and full-year fiscal 2021 Wine and Spirits guidance. We now expect fiscal 2021 Wine and Spirits net sales and operating income to decline 9% to 11% and 16% to 18% respectively, which reflects the closing of the Gallo transaction, including Nobilo and the concentrate transaction, as well as the Paul Masson divestiture. In addition, we expect the retained portfolio post divestitures to grow net sales in the 2% to 4% range this year. Looking ahead to Q4, a couple of items to touch on from a Wine and Spirits segment perspective. For Q4, we expect Power Brand depletion volumes to be muted due to the following. First, we are lapping strong Q4 fiscal 2020 Woodbridge volume buy-in ahead of the price increases that went into effect on March 1. Second, we are also lapping solid Q4 fiscal 2020 innovation driven by the rollout of Unshackled. And finally, we are continuing our efforts to right-size inventory on hand at several chain retailers in key states to allow for better inventory management going forward. Also let me provide an update on marketing cadence for the remainder of the fiscal year. In the first half of the fiscal year, reduced marketing spend provided margin benefits due to timing as we shifted spend from the first half into the second half of the fiscal year. Originally, we expected a majority of the shift to impact Q3. However, we now expect a shift in spend to be more equally distributed between Q3 and Q4. We are also expecting incremental investment in Q4, creating strong support for our Power Brands as we propel our momentum into fiscal 2022. This will result in an increase in year-over-year spend for Q4. Now let’s proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in at approximately $171 million, up 15% versus Q3 year-to-date last year. The increase was primarily driven by increased compensation and benefits, unfavorable foreign currency losses and an increase in charitable contributions primarily driven by COVID-19 support efforts, partially offset by reduced T&E spend. We now expect full-year corporate expense to approximate $240 million. This is a good spot to provide an update on our SAP S/4HANA implementation. I am excited to announce that the final phase of our SAP implementation is scheduled to go live on March 1, 2021. We have various business continuity processes and resources in place to ensure this transition goes as smoothly as possible and look forward to updating everybody on our efforts during our Q4 call. As a reminder, we expect corporate expenses as a percent of net sales to decrease by the end of fiscal 2022, once our digital enablement activities are fully implemented and we begin to eliminate redundant IT cost, allowing us to realize benefits of the new platform. Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 7% to approximately $96 million primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continued to decrease our leverage ratio. Fiscal 2021 interest expense is now expected to approximate $390 million. Our Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings came in at 17.7% versus 17.5% in Q3 last year, primarily driven by higher effective tax rate on our foreign businesses, partially offset by an increased benefit from stock-based compensation. As indicated last quarter, we expect our full-year fiscal 2021 comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity and earnings impact to approximate 19%, which would imply an increase in the Q4 tax rate driven by the timing of stock-based compensation benefits. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.9 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2021. This represents an impressive 23% increase and reflects strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. We are projecting full-year fiscal 2021 CapEx spend to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million, which includes $650 million to $750 million of beer CapEx as we expect an acceleration of spend during Q4, driven by the 5 million hectoliter expansion at Obregon. Furthermore, we expect fiscal 2021 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion and operating cash flow to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. Moving to Canopy. In Q3, we recognized a $770 million increase in fair value of our Canopy investments. These were excluded from comparable basis results. The total pretax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $834 million, which increased significantly from Q2 driven by Canopy’s robust share price movement during the quarter. In closing, I’d like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. As we’ve navigated through a challenging and volatile economic environment throughout the first nine months of our fiscal year, we believe it was financially prudent to focus on paying down debt and further reducing our leverage ratio. As a result of our strong cash generation profile, we’ve reduced our net debt by $1.2 billion since the end of fiscal 2020, which has led to further reduction of our leverage ratio to our target range. These financial strides coupled with the fact that our business has continued to remain resilient through this economic environment, now provides us with the flexibility to be opportunistic and resume share repurchase activity in the near-term as we remain fully committed to our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through fiscal 2023. We are also pleased that the Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $2 billion for share repurchases. And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. So beer depletion growth was obviously strong in the quarter even ex the retailer inventory rebuild on an underlying basis also. Just looking going forward to beer depletions, can you discuss your level of comfort that once we cycle COVID in March, you're back to sustained high single-digit beer revenue growth going forward, in line with the long-term goals, do you expect to return to historical levels of share gains? Also, basically just wanted to get an update on your visibility there on beer depletions and market share, particularly given the comments on high single-digit beer revenue growth in the foreseeable future. And then also, maybe can you just touch on if there is any risk specifically in fiscal Q4, with the rising COVID case counts and weaker on-premise trends before we cycle the COVID impact from last year in March? Thanks.
William Newlands: You bet. So let me try to unpack that a bit. Yes, one of the benefits that we've seen as our business has been moving through the year is that we are getting back to our long-term trends that we have previously announced. And that's driven quite frankly by the strength of our brands. Modelo in this quarter was nearly 20% depletion growth, Pacifico was the same. These brands are resonating with consumers. And keep in mind that's all being done – which relates to your second question, with on-premise trends that are really not very good. Year-to-date, on-premise for our beer business is off 53%. So I think the fact that we have produced these kinds of results with that environment speaks to the strength of our beer portfolio and the long-term positioning that we have for those brands. You then throw in the fact that we are more than doubling our capability in seltzer next year, and I think we should expect to see – consistent with our long-term trends, the growth profile we previously stated.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. Thank you. Hi guys and happy new year.
William Newlands: Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: I have a question on your full-year beer operating income growth guidance of 8% to 10%. Although you revised it higher, it actually still implies a pretty big hit to your beer margins in Q4. So I just really wanted to better understand why this is the case, especially as I look at the easy year-over-year margin comp and even factoring in the year-over-year increase you just called out in terms of marketing spend. So I guess I'm really wondering if you're simply being ultra conservative on the upside in operating income growth for beer or is there something else? Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. Thanks Bonnie. Yes, so we did increase the range a little bit there as you said 8% to 10%, and we did increase our margin outlook closer to 41%. So we feel really good about that margin profile by the way. But you're right, that does imply some bit of dilution if you will in Q4, so let me just give you some of the elements that make up that. As we said, the biggest driver of that is going to be marketing because we think it's important that we continue to spend behind the brands and support the brands, particularly Corona Hard Seltzer. And so there's going to be significant increase in marketing spend in Q4. Additionally, we have a couple of COGS-related headwinds in Q4. One is, as we've had even in Q3, which is freight and logistics, as we're doing things to expedite shipments into the U.S. to ensure that we're increasing our inventory levels to more historical levels. And then furthermore, under COGS, we also have increased headcount in Obregon as we get ready to turn on the next 5 million hectoliters of capacity at Obregon. And we also in Q4 have some brewery maintenance that we shifted out of Q3 and into Q4. And then finally, the last thing is just as we talked about, the staggered pricing increases that we've taken this year and we staggered them through Q3 and Q4 and some will flow into the first quarter of next year. So all of those together is what's leading to a bit of a giveback on margins in Q4.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your question, please.
Bryan Spillane: Hey. Good morning, everyone and happy new year.
William Newlands: Thanks, Bryan.
Bryan Spillane: So couple of questions. First one just on – question related to Seltzer. And I guess question is really just, as you look at it going forward and again thinking about an aspiration to be a top three player, can you just give us your thinking now in terms of how we should think about, is that going to include launching new brands and also just thinking about Topo Chico and co-working with Molson Coors, would you be open to maybe partnering with some other companies brands in order to sort of put more lines in the water I guess in seltzers?
William Newlands: Sure. Obviously, the seltzer category continues to remain strong. As we've said, we plan to more than double our capability in the seltzer area for Corona Hard Seltzer in the coming year. I mean the fact that we've done as well as we have with one SKU, this year one variety pack, we think is pretty impressive and certainly ahead of what our expectations were. But keep in mind we also have our toe in the water on some other things. Funky Buddha in Florida has performed extraordinarily well in the seltzer category, in that particular market, and we are extending that some in the coming year. We have a minority investment in PRESS, which has done – also done extremely well in the seltzer category. So we have our toes in the water in a number of ways. Certainly, our Corona Hard Seltzer is going to be our lead play and we think that is where the majority of our growth in that category will come from. As we said, we have a second variety pack that we're introducing at the beginning of the fiscal year, and then we have a couple of other things we might be doing which you'll hear more about as we go forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please.
Sunil Modi: Yes. Good morning, everyone, or good afternoon, and happy New Year. Just two questions from me. Bill, there's been some, obviously, controversy around Corona Seltzer given what some of the data has said in terms of deteriorating share trend. So I was hoping you could just provide some context around what everyone has seen versus what you guys are seeing in terms of that brand from a supply-demand and balance perspective? And then just as the brand continues to grow, are you going to have enough capacity to effectively execute the hard seltzer lemonade launch later in the year? And then my kind of secondary question is on Corona Light. Obviously, the brand has struggled relative to the other Corona franchises, and just curious what the plan is there over the next one to two years?
William Newlands: Sure. As it relates to Corona Hard Seltzer, we are more than doubling our capacity in that particular franchise for the coming year. And as you know and you commented, we're extending that into additional pack opportunities. We've sold everything we could make this year and we were very pleased with the performance. And frankly, that was – as I said earlier, that was a bit better than we expected to do. So we're quite pleased with where we stand in the overall seltzer market, and certainly with the more than doubling of capacity next year, we expect to remain a very strong player and a top three player in that particular segment. Keeping in mind, Nik, we have the second-best velocity in the category with that particular brand with one SKU. So I think as we're able to broaden our distribution reach on the shelf, I think we'll be very pleased with where seltzer is when we're sitting here a year from now. As it relates to Light, obviously a lot of our work and a lot of our time and energy has been spent on Premier, which we're very excited about, continues to be a big growth profile for us. So I think we need to think about that, particularly the Light business in conjunction with what we are doing across the overall Light category and our Premier, Corona Light et cetera. And I think, obviously, Light has been hurt some. However, the trends actually been quite good during this COVID timeframe.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen. Your question, please.
Vivien Azer: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Bill, it seems pretty clear you guys have a lot of your sleeve on the hard seltzer front with clear market share gain aspiration. But I was wondering whether you could comment at all on the deceleration that we've seen in the hard seltzer in scanner data over the last six or seven months? And how that informs what you think is kind of a better normalized growth rate for the category going from here? Thanks.
William Newlands: Yes. I think the one thing that we've probably seen a bit of is some seasonality this year. And it's not unusual, I don't think. As you get more and more people into the category, you get more consumers who are either less frequent users or experimenting in the category. And oftentimes, there is some movement around within categories when that occurs. You couple that when there is a bit more seasonality that we've seen this year than what we have seen in prior years. So I still think it remains a very strong growth category. It grew, if you remember on our call last year, we anticipated, or I made the comment that I thought it would at least double in 2020 calendar year. In fact, it did more than that as a category and we still see strong trends. So we think this is going to continue to be a growth category, although it's obviously, like any other category, it's difficult to continue to grow at the pace it has been growing.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hey. Good afternoon. A question, maybe housekeeping on this new share buyback. It's $2 billion on top of the remaining $1.9 billion. Is this on the same timeline as your original $4.5 billion kind of cash return to shareholders, or is the additional $2 billion stretched out over some more extended period given there's been a little bit of time? And then secondarily, could you maybe comment a bit on your distribution trends during the period in which you were supply constrained versus now that supply is starting to come back, if there was an ebb and flow there in any particular direction in terms of what we're seeing? Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. So I'll answer the first question there. So in terms of – you're right that the one point or that the $2 billion we just announced is in addition to the $1.9 billion. The additional $2 billion is to give us further flexibility around share repurchases and we're still committed to the $5 billion return to shareholders, half of which is share repurchases through the end of fiscal 2023.
William Newlands: And relative to distribution trends, we were actually quite pleased with our ability to hold shelf presence. As you know and we said in prior calls, we focused our attention on the 20-ish SKUs that represented more than 75% of our total portfolio during the time when we had a slowdown in production. So that allowed us to expand and extend some of those SKUs on shelf and allowed us to maintain our position. Obviously, now that we have been able to raise our production rates and we are filling in some of those scenarios that had occurred, we're quite pleased that we're maintaining and in fact growing our distribution platform going forward. Keeping in mind, in many instances, retailers did not do shelf reset during the COVID timeframe just because of the pandemic. So we're very comfortable with our distribution platform. We think that given some of the things we have coming down the path, we'll be able to extend that going forward as we have every other year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your question, please.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thank you. And I just want to talk a little bit about wine. It was really nice improvement in the Power Brands depletion versus the first half of the year. So was curious if you could talk a little bit about what drove that? Maybe there were some pull forward given the net sales outlook kind two to four. So curious what those dynamics. And then also, just the pricing and promotional environment in wine, the space where Kim and Meiomi play is certainly premium priced, but it feels like there's been kind of a bit more discounting activity out there. And so just kind of curious in your perspective on pricing at that price point where you play. Thanks.
William Newlands: Sure. Lauren, we're seeing two or three things in the wine space. First of all, given there has been some change in how the consumer purchases, more DTC, more 3 Tier e-commerce. Consumers are going with brands that are tried and true and we're fortunate to have some that are extremely well received. You noted a couple of – Meiomi has done extremely well, Kim, The Prisoner Wine Company. These are brands that are trusted by consumers, loved by consumers. And that certainly helped the process, particularly as peoples shopping patterns changed some. Secondly, our innovation agenda has worked extremely well. Things that we did earlier in the year, like Unshackled has done very well, as well as some of the newer things that we've done. We noted in my brief prepared remarks that Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the strongest individual entries that occurred in the entire industry this past year, and you add into that The Prisoner Cabernet and The Prisoner Chardonnay. We did very well with our innovation agenda as well. And I don't think we have seen – I would slightly disagree with your comment that there has been a more aggressive environment or aggressive promotional environment. Fortunately, the robust demand that we've seen in many of our Power Brands above $11 where we had lots of double-digit growers, our demand has been very strong and that has been the single biggest driver of our improved wine results is the sheer demand for our products and the fact that the consumer is looking for brands and products that they have great faith in, especially as their shopping patterns have changed some.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein from Evercore. Your question, please.
Robert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. I just want to drill down a little bit more into the accelerating depletion trends that you saw in the quarter, which were quite marketed. I mean, do you think this is just purely a function of the greater availability of your brands on the shelf or increase in media spend against them, the timing of your price increases and improving consumer? Just trying to get a little feel for those different drivers. And then tied into that, how do you see the distribution gains looking in terms of calendar 2021? Thank you.
William Newlands: Sure. I mean, there were a number of factors that weighed in on the improved performance. It starts and always will start with the strength of the brands. And certainly, as we were able to get our inventory position into a much better place during the quarter, it was reflected in our results and then it is reflected in the demand consumers had. Remember, we had roughly 15% growth across the beer portfolio and in IRI during the quarter, extremely robust growth, especially given the fact that on-premise was a drag to say the least. Fortunately again, we are a little less susceptible to the on-premise and some of the overall marketplace. But the sheer strength of our brands was a critical factor. No question, some of the depletion pieces Garth noted in his remarks were driven by our replacing some of the inventory that had decreased during the time when we were not able to produce. But I think we do need to keep in mind, the end of the day, it's all about consumer takeout, and consumers are strongly demanding our critical brands.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your question, please.
Kevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Happy new year and congratulations on the strong results.
William Newlands: Thank you.
Kevin Grundy: Bill, question relates to the competitive outlook. Building on Lauren's question from wine, but I'm going to kind of ask you from a beer and seltzer angle for the upcoming year. So the context for the question, given the obvious challenges from the pandemic this past year on-premise, out of stock this past summer, et cetera, many in the industry, including you guys, were really unable to support your brand sufficiently with marketing budget cut rather sharply. So my question is, what is your outlook? How are you guys thinking about the next 12 months in terms of the competitive backdrop, specifically around pricing and brand support as the industry returns to health? Do you foresee a more competitive backdrop than we've seen in the past as companies try to reinvigorate the top line, or do you expect a generally rational environment? Thanks.
William Newlands: I think it's tough to tell what others will do. What I'll tell you is what we plan to do, is we plan to continue to spend in that 9% to 10% range of our marketing spend in our beer business, and we've got a lot of good things to talk about. We're extending our investment against Modelo. We'll be reintroducing Refresco this year. Despite the tremendous performance, we have things like Refresco that we just stopped producing, and we're going to reintroduce even though it had a tremendous start before the pandemic hit. So we expect it to certainly be a competitive marketplace, but demand remain strong, and that's certainly to our advantage because our brands have performed very well in that mix. As we've said, we are going to continue to invest behind our brand. Our brands respond extremely well. Jim Sabia does an outstanding job with his team about making sure that we get tremendous returns against the dollars that we spend against our brands. And we expect that that sort of intelligent approach to investment behind our business will continue, and then when you add on the fact that we will be adding additional products into the mix that we will invest behind, I think we're going to have a very robust and aggressive year in building our brands for the future.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan Your question, please. You may have your phone on mute.
William Newlands: The COVID new issue.
Operator: Still not hearing you. Should I move on to the next questioner?
William Newlands: Yes, please.
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Sean King from UBS. Your question, please.
Sean King: Hi, great. Thank you. First off – and apologies if I missed this, but is there any color you can provide on the quarter-to-date completions, now that we're five weeks in, are you still reloading shelves? And then secondly, sort of looking longer-term at the on-premise. Your historic exposure, I guess, under indexed of the industry in like a pre-COVID world. As we think about the reopening, will that continue to be a case based on the way you're brands are positioned around occasions or could there be incremental shelves or incremental share gains in that channel as that trade focuses on higher velocity brands?
Garth Hankinson: So as it relates to our current depletions through the first month of the quarter, depletions continue to perform in line with where they are so far through the fiscal year-to-date and the expectation is that they'll continue like that through the remainder of our quarter. And then on the – I'm sorry, could you repeat the second part of your question?
William Newlands: Which channel – we missed it. Which channel are you referring to? I'm sorry.
Sean King: Sorry, I was just referring to the on-premise, that you historically under indexed the industry, and if there is an opportunity going forward that that mix could actually have incremental share gains with the portfolio?
William Newlands: Well, certainly, historically, as you said, we have under indexed in that. And we're seeing wide variability depending on what month, what state, what market, what city as to what's going on in the on-premise. That's been, frankly, the most difficult thing for any of us in the industry to project as to where it's going to go and how it's going to go there. What I would say is, we have very focused business plans against each channel. We plan by channel, as you would expect, and by customer; and we would certainly expect to have a strong showing in the on-premise once we get back to something resembling normalcy, acknowledging that the general consensus within the industry is that we are going to have a smaller on-premise coming out of the pandemic than we had going in, just because of the challenges that unfortunately many of our important accounts have had during the pandemic.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Christopher Carey: Hi, good afternoon. So I guess – I just wanted to talk about capital allocation, just to end things, but from a bit different perspective maybe than how it's been addressed so far. So I guess in July, Constellation had noted that after exercising that last batch of Canopy warrants that it was going to see how things unfolded in the U.S. and Canada. I mean, I'd argue that Tuesday's Senate results made the U.S. a much more tangible opportunity for cannabis much sooner. And I wouldn't expect maybe Canopy's spending to be as inefficient as it was in Canada, but certainly U.S. expansion requires money. And I just – I wonder if your thought process on these warrants has changed at all in the medium-term, because I think it'd certainly pick up a bit sooner, and how that factors into this renewed commitment to buybacks and just any perspective there? And I guess just on top of that – apologies for the long question at the end of the call – but that can also impact Canopy's profitability, is that an acceptable outcome? And so just any color there? Thanks so much.
Garth Hankinson: Sure. So just on capital allocation in general, our capital allocation priorities remain consistent with what we said earlier this year, which is continuing to pay down debt and getting into and maintaining levels inside our targeted leverage ratio that we're comfortable with. And we've made good progress on that this year. So far, we've brought our leverage ratio down about 59 basis points from where we started the year, about 39 basis points since the end of Q2, and we announced earlier this week that the early redemption of another $500 million in notes. So we're going to – that continues to be priority number one. And then, we are fully committed to the share repurchase program that we've previously announced, which is to return to shareholders $2.5 billion worth of capital through share repurchases by the end of our fiscal 2023, as well as dividends to make up the balance. As it relates specifically to the Canopy warrants, there is still – on the next batch of warrants, there's still two years left on those. So we don't need to make a decision anytime soon. Even with the performance of Canopy's share price, they're still not in the money. So we'll make the decision on those warrants much more closely to when they mature or to their termination date.
William Newlands: I would also just add to that, what Garth said, that keep in mind, Canopy has already had – is already well prepared for the U.S. market relative to their investments or their prepared investments in both acreage and terrace land, plus their cash position. So we would certainly expect that if there is any speed up in the federal legalization, that Canopy is well positioned to be a winner in the U.S. market going forward.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I would like to hand the program back to Bill Newlands for any further remarks.
William Newlands: Well, I'd like to thank everybody for joining our call today. Despite the challenges faced in 2020, we're again on-track to deliver a strong year of growth, which is consistent with our long-term goals. We're confident in the resiliency of our business. Our beer business remained strong as demand continues to be robust, while our Wine and Spirits premiumization strategy continues to gain momentum and is further enhanced by the completion of the Gallo deal. The health of our business has allowed us to provide fiscal 2021 guidance that reinforces our strategic growth priorities and strong cash generation capabilities. This, coupled with the closure of the Gallo transaction, allows us to continue to execute on our commitment to return $5 billion in value to our shareholders through fiscal 2023. As a reminder, during our next quarterly call, we will be providing our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. Thanks again, everyone, for joining the call and I wish you all a safe, happy and prosperous New Year. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2020-10-01 11:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands Q2 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's Second Quarter '21 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO.  As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at cbrands.com.  Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time.  Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.
William Newlands: Thank you, Patty. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Before I begin with a discussion of our performance in the quarter, I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the continued and unprecedented challenges of this year marked by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing social unrest rooted in a long history of racial injustice in this country, and the most recent string of natural disasters, including wildfires across the western part of the United States.  As it relates to the fires, fortunately, all Constellation employees are safe and accounted for, and there have been no direct impacts to any of our facilities. That said, our hearts go out to those who have been adversely affected by the fires, and we send our sincere thanks to the brave firefighters and other emergency personnel working tirelessly to battle the fires and keep people safe. I'd also like to thank the members of our Constellation team, who continued to pull together despite adverse circumstances to drive the success of our business, including excellent second quarter results. As Garth and I review these results, we'd like you to focus on 3 key takeaways. First, in what was expected to be our most challenging quarter of the year, our team overcame COVID-related headwinds to deliver solid business performance in Q2. This performance was led by our beer business, which grew depletions by almost 5% as we continue to see incredible consumer demand for our portfolio of brands.  While the COVID-related slowdown of our beer production in Mexico earlier in the year impacted shipments and net sales in Q2 and created some temporary out of stocks at retail, we are quickly recovering and expect inventory to return to normal levels by the end of Q3, and we're beginning to see accelerating consumer takeaway trends in IRI channels as we work to ensure that consumers can find their favorite Constellation products on the shelf at retail. Second, our wine and spirit premiumization strategy continues to gain traction as our higher-end wine power brands outpace the U.S. high-end wine category in IRI.  Regarding the Gallo transaction, both Constellation and Gallo remain committed to completing this transaction, and we're very encouraged by the progress that we've been making. We continue to receive positive feedback from the FTC staff and addressing the concerns that they raised related to the transaction. Based on our interactions with the FTC, we expect a consent decree will be submitted to the commissioners for review and approval in the coming weeks. We're happy to say that this marks the final stage in this process. Once final approval is received, closing can happen quickly, which allows us to forge ahead with the strategy for our wine and spirits business.  And third, the strong performance delivered by our beer and wine and spirits businesses drove strong cash generation, allowing us to further reduce our debt and progress towards our desired leverage range. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver a solid year of organic growth in fiscal '21. Let's move to a more fulsome discussion of our beer business performance in the quarter. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, including the continued partial closure of the on-premise, which was down 50% in the quarter year-on-year, Constellation's beer business continues to be one of the largest contributors to U.S. beer industry growth.  During the second quarter, our beer business delivered 11% growth in IRI channels overall and more than 15% growth for our priority SKUs. This performance was driven by 12% IRI growth for Modelo Especial as the brand solidified its position as the number three beer brand in the U.S. beer market, and the brand family is on track to deliver its 35th consecutive year of growth. The Corona Brand family also grew double digits in IRI channels, with the most significant contributions coming from Corona Hard Seltzer, Corona Premier and Corona Extra. We continue to be thrilled with the performance of Corona Hard Seltzer. Despite launching this new brand in the midst of a pandemic, which prevented us from engaging in a number of the activities conducive to introducing a new brand, Corona Hard Seltzer has become one of the most successful new product launches in our company's history. With the launch of only one SKU to date, the brand continues to exceed our expectations and has already achieved the number four position in the category.  To put this in perspective, Corona Hard Seltzer is the second fastest moving hard seltzer. Let me repeat that: Corona Hard Seltzer is the second fastest moving hard seltzer for those seltzer brands with significant distribution and velocity and remains strong as we continue to pick up distribution. These ongoing distribution gains have led to IRI ACV distribution approaching 70% since product launched in March. And to date, the brand has maintained incrementality levels at the 90% rate, significantly outpacing our expectations.  Corona Hard Seltzer over indexes to the Hispanic consumer relative to its competitors, which unlocks an untapped opportunity for this category with the fastest-growing demographic in the country. Currently, 15% to 20% of brand volume is estimated to come from Hispanic consumers, while other seltzer brands are closer to 10% to 15%.  Our expectations for the hard seltzer category growth are extremely high, and our intention is to become a top 3 player in the hard seltzer market as we believe there's a natural and compelling connection between what the Corona Brand stands for and what consumers want in a seltzer, refreshing great taste, hint of flavor and [ours] [ph] at 0 carbs, zero sugars and only 90 calories. In the future, you'll see us expand with new flavors, new packages and even new platforms. So stay tuned.  From an operational perspective, we continue to engage in constructive conversations with the Mexican government as it relates to our future plans for production in Mexico. Meanwhile, we're progressing with the 5 million hectoliter expansion of our Obregon facility, which is expected to be completed by the end of this fiscal year. As a reminder, after the completion of the Obregon capacity expansion, we believe we will have ample capacity at the Nava and Obregon breweries to meet consumer demand over the medium term. This includes more than doubling of our seltzer production capacity heading into our next fiscal year.  Let's now move to the quarterly results for our wine and spirits business. I'm pleased that we're nearing the finish line with the Gallo transaction, which paves the way for accelerated growth and margin performance for our wine and spirits business going forward. It also aligns with the vision for our business to be a bold and innovative higher-end wine and spirits company with distinctive brands and products delivering exceptional consumer experiences.  During the quarter, we continued to see the staying power of the consumer-led premiumization trend with premium price point segments continuing to outpace value price segments, further reinforcing the strategy of our business. In fact, our higher-end wine power brands at the greater than $11 retail price point outpaced the U.S. high-end wine category in IRI channels driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford and the Prisoner portfolio, all of which posted double-digit growth in IRI channels for the quarter. These trends drove excellent margin performance for the business as price and mix benefits for this higher-end stable of brands drove significant margin enhancement. Throughout the remainder of the year, we plan to continue to invest in capabilities that position our wine and spirits business for long-term success.  The wine and spirits innovation pipeline is primed with impactful product introductions as we enter the peak seasonal period for the business. These initiatives are aligned with the key consumer macro trends of betterment, convenience and sustainability that we believe can drive scale going forward.  Key product launches include the Prisoner Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay varietals, SVEDKA and High West ready-to-drink cocktails, Ruffino wine spritzer and Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon. These initiatives will be supported throughout the remainder of the year with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build the portfolio. And while we're already a leading player in 3 tier e-commerce, we're excited about our renewed focus on the direct-to-consumer space with our acquisition of Empathy and our minority investment in the Booker Vineyard's business as we believe e-commerce, including DTC, can become a key growth driver for our business.  E-commerce for beverage alcohol has exploded due to the pandemic, increasing 3 to 4x in volume versus prior year. We were focused on e-commerce as a growing channel even before COVID and have further accelerated our strategy with increased resources and focus on digital shelf management and redeploying marketing dollars to support our digital commerce channels.  Now I'd like to take a minute to address the unfortunate wildfire situation in the west in a bit more detail. As mentioned, and thankfully, all of our employees are accounted for and safe, and no Constellation properties have been impacted by the fires. While we're more than 70% through harvest, it is still too early to determine the overall impact the fires and resulting smoke might have on this year's vintage. However, we continue to perform extensive testing and evaluation, and we have considered a number of potential contingencies and options as we progress through harvest based on our perspective at this point. That said, we are committed to providing consumers with the same high-quality wine they've come to expect from our higher-end brands. And despite potential impacts from the fires, we fully expect to be able to meet consumer demand for our excellent portfolio of products. Garth will provide some additional details in a few minutes on that topic.  Now moving to our ventures portfolio. Last year, we announced our commitment to invest $100 million to support African-American black and minority-owned start-ups in the beverage alcohol space as part of our efforts to enhance diversity and access to opportunity within our industry. We're happy to say we've received significant interest in this program to date. We've also made good progress over the past several years with our focus on Female Founders initiative as female-funded and/or female-led businesses now account for more than half of our ventures portfolio. We see an opportunity to make similar progress in supporting African-American black and minority businesses in the coming years and look forward to updating you on our progress.  We've recently acquired a minority stake in the Booker Vineyard's business, a super luxury direct-to-consumer focused wine portfolio to further align our wine and spirits business to changing consumer preferences. We believe this relationship strengthens our fine wine portfolio and our long-term aspiration to build a strong omnichannel business that includes category leadership in DTC and 3 Tier e-commerce.  Additionally, we recently acquired the remaining interest in Copper & Kings American branding company, which marks our first full ventures acquisition. Copper & Kings is a cutting-edge distillery that primarily produces highly-differentiated American brandy with a tasting room and restaurant located in the heart of urban country in Louisville, Kentucky. This acquisition allows us to play in the rapidly emerging craft spirits market, where premiumization trends remain robust.  Finally, we're pleased with the progress that the Canopy Growth team has made in prioritizing a strategic direction to focus on what's needed to become a world-class CPG company. They've identified goals for their core markets, rightsized their footprint, balanced supply and demand needs, improved execution and made progress in reducing operating expenses and cash burn.  I'm especially excited about the successful launch of the Rec 2.0 cannabis beverage products in the Canadian cannabis market, where Canopy has a 75% market share and the top 4 SKUs in the category, shipping more than 1.6 million cans since launch in March. For comparison, in the calendar year 2019, a total of 4 million cans of cannabis beverages were sold in the entire U.S. market over the course of that year. So great progress to date. We believe that beverages and other Rec 2.0 products will attract new consumers to the market and further drive conversion from the illicit market. And earlier today, Canopy growth announced plans to bring its line of cannabis beverages to the U.S. next summer through its revised agreement with Acreage Holdings. Overall, Canopy remains the best position to win long term in the emerging cannabis space and is well capitalized to face the challenges associated with this current economic environment.  In closing, I want to take you back to the 3 key takeaways mentioned at the top. I'm extremely proud of the results our team has driven in the face of continued adversity. And what was expected to be our most challenging quarter of the year, our team overcame COVID related headwinds to deliver solid business performance in Q2. Our beer business continues to be a top growth driver within the industry, and we're seeing accelerating consumer takeaway trends in IRI channels as we work to rebuild our inventory position.  Our wine and spirit premiumization strategy continues to gain traction, and we are in the final stages of completing our transaction with Gallo, which paves the way for accelerated growth and margin performance for our wine and spirits business going forward. And our performance in the quarter drove strong cash generation, allowing us to further reduce our debt and progress towards our desired leverage range. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver a solid year of organic growth in fiscal '21.  This year also marks our company's 75th anniversary. We have a strong legacy of success that we're extremely proud of. Our continued growth and resilience will help ensure the future of our company remains extremely bright. And as I often like to say to our team, we firmly believe the very best is yet to come.  And with that, I would like to now turn it over to Garth, who will review our financial results for the second quarter.
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. Despite an uncertain economic environment and headwinds related to COVID-19, Constellation Brands continues to generate strong financial results. During our second quarter, we generated comparable basis EPS, excluding Canopy growth, of $2.91, continued to deliver strong margins in both our beer and wine and spirits segments and increased free cash flow by 10%, resulting in ongoing debt repayment and progress in achieving targeted leverage.  Now let's review Q2 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results, starting with beer. Despite reduced shipment volume in Q2 related to COVID-19, net sales were flat to prior year. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales increased 1% on organic shipment volume down 1%, which was partially offset by favorable pricing.  Depletion volume growth for the quarter came in at nearly 5% driven by Modelo Especial and the successful launch of Corona Hard Seltzer as strong performance continued in the off-premise channel and more than offset the impact of the nearly 50% year-over-year reduction in the on-premise channel due to COVID-19.  In Q2, we benefited from one extra sell day. When adjusted for the extra sell day impact, the beer business generated approximately 4% depletion volume growth. In Q3, depletion selling days are flat year-over-year. While depletion trends tempered in Q2 versus Q1 due to some out of stocks resulting from the slowdown in production earlier in the fiscal year, we remain confident in the strength of our business as underlying consumer demand remains quite robust. We are making good progress in rebuilding inventory supply across our network, both at our distribution centers and with distributors, following the production slowdown for roughly 2/3 of our Q1 and the beginning of Q2 that created out of stocks at retail and negatively impacted depletions during the quarter. We expect distributor inventory levels to return to more normal levels by the end of Q3 as shipment volume is expected to outpace depletion volume during the quarter.  Moving on to beer margins. Beer gross margin of 55.7% was flat to prior year as favorable pricing and the benefit of the Ballast Point divestiture was offset by unfavorable mix and increased operational costs driven primarily by higher material costs and reduced throughput at our breweries, resulting in unfavorable fixed cost absorption.  Marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 70 basis points to 8.4% as marketing spend decreased resulting from COVID-19-related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and/or postponements. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, beer operating margins increased 70 basis points to 42.5%.  Looking ahead to the balance of the year, a couple of items to touch on from a beer segment perspective. First, we plan on taking selective price increases this fall. For our pricing strategy, we implement price increases annually on a market-by-market and SKU-by-SKU basis depending on the dynamics within a given market. This year, our pricing approach remains intact. However, the timing of the price increases could be more staggered throughout the back half of the fiscal year and in some instances may shift into the beginning of our fiscal year 2020. With that said, for fiscal '21, we still expect 1% to 2% of pricing within our Mexican portfolio.  Second, our marketing spend in the first half of our fiscal year was significantly muted as a percentage of net sales decreased to 8.6% due to the lack of sporting and sponsorship events. However, during the back half of the fiscal year, we are committed to an increase in spending behind our brands, especially by leveraging the return to sports. As such, we expect marketing spend in the range of 9% to 10% of net sales on a full year basis.  Moving to wine and spirits. Our wine and spirits power brand strategy continues to gain momentum as marketplace performance for our higher-end power brands continues to outpace the higher-end segment. However, as expected, power brand depletion volume decelerated during the quarter resulting in a 1% decline, while overall depletion volume for Q2 declined 3%, reflecting the brands to be divested.  To better align with our strategy for the business going forward, we did not replicate some lower return incentive programs and pricing initiatives that ran during our Q2 fiscal '20. During the quarter, we also worked to rightsize inventory on hand at several chain retailers in key states. While this drove a negative impact to depletion trends in the quarter, this will allow us to better manage inventories on a go-forward basis.  Wine and spirits net sales declined 11% on shipment volume, down 19%. Excluding the impact of the Black Velvet divestiture, organic net sales declined 9%, reflecting shipment volume decline of approximately 17%, partially offset by robust price and mix benefits in the quarter. Q2 net sales results outperformed our previously communicated expectations, primarily due to incremental shipments from the brands to be divested driven by the timing of the Gallo transaction.  Operating margin increased 310 basis points to 25.9% as benefits from price and mix, along with lower marketing spend, were partially offset by higher COGS and SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Higher COGS mostly reflect increased packaging costs, including glass and labels, partially offset by lower rate costs. In Q2, we experienced continued margin expansion driven by shipment volume mix resulting from some of our fast-moving power brands, such as Kim Crawford, Meiomi and the Prisoner brand family, and favorable pricing for Woodbridge and SVEDKA. In addition, we saw lower promotions as some incentive programming activities did not occur due to the current operating environment and COVID-19-related closures for the on-premise.  The marketing benefit to margin in the quarter is mostly related to timing as we plan to shift marketing dollars from the first half into the second half of the fiscal year to support key marketing and advertising initiatives for our power brands and innovation launches as we enter our peak selling season. Let me point out that a majority of the shift will occur in Q3, resulting in an increase in year-over-year spend for the quarter.  As Bill discussed, during August, significant wildfires broke out in California, Oregon and Washington state. We are currently monitoring and assessing the impact of the smoke damage from these wildfires as we progress through the August to October harvest season. At this time, we do not expect a material impact to our ability to meet consumer demand. However, we expect our margins to be impacted as we recognize costs in the remainder of the fiscal year due to decreased production levels, driving unfavorable fixed cost absorption. Currently, we are estimating these costs of about $25 million to $35 million in Q3 and $10 million to $15 million in Q4 fiscal '21.  As Bill mentioned, we expect a consent decree will be submitted to the commissioners for review and approval in the coming weeks and, therefore, expect the Gallo and other ancillary deals to close by the end of Q3. Therefore, we are expecting reported net sales for wine and spirits to be flattish to prior year in Q3 while expecting a decline of 20% to 25% in reported wine and spirits operating income, reflecting the negative impact of the wildfires and increased marketing expense during the quarter.  Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in at approximately $110 million, up 13% versus last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by increased compensation and benefits, unfavorable foreign currency losses and an increase in charitable contributions primarily driven by COVID-19 support efforts, partially offset by reduced T&E spend. Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 10% to approximately $100 million primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continue to decrease our leverage ratio.  Our Q2 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact, came in at 16.9% versus 15.2% in Q2 last year primarily driven by higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses, partially offset by an increased benefit from stock-based compensation. While our pre-COVID estimated full year FY '21 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact, was 18%, we now expect the rate to approximate 19%. The 1 percentage point rate increase versus our pre-COVID estimate primarily reflects an estimated higher marginal rate on foreign earnings.  Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion for the first half of fiscal '21. This represents an impressive 10% increase. Free cash flow improvement reflects strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx.  Fiscal year-to-date CapEx totaled $278 million or approximately 22% below last year's spend. This included approximately $200 million of beer CapEx primarily driven by the 5 million hectoliter expansion project at our Obregon brewery, which we expect to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021.  Moving to Canopy. In Q2, we recognized a $48 million decrease in the fair value of Canopy investments. These impacts were excluded from comparable basis results. The total pretax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $64 million. In August, Canopy reported first quarter fiscal '21 results. We are pleased with the progress that has been made since David Klein took over as CEO in rightsizing the business, reducing the company's cash burn and improving free cash flow. We are bullish on the growth prospects for Canopy growth as they continue to execute against their strategic plan.  Now let's shift the discussion to outlook and guidance. Given the unprecedented COVID-19 events that began to abruptly and dramatically impact consumers and the marketplace almost concurrently with the start of our fiscal year and given the related uncertainty, volatility and fast-moving developments that have evolved during the first half of our fiscal year, we still do not believe it is prudent or appropriate to provide formal financial guidance for fiscal '21 at this time. However, let me reiterate that in a normalized environment, our medium-term growth algorithm remains unchanged for both our beer and wine and spirits segments.  In closing, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. While we remain focused on our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases through fiscal '23, in the short term given the volatile environment, we remain focused on paying down debt and further reducing our leverage ratio. In fact, we've reduced our net debt by nearly $600 million since the end of fiscal '20, resulting from our strong cash flow generation while continuing to maintain our quarterly dividend rate.  And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. 
Bonnie Herzog: I wanted to ask a little bit about the spending that, Garth, you just kind of touched on. A key driver of your strong operating margins in the quarter really has been a result of lower marketing spend. And now you've talked about your outlook for spending for the full year being between 9% and 10% as a percentage of sales, which is about 50 bps lower than your previous guidance. So I kind of wanted to better understand that this is mainly a function of the ongoing pressures from COVID or do you see this maybe more as a realistic run rate going forward in terms of what you're seeing with your depletions and demand for your brands? I guess I'm trying to get a sense of how you guys are balancing things and really how important it is for you to drive continued margin expansion.
William Newlands: Sure, Bonnie. Let me take the first part of that, Garth. Our expected run rate is no different going forward than it's ever been. At the same point, because so much of our live events and sports were delayed in the year, I mean think about the NBA Finals, hockey, baseball playoffs, football, many of the things that we advertised on were pushed back later in the year, and therefore, into our third quarter. Some of our spend was also pushed back into those time frames as well. So our intention is to have a consistent run rate of spend in that 9% to 10% range as we always have, and you will expect to see a little bit more in the third quarter because many of those pre-bought scenarios will take place during that quarter rather than in the second quarter when we had originally anticipated they would occur.
Garth Hankinson: Yes, and the only thing that I would add to that, Bonnie, is from a margin perspective, right, we continue to think that the right range to think about in terms of our beer margins are at 39% to 40%. Obviously, in any given year, we're going to face headwinds or tailwinds that are going to fluctuate a little bit. But those are best-in-class margins, and that's the right way to think about the business on a go-forward basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC.
Sunil Modi: So Bill, I just wanted to have a chat on shelf space, right? So you guys have obviously been very active with the shopper first initiative, ran into a bit of a hiccup with supply/demand. So maybe you can just kind of give us a state of the union on are -- have you lost any spacing as a result of the out of stocks? Because that has happened in a few categories. So if you could just give us an update there.  And number two, how do you think the retail psychology is evolving as the last six months has gone on? Clearly, Constellation has been under space for a very long time. So I'm just curious like where the retail universe is right now in terms of your actual slot in the core.
William Newlands: Sure. Certainly, the space issue has been somewhat challenging over the very most recent past, simply because of the reduction in production that we had around COVID-19. With that said, we have seen very little reduction of our overall space as we have spread out our product mix and our product offering into the existing space that we already had. We're also fortunate that many retailers have moved their resets and their timing back in the year for the same reason as because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which now matches up with the time when we're expecting to have our inventory levels back in a more normalized fashion during this quarter.  So we don't see any long-term issue around that. We've been very straightforward with our retail partners about where we are. And as you well state, our business, if anything, demands more space given the great acceleration that our brands have in the marketplace. And we expect that over time, we will continue to gain in the distribution area much as we have over the last several years.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse.
Kaumil Gajrawala: As it relates to inventories, it looks like kind of year-to-date, you're running with shipments down about 4%, depletions up about 5%, and that's during a seasonal peak period. To get inventories back to where you want them by the end of Q3, what should we be thinking about in terms of the spread between shipments and depletions?
Garth Hankinson: Yes. So Kaumil, thanks for the question. I'd say that the spread between depletions and shipments is going to be tough to gauge as we move through the quarter because it'll largely be dependent upon what depletions look like. And we've actually seen -- as Bill noted, we've actually seen very strong continued consumer takeaway in IRI, and depletion growth remains very robust. Suffice that to say, we do know that there will be a dislocation -- not really dislocation, but a difference in between shipments and depletions for the quarter. How much remains to be seen will be driven by consumer takeaway.
William Newlands: Let me just add to that. I'm sure that you have seen in the most recent four week share data that our brands are accelerating as we bring more and more of them back to the table. I think as Garth points out, that's going to be a big factor in terms of what the balance is of that. Depletions are certainly accelerating, we're very pleased with that, but it's very tough to give you an exact answer without knowing how that will land during the course of the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen.
Vivien Azer: So I'm curious, Bill, it sounds like you're very constructive on the momentum that you've established early days on the Corona Hard Seltzer offering. Curious to hear how you're thinking about positioning a new hard seltzer offering and taking a portfolio approach to the category.
William Newlands: Well, we've shipped about 5.5 million cases year-to-date, which is ahead of what we had expected, and we're very excited about it. As I already said, our velocity against literally one SKU is second in the category. So everything that's occurring around Corona Hard Seltzer has been sort of positive to what our initial expectations are.  As we already also stated, we're going to be in a position to put additional SKUs into the marketplace next year. We would -- we've already said also that our capacity would more than double next year. And keep in mind, we have a minority investment in PRESS, which we're very excited about. PRESS has performed exceedingly well. And as we've said in prior calls, we do expect some price stratification to occur over time in the seltzer category. So PRESS is very positive.  We've also done some very limited regional things like Funky Buddha in Florida. In Florida, that particular brand is in the top 5 of all seltzers in the state of Florida. So we've got our toes in the water on a number of areas. Corona Hard Seltzer will continue to be our lead, but we certainly have other opportunities to continue to gain share in what is becoming a very important subsegment of the beer business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane: Garth, I just wanted to follow up on the incremental costs in the wine segment. So I guess two questions related to it. First are the costs that you highlighted, are they relevant to the -- or related to the ongoing business, so separate from the piece that's going off in the divestiture to Gallo? And then second, I guess trying to understand if this at all impacts kind of the timing or the cadence of supply chain for the wine business going into next year. And I guess what I'm trying -- I'm thinking of it is, are you -- is there a delay in terms of pressing grapes and putting juice in the tanks? Is there a delay in pulling product out of the tank and bottling? I'm just really just trying to understand if there's going to be any kind of disruption in the flow of the supply chain in wine that might lead into next year.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. Bryan, thanks for the question. So the costs, as I outlined them, are for the remaining business, for the business that we are retaining, not for what we're divesting to Gallo. And as it relates to the question on supply chain, we don't expect there to be any material impact on our ability to meet consumer demand as we go forward. We have lots of flexibility in how we source grapes and fruit, whether that's through the bulk line market, the bulk line that we have on hand, our own vineyards, relationships we have with other growers. We don't see any impact on our ability to meet consumer takeaway.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: So Bill, you mentioned your aspiration to be a top 3 player in the seltzer category -- hard seltzer category longer term. Obviously, you just touched on some of the new SKUs that you have planned. But can you also give us a sense for how important new platforms will be in that aspiration long term in terms of becoming a top 3 player? And is that more of a longer-term focus? Or could we see a big push behind new entries of brands in the hard seltzer more near term?
William Newlands: Well, certainly, Corona Hard Seltzer will be our primary approach to this category. As we stated, given our roughly $10 million capability for this year, we've relied on one -- literally one SKU. So as we go forward and we expand and finish the Obregon expansion that I discussed earlier, that gives us the opportunity to extend our reach within the Corona Hard Seltzer franchise.  We're a big believer that Corona is the perfect brand to maintain our lead focus for seltzer because it meets up exactly with the whole brand essence of refreshment, relaxation and finding your beach. So it -- that will continue to be the lead play for us, but we're always exploring what consumers are interested in going forward. And yes, we do have some additional things that we'll be talking to you about in future conference calls as to what we expect to do during the next fiscal year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sean King from UBS.
Sean King: Yes, I wanted to dig a little bit more into what you're seeing in the month of September. I know you mentioned like based on the IRI data that we're seeing a gradual acceleration as you're getting more on the shelves, but in terms of the on-premise that you're seeing there would be helpful. And what I've been hearing is that there's fewer taps at most of the outlets that are open, if that's a potential headwind or a benefit for your portfolio.
William Newlands: Sure. As you know, we are somewhat less susceptible to the on-premise versus much of the competition with our brands. With that said, there's -- we had 50% closure in the second quarter. We had 75% in the first, and it's looking more and more like that will also reduce another 15% to 20% during the third quarter if things continue as they're going.  With that said, admittedly, the quarter -- I mean, excuse me, the month literally ended yesterday, so we're still adding it up. But it certainly looks like we're going to have a significantly better depletion month in September than we have year-to-date. In fact, it could quite well be our best month of the year so far. That matches up entirely with the acceleration that you've seen in IRI data over the last 4 weeks, which has been accelerating and returned us to a gaining share position, which is something we've normally seen in our business over the course of time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.
Kevin Grundy: Great. This is building on Nik's question earlier. This is for you, Bill. Just the outlook for the Modelo brand looking out over the next few years and kind of pass some of the near-term volatility related to COVID comes up frequently with investors, understandably given the importance of the brands to your outlook. So could you comment on your ability to grow volumes in that business double digits over the next few years? As we look at the Nielsen channels, ACV is less of an opportunity. But as was pointed out, shelf space is an opportunity. So maybe comment on that a bit, talk a little bit about the interplay and your ability to drive that kind of growth, the interplay between Modelo with the Corona brand. And then just lastly, perhaps touch on, is it in the consideration sector that you would extend the Modelo brand into seltzers as well?
William Newlands: Sure. As we've said, Modelo is one of the chief growth drivers of our beer business. Modelo Especial has become the number three beer brand in the U.S. market, and it continues to accelerate, part of -- it does that for a number of reasons. One is it continues to have a disproportionate SKU in the Hispanic community, which is a growing demographic in the United States, but we've also radically extended that into the non-Hispanic community. Jim Sabia has been advertising to the non-Hispanic community only for the last few years. So this is relatively new that we've been expanding the reach, particularly in Modelo Especial.  As you know, our Chelada introductions have gone extremely well, one after the next. And certainly, it's continued to see growth in Negra as well. So the overall family is very healthy. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're looking at the 35th consecutive year of growth for that brand. And quite honestly, I don't know how high is up. I think there's -- there remains tremendous opportunity to extend that franchise, both with its core Hispanic community as well as the non-Hispanic marketplace into which we've started to advertise.  I highly doubt that we will do a seltzer under that brand. We believe that the core essence of that brand focuses much more on full flavored beer. And any innovation that we might approach on that particular brand will follow more of the brand essence of the Modelo brand rather than what we have done with Corona, where we feel the whole refreshment platform matches up perfectly with the hard seltzer subsegment.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: So I wanted to go back to the depletions commentary. I understand there are obviously a lot of puts and takes, but you sounded optimistic. So Bill, are you running in the mid-single digits as you alluded to before or even at the high single digits for beer depletions in September?
William Newlands: Well, as I said earlier, and I'll maintain that thought given we have not even gotten all the numbers in yet, and therefore, Garth has not added them all up. But it appears that September will be significantly better than what our year-to-date has been. And as I said, it very likely will be our single best month of the year.  So we continue to be optimistic that what we've seen on takeout and IRI trends that have occurred over the last four weeks is currently being reflected in our increased depletion trend that we're seeing in September, which again matches up with our expectation given we have been back operating at normal levels within the plant now for a significant period of time. So again, it's a little difficult to put an exact number on it right at this point, but it certainly looks like September was a very, very positive month.
Andrea Teixeira: And if I can squeeze -- that's helpful, Bill. If I can squeeze just a margin question. I know it's like you just quoted some of the expenses that are -- I mean, obviously, the COVID expenses. Other than those, like which may or may not recur as we lap next year, are we looking at obviously a better outlook now that production is when -- it's where it should be and you're reaching back to the production and you're getting obviously economies of scale and you're getting your seltzer volumes like as you quoted better than anticipated? Should we see a progression in like long-term outlook for margins to continue to build or you're going to have to invest more into the pricing? The pricing commentary obviously is going to last, but you're going to increase the pricing through the beginning of fiscal -- we could go into fiscal, but I'm just thinking of the puts and takes of FX and volumes coming back, how we should be thinking about margins going forward.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. So margins for our beer business going forward, as we said earlier, the right range to think about them is, as we said previously, which is that 39% to 40% range, right, again, best-in-class margins. In any given year, we're going to have puts and takes as it relates to margins. We're going to get the benefits of our pricing, but we're also going to face headwinds around things like incremental depreciation that flows through cost of goods as well as we build and add capacity, we'll have periods where we have lower utilization rates, which can -- which will have a drag. And so as we say, there's always going to be these puts and takes in any given year, but 39% to 40% is the right way to think about our margin profile over the medium term.  And on the seltzer point that you raised, seltzer currently is a drag given the additional flavors and some of the co-packing that needs to be done there. As we progress and as we get to be -- have more scale in seltzer, there'll definitely be margin improvement there, and we'll start to get closer in line with Corona Extra glass. But again, even as margins improve on seltzer, that there will be other puts and takes. So 39% to 40% is the right way to think about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein from Evercore.
Robert Ottenstein: Bill, I just want to kind of step back and ask you a big picture question that you're probably in a better position to answer than anybody else. And that is at least based on the data we get, and for spirits, it's not that good, but even with the tremendous boost that the beer industry has gotten from hard seltzers, it looks like spirits are gaining share of throat and that maybe even have accelerated this year. And based on what you see, is that, in fact, true? And what do you account for that? Is it the out of stocks for beer? Or is there something -- due to the COVID environment that favors spirits? And if these trends look like they're going to continue, are you thinking just in terms of your long-term capital allocation to pivot more towards spirits? I know you just made a spirits acquisition. But just how are you thinking about that dynamic?
William Newlands: Sure, Rob. It's very difficult in a COVID year to make lots of predictions about what will be sustainable and what will maintain itself once we come out of the COVID scenario and what won't. I do think it's very fair to say there will be some fundamental change. Some of that fundamental change will be about 3 tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer, things that we're investing a lot of our energy and focus on going forward. So I wouldn't make a lot of prediction as to what the adjustments that could occur between spirits or beer or wine.  What I would say is we have worked aggressively, as you've seen, to make sure that our portfolio is positioned for where the consumer is going, not where the consumer has been. We've invested in craft spirits, which we think has tremendous upside. Our beer business plays in the high end, which is where the growth in the category is. We're extending our capabilities in seltzer to more than double what we have done in this fiscal year going forward. And our wine business is tremendously positioned to continue to leverage the premiumization trend that's going on. In addition to that, we're doing the kinds of innovations that the consumer is looking for in things like betterment and convenience. You're seeing that in some of the new products that we've talked about this year.  That's where our focus really lies, and I think there's tremendous opportunity within our portfolio no matter how it shakes out post-COVID. As I said, I do think there will be some fundamental change about how the consumer buys. And to some degree, there almost has to be because there has been a significant shift from the on-premise to the off-premise. And I think that the long-term trend of that, I still think, is too early to predict.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from Truist Securities.
Grant O'Brien: This is Grant on for Bill. Just had one on the wine and spirits power brand's depletion growth this quarter. I was just hoping, Garth, you give a bridge on some of those impacts you walked through the inventory changes at the distributor level and the promotional changes. Just trying to get an underlying growth number for that business.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. I think the question is that you want to understand sort of like why the power brand growth wasn't higher than you were expecting, and that really is because we did do -- we didn't repeat some non-return generating promotional activity or take some non-enhancing -- non-value-enhancing pricing actions. And we also cleaned up or reduced the number of days outstanding with some key retailers. So the underlying brands are strong as you see in the IRI takeaway, and the reduction or a slowdown in depletions really is just -- is doing a little bit of house cleaning, so to speak.
William Newlands: Yes. Keep in mind, Bill, if I could add -- just to add to Garth's comment, our high-end over $11 power brands continue to outpace their competition, and that's led by Meiomi and the Prisoner family, Kim Crawford. These brands are accelerating in the minds of consumer.  Keep in mind, going back to sort of Robert's question from a minute ago, one of the things that we continue to see is people are attracted to try and true brands. And we are very fortunate when you talk about our beer business or our wine business or our spirit business to have a lot of those brands that are inherently trusted, and that has been extremely helpful for us during the pandemic.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet from Guggenheim.
Laurent Grandet: Another question on seltzer. With the launch of Topo Chico seltzer next year, there will be more competition to attract Hispanic consumers into the seltzer category potentially from beer. So first, I mean do you see Topo Chico seltzer as a risk for your core Mexican beer business? And second, what are your plan with Corona seltzer to increase Hispanic penetration that seems to be low by your account?
William Newlands: Well, as I said earlier, we have been very pleased by the development of our Corona Hard Seltzer business with the Hispanic community. It's indexing somewhere between 5 and 10 points greater than the overall category, and we think that speaks very well to broadening the reach of the seltzer subsegment with consumers. So we're very positive about that.  As I'm sure you've seen, there's been a lot of introductions in the seltzer category, but consumers have a tendency to go with tried and true, trusted brands. And there is really no stronger brand that's trusted in the minds of consumers than Corona. And certainly, Corona Hard Seltzer will fall into that ZIP code as well. So we always wish well for our competition, but we'll be quite happy to do our bit, and we'll see how it all falls out.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Bill Newlands for any further remarks.
William Newlands: Thanks, Jonathan. So thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. Despite the continued and unprecedented challenges that have occurred since the beginning of our fiscal year, our team continues to remain agile and have overcome massive headwinds to deliver strong business performance in the first half of our fiscal year. We remain confident in the resiliency of our business.  Our beer business, as we've discussed today, continues to be a top growth driver within the industry, while our wine and spirit premiumization strategy continues to gain momentum, especially as we enter the final stages of completing our transaction with Gallo. We remain bullish on the future performance of our powerful collection of consumer connected brands, and we are well positioned to deliver a solid year of organic growth in fiscal '21.  Our next quarterly call is scheduled for early January. So I'm wishing everyone at this point a safe and happy holiday season, and I'm also reminding you to enjoy some of our great products during your socially-distant celebrations with your family and friends. So thanks again for joining the call today, and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2020-07-01 11:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be open for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Shannon. Good morning, and welcome to Constellation’s First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. I’m here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here’s Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Patty. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter call, everyone. Before getting into a discussion of our quarterly results, I'd like to address two topics that have become extremely relevant to our business and our society in large. First, our thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have been impacted by racial injustice and associated acts of violence in both this most recent time period and throughout the years. We stand in solidarity with the black community, and our belief that black lives do, in fact, and have always mattered. We categorically denounce bigotry, racism, social injustice and acts of senseless violence in all forms. They are clearly inconsistent with our company values and our commitment to embracing diversity and creating an inclusive environment for all employees feel safe, respected and valued. Earlier this week, we announced our commitment to invest $100 million to support African-American black and minority-owned startups in the beverage alcohol space and related categories over the next 10 years. These small businesses serve as the fabric of their respective communities. And we must make it more equitable for them to access the capital needed to have a fighting chance at success. In addition, we've made a $1 million commitment over five years to the Equal Justice Initiative and their efforts to educate the public about the history of racial and justice in this country and to support their quest for equity in the criminal justice system. Furthermore, we've made a commitment within our company to enhance representation and access to opportunity for black team members at Constellation by strengthening our recruiting, hiring and development programs. The conditions that have allowed systemic racial injustice to persist have existed far too long. We all have a role to play in creating a more equitable experience for African-Americans in this country, and we are committed to doing our part to make this happen. Switching gears, our organization has responded and adapted to the challenges of the COVID-19 operating environment in an incredible and agile manner, which is reflected in our results for the first quarter. I'm especially proud of the efforts of the Constellation team members, of our distributors and our retail partners who work together to ensure our customers' needs were met under very challenging circumstances. As I've said before, the health and well-being of our employees is our number one priority and we've taken a number of preventative measures to keep them safe in our operations and out at retail to ensure our continued ability to meet the needs of the market. We've provided support and relief to our customers and our channel partners by donating more than $4 million in COVID-19 relief efforts and by donating PPE and sanitizer produced in our own facilities. Bottom-line, I'm extremely proud of the way our team and industry partners have risen to the occasion, and I remain confident our business and our brands will emerge even stronger on the other side. Now, let's transition to a discussion of our performance in the quarter. As Garth and I run through the highlights, there are three key points I'd like you to take away. Number one, despite various headwinds, we delivered solid first quarter business performance and strong cash flow generation. We are winning in sales channels that are open. Beer depletions remain strong and consistent with long-term trends despite the lost selling day in the quarter and the virtual shutdown of on-premise sales. And our wine and spirit power brands continued to gain traction. Number two, the slowdown of our beer production in Mexico due to COVID impacted shipments and net sales in Q1, and this impact will extend into Q2 as well. We will make up some of that impact in the back half of the year as our beer production in Mexico has returned to normal levels. Number three, this short-term disruption to our import beer business does nothing to dampen our long-term prospects. Consumer demand and takeaway for our brands remains extremely strong, and our outlook for the year and over the long-term remains extremely bright. Now, let's talk more specifically about our about our performance in the first quarter, starting with our beer business. Imports continue to be one of the primary growth contributors in the high end and total U.S. beer market, with Constellation delivering more than 80% of that import growth, driven by the Modelo Especial and Corona brand families. Solid first quarter depletion trends of 7% adjusted for one less selling day were driven by strong off-premise growth of almost 20%, due to the grocery and C-store channels, offset by a drag from the closure of the on-premise channel, which was down about 75% year-over-year. This is excellent performance considering that the country really began to feel the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in earnest in early March, which coincided with the beginning of our fiscal year and our brands over-index to densely populated states, such as New York and California that have been significantly impacted for a prolonged period of time. One of the highlights of the quarter was the successful launch of Corona Hard Seltzer. As expected, the brand name Corona drove extremely good trial of Corona Hard Shelter, and the great taste profile is driving a repeat purchase intent of almost 80%, which exceeded our expectations. Corona Hard Seltzer is already the number four hard seltzer brand and recently achieved IRI market share of almost 6% of the U.S. seltzer market. Ongoing distribution gains have led to IRI ACV distribution approaching 65% since product launched in March, with early results for Corona Hard Seltzer, incrementality, trending at around 90%, also exceeding our original expectations. We're also seeing high Hispanic penetration rates for the brand versus other Hard Seltzers, which we believe will be a key growth driver going forward and a major point of differentiation within the fast-growing demographic in this country. We believe the refreshment attributes of seltzer, combined with the halo effect of the Corona brand, which remains one of the most loved beer brands, provides an opportunity to build one of the strongest Hard Seltzer brands in our industry. During the quarter, we kicked off the summer selling season and gained share during the Memorial Day and Cinco de Mayo holidays. Cinco is a great example of changing consumer behavior during the pandemic, when people enjoyed our great brands in Cinco celebrations at home. As a result, our Cinco performance increased two to three times, what we would normally see in the off-premise. Our beer portfolio contributed nearly 20% of total U.S. beer category growth during Cinco and claimed four of the top 20 share gaining brand in IRI channels, driven by Modelo Especial as the top share gaining non-seltzer beer brand, Corona Hard Seltzer, Pacifico and Modelo Chelada, Limon y Sal. As previously mentioned, we have returned to normal production levels at our breweries in Mexico. During the mandated production slowdown in the quarter due to COVID-19, our focus on prioritizing production of our top-selling SKUs, which represent about 75% of total volume helped minimize disruption at retail, while supporting our efforts to ensure consumers could find our brands on the shelf and in the cold box. While supply will continue to be tight on select slower moving SKUs throughout the remainder of the summer, due to continued strong consumer demand for our brands in the off-premise, we expect to return to normal inventory levels in the third quarter. Let's now move to quarterly results for our Wine & Spirits business, which experienced the same market dynamics as our beer business during the quarter, with strong demand in the off-premise, offset by a decline in the on-premise of almost 80%. We continued to see staying power of the premiumization trend with premium price segments continuing to outpace value price segments, further reinforcing our Wine & Spirits business strategy. In fact, we saw excellent consumer takeaway trends of over, 25% for our Power Brands in the IRI off-premise channels during the quarter. Our Power Brands are winning in the high end and across the majority of price segments in the U.S, wine category, with strong velocity and distribution gains that are outpacing the market. First Quarter depletions for our collection of Power Brands grew 5%, driven by Kim Crawford, Meiomi, SVEDKA, The Prisoner brand family and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. We continue to invest in additional ways to fuel portfolio growth through innovation, capitalizing on priority, consumer trends, with successful product introductions, like the Prisoner unshackled Ruffino organic Prosecco and Robert Mondavi Private Selection Buttery Chardonnay, all of which are performing well in the marketplace. As you know, some of our biggest success stories and innovation have come from the spirit barrel age category, where we currently enjoy a 40% market share. The newest addition to this portfolio comes from the Woodbridge family, where we're seeing early success from the Bourbon barrel-aged Cabernet and Red Blend, as well as the rum barrel-aged Chardonnay. You should expect to see continuing premium category leading innovation from us as we emerge from the COVID environment, including line extensions for Meiomi in the Cabernets space, and from The Prisoner Brand Family with the addition of Cabernet and Chardonnay neighbor islands. In the Spirits category, you'll see SVEDKA pure infusions, as well as High West and SVEDKA premix cocktail in the RTD space. We continue to invest in capabilities that position, our Wine & Spirits business for long-term success. As a result of sheltering in place restrictions and the shutdown of on-premise accounts due to COVID-19, eCommerce for beverage alcohol has exploded, increasing three to seven times in volume versus prior year, depending on the channel. Consumer awareness for eCommerce and beverage alcohol has significantly increased and accelerated change in consumer behaviors by several years. With two-thirds of consumers saying they are planning to continue their eCommerce habits post-COVID, eCommerce is gaining share through platforms like Instacart, Drizly and other retailer online sites as consumers seek the convenience of these channels. In line with this accelerated trend, we acquired Empathy Wines in June. This acquisition fits in nicely with our broader premiumization strategy and strengthens our position in the direct-to- consumer, and three-tier eCommerce channel, where we'll utilize Empathy’s digitally native platform to reach new as well as thousands of existing loyal consumers. In addition, Empathy focus on producing high quality sustainably made wines sold direct to consumer from its winery via its eCommerce platform at the $20 price point in three variants, like Blend, Red Blend and Roget launched in 2019 the brand has sold approximately 15,000 cases and acquire more than 2,000 subscription customers. We are already a leading player in three-tier eCommerce and have seen growth in this channel of more than 500% in the last three months. We plan to leverage this acquisition, as an opportunity to strengthen our position and outpace the market. As you know, we recently revised the Gallo transaction to exclude our Mission Bell facility as the FTC wanted to ensure that we have adequate production capability for our J. Roget and Cooks brands, which we decided to retain once they were excluded from the original transaction. We're also one step closer to the finish line on this transaction with the signing of separate agreements to sell Nobilo New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy. As you will recall in December, we entered into a separate pub-related agreement with Gallo to divest our Nobilo brand for 130 million. This fits with Gallo’s portfolio strategy and allows them to expand in the New Zealand wine category without affecting our long-term goals nor our opportunity in this category at the greater than $11 price point. In addition, we've signed an agreement to sell Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy to Sazerac for $255 million. As a reminder, last December, we announced the Paul Masson had been excluded from the original transaction due to FTC concerns and we indicated that we were pursuing opportunities to divest this brand at that time. These transactions are subject to final FTC review and they are expected to close in the second quarter, concurrent with or closely following the close of the Gallo transaction. All proceeds will primarily be used to reduce debt. Finally, we continue to be encouraged by steps David Klein and the Canopy team are taking to position the company to win in key markets and product categories over the long-term. The business continues to work through its transformational strategy with a leaner approach that will allow Canopy to be more flexible and adapt more quickly to changes in this dynamic cannabis market. Canopy has seen early success from its Rec 2.0 products in the Canadian cannabis market, including beverages, which we are very excited about. The company's Tweed and Houndstooth brand has been one of the most raved about cannabis beverages in the market with overwhelmingly positive consumer feedback. We believe that beverages and other Rec 2.0 products will attract new consumers to the market and further drive conversation -- excuse me conversion from the illicit market. We continue to believe that Canopy remains best position to win long-term in the emerging cannabis space and is well capitalized to face the challenges associated with this current economic environment. As I close, let me again reiterate the three main takeaways from this forum. First, despite various headwinds, we've delivered a solid first quarter business performance and strong cash flow generation. We are winning in the sales channels that are open. Beer depletions remain strong and consistent with our growth outlook for the future, despite the less selling day in the quarter and the virtual shutdown of on-premise sales and our Wine & Spirits Power Brands continued to gain traction. Number two, the slowdown of our beer production in Mexico due to COVID impacted shipments and net sales in Q1 and this impact will extend into Q2 as well. We will make up some of that impact beginning in the third quarter as our beer production in Mexico has returned to normal levels. And number three, this short-term disruption to our import beer business does nothing to dampen our long-term prospects. Consumer demand and take away from our brand remains extremely strong and I remain optimistic about our outlook for this year. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Garth who will review our financial results for the first quarter.
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill and hello everyone. Well, the start with our fiscal year marked the beginning of a global pandemic, resulting in rapidly changing market conditions, Constellation Brands delivered solid performance in Q1, driven by our ability to remain agile and prudently navigate through these uncertain and volatile times. During Q1, we improve margins and both our Beer, Wine & Spirits segments delivered solid Beer and Wine & Spirits Power Brand depletion volume trends, due to strong brand performance despite closures in the on-premise channel and shelter-in-place guidelines that impacted a majority of the quarter and increased operating cash flow and free cash flow by 16% and 24%, respectively. These strong cash flow results provide us with the financial flexibility needed to continue to focus on debt pay-down and liquidity. During the quarter, we were able to issue debt at very favorable rates and use the proceeds to satisfy $700 million of debt coming due in November, and pay down other near term maturities. Now, let's review Q1 performance in more detail. We're all generally focused on capital basis, financial results, starting with Beer. Net sales declined 6%, excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales declined at 4% and organic shipment volume down 6% partially offset by favorable pricing. Q1 shipment volume was negatively impacted by reduced production levels at our breweries in Mexico, as part of COVID-19 safety measures. Depletion volume growth for the quarter came in at 5.6%, driven by Modelo Especial, and the successful launch of Corona Hard Seltzer a strong performance in the off-premise channel, more than offset the impact of the reduction in the on-premise channel, due to COVID-19 related shutdowns. When adjusted for one less selling day in the quarter, the Beer business generated nearly 7% of depletion volume growth and impressive result in this operating environment.  A large gap between shipment and depletion volume trends for Q1 was driven by the reduced production levels for roughly two-thirds of the quarter and robust consumer demand. This resulted in lower than normal distributor inventory on hand at the end of the quarter. I'm happy to report and reiterate that beer production in Mexico return to normal levels in June, and we expect distributor inventory levels to return to more normal levels during the third quarter of our fiscal year, as some shipment volume shifts from Q1 and Q2 into Q3. Beer gross margin of 55.6% was flat the prior year, it’s favorable pricing and the benefit of the Ballast Point divestiture was offset by increased operational cost driven primarily by higher material costs and reduced throughput at our breweries resulting in unfavorable fixed cost absorption. Marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 220 basis points to 8.8%, as marketing spend decreased due to the implications of COVID-19, essentially canceling and/or postponing most sporting and sponsorship events. With most sports programming on hold during Q1, and big events, such as the NCAA Basketball Tournament cancelled, in the short-term we are reallocating marketing dollars to lower cost digital marketing efforts and TV programming that consumers are engaging with in this current environment. We are recalibrating our marketing spend and strategy for the remainder of the fiscal year. However, currently we still expect to spend in the range of 9.5% to 10% of net sales on a full year basis. As such, the marketing related margin benefit in Q1 is mostly related to timing. As a result of the abovementioned factors, beer operating margins increased 240 basis points to 41.7%. Looking ahead to Q2, we expect shipment volume to be negatively impacted, as we ramp back to normal production levels in June. Keep in mind that we expect to see some residual margin compression in Q2 as the reduced production levels in Q1 and the start of Q2 will create unfavorable fixed cost absorption, which is expected to continue to work its way through the Beer business results during Q2. Moving to Wine & Spirits Power Brand depletion volume accelerated and achieve 5% growth as these brands continue to win in higher end and across the majority of price segments in the U.S. Wine category. Overall depletion wine declined 1% reflecting the impact of the brands to be divested. Net sales declined 7% and shipment volume down 13%. Decline in net sales was driven by the following: lower volume and unfavorable comparison to Q1 prior year, due to a very strong quarter last year for the brands to be divested; on-premise and retail tasting room closures throughout most of the quarter as a result of COVID-19 and net sales of the Black Velvet brands are not included in this year's Q1 as a result of its divestiture late last year. The decline in net sales is an improvement from our Q1 pre-COVID targets we provided for the Wine & Spirits business during our last sales and earnings call driven by the strength of some of our fast moving power brands such as Kim Crawford, Meiomi and SVEDKA, and an improvement in some of the -- in some of the brands to be divested such as Black Box and Paul Masson, which saw accelerated and robust consumer takeaway trends during Q1. Excluding the impact of the Black Velvet divestiture, organic net sales declined at 4%, reflecting shipment volume decline of 9%, partially offset by strong price and mix benefits in the quarter. Operating margin increased 240 basis points to 28.3% as benefits from Price Index, along with favorable SG&A were partially offset by the Black Velvet divestiture and higher COGS. In Q1, we saw the benefits of shipment volume mix driven by Meiomi and Kim Crawford and favorable pricing for Woodbridge and SVEDKA. In addition, we saw lower promotion expense as scheduled incentive programming activities did not occur due to the current operating environment and COVID-19 related closures for the on-premise. While we expect to continue to see positive price and mixed benefits the remainder of our fiscal year, they should temper versus the very strong price and mixed results we saw in Q1. Depletion in shipment volume for our power brands is expected to temper in Q2, as we do not plan to replicate some lower return incentive programs that ran during our Q2 fiscal 2020. However, we plan to shift some programming resources for these brands the back half of the year to better align with timing for our key selling season for our Wine & Spirits business. In addition, we are assuming a Q2 close for the Gallo and other divestiture transactions, which will negatively impact the quarter. Therefore, we are expecting decline of 25% to 30% in reported Wine & Spirits sales and operating income for Q2. Q1 corporate expenses came in an approximately $51 million, up 16% versus last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency losses and an increase in charitable contributions, primarily driven by COVID-19 support efforts. Comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased approximately 13% to $100 million, primarily due to lower average borrowings. Our comparable basis effective tax rate excluding Canopy equity and earnings came in at 19.3% versus 18.6% last year, primarily driven by lower level of stock based compensation benefits this year. Moving to free cash flow, which we defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less CapEx, we generated free cash flow of $542 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This represents an impressive 24% increase. Cash flow improvements reflect strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. CapEx totaled $144 million or 7% below last year spend. This included approximately $110 million of beer CapEx, primarily driven by the five million hectoliter expansion project at our Obregon Brewery. While COVID-19 safety precautions slowed expansion activities at our Obregon Brewery during Q1, construction activities are ramping back up. And we expect the five million hectoliter addition to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. Let me remind you that with the completion of the Obregon capacity expansion, we believe we will have ample capacity at Nava and Obregon to meet consumer needs over the medium-term. Moving to Canopy, in Q1, we recognized a $197 million decrease in the fair value of Canopy investments. These impacts were excluded from our comparable basis results. The total pre-tax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $112 million. On May 1st, we exercised the original warrants with Canopy for $174 and increased our ownership position by approximately 3% to 38.6%. The warrants were in the money, and the amount was manageable from a liquidity and leverage standpoint. We continue to believe in the long-term and substantial opportunity in the emerging cannabis market and remain confident that Canopy is best positioned to win in this space. As a reminder, the expiration of future and much larger warrant tranches were extended to calendar years 2020, 2023 and 2026. We will evaluate the exercise of each of these warrants prior to expiration as we continue to see how the cannabis industry unfolds in both Canada and the U.S. Furthermore, we do not plan to make any additional cash contributions to Canopy beyond the potential exercise of these warrants. Now let's shift the discussion to outlook and guidance. Given the unprecedented COVID-19 events that began to abruptly and dramatically impact consumers and the marketplace almost concurrently with the start of our fiscal year and given the related uncertainty volatility and fast moving developments that have evolved during the first quarter of our fiscal year, we still do not believe it is prudent or appropriate to provide formal financial guidance for fiscal 2021 at this time. However, let me take a moment to reiterate that in a normalized environment, our medium-term growth algorithm remains unchanged for both our Beer and Wine & Spirits segments. This is a good spot to discuss our capital allocation strategy. While we remain focused on our goal of returning $4.5 billion to shareholders in the short-term, given the uncertainty of the current environment, we will be focusing on maximizing free cash flow and utilizing that free cash to reduce debt and leverage, creating the flexibility needed to fulfill our $4.5 million commitment longer term. As a result, we are moving this goal out to cover the fiscal 2020 to 2023 time frame and the total cash return in the form of dividends and share repurchases to approximately $5 billion as we add another year of dividends into the mix. In closing, I want to reiterate that our cash generation profile remains strong, our quarterly dividend rate has been maintained, and we remain focused on actively and prudently navigating through the challenging environment presented by COVID-19, and we look to provide updates as more factors become known. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Bryan Spillane: Hey good morning everyone.
Bill Newlands: Hey Bryan.
Bryan Spillane: So, I guess a question on the wine business and maybe just two related. One was -- I think you took some price increases earlier this year on Woodbridge and be some other brands. So, I just wanted to see how the market reacted to that? Whether you feel like you were able to successfully get those price increases through? And then maybe related, there was some repositioning that you were planning to do in the wine business this year from a brand positioning and marketing increases. And I just want to understand if that's actually happening, if you can still do that in this current environment? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure, you bet. So we did in fact, take price increase on Woodbridge and I must say one of the things that has been a benefit of COVID is that if there are any, is that consumers have continued to buy tried and true brands of which Woodbridge is one. And it was certainly helpful that we put our price through concurrently with that and Woodbridge has actually been outperforming our expectations around the pricing increase throughout the first quarter. So, so far, so good. We’re going to continue to watch that as you would expect, but so far that's gone very well. I would also say that some of the new product introductions that we have put into Woodbridge have performed and we're expecting to continue to perform very well. That's a very important brand for us. A lot of the work that we're doing more broadly around our brands is continuing. We've seen a tremendous increase in direct-to-consumer and three Tier commerce, which goes very well to strong brands like the prisoner and may owe me and brands of that elk. So we’re going to continue to put focus on those brands. We think they're very well positioned and those brands are tried and true brands in the mind of the consumer, which at the moment is where the consumer is spending their dollars.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning everyone. I had a question on out of stocks. It's a key summer holiday this week with the force, so hoping you guys could share with us how you feel specifically about the holiday and your supply? Also, maybe love to hear some more color on what you're doing to minimize the disruption for out of stocks? For instance, I've heard from some of the distributors that you're doing drop loads. So, I guess I'm trying to get a sense from you how flexible you can be on the production side with all of this and then maybe finally can you touch on how big of a drag some of these shortages and may be any initiatives you might be taking to minimize the situation. How big of a drag it might be on your margins, if at all? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure. Let's start with -- our belief is that our operations team is best-in-class. And we are doing everything we can do at the moment to expedite shipments from our breweries, true our distribution facilities and through our distributors to consumers. Certainly, because of the reduced production that occurred during about 70 plus days, mostly in the first quarter, it’s certainly reduced our ability to ship to normal levels. But let's keep in mind, the demand for our brands for Modelo and Corona have never been stronger. We were up almost 20% in the off-premise channel during the quarter. And we're seeing consistent depletion levels as we start Q2 as well. So we are in a very strong position. Keep also in mind that during the mandated COVID-19 reduction in production, we produced the SKUs primarily that led to 75% of our sales. So, while a consumer may or may not be able to buy a particular SKU, in all likelihood, we would expect that a person who wants to buy Modelo or Corona and the brand families associated with those will be able to buy those during the holidays.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Your line is open. 
Nik Modi: Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. So Bill, I know that, obviously, there's a lot of noise in the numbers. The question is -- I think, the top question most investors have is -- how long what the growth curve for the beer business will look like -- not only next six months, but next two, three years? So, I was hoping maybe you can provide some context on the following three points, right? One is -- number of new households or trial surge that you've seen and repeat rates on those new trials that you've seen since this whole pandemic started? The second point would be -- I understand the out of stock situation you are able actually provide products and maybe some packages weren't found, but I'm sure that out of stocks did cost you some sale. So I am just curious, maybe you can help -- can provide some context on how much the business would have grown on depletion had there been no issue in out of stocks at all. And then the third point is, obviously, retailers are thinking -- rethinking how they think about the shelf, something you guys have been doing for the last two to three years now. And so how you think this environment might shape or accelerate some of your Shopper-First initiatives and more spacing for your brands and retail longer term?
Bill Newlands: Sure. So let's take it in reverse order. Relative to the shelf, obviously, the one thing that's occurred during this particular timeframe is some of the resets that would normally occur have been pushed back as many retailers are focusing their attention on throughput from their existing shelf sets. We think that as they come into the fall season and do fall resets that this will continue to increase the probability of Shopper-First. Because I think it’s became more and more clear that brands that are -- that have strong demand behind them and ours are two great examples with the Modelo and Corona franchises are far demanding more space, and they're demanding more space because the takeout is there against them. It's kind of difficult to give you a specific example about what we could have grown because you had so many different factors involved in the quarter. You know our quarter of course, started almost concurrent with the pandemic, which was a little different than if you were on the calendar quarter, admittedly. But when you look at the fact that on-premise was effectively closed, but off-premise was up almost 20%, you know, you've got a lot of different dynamics in play there.  As I said earlier, we sincerely believe that the consumer wanting to buy our brands will be able to buy Corona and Modelo. And certainly, the start of Corona Hard Seltzer has also been a real success. We have already shipped in access of 3 million cases of Corona Hard Seltzer. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the takeaway and repeat has been exceptional. So one of the things we are seeing relative to your first question in terms of consumer purchasing. About 30-some-odd percent of consumers are actually increasing their consumption of those brands that they are traditionally using. And given the strong representation of our brands, Corona, Modelo, in particular, it's not surprising that you've seen an increase in the takeout demand during this time frame. It goes back to what I said earlier about tried and true brands. The same would apply to many of our Wine & Spirits brands as well. But certainly the consumer's interest in buying brands in which they have a lot of faith and comfort is working to our advantage.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is open.
Vivien Azer: Hi. Thank you. Garth, I was wondering -- thanks for the color in terms of the marketing spend outlook. I was wondering if you could offer any color on how you're thinking about phasing that and whether we might expect something different as you kind of lean into a post-COVID recovery perhaps? And then, a quick follow-up. Bill, I really appreciated your comments at the start of the call and I'm curious whether you guys are accessing any change to your social media advertising spend? Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Yes, Vivien. Thanks for the question. As it relates to marketing spend and the phasing of that, I'd say, it's still too early to tell exactly what that will know, as we sort of come out of COVID-19 and we don’t know exactly when some of these sponsorships and sporting events might get rescheduled. So other that we still believe that we’re going to spend in that 9.5% to 10% of net sales for the full year, the phasing is still a little bit up in the air.
Bill Newlands: So relative to social media, there's obviously been a lot of discussion around social media. I would say and let me reiterate what I said earlier. We think it's very important to protect users for disinformation and hate-speech. Those things run directly counter to our commitment to social justice and to racial equality. We have decided that we are going to do a comprehensive review of our social media work and along with that for the month of July we are pausing our Facebook engagement until we are able to do a thorough review and to make sure that all of our social media efforts match up with what I just said, which is the commitment to social justice and racial equality.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Your line is open.
Rob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just one point of clarification and then my question. Just can you just break out the price/mix in the quarter and maybe separate out headline pricing from promos? And then, my main question really is unbelievable growth, right, in the seltzer category. You're now in the mix, big time with Corona Seltzer which, I think, you said is 90% incremental. What have you learned about the category now year-to-date and how big do you think it can be as a percentage of overall beer sales? And is your latest thought in terms incrementality to the entire beer category at this point? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: So, relative to those two or three questions in that, we continue to have our long-term algorithm, particularly as it relates to beer, of expecting that price will grow 1% to 2% annually. We've done that consistently over time and we expect that that algorithm is going to continue. The relative to seltzer, earlier this year, we said we thought the category, which was roughly 60 million cases last year, could double and probably triple in the long run. If anything, that's starting to look conservative. The consumer certainly enjoys the refreshment characteristics of this particular category. And I think our introduction of Corona Hard Seltzer is a great example of leveraging a tremendously strong brand, into a new category. I think it would be important to not simply lump seltzer in with beer. Given the incrementality that we've seen is roughly 90%, which again is more than we frankly expected, suggests to us that it is not necessarily a direct trade-off with beer. And I think that it has category dynamics that are free and understanding of the role. So, our view is that this continues to have a lot of longevity. And we are certainly planning to be a critical part of it. As you know, we've already gotten to number four in the category with a roughly 6% share. And as you also know, we've just warming up.
Rob Ottenstein: Got it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.
Lauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. I was hoping that you guys could give us a little bit of help on the gross margin range of this quarter. And particularly in beer I am curious across those businesses. I know you mentioned that, you'll see some of start going into Q2 of the lower production volumes. And anything maybe just a little bit of visibility on the drivers of gross margin quarter and thinking about how that develops into 2Q it could be really helpful. Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Bill, you?
Bill Newlands: Yes. So, gross margins per beer is what we had some drags there, as it relates to materials and to fixed overhead absorption. That drag was offset by finding balance point divestiture, as well as by pricing. Going forward into Q2, we expect that there will be further downward margin pressure as it relates to fixed overhead absorption as we work through the inventory or the slowdown that we had in Q1 at the very beginning of Q2. At gross margin, they were flattish gross margin and beer. That resulted in about 240 basis points of improvement at the operating line because of primarily the timing of the marketing spend that we talk about earlier.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sean King with UBS. Your line is open.
Sean King: Thanks for the question. I apologize if I missed this. But do you provide any update on Mexicali? And, I guess, the potential options you're exploring there?
Bill Newlands: We continue to be in discussions with the Mexican government about what our long-range plans are for Mexico. As you know, and as we've stated, based on the expansions that we already have in play our medium-term is already set. We believe there's going to be plenty of opportunity. And we spend more than 30 years working very well with the Mexican governments, both local and federally. And we expect that to continue and we expect to have a strong long-range solution for our continuing supply for the long run. So I don't have anything new to report on Mexicali other than to say, we fully expect to be able to service our needs for the long run.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your mind is open. 
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, good afternoon guys.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Dara.
Dara Mohsenian: First, just a clarification, you mentioned depletion levels in Q2 in beer so far consistent with Q1. Is that versus the reported 5.6% depletion result or is that more 7% on a days adjusted basis? And then just on Corona Hard Seltzer, with the strong repeat rates you mentioned, can you give us a sense for what share level you think that brand can ultimately reach within the Hard Seltzer category and also what distribution level, it'd be reasonable to expect that brand to get to? Thanks. 
Bill Newlands: Sure. Let's, let's start with the hard Seltzer question. We already are seeing ACV distribution IRI channels of approximately 65, which, which is very strong, especially given the fact that as I said earlier, many retailers are not doing the resets that they had planned for the earlier part of this year. It remains to be seen what our -- what our long-term, scenario looks like. We're already about 6%. As you know, we've only introduced so far in variety pack. We would expect to extend beyond just variety pack, later this year and into the following years. So we're very optimistic that we're going to have a -- an important part of the Seltzer category, and certainly would expect to be in the top three, overall within that category, going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open. 
Kevin Grundy: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon and congrats on the strong quarter. Just to follow up on the last question, I'm not sure there was there's clarity on where depletions were running for Q2, if it was close to the 7% on a selling day adjusted basis. So clarity there I think would be helpful for folks? And then more broadly, maybe you can just comment on the biggest variables impacting your decision to withhold guidance and the context being particularly strong starts at a year, sounds like June is off to a good start. Bill, you commented the portfolio has never been stronger. We're seeing that in really strong Nielsen data, production is ramping it breweries. You've had the strong start to the second quarter, commodity is still relatively benign, enough competence to deploy some cash towards small wine deal. We are kind of putting this all together.  And then in addition, the company is obviously very definitely managing through this very sharp and unprecedented channel shift. So with all of that said, comment on the biggest swing factors here that, leave the company a little bit reluctant to provide guidance at this point? So thanks for all that.
Bill Newlands: Okay. Thank you. I might quote some of you. Some of those things that you just said that was quite nice. Relevant, you know first of all, I need to apologize for Dara, I did not answer the same question a minute ago and I apologize for that. Relative to depletions, our view is, is that -- that the second quarter specifically starting in June is looking fairly consistent with what the non-adjusted amount would be. And the takeout continues to be strong. All you have to do is look at IRI and Nielsen every week and you see that the take out is strong.  Here's the issue around guidance, if anybody would have said in February that we would have gone through what we just went through over the course of a quarter, you wouldn't have believed us. And while -- excuse me, on-premise was off 75% in the first quarter, a little more actually in wine and spirits. You started to see some openings, which saw a decrease to an off sort of 40% plus for a brief period of time. Now, we're turning around and we're seeing closures, again, in Arizona and Texas and Florida. So it is very difficult in this particular environment to be able to predict. What we are anxiously looking for, and I would suggest that all of you would want to look for is, how are brands performing, given there are going to be spits and spurts in the marketplace. And our brands continue to perform extremely well. There's going to be a lot of volatility this year, and ability to predict is very challenging admittedly. But I think those brands that are try and true that have strong consumer pull and demand. As I stated earlier, we are seeing a significant portion of our existing consumer base buying more than they had done historically. That speaks to strong brands. And I think that when we are through this pandemic scenario that has been very hard to predict, we believe we will be right back on our longer-term beer sales trends of 7% to 9% growth, which is what I'm sure many of you are interested in, and certainly, every all saying, point to the fact that our long-term algorithm is unchanged.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good afternoon. I have a question and a clarification. On the question, can you give us an idea of the cadence of the beer depletions for the quarter? Especially U.S. in May and now in June, I think you, Bill you said, the kind of the 5% to 6% would be the -- the non-adjusted number for June, but I was wondering what happened in the previous quarter. And then that June is probably because you went out and the stock-outs that you mentioned before. And if you can give us an idea of the 75% decline in terms of the cadence that you had. I'm assuming that would be much worse in May than it was in the beginning of the quarter that would be helpful? And the clarification on the wine guidance for the second quarter, you said sales and EBIT down -- Garth said, down 25% on a year-over-year basis. Is that an organic number or you corporate some of the impact of the divestitures closing during the quarter? Thank you.
Garth Hankinson: Yes. So, I will take the second part of the -- I will take the Wine & Spirits of that first. So, the down 25% to 30% really does take into account largely the wine divestiture. We didn't expect -- since we're now anticipating or expecting to flow that in our Q2, we're not expecting to shift much of the divested brands during our Q2, and then furthermore, we are expecting on our Power Brands to have depletions slightly down as we don't -- as we don't replicate some promotional and shipping activity that really was non-productive.
Bill Newlands: And going back to your question about, how we think about the month. I think your question is a perfect example of why we have not given guidance because it is very, very difficult to predict. I mean, in the beginning of March, on-premise looked fairly normal. But the time we’ve got to the end of the quarter, the first quarter, it was up 75%. I mean, as good as Garth is at predicting, he couldn't have predicted that. So -- and now we are seeing some market places going back to closures or to significantly reduce volume in restaurants and pub scenarios. So, it is just very challenging for us to put exact number and how it's going to follow, if you could tell me how the pandemic would play out, we could give you a much better answer. But as we see on almost a daily basis on -- on the news, it's impossible to predict exactly what the pandemic is going to do, which is why we continue to go back to the scenario that says, we have extremely strong brands, and our brands are outperforming in the marketplace and in the channels that are open to us, and that's how we will continue to judge our success.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Bill Chappell: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a follow-up on the marketing spends and trying to understand how you're looking at it, as you said, some events like the NCAA tournament have been canceled. There could be a case where you're advertising at the World Series and the NBA Championship at the same time. So, how do you look at the spend for the back half of the year, especially around sports spending, when a lot of it's going to concur and it seems like it would be very duplicative to advertise all over the place?
Bill Newlands: Well, you're right. It's more challenging than it would usually be. And as Garth pointed out in his remarks, the first quarter was a great example as there were a lot of live events and many of the things on which we normally advertise, like using the NBA as an example, just didn't exist. So, we are going to be focused in real-time on where we can implement our marketing spend. What I think is most important overall, as Garth noted, we still expect to spend between 9% and 10% on our marketing of our brands. When you look at historical results of companies that continued to spend in recessions, and admittedly, we're in one, or we're about to be in one. Those companies that continued to support their brands came out the back end even stronger. We believe in that and we are going to continue to spend. As you pointed out, that will mean some real time adjustments as we go. Because, admittedly, it's been very tough to predict what will in fact occur and when it will occur as you’re seeing with things like the baseball schedule, which has moved all over the place in terms of number of games and how they're actually going to exercise those. Same is true in basketball; same is true in many of the live activity. So the reality is we will be doing this in real time. But it doesn't change our intent, which is we’re going to spend against our brands to make sure they are top of mind in the consumer's view.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Steve Powers: Yes. Hey, thanks. Actually, I want to pick up on that train of thought, in terms of just an update on how you're assessing any implications of recessionary economic conditions on your categories and brands. I mean, so far, as you highlighted, the premiumization trends have continued nicely. So, but do you see any risk coming -- of that coming under pressure, even if temporary whether in beer or Wine & Spirits and just what are you watching most closely, keep tabs on that as conditions developed? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Certainly. As you would expect, we watch things like unemployment rates. We are overdeveloped, as you know with the Hispanic community and the unemployment rates in the Hispanic community have been significantly higher than the average unemployment rates in the in the marketplace today, although all of its in double-digits. So, so that's something that we watch very carefully. Again, it's the same point, the brand awareness, brand loyalty of our brands within those communities are very strong. But we watch those things very, very carefully. Certainly, one of the other things that you see, and I think it's been exacerbated in the pandemic because of people sheltering is people look for those small moments of joy in their lives. And fortunately, our brands can often offer those to people. So, we think that the strength of our brands in conjunction with people engaging more at home than they would naturally and normally do, will be important to the continued success of our business, albeit, we're watching a lot of those characteristics like unemployment very carefully.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Your line is open.
Laurent Grandet: Good morning everyone and thanks for the opportunity for the questions. So, I'd like to come back to the wine divestiture to Gallo. It looks like, I mean, the $250 million earn-out is based on volume depletion performance in fiscal year 2020 and 2021 versus fiscal year 2019. And if I read it correctly in depletion orders between minus 10% from the payment to minus 2% for 100% payments, so could you please tell us, as we're kind of almost in the middle of it, the current volume depletion performance of the portfolio brands you’re applying to divest to Gallo? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Yes. Thanks for the question. And what I would tell you is that the earn-out portion of that transaction is really based on the 24 months after we closed the transaction. So we'll measure how those brands performing at the end of year one, and then again, the end of year two. Those brands have benefited recently by what Bill has described, as the change in consumer behavior to shift consumer behavior toward these tried and true brands or back to tried and true brands. And so some of the brands that we are divesting to Gallo is actually recovered quite nicely in that portfolio of brands is performing much better than it was a year ago at this time. So we feel is that as we transition that portfolio brands to Gallo, that they're in a very good position, and they're in a good state of health that we've got a very good chance of getting into that [indiscernible] a meaningful way.
Operator: Our next question -- with MKM Partners. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. And you'll have to forgive me I'm still a bit confused. Did you say June beer's shipments are roughly minus 7% or are you saying June is down a bit more than minus 7% and July and August will help make up for to get the total quarter beer shipments to minus 7%?
Bill Newlands: We didn't comment on shipments at all. We talked about depletions. As we’ve said we have ramped up our production during June to normal levels, which will allow us as subsequent quarters. My personal suggestion would be that many of you think about the first quarter and the second the third, as in combination. Because as our production has ramped up, you will see some continuing stress on the shipment side of our business during Q2, and we would expect [depletes] to outperform ships during the quarter with a lot of that flipping as you go to the latter part of the year. Again, it still goes back to our long-range algorithm around beer being up 7% to 9% is very consistent. We expect that in the long run, and we view this short-term pandemic blip as being just that, a blip in our long-term success.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. At this time, I would turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for closing remarks.
Bill Newlands: Great. Thank you. Thanks everybody for joining our call today. Despite the challenges and extremely volatile environment that were concurrent with the start of our fiscal year, we've delivered solid performance and strong cash flow generation during Q1, which provides us with great momentum, as we head into our key summer selling season. Let me reiterate that the short-term production disruption to our import beer business that we experienced during Q1 does not hinder our long-term outlook as consumer demand and takeaway for our brands remains extremely robust in the channels that remain open, and we remain optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. In closing, I'd like to wish everyone a Happy Fourth of July and hope that your celebrations with your family and friends includes our fantastic beers, our wines, and our spirit products. Thanks again everyone and please have a healthy and safe summer season. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-04-03 11:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands Q4 Full Year FY20 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Josh. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's year-end fiscal ‘2020 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure any other non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the Company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to what we’ve done in prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now, here's Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Patty. Let me add my welcome as well. Let me quickly frame up the key themes you're going to hear from Garth and me today. First, we delivered strong performance in fiscal ‘20, led by our beer business which generated double-digit operating income for the year with accelerating IRI trends as Q4 progressed, and that momentum has continued in the early stages of fiscal ‘21. We have ample brewing capacity to continue fueling the growth of our beer business in the medium term, and we're working with local authorities and government officials in Mexico to ensure we have ample long-term capacity as our business continues to grow and evolve. Second, our high-end power brands and successful new product launches fueled performance in fiscal ‘20 that drove accelerating depletion trends in Q4 for our wine and spirit business as our premiumization strategy continues to take hold. And third, our strong performance and fit financial discipline generated record cash flow, reduced our outstanding debt, and built solid momentum heading into fiscal ‘21. We'll talk in more detail about each of these areas, but before we go any further, I'd like to take a minute to address current circumstances related to the COVID-19 outbreak. First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers go out to those affected by this terrible virus and to the first responders and healthcare professionals working to help those in need. We sincerely hope the increased efforts to more fully contain this virus gain strong traction soon. With this in mind, we operate with a customer-focused mindset, a genuine concern for people and a desire to make a positive difference in our communities that is core to our DNA, even more important today as our industry and communities face substantial hardships. As such, constellation along with a number of our brands, has committed more than $2.5 million toward COVID-19 relief efforts that will directly benefit our business partners and communities now and through their recovery. Specifically, we are supporting the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation, Restaurant Employee Relief Fund; the U.S. Bartenders Guild and first responders who continue to support those in need in communities across the U.S. I'm also extremely proud of the Constellation team for their continued efforts to meet the needs of consumers and to help keep the economy going while also keeping our people safe. The health and wellbeing of our employees is our number one priority, and we've taken a number of preventative measures and provided a number of protections to keep our employees safe in our operations and out at retail and to ensure our continued ability to meet the needs of the market. Our production facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Italy, and New Zealand are operational and our distributors are up and running. Our teams are also working hard to ensure our distributor and retail partners have ample supply of our products to meet consumer demand, particularly in the off-premise, which has seen accelerated growth as many restaurants and bars have suspended dine-in services to help mitigate spread of the virus. The off-premise channel represents 85% to 90% of depletion volume for both our beer and our wine and spirits businesses and over-indexes to the rest of the beverage alcohol industry in the U.S. versus the on-premise channel. These trends are reflected in recent IRI data ending 3 ‘22, which shows accelerating consumer takeaway trends in off-premise channels. Specifically, we've seen IRI dollar sales growth for our beer business increase to 24% in the four-week period ending 3 ‘22 versus 12-week and 52-week trends of 17 and 12 respectively. For our wine spirits power brands, we're also seeing accelerating growth, up 23% in the latest four-week period versus 12 and 52-week trends of 7 and 4. During this time, we are focused on the channels the consumer is choosing, namely 3-tier e-commerce, direct-to-consumer and the off-premise, especially big box grocery, mass and club channels where we are working diligently to ensure high-end stock positions for our key SKUs. We've also adjusted our marketing approach to ensure our consumer messaging is in tune with current realities and by shifting our focus to digital and social media platforms as sporting events and other major gatherings are suspended. Bottom line, we are well-positioned to continue meeting the needs of consumers as well as our retailer and distributor partners. We will continue to manage our business with focus and discipline, while remaining flexible and are willing to adapt as needed to shifting consumer behaviors. And I remain extremely optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business. Now, let's get back to those themes that I highlighted at the top of the call. As mentioned, our beer business once again delivered exceptional results in fiscal ‘20 and continues to be the leader in the high-end and a cornerstone of growth in the U.S. beer industry. Imports continued to be one of the primary growth drivers in the high-end and the total beer category with Constellation driving 100% of the growth in this segment. The primary drivers of our beer portfolio growth continues to be our Modelo and Corona brand families. The trio of brands that comprise the Casa Modelo brand family includes Modelo Especial, Modelo Negra and Modelo Chelada and is one of the biggest forces in beer, delivering more than 20 million cases of growth to the U.S. beer category, last year. Modelo Especial led the way as the top non-seltzer share gaining beer brand in the U.S. beer industry, achieving depletion growth of more than 16%, an acceleration over the previous year’s trend of 12%. Modelo Especial is now the number four beer brand overall in the U.S. beer market and the best selling beer in major markets like Chicago, as well as the States of Nevada and California where sales of the brand are greater than the two biggest premium domestic light brands, combined. We plan to invest at record levels this year for Modelo to reach more consumers and to increase the brand's appeal among total market consumers. We’ll accomplish this through innovation, investment in Spanish language media and targeted programming and will extend the brand through new pack sizes such as our seven ounce Modelito a popular format, particularly in C-stores, Innovation with new product offerings like Modelo Chelada, Mango Chile, and we're testing new spirits Barrel-Aged offerings on a smaller scale that remain true to the essence of the Modelo brand and align with consumer's desire for more flavor. I'm talking about Modelo Reserva, which is a golden, sessionable, refreshing lager with a 5.5% ABV that will be available in test markets in tequila and bourbon barrel-aged options. Modelo’s strength with Hispanic consumers continues to fuel the growth of this brand and with more than 1 million Hispanics reaching legal drinking age each year, combined with our continued efforts to broaden our appeal with general market consumers. We believe we're only scratching the surface of where this brand can go. Our flagship Corona brand remains the number one imported brand family in the U.S., selling just shy of 150 million cases in fiscal ‘20. In fiscal ‘21, we'll embark on a comprehensive master brand restage for the Corona brand family that drives a more cohesive look and greater consistency in marketing communications across sub brands, as well as new heritage and experiential programs designed to strengthen the bonds consumers already have with Corona. We're also excited to launch a new cause marketing program, focused on protecting our beaches, through our partnership with Oceanic Global, a leader in ocean conservation. We believe this program will further deepen the emotional connection Corona consumers have with the brand. Corona Extra is the seventh largest brand in the U.S. beer category, and remains the number one brand in New York City, Miami, D.C., and is a top three brand in eight other major U.S. markets. Brand equity for Corona Extra remains extremely strong, and sales have accelerated in IRI with 4-week and 12-week trends outpacing their corresponding 52-week trends. We remain bullish on Corona Extra's future potential, knowing that there are several large DMAs that based on high per capita income are right for Corona Extra growth. In only a second year as a national brand, Corona Premier grew depletions nearly 19% in fiscal ‘20 to 10 million cases and became the number five growth brand in the U.S. beer category with distribution continuing to grow double digits. In just two years, Corona Premier has achieved an ACV of almost 75, which is similar to some brands that have been around for decades. This brand is perfectly positioned to capitalize on the macro trends of betterment, premiumization as consumers trade up from domestic life. And we have plans in place to continue building traction for this brand, including winning with Hispanic consumers who compromise about 30% of its consumer base. In fiscal '20 Corona Refresca became a 3 million case brand in its first year, with a variety pack becoming the number five top selling new beer in IRI. This now gives Corona an ownable play in the ABA space, delivering tropical flavors to a range of consumers. To capitalize on the success Refresca, we will be extending the brand into the high ABV FMB space this fall with the launch of Corona Refresca [Mass] [ph], 24-ounce cans with 8% ABV in tropical berry and mango citrus flavors. We are very excited about this year's Corona Hard Seltzer launch, which is off to a strong start and has already achieved an ACV approaching 50 in its first month of national launch.  As we've said before, the hard seltzer category continues to grow at a breakneck clip, and we believe it's here to stay. As an aside, our recent venture investment in Press Seltzer provides a wonderful complement with a unique value proposition and price point, as we believe the hard seltzer segment will price stratify over time.  Our Pacifico brand grew depletions more than 13% in fiscal ‘20 which represents an acceleration over the previous year. Pacifico is the number seven beer overall in California, where it continues to grow double digits. In fiscal ‘21, our plans will focus on continuing to win in California, while further expanding awareness and trial in key DMAs across the country. This includes a 40% increase in digital marketing investment, including our first national YouTube buy, a new sponsorship with the LA Chargers, and continued partnerships with the Summer and Winter X Games, which will help us to do just that. In addition to our continued focus on accelerating growth for our core beer franchises, we're also leveraging innovation and domestic production capabilities to launch new to-world brands that allow us to compete in growing sectors of the high end. Our recent launch of Two Lane in partnership with country music star Luke Bryan is a great example. This beer plays in the domestic high-end sessionable space and delivers on a refreshing taste consumers want with only 99 calories, 3 grams of carbs and 4.2% ABV. In fiscal ‘21, Two Lane will be available in select markets in the Southeast. In support of our efforts to build brands consumers love, our commercial team continues to work with our three-tier partners to ensure we deliver world-class execution at retail. This includes increasing adoption of shopper-first shelf principles, by making it easier for consumers to shop by organizing shelf flow in ways that help maximize growth and profitability and by meeting consumers where they are going by allocating space based on future growth opportunities and ensuring highly incremental packages with high velocity are represented with adequate holding power. We currently have 6,000 retailers that have implemented shopper-first shelf principles and those who have embraced this program have seen solid increases in overall growth and profitability for their category. As you can see, we believe fiscal ‘21 holds great promise for our beer business with a healthy core, master brand innovations and emerging brands poised to grow. From an operational perspective, we continue to make strategic investments in our beer business to ensure we have the capacity, quality, control and flexibility to support the continued growth of our business in the medium-term based on our forecasts. The capacity we’ve built in Nava plus Obregon when completed at the end of this year will enable us to provide more than 400 million cases of beer, which is ample supply for several years to come. We also completed construction of furnace number five at our glass plant adjacent to our Nava Brewery, which now supplies 60% of the glass needs for that brewery, resulting in significant logistics savings. Earlier this week, I met with Mexican president, López Obrador and his team in Mexico to discuss our brewery construction project in Mexicali. Our discussions were constructive and surfaced several options for consideration. We will continue to work with local authorities and government officials in Mexico to reach an optimal solution for our business. We've had a positive, mutually beneficial relationship with Mexico for more than 30 years and we fully expect this to continue. Some of you have asked about our operations. Let me just say that we are being exceedingly careful to protect our people and to maintain ultimate safety. With that said, over the past several weeks, we've taken steps to build ample product supply across our warehouse and distributor network in the U.S. We have close to 70 days in the system and we’ve shifted resources to accelerate production of high-volume SKUs for key off-premise accounts. Our facilities are currently operating and we remain confident in our ability to continue meeting the needs of U.S. consumers and did not expect any near-term service disruption to retailers. Shifting now, our wine and spirits premiumization strategy continues to show promise as our business closed out fiscal ‘20 in a position of strength, posting accelerating power brand depletion growth and operating margin improvement in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter power brand’s family depletion growth accelerated to more than 4%, led by double-digit growth for Kim Crawford, Meiomi and The Prisoner Brand Family, as this collection of brands continued to outpace the total U.S. wine market. Operating margin expansion was driven by our focus on more efficient price promotions with our mainstream power brands, as well as market share gains in the higher end of our portfolio with Meiomi and The Prisoner family contributing strong mix trends. Innovation continues to fuel growth as we capitalize on innovation trends in consumer-driven growth segments. Our introduction last quarter of Unshackled by The Prisoner Wine Company has been extremely well received. We further capitalized on Barrel-Aged wine trends with the introduction of new offerings from both Woodbridge and Cooper & Thief. Since launching our first Barrel-Aged wine series a little more than two years ago, we have sold well over 2 million cases, and that number continues to climb. In response to the consumer-led trends around convenience, we launched Kim Crawford wine in a can. And our Crafters Union brand remains the number one growth driver in the can wine segment. We're also excited about the recent launches of SVEDKA botanical flavors, and Ruffino Organic Prosecco, which align with consumer trends for flavor, betterment and sustainability. Bottom-line for fiscal '20, our wine, spirit transformation focused on premiumization continues to gain traction. Our higher end power brands are driving mix and margin expansion. Our mainstream power bands are outgrowing the competition. And our innovation initiatives are fueling growth through velocity and distribution gains. Heading into fiscal ‘21, we are committed to investments in bold innovations, compelling, marketing campaigns, and immersive brand experiences with a specific focus on top markets and accounts in priority DMAs. We'll continue building momentum by further leaning into our premiumization strategy and maximizing growth opportunities for our power brands through compelling marketing campaigns for Woodbridge, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, SVEDKA and The Prisoner. We're instituting greater pricing discipline, consistent with strategies that have proven very successful in building strong brands in other parts of our beverage portfolio. And, we'll continue to leverage the power of existing brands with strong equity. We remain committed to mix and margin accretive innovation in growing sectors of the wine and spirits categories that align with consumer trends. We have a strong innovation pipeline planned for the coming year, including upcoming line extensions for Ruffino and SVEDKA Vodka in the RTD space. The launch of a new High West pre-mixed cocktail in the spirit space, and the extension of our highly successful Barrel-Aged wine program. You can also expect us to introduce new-to-world brands in the wine category. In addition, we plan to leverage the success of shopper-first shelf initiative developed by our beer business by adapting and implementing this program for wine and spirits retailers in fiscal '21. We recently took pricing on our Woodbridge brand beginning March 1st, and to-date we have seen no negative impact from this action, due to the consumer need to stick with tried and true brands in this time of uncertainty. We are actively supporting this price increase with marketing investments, including national TV, as well as digital and social advertising. We're in the final phase of completing the revised Gallo deal. And we continue to work with the FTC, primarily on the brands that have been excluded from the original deal. We have communicated our intent to retain the Cook’s and J. Rogét sparkling wine brands, and the FTC is currently reviewing our business plans to support these brands in the future. In addition, the FTC is vetting potential buyers we have identified for Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy, and our concentrate business. We continue to work in collaboration with Gallo to satisfy all FTC obligations, and both companies are fully committed to getting this deal done. With each step, we're marching closer to the finish line. And we expect to close the deal around the end of our first quarter. Finally, we're very encouraged by the steps David Klein is taking in his new role as CEO of Canopy Growth. David and the Canopy team recently announced their focus on four key areas, improving Canopy's connection with consumers, instilling greater focus and discipline across the organization, defining visible path for profitability and positive cash flow, and building the Company's credibility with key stakeholders. Canopy continues to be the global leader in total cannabis sales, with a leading market share in Canada. The Company recently took steps to right size its business to better align with consumer demand and position the Company for long-term success. Canopy just launched its first cannabis beverage product, Tweed Houndstooth & Soda, which has received an overwhelmingly positive consumer response. And they plan to roll out additional beverage products over the last few months. And I can tell you, they are awfully good. These are game-changers. They also have completed their first shipments of cannabis-infused edible chocolates, and Juju Power 510 batteries in December of 2019. We expect further revenue from these products like vape, edibles and beverages gain traction in the marketplace now that rec 2.0 products have been legalized in Canada. Canopy remains best positioned to win long-term and to face challenges associated with this current economic environment, as many competitors without access to capital show signs of trouble. In closing, we reached the conclusion of an excellent year in fiscal ‘20. Our path to these impressive results was paved with great execution and consumer obsession in growing our core business supported by investments to enhance our portfolio and our operations. We are now facing an increasingly challenging operating environment and rapidly changing market conditions. As you can see from our press release, we are not providing formal guidance. However, we provided the targets that are included in our original fiscal ‘21 plan, prior to the COVID-19 crisis. My goal in doing this is to reiterate that our strategy remains unchanged and to provide the confidence we have in the growth prospects for our core business, as I continue to feel very optimistic about our long-term opportunities. When we look at the beverage alcohol category, we are generally a recession-resistant industry. In previous recessions and downturns, the TBA industry has generally been non-cyclical and only minimally affected. Bottom-line, we manage our business for the long term, making tough but necessary decisions to adapt to consumer trends while always looking forward to deliver what's next. We will continue to quickly adapt to rapidly evolving market dynamics, which is a continuation of who we've always been. Now, with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Garth who will review our financial results for fiscal ‘20 and our financial focus for ‘21. Garth
Garth Hankinson: Thank you, Bill, and hello everyone. Fiscal ‘20 marked another great year for Constellation brands. We produced strong beer operating performance and cash flow results, while our wine and spirits power brand strategy continued to gain momentum as marketplace performance for these brands outpaced the overall U.S. wine and spirits category for fiscal ‘20. Specifically, in fiscal ‘20, we grew comparable basis diluted EPS, excluding Canopy equity earnings by 6%. In addition, we generated record operating cash flow of almost $2.6 billion and record free cash flow of $1.8 billion. We also reduced debt by more than $1.4 billion and came within our target leverage range. And we returned over $600 million of cash to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. Before going into further detail on fiscal ‘20 results, I want to take a moment to discuss the rapidly changing market conditions due to the impact of COVID-19. To echo Bill, while the COVID-19 outbreak and situation is unprecedented and creates a lot of uncertainty and volatility, one thing remains clear, we will continue to be agile in the marketplace and actively manage and responsibly navigate our way through this crisis. Constellation is a strong cash flow generator, has ample liquidity, financial flexibility, and significant capacity under our $2 billion revolving credit facility. Additionally, we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating, which allows for flexible access to capital markets and more favorable rates. Furthermore, as Bill mentioned, we continue to work in collaboration with Gallo to satisfy all FTC obligations and both companies remain fully committed to finalizing this transaction. As such, upon close of the Gallo transaction, we expect to receive approximately $850 million in cash, which we plan to use for debt pay down to further advance and progress -- to further advance the progress we've made to reduce our leverage and maintain it within our targeted range. More on fiscal ‘21 in a minute, as I want to continue to expand on the fiscal ‘20 financial performance we delivered before the COVID-19 impacts began to unfold where I’ll generally focus on a comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 8%, primarily due to shipment volume growth of 6% and favorable pricing. Depletion volume growth for the year came 7.5%, while depletion volume growth or import portfolio grew 8%. As expected, depletion volume growth was higher than shipment buying growth, primarily due to the FY19 year-end shipment timing benefit that reversed during our fiscal ‘20, most of which occurred in Q4. Beer gross margin increased 120 basis points to 55.6%, driven by favorability in pricing and FX. Our operational cost and efficiency initiatives helped offset the impact of inflation on costs such as materials, labor and freight. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 70 basis points to 10%, primarily driven by increased investment for the Modelo and Corona brand families and in support of our innovation activities, including Corona Hard Seltzer, which came in at the higher end of our previous guide range. As a result of the above mentioned factors, we achieved record full-year operating margin of 40%, an improvement of 70 basis points. Moving to wine. Net sales declined 6% on shipment volumes down approximately 8%. Full year net sales results outperformed our previous expectations, primarily due to stronger mix benefits from our power brands in Q4, driven by The Prisoner, Unshackled and Meiomi. Depletion volume declined 5% while power brand depletions were up 2%. We remain confident that our premiumization strategy is working as power brand trends accelerated as we've finished fiscal ‘20. Operating margins decreased 50 basis points to 26% as mix benefits and favorable SG&A were more than offset by higher COGS, primarily reflecting increased freight costs and an increase in marketing as a percent of net sales, driven by our premiumization and innovation activities. Corporate expenses came in slightly better than our previous guidance, finishing at $224 million, up approximately 13% versus last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in insurance costs, high incentive compensation, and a ramp-up in IT spend, to support our SAP S/4HANA implementations. Those increases were partially offset by a reduction in consulting costs. Comparable basis interest expense for the year increased 11% to $429 million. This primarily reflects additional interest expense related to the funding of our incremental investments in Canopy Growth in November 2018, partially offset by our debt pay down during fiscal ‘20. Our comparable basis effective tax rate excluding Canopy equity and earnings came in at 16.1% versus 18.2% last year. This improvement was driven by lower effective rates from our foreign businesses, partially offset by lower level of stock-based compensation benefits. While stock-based compensation benefits were lower on a full year basis, the benefit came in higher than expected during Q4, which drove the tax rate favorability versus our previous guidance. Now, let's review Q4 results. Beer net sales increased 9%, primarily due to shipment volume growth of 7% and favorable pricing. Depletion volume growth for our import portfolio should continue to strength, growing over 11%. When including an unfavorable impact from Ballast Point, total beer depletions were up 10.8%, including the benefit of an additional selling day in Q4. Beer operating margin decreased 120 basis points to 39.3% as increased marketing and SG&A spend was partially offset by benefits from pricing and COGS. Marketing as a percentage of net sales was 8.7% or 230 basis points higher than Q4 last year driven by marketing investments and spend timing. Wine and spirit net sales were up 1% for Q4, while shipment volume was down approximately 1%. As stated earlier, our power brands continued to drive mix benefits. Operating margin increased 120 basis points to 28.9%, primarily due to mix benefits and lower marketing and SG&A expenses. Moving to fiscal ‘20 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated a record $1.8 billion, compared to $1.4 billion last year. This represents an impressive 34% increase. Free cash flow improvement reflects strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx in the beer segment. CapEx totaled $727 million or 18% below last year spend and in line with our most recent guidance. This included approximately $520 million of CapEx for our Mexico beer operation expansion. Furthermore, through fiscal '20 we've cumulatively spent approximately $700 million in capital related to our Mexicali expansion project. Moving to our full-year fiscal '21 P&L and cash flow targets. Given the unprecedented COVID-19 events that began to have roughly and dramatically impact consumers and the marketplace, almost concurrently with the start of our fiscal year, and given the related uncertainty, volatility, and fast-moving developments that have evolved over the month of March, we do not believe it is prudent or appropriate to provide formal financial guidance for fiscal '21 at this time. With that being said, we thought it would be helpful to highlight some of our key financial targets, assuming a normalized environment for fiscal '21 prior to COVID-19, as reference as you think through your modeling and scenario work given the changing marketplace dynamics. For pre-COVID-19 fiscal '21, the beer business targeted net sales growth of 7% to 8%, which includes 1% to 2% of pricing within our Mexican portfolio. Including the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales growth is 8% to 10%. Operating margin in the 39.5% to 40% range as investments for the Corona Hard Seltzer launch as well as inflation headwinds, primarily related to glass, raw materials, transportation and labor costs in Mexico are expected to be greatest in the benefits from product pricing and productivity initiatives. Moving to wine and spirits. For pre-COVID-19 fiscal '21, the wine and spirits business targeted net sales and operating income decline of approximately 30% to 35%. This assumes the revised wine and spirits divestiture transaction with Gallo and the separate divestitures of Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy and the concentrate business closed around the end of Q1 fiscal '21, while the separate but related agreement to divest the Nobilo Wine Brand to Gallo closes by the end of Q2 fiscal '21. Lastly, the plan to retain the Cooks J. Rogét sparkling wine brands is also included in our pre-COVID-19 target for fiscal '21. Our pre-COVID-19 expectation for Q1 wine and spirits results assumes a decline of 25% to 30% in sales and operating income due to the following factors: Unfavorable Q1 FY21 comparison due to a very strong quarter last year for the brands to be divested, sales of the Black Velvet brands are not included in this year's Q1 result, as a result of the divestiture late last year, and distributors have ample supply of brands targeted for the Gallo divestiture as they assumed fiscal '20 year end close on the transaction. Our retained portfolio of power brands in the wine and spirits business, including Cook’s and J. Rogét target net sales growth of 2% to 4% on a pre-COVDI-19 basis for fiscal '21. Other pre- COVDI-19 target assumptions include interest expense in the range of $385 million to $395 million, comparable tax rates excluding Canopy equity earnings of approximately 18%, weighted average diluted shares outstanding targeted at approximately 195 million, operating cash flow in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. This is a good spot to discuss a few items around capital management and deployment. As you would expect, we’re reviewing in detail all expenses in capital expenditure plans for refinement and flexibility to make sure we prioritize and optimize the spend given the current business conditions and economic environment. While wine and spirits EBIT is moving down in fiscal '21, due to the planned divestitures, we are maintaining our current quarterly dividend rate. In addition, we remain focused on our goal of returning significant capital to shareholders balanced between dividend payments and share repurchases. However, in the short-term, given the uncertainty around the COVDI-19 impact on our business, we will be maximizing free cash flow and utilizing that free cash flow to reduce debt and leverage. We believe longer term, we retained a full flexibility to fulfill our $4.5 billion commitment over time. In closing, I want to reiterate that Constellation is a strong cash flow generator, has ample liquidity and financial flexibility. We remain focused on fruitfully navigating through the challenging environment presented by COVDI-19, and we'll look to provide updates including full year guidance as more factors become known. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.
Bonnie Herzog: So, I wanted to get some clarification on the Mexican government's decision, which determined that alcohol is non-essential. And I just wanted to make sure I understand what you're sharing with us today that if I heard you correctly, you are not suspending your production. But, what I'm hearing is, a lot of the other brewers are suspending. So, I just wanted to make sure I heard you correctly. And then, curious to hear how you see this situation evolving and maybe what your contingency plans are. You did share with us some of the, I think,, finished inventory that you have on hand to meet the U.S. demand. But I just kind of wanted to understand where you're at with that specific situation. Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure. So, as we stand today, we are currently operating. We also have, as I noted in my script, roughly 70 days through the system at either -- and that does not include at retail. That is purely that we have or our distributors have. So, we are fairly confident that we will see no disruption at retail from our operations, and we'll be able to meet consumer demand as it continues.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Bill, I think you mentioned that you're working through a series of options on what's going to happen with Mexicali. Obviously, we don't know which of those options you'll take. But, could you at least give some insight on what your options are from this stage?
Bill Newlands: We're not prepared to go through what the exact options are. What I would say is this. We had a very productive meeting with the President and his team. I think there is mutual agreement that we have been a strong player in Mexico for 30 plus years, and that that strong relationship is going to continue, and that we will have solutions for the long-term to make sure that we are able to meet the strong consumer demand that we continue to have for our brands. So, while I'm not prepared to talk about the specificity of that, we are very comfortable that our discussions will yield strong, medium and long-term benefits for our business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. You may proceed with your question.
Vivien Azer: Thank you. Good morning. I was just hoping to the on-premise off-premise mix, Bill, very helpful in terms of contextualizing the revenue mix. But, Garth, I was wondering, whether you could offer any insight into the margin differential, given the presence of kegs in the on-premise. And then, as a follow-up to that, is it possible for you guys to move cans and bottles that are no longer being sold in the on-premise into the off-premise with the distributors? Thanks.
Garth Hankinson: Thanks for the question, Vivien. So, to your first question, the margin differential, there's no margin differential for us between on and off-premise, because that goes through -- that all goes through distributors. So, same margin for us. As it relates to the question, can we move product out of the on-premise to the off-premise?
Bill Newlands: Let me touch on that Vivien. In many instances, distributors will pick up and redistribute supply where necessary or where a particular channel, like on-premise has effectively closed in many markets. So, yes, that in fact often does occur. Obviously, there's some format differences in terms of what people use in particular channels. But yes, it does occur. Just to reiterate a piece of your question as well. We are multiple points across both, beer, wine and spirits, less reliant in on-premise than the industry overall. So our business has been skewed historically and still is to the off-premise channel, which in an instance like this is very valuable. But, that's not to say, as you've heard, we haven't recognized the many challenges that our friends in the on-premise are having at moment. And we as a company and many of us as individuals have made significant contributions to help those who are in need at the moment and who have run into very challenging times, for those who are in the on-premise.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.
Bryan Spillane: Hey .Good morning, everyone. Garth, maybe just two quick modeling questions for you. One, in terms of the on, off-premise split for spirits and -- wine and spirit for the year. Could you give us a sense, in the fiscal '21 plan that was unaffected by COVID, what was the growth expectation in those two channels? What were you expecting [indiscernible] home versus growth at home? And then second, if you could give us a sense within both segments of just fixed and variable costs, as we kind of want to run through sensitivity to be able to get a rough sense of fixed and variable costs. Thank you.
Garth Hankinson: Bryan, would you mind repeating the first part of that question around the margins? I just -- I didn't quite catch that.
Bryan Spillane: So, the second part is just trying to get an understanding of what is fixed versus variable costs in both, the beer, and wine and spirits segments?
Garth Hankinson: Yes. Okay. So, fixed versus variable cost is -- for both businesses is they skew highly towards variable, call it somewhere in the neighborhood of two-thirds variable and one-third fixed, maybe a little bit higher in some cases. On the beer side, the variable costs really are around freight and packaging. And in wine it's [freight] [ph] costs and packaging. Then, I believe the first part of your question was around the on-premise versus off-premise growth rates. And for on-premise growth rates, we were modeling in flat and for off-premise it was mid single digits.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.
Nik Modi: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Bill, just a question on retail. I mean, we are hearing that resets are being pushed back -- resets are being pushed back. And I just wanted to gain an understanding of impacting you guys, because obviously there's a lot of new products coming in the marketplace. Corona Seltzer has gotten into the market but not at full distribution. So, if you could just give it some of the puts and takes in terms of how that's going, are you getting just more space of your A level SKUs in the place of some of the new products that were going to come out in the market? Any thoughts on that would be helpful. 
Bill Newlands: Sure. You bet. We're seeing -- first of all, obviously there was -- particularly in March, there was a lot of heavy-up pantry loading, people buying particularly those brands where they have a lot of comfort. And of course many, many of our brands across beer, wine and spirits all fit into that. So, that was obviously very helpful. Keeping in mind that the Seltzer, much like Refresca did, goes into different space, and Seltzer has obviously been a very hot category. You see a lot of that product on the floor with us and with competitors as well. And we've already in just the first month, our team and our distributors have done an outstanding job of getting the product out to market. We've almost achieved 50%, ACV in the first month, which is again record speed. So, we think as time goes forward, you're going to continue to see core SKUs, critical SKUs being very important. And in fact, we have made some adjustments in our production footprint to make sure that those core SKUs are fully available throughout the supply chain because that's something that we think will occur in the near term, until consumers spend more time in stores. We've also seen a very rapid uptick in click, things like 3-tier e-commerce, click and collect. Our Company had its single biggest -- in wine, had our single biggest direct-to-consumer week we've ever had last week as consumers again found alternate ways to continue to buy our products. So, I think, just to summarize that, you're going to continue to see critical SKUs, be in stronger distribution positions. But we've been very pleased with our distributors’ ability to continue to get critical new products. Remember, most of the new things that we're doing this year are master brand extensions. So, they are consistent and part of strong brand families. That particularly at a time like this, I think is important because the consumer often during recession or recessionary type behavior, seeks out those core brands that they have a lot of personal comfort with. And again, our brands fortunately are part of that set.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.
Dara Mohsenian: So, I wanted to ask more of a longer term question. In past cycles, we've seen some trade down occur in the beer category in a recessionary environment, including back in 2008, 2009. Could you just spend some time discussing how your product portfolio might be more or less at risk from a macro slowdown versus past cycles on a theoretical basis, sort of ex the COVID situation, due to much higher share level today, your brand mix has changed over time. So, just curious for your perspective on the degree of trade down risk or macro sensitivity may be versus what you see in the past cycles?
Bill Newlands: Yes. And I joked with Garth earlier today, I guess if you're old enough, you've been through a couple of these cycles. So, I have. What we expect to see is this. Brands are even more important at a time like this, because many people are seeing the opportunity -- and our category is one of those, for simple pleasures in life. Let's face it. The more people are sheltering in place, the more that they look for those small pleasures in life and our category is one of those that addresses that. But, you often see even stronger brand behavior that occurs during this time. So, let's take our Woodbridge wine brand example. We have seen significant pickup in the month of March for that brand because as I said in my script, it's a tried and true brand. People know it, they appreciate the quality for the price value relationship that exists there, and we've seen quite a bit of an uptick against that brand. We've seen the same thing with Kim Crawford, Meiomi and The Prisoner, brands that the consumer appreciates, and likes. Similarly, in beer, when you have a brand like Modelo that’s the number four brand now in the entire U.S. beer business, you've got a brand that has a great deal of trust, and you're seeing the trends that support that. Fortunately, Modelo and Corona are two of the most trusted brands in the consumers’ mind. And therefore, we feel very comfortable that we will actually get a disproportionate amount of benefit that occurs when people go to the more tried and true brands. That's what we saw in 2008, that's what we saw in the previous recession before that that those tried and true brands end up winning. And we think our brands are well-positioned across beer, wine and spirits to take advantage of that, just a little less experimentation during a recession environment, and that's why those core brands like ours will do very well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.
Lauren Lieberman: My question was just continuing to going back to the conversation about Mexico production. If we do, in fact, get to place where you need to curtail production, even though there's no [Technical Difficulty], how should we think about [Technical Difficulty] margins, right? So you shut down the plant for a month, I would think you get a good amount of pressure on margins, but does that even out, when you ramp back up as you come out of this? So, just kind of thinking about very, very short-term question, but just trying to understand how we should think about that net impact on profitability? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Well, again, I'm going to repeat myself, but I hope you'll bear with me on it. We continue to operate in Mexico. And as long as that is a consistent statement and we expect that it will be, we wouldn't expect that there would be any significant issues around our margin structure. Obviously, a lot of things factor into that, not the least of which is, the peso and various other things that occur during times like this. But, I think the best way to think about it is, we have 70 plus days in the pipeline for our beer business and we expect to have no disruption in our ability to produce product and deliver it to retail.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.
Kevin Grundy: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Bill Newlands: Good morning.
Kevin Grundy: Bill, I wanted to pick up on the on-premise, off-premise dynamic. I know, this is a difficult question to answer and I appreciate that you don't want to give guidance. But maybe even qualitatively, I think what a lot of investors are kind of wrestling with is how much of the unprecedented weakness in the on-premise channel is potentially going to be captured in the off-premise. And we've seen big pantry loading at this point, but really harder to make conclusions on what's going on in terms of how quickly consumers are going to -- will destock their pantries. So, any comments you have potentially on how much of the on-premise weakness will potentially be offset by the off-premise? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure. You bet. Admittedly, this is somewhat unprecedented. So, I think we need to all be careful with specificity of answers because in other recessionary periods, while you saw decreases in the on-premise, you didn't have shutdown in the on-premise. So, it is a little different. With that said, channel shift is not unusual during recessionary times. And you're obviously seeing that now in part because the on-premise is in many markets is largely closed. Again, if you are in the 85% to 90% range for us and the off-premise to start with, the need to see some increase in channel shift is less significant than it is for someone who is more weighted to the on premise. Let's take March as an example. Admittedly, there was some pantry loading that occurred during that month. It more than made up -- the off-premise more than made up for the on-premise loss that occurred during that timeframe. It was an excellent month. But, we're always reticent to project that forward because you don't know what the consumption profile will be. I'll repeat what I said a minute ago, because I think it's a very true comment. People look for small pleasures in their life when you were in situations of recession. Multiply that by the fact that most of us are now sheltering in home. Those small pleasures -- our business is one of those small pleasures and I think that will be advantageous for our business going forward.
Garth Hankinson: As long as around the on and off-premise question, let me just go back to clarify, Bryan's question around the growth rates related to on versus off-premise. Bryan, I gave you a bit of incomplete answer. So, what I gave you is zero on-premise growth and mid single digits. That was really for wine and spirits, as you think about their total sales being in that 2 to 4 range. On beer, total sales were targeting to be 8% to 10% on an organic basis. So, the on-premise would be in the sort of low to mid single digits and off-premise would be the remainder.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.
Rob Ottenstein: I was just wondering, if you could talk a little bit about how you may be adjusting your marketing spend, and what sort of flexibility you have on your contracts. Obviously, you do a lot with ESPN, a lot of sports, UFC and a lot of these events just aren't going to happen. So, is there -- maybe there's some kind of breakout that you can give us in terms of what is fixed for this year or let's say the calendar year, next 12 months, and what areas you can possibly save or redirect?
Bill Newlands: This is also, as you would expect, a bit of a moving answer. Some things you've seen have been postponed. Therefore, we are not -- well, we may not spend it in the first quarter, we might well spend it when the events do occur, assuming they do. What we have done is that we have adjusted, Jim Sabia and his team in both wine spirits and in beer, have done a fair amount to move to more digital and social media efforts, which is actually good. That's very consistent with where the consumer is going anyway. So, we do have quite a bit of flexibility to move things around. When you have cancellations, let's take the NCAAs. That is a cancellation. So, choices are then made as to whether or not we reproportion that type of spend that we have into other formats, or we don't. Those decisions are ongoing. It’d be difficult to give you a definitive answer at this point in time around that. We will try to do that going forward, as more thoroughly understand what is canceled versus what is delayed. Until we have a better handle on that, it’d be very difficult. Suffice it to say, one of the traits that we've seen with our marketing group is to be very nimble, and they are being very nimble, adjusting on the fly to more digital and social environments from things where we can't do live sports, as you know.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.
Andrea Teixeira: As a follow-up on the comments about the production in the Mexico in your discussions, Bill, with the Mexican government. In order to stay open, could you prove that your production facilities are safe enough to be made operational through the end of April? And then as a follow-up to the margin commentary, how much of your Mexican peso dominated costs are hedged at this point in light of the devaluation of the Mexican pesos?
Bill Newlands: So, Garth, I'll take the first half of that. Let me just tell you some of the things we've done. And we've done this in the wine and spirits as well as beer. And I think it's important. As I said, our employees are our number one priority. We are testing for temperature as people enter our facilities. We are keeping social distancing in our facilities to make sure that people are safe. We have changed how we run shifts in our plants to make sure there are not overlaps of shifts, in case there are any issues that occur with people's health. So, we are doing everything humanly possible to make sure that we continue to operate in a safe and effective manner within all of our operating facilities. The same is true of that in New Zealand and Italy as well. So, first and foremost, we are taking great care to make sure we are operating correctly. I think that will likely be respected by the government of Mexico. They have obvious concerns for their entire economy, as our country has great concerns for our economy, to make sure that people are being protected. And I think the kind of steps that we're taking to make sure we're protecting our people, we believe is best in class. We're keeping track of everything possible to ensure the safety of our employees, and that effort will continue. Garth, do you want to touch on the second piece?
Garth Hankinson: Sure, on the hedging piece. So, as it relates to both, commodities and on currency, we're -- for the current fiscal year, fiscal '21, we are hedged on both fronts, in excess of 80%. We are using this period of time as we see some movements on commodities and in currency to layer in additional hedges for the next couple years. So, we could see some further benefits in coming fiscal years.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. You may proceed with your question?
Laurent Grandet: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for the opportunity. So, two follow-up questions actually. One, you said you will focus on the core brands going forward. And that makes sense. I’d like to understand if Corona Seltzer is considered as a core brand and being -- will be one of your focus points for the next two months. That's one question. And the second follow-up, sorry to come back on this, manufacturing in Mexico. But, this morning again one of your competitors said that on Sunday April 5th Grupo Modelo will suspend beer production and distribution operations. So, as you've got 70 days of inventory, obviously you want to beat kind of goodwill with the Mexican government, I mean, on the Mexicali and brewery subset. So, why -- and there is something, I don't know understand it. Why are you -- have you decided to go against the government decision in that specific subject? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: So, let's tackle your first question, which is seltzer. Certainly, our Corona brand family, since we approached 150 million cases of product in fiscal '20 is one of the critical things and critical brands that we have within our portfolio. The seltzer, as you know, is one of the fastest growing sub segments within the alcohol beverage business, as well. Therefore, the combination of the great Corona branding, plus the hot category of seltzer is a wonderful combination. And we're expecting that that's going to be important part of our success story for fiscal '21. I do need to be very, very clear with you. We are not doing anything against what the government of Mexico is suggesting. We certainly -- our company is known for respecting, respectful of the laws and approaches of any company -- any country in which we operate. And that certainly will continue. I have no comment regarding a competitor and what they are choosing to do or not choosing to do. I personally would suggest you ask them. What I would say is today, currently, we are operating and we will continue to do what's appropriate under the restrictions that apply or don't apply in any company -- in any country in which we operate.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Kirk with MKM Partners. You may proceed with your question.
Bill Kirk: Thank you, everyone. So, on the 70 days of inventory in the system, how much of that is in Mexico? I guess, that'll show up in a 10-K, but how much of it is in Mexico and how much of that is actually allowed to leave Mexico and into the United States? Is that allowed to come over the border right now?
Bill Newlands: So, to answer your question, the vast majority of that answers in the United States between either inventory at our distributors or in our DCs. So, the vast majority of it I would say, in excess of 80% of that is already in the United States.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. You may proceed with your question.
Bill Chappell: I just want to go back to Mexicali. And I understand you can't talk about where it goes from here. But can you maybe give us an update on how much money has been put into it? And then, any kind of color on how you've got this far down the path and we got to this stage?
Garth Hankinson: Yes. I'll take the first part of that. To-date, we have spent approximately a $700 million in Mexicali.
Bill Newlands: So, what I would say is that there are a lot of decisions that have been made as time has gone on. As you know, there have been changes in government during the time that this facility has been started. What I would say is this. We've been operating in Mexico for 30 years. It has been a tremendous partnership with the people of Mexico and with the government of Mexico and with the local States within Mexico. We remain extremely confident in our long-term ability to meet the consumer needs in the United States for the critical brands of Modelo, Corona, Pacifico, and other related brands. So, I don't feel that it does anyone any good to micromanage the approach to the situation. What I would say is we're going to have a very solid solution for our long-term prospects and we certainly appreciate the government's engagement with us on that topic.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean King with UBS. You may proceed with your question.
Sean King: Hi. Thanks for the question. I got a wine sale question. Is it safe to say that the escalating COVID-related work stoppages and disruptions could have an impact on the, I guess, achievability of the new timing, or is that already baked into your new outlook?
Garth Hankinson: So, thank you for the question. We think that the COVID situation is baked into the current timeline. That being said, I don't know how much more disruption COVID-19 could have in terms of the government's ability to work. But I can tell you right now that the FTC continues to be actively engaged in our conversations and in the review of this process. And, we’ve factored all of that into the timeline that we provided.
Operator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for any further remarks.
Bill Newlands: I'd just like to thank everyone for joining our call today, particularly in these challenging times. I believe we've done an excellent job of building vital momentum in fiscal '20 as we head into what admittedly will be a volatile start to our new fiscal year. Through our strategic initiatives and priorities, we are positioning Constellation for sustained long-term success and will continue to quickly adapt to the rapidly changing market dynamics as we navigate through fiscal ‘21. As the environment evolves, and more factors become known over the next few months, we hope to be able to provide much more clarity on the prospects for our business for the year in which we are in. I'd like to thank you all again for joining the call. And I hope you and your loved ones remain healthy and safe during this unprecedented time. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-01-08 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, we will -- the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks Liz. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's third quarter 2020 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and David Klein, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure any other non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please also refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Patty. Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. I certainly hope you enjoyed the holidays and have the opportunity to include some of our awesome Constellation products in your celebrations with your family and friends. The end of every year is a time of reflection for me, and this year is no exception. As I reflect on 2019 I'm reminded that we're not only ending a certain fiscal year but a dynamic decade the Constellation Brands. Since 2010 constellation has been on an incredible journey marked by strong financial performance and notable business milestones. Over the last 10 years, we've significantly increased the value of our stock and produced double-digit growth in sales, operating income and operating cash flow. As a matter of fact, the closing price of Constellation's stock on December 31, 2009 was just more of than $15. Fast forward to December 31, 2019 we closed at almost 190. This incredible increase of more than 1000% over the last 10 years made Constellation, the best performing stock in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index during this timeframe. One of the biggest drivers of our success with the game changing beer acquisition that was executed almost half way through the last decade. It enables Constellation to buy Grupo Modelo brands in the United States where we successfully built these brands for many years, while positioning ourselves for this transformational opportunity. At that time, this deal allowed us to double the sales of our company, diversify our profit stream, significantly enhance our margin, earnings and free cash flow while providing new avenues for growth. Since then, our beer business has made significant contribution to the overall sales, profit and cash flow results for our business and continues to be a powerhouse for growth as the number one Brewer and seller of imported beer in the US market. Calendar 2019 marked the 10th consecutive year of volume growth for Constellation Beer business and solidified our position as the leader in the high end of the US beer business. These trends were driven by Corona Extra, Modelo Especial's explosive growth and our successful innovation initiatives. In 2010, the Modelo Especial brand depleted approximately 35 million cases and then went on to achieve double-digit growth in every single year of the past decade finishing 2019 at more than a 140 million cases and there's more to come. In our most recent third quarter this powerhouse brand posted depletion growth of almost 15% with double-digit growth in 46 of the 50 states while solidifying its position as the number four beer brand in the US market. Corona Extra which is the number 7 beer brand in the US beer category grew from approximately 90 million cases in 2010 to more than a 110 million cases in 2019 and as one of the few top selling brands in the US to grow this past decade. From a quarterly perspective the Corona brand family grew nearly 7% in IRI channels, driven by the continued strength of our Corona Premier and Corona Refresca innovations as well as the renewed growth of Corona Extra. Corona Premier continues to gain distribution, especially in the on-premise and delivered double-digit depletion growth in 35 of the 50 states during the quarter. Corona Refresca was a top 10 growth contributor to the year -- to the US high-end beer category during the third quarter. And finally, let's not forget Pacifico which achieved double-digit depletion growth of nearly 16% and remained a top share gainer within the US imports segment. We're excited also about our plans for the launch of Corona Hard Seltzer this spring, which will help to further strengthen our position as the leader in the high end of the US beer segment. Our launch strategy includes the largest-ever single brand investment for our portfolio of more than 100 -- excuse me, more than 40 million in marketing to support this intro. We've already started to take orders from distributors and have received incredibly positive feedback from retailers who are excited about the prospects of Corona seltzer and have already incorporated our newest portfolio addition into their shelf set programing plans for the spring selling season. As we've discussed Corona hard seltzer will be introduced in four flavors, including tropical lime, mango, cherry and blackberry lime. Corona carries unbelievably strong brand equity as the number one most loved brand among both Hispanic and total population drinkers aged 21 to 54 and that's why we've decided to put the Corona brand name on our new seltzer and of course the refreshment characteristics of seltzers perfectly matches with Corona's refreshment DNA. There's been a lot of debate about the seltzer trend and where seltzers are sourcing their growth within the total beverage alcohol category. Our research shows that seltzer you is taking share across the board from beer, wine and spirits. While significant amount of this growth is sourced from the beer category it is primarily coming from domestic premiums, press and FMBs with minimal interaction of seltzer consumption with imported brands. In addition, we are seeing increased overall consumption from those seltzer drinkers and new consumers who are entering the TVA space through their interaction with seltzers. As the trends that you've seen for Constellation's beer business in this week's four week IRI data covering the month of December are related to our recent annual price increase specifically in the California market which briefly decreases features and promotions. The impact of these price increases are normal and frankly short term in nature. Overall we closed out the month With the depletion growth high single-digit range of our year-to-date trends. Moving now to wine and spirits. I'm pleased that we've been able to execute a revised agreement with Gallo which paves the way for accelerated growth and margin performance for our wine and spirits business going forward. In addition, we believe it addresses the FTC concerns by excluding the sparkling wine brandy dessert wines and concentrate categories from the original transaction. We are already actively pursuing other opportunities to divest most if not all brands in these categories as we believe this is the best path to optimize our portfolio going forward. To be clear the FTC needs to provide final approval of our revised agreement with Gallo, once we have finalized all transactions, including the proposed divestitures, which we expect to occur by our fiscal year-end. We have also entered into a separate but related agreement with Gallo to divest our Nobilo Wine brand. This fits with Gallo portfolio strategy and allows them to expand in the New Zealand wine category without affecting our long-term goals and strategy or our opportunity in the New Zealand wine category in the US as a greater than $11 price point. This transaction is expected to close in the first half of fiscal 21. Despite the delay and timing and revisions to the transaction I'd like to remind everyone that we have benefited from almost an entire year of additional cash flow from the divested brands by the time the transaction closes, which has contributed to our debt reduction and share buyback activities. During the last decade our team has created significant value by transforming and simplifying our wine and spirits portfolio through the rationalization and divestiture of assets in an average premiumized business, which is the right strategy to enhance our lines for growth and financial profile going forward. This premiumization strategy is taking hold in the marketplace as our power brands continue to outpace our competitors and take market share at the price points that matter in the higher end. In fact, our power brands as the greater than $11 retail price point grew nearly 9% in IRI channels. During the third quarter including brands like which is more than doubled this volume with a CAGR of nearly 30% since its acquisition in 2015. Kim Crawford, which is another gem within our power brand portfolio Was the number one selling wine on wine.com this past year and has consistently outperformed its competitors, posting a 20% volume CAGR and IRI channels over the last decade. As we progress through fiscal 20 we continue to show steady upward progression in revenue trends for our power brands and expect mid-single digit sales growth for this collection of brands in the fourth quarter. Innovation and new product development are also critical to our success for the remainder of the year and we feel we are well positioned to drive these initiatives to the finish line. We've already had great success with the launch of Robert Mondavi, Private Selection Buttery Chardonnay and Woodbridge ready to drink packs, which while gaining traction across all channels is doing especially well in the convenience channel. A channel growing at two times the rate of the total US wine market. Both Woodbridge and Robert Mondavi Private Selection which represent the most significant volume within the Robert Mondavi brand franchise are outperforming in their respective price segments driven by marketing investments that we've recently made. We recently extended our highly successful Barrel-Aged program with the introduction of our RMPS Rye Barrel Aged Red Blend. As a reminder, we've sold more than one million cases of barrel Lynch products since the inception of this program nearly two years ago, which helped to revive that Robert Mondavi Private Selection brand, will also becoming the foundation for some of our other successful Barrel Aged innovations like Cooper & Thief. We're also building on the success of wine in a can where consumers are seeking products that are convenient, ready to drink and sold an environmentally friendly packaging. These trends have helped to fuel the growth of Crafters Union, which is the number one growth driver in canned wine over the last 12 weeks. We plan to build on the momentum of this brand with the launch of Crafters Union Bubbles during the fourth quarter. Later this month, we will be releasing the prisoner Unshackled, the newest addition to The prisoner collection of brands in Red Blend and Rose. We expect these brands to strengthen our ability to compete at the fast growing $25 retail price point. On the spirits front SVEDKA Vodka continues to significantly outpace the Vodka the category in IRI channels, driven by increased distribution within a core portfolio as well as low as the more recent introduction of the Rosie flavor. During the quarter. One of our most successful venture investments. Nelson's Green Brier once launched its first Tennessee Whiskey product, this Tennessee Whiskey is based on Nelson's original recipe dating back to 1860 and it's the first time it's been bottled since provisions shut down at distillery in 1909. This is another milestone for Nelson's Green Brier as they continue to innovate and leverage the success they've already achieved. Overall, our US wine and spirits business has executed changes that have resulted in the sharpened focus on consumer preferred trends related to premiumization, innovation and brand building. As a result we have benefited from ongoing consumer trade of trends positive mix and great consumer response to our new product introductions in the marketplace. Before moving on to Canopy Growth, I'd like to remind everyone that the core business activities I just highlighted are driving an increase in our EPS guidance for fiscal 20. Now a few comments about our investment in Canopy Growth, which continues to have the leading market share in Canada and to leave a leader in global cannabis sales. We've remained bullish on the Canadian cannabis market as the conversion of the illicit market to the legal market continues to strengthen. Per Statistics Canada in 2018%, 23% of cannabis consumers obtained cannabis from a legal market, while in 2019 that number significantly improved to almost 50%. In addition, retail store sales have increased significantly in every province during the last 12 months. We expect further retail sales increases as products, like vape, edibles and beverages flow through the retail stores in Canada now the Rec 2.0 products have been released. We couldn't be more excited to see these products in the marketplace as Canopy now have the ability to showcase their best in class brands and intellectual property. We are also excited to see the progress, the Ontario government has made to satisfy the demand of consumers by agreeing to allow more retail store openings beginning in early March. During Canopy's second quarter they established leading recreational market share across Canada, including a noteworthy share of over 35% in Alberta, Canada's most developed provincial recreational market. In the US in early December the Canopy team introduced first and freight allowing a branded CBD products. These products And a variety of formats including softgels, oil drops and creams and are currently available for sale via e-commerce on the first and free website. Overall, we're pleased with the progress of the Canopy team and what they've accomplished in the last few months. As most of you know, in less than a week, my colleague, David Klein will assume the role of CEO in Canopy Growth where I believe he will bring more focus and discipline to that business in executing their strategic priorities. We have also appointed as Constellation's new CFO who will help lead our company through its next phase of growth. David has been a significant contributor to our organization during his time here. His accomplishments and Constellation are numerous, and I wish him great success of Canopy where I will continue to collaborate with him through our Canopy board interactions. During this time the Constellation David built an incredibly talented finance organization, which is why we're expecting a seamless transition as he assume his new role. Garth brings a wealth of experience to this critical leadership position. Most recently, serving as Senior Vice President for our corporate development activities, where he's led the company's efforts and financial planning reporting and analysis as well as mergers, acquisitions and our venture initiatives. Many of you will have the opportunity to meet Garth in the coming weeks and I would like to publicly congratulate him and welcome him to our executive management team. In closing we have accomplished a great deal on this exciting journey through the last decade. But I'm equally excited and optimistic about the next 10 years as well. We have a great product portfolio in a terrific industry, we have the right strategy and its energized management team in place to execute our vision for the future. I'd like to reiterate two key takeaways from today's discussion, number one, with every step we take we are positioning Constellation for sustained long-term success. As we continue to premiumize the portfolio the strategy, which has paid huge dividends over the years. I'm confident in the continuation of strong results for our beer business and the excellent prospects for our wine and spirits business going forward. Number two, our powerful cash generation capability and our desire to quickly de-lever and return 4.5 billion in cash to shareholders makes Constellation Compelling investment for the future. We remain steadfast in this commitment and I believe our significant debt reduction to date, coupled with our second quarter share repurchase are a testament to this commitment. We have a relentless consumer offset focus on brands and categories that are high growth, high margin and we're working continuously to build a solid and sustainable foundation of operational excellence, financial strength and innovation. We plan to execute in these areas throughout the remainder of the year and well into the coming decade. With that I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, David, who will review the financial results of our third quarter. David?
David Klein: Good morning everyone and thank you, Bill. It's truly -- pleasure working with you and all of the wonderful people at Constellation. My time as CFO has been exciting, as well as personally and professionally fulfilling. On leaving the company in good hands with Garth as the new CFO throughout his 18 years at Constellation Garth has been a significant contributor to our premiumization and growth efforts while developing an in-depth understanding of the company's business operations and finance activities/. Going forward, we will continue to collaborate on key initiatives as they relate to Constellation's investment in Canopy Growth. I'll certainly miss my interactions with our investors and the sales side analysts who cover Constellation. Over the years I've valued your ideas suggestions and feedback and I thank you for your ongoing support. I look forward to continuing to interact with many of you in my new role at Canopy growth. Now moving to the financials in Q3, we continued to produce strong beer operating performance and cash flow results, our wine and spirits Power Brand strategy is gaining momentum as marketplace performance for these brands continues to outpace the overall category. We also recently closed the Black Velvet transaction revised the original Wine and Spirits deal with Gallo, including a separate but related agreement to divest the Nobilo Wine brand and signed an agreement with Brewing to divest Ballast Point. Before we jump into the financial results, I'd like to provide an update on guidance, we've increased and narrowed our full year comparable basis, diluted EPS range to $9.45 to $9.55. Our increased guidance range primarily reflects the updated Gallo transactions and related timing as well as strong beer operating performance. This range excludes Canopy equity earnings which better reflects the Underlying performance of our core business. We strongly urge investors to focus on this metric as the Canopy equity earnings impact is non-cash. Our increased FY20 guidance now assumes the Revised Wine and Spirits transactions and the Ballast Point transaction closed by the end of the fiscal 20. We expect the Nobilo transactions to close in the first half of fiscal 21. As Bill mentioned, we believe efforts to divest remaining brands from the original transaction along with incremental cash flow generated from the delay in timing of the transaction relatively close to the value outlined in our original divestiture agreement with Gallo. This assumes we realized the full value of the earn-out. After completing these transformation activities we believe the wine and spirits business will be positioned to produce mid single-digit topline growth while migrating to an operating margin of 30% over time. Now let's review Q3 performance and our full year outlook in more detail where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer, net sales increased 8% on shipment volume growth of nearly 7%. The reversal of the year end fiscal 2019 over shipment was minimal in Q3 and came in lower than previously anticipated. We expect the remainder of the shipment timing benefit from fiscal 19 to reverse in Q4. The increase in volume growth for our import portfolio showed continued strength growing nearly 8%. As Bill mentioned, this was mostly driven by continued strong performance of Modelo Especial when including an unfavorable impact from Ballast Point total beer depletions were up 7.3%. In Q4, we pick up the additional selling day that we lost in Q2, which will help us achieve high single-digit depletion growth in Q4. Beer operating margins increased 200 basis points to 39.3%, benefits from pricing and COGS were partially offset by higher marketing and SG&A. COGS benefits were largely driven by FX a one-time contract contractor cost reimbursement and an inventory build ahead of our SAP S/4HANA implementation. The contractor cost recovery and the inventory build helped us outperform our margin expectations for the quarter. I am pleased to report that the first phase of our SAP S/4HANA implementation for our beer operations in Mexico was completed ahead of schedule and with excellent execution by This is an important milestone after more than a year of planning, designing and training for this important initiative. We'll continue to update you on upcoming milestones of our SAP S/4HANA implementation. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 30 basis points to 11%. Marketing spend for the quarter was slightly below expectations. We expect fiscal 20 marketing as a percent of net sales to be in the 9.5% to 10% range. For fiscal 20, we now expect net sales growth of 7% to 8%. This includes 1% to 2% of pricing within our Mexican portfolio. As a result of the plan reversal of fiscal '19 shipment timing benefit. We expect full-year fiscal 20 depletion volume growth to land about one percentage point ahead of shipment volume growth. We also expect fiscal 20 operating income growth of 8% to 9% and our full year operating margin to be in the range of 39.5% to 40% which is an improvement compared to the previous year and prior FY20 guidance of 39.3%/. As we move toward next year we're excited about our plans to launch Corona hard seltzer at the beginning of fiscal 21. There will be some investment in production costs, as we ramp up production for this major innovation in addition to the significant marketing investment Bill mentioned earlier. Moving to wine and spirits, net sales declined 10% on shipments that were down 14%. Depletions declined 6%, Q3 results outperformed our previously communicated expectations primarily due to a shipment timing benefit. Our third quarter wine and spirits results were somewhat impacted by a shift in Thanksgiving holiday timing with retailer and distributor replenishment shifting to the fourth quarter. Last year there was one full week post-Thanksgiving to fully replenish. In addition to the shift of the Thanksgiving holiday, we continue to be impacted by transition activities with distributors and will some lower quality sales incentives and pricing activities that we've decided not to repeat in order to better align with our strategy for the business going forward. Wine and spirits operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 26.2% as mix benefits were more than offset by higher COGS and higher SG&A as a percent of net sales, Higher COGS mostly reflect freight cost headwinds. The higher SG&A as a percent of net sales included marketing investments driven by the continued support of the power brands, including new Product development initiatives and may only advertising in the quarter. We now expect fiscal 20 wine and Spirits' net sales and operating income to decline 8% to 10%. Our updated guidance reflects the revised transaction close assumptions discussed earlier. As part of the Wine and Spirits Transactions, we remain committed to our $130 million stranded cost reduction plan, which we now expect to be realized over -- over the fiscal 21 to fiscal 22 timeframe. I remain confident that the wine and spirits transformation strategy is working. Power brand performance continues to benefit from our increased focus and marketing investments. In fiscal '20 we're running a bit short of our mid-single digit Power Brand depletion growth target, largely due to the activity as I mentioned earlier. However, power brands are driving mix benefits in gaining share in IRI channels and you should expect to see a sequential improvement in depletion trends in Q4. When you include this mix benefits we believe our portfolio of post divestitures is on track to achieve our longer-term targets, including mid-single digit net sales growth while migrating to an operating margin of 30%. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in at 149 million, up slightly versus Q3 year-to-date last year. We now expect full year corporate expenses to approximate $230 million reflecting an increase for insurance related costs, higher incentive compensation and the ramp in IT spend, which includes our S/4HANA implementation in other digital enablement activities. We expect our SG&A look to decrease by the end of fiscal '22 once our digital enablement activities are fully implemented. When we can eliminate redundant IT costs and realize the benefits of the new platform. In Q3 comparable basis interest expense increased 11%. This primarily reflects additional interest expense related to the funding of our incremental Canopy Growth investment in fiscal -- in November of 2018. Fiscal 20 interest expense is now expected to approximate $430 million. Our Q3 comparable basis. Effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings came in at 17.5% versus 14.1% last year. This increase primarily reflects lower stock-based compensation benefits. We now expect our full year fiscal 20 comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings to approximately 18% the one percentage point rate increase versus our guidance is primarily due to the impact of lower stock-based benefits and higher expense for miscellaneous tax items than we previously forecasted. I'd like to note that we expect our full year cash tax rate to be in the mid to high single-digit range. Let's move to free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activity towards CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.5 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 20. This represents an impressive 14% increase. Free cash flow improvement primarily reflects strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. We now expect full year CapEx spend of $700 million to $800 million versus our original guidance of 800 million to 900 million. This includes approximately $560 million of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion, including investments in the Obregon and Mexicali breweries as well as the fifth glass furnace at the Nava glass plant. We expect fiscal 20 operating cash flow to be in the range of 2.2 billion to 2.4 billion and free cash flow to be in the range of 1.5 to 1.6 billion. Now let's discuss several impacts that were excluded from Q3 comparable basis results. Last quarter, we noted that we expected to recognize a loss in Q3 on the write-down of assets held for sale related to our transaction with Gallo. The actual write-downs of $340 million was largely driven by the $250 million of contingent consideration associated with the revised transaction price. Accounting rules govern our election to record the contingent consideration when it's determined to be realizable. We also recognized $547 million of net income tax benefit resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets in connection with tax reform in Switzerland. Moving to Canopy the total pre-tax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November 2017 is $223 million. In Q3, we recognized $534 million decrease in the fair value of the Canopy investment. As a reminder Constellation's original warrants with Canopy have an exercise price of $12.98 Canadian per share and will expire on May 1 2020 and represent less than $200 million in consideration. In addition, the tranche A warrants expire on November, 1 of 2023, the company will evaluate exercise of each of these warrants immediately prior to expiration and does not plan to make additional cash contributions to Canopy beyond the potential exercise of these warrants. I would Close with some comments on capital allocation. First and foremost, as Bill mentioned constellation remains committed to its goal of returning $4.5 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases over the fiscal 20 to fiscal 2 timeframe. I am pleased to report that in Q3 we returned to our targeted leverage ratio range this was at the early end of the 12 to 18-month timeframe. We committed to when we closed on the Canopy investments, excludes non-cash Canopy related equity earnings. Continued deleveraging, driven by the company's strong cash flow generation capabilities should provide the flexibility to be opportunistic and increased share repurchases as we move into fiscal 21 and 22. As I reflect on my time as CFO Constellation, I'm proud to have been in this role during a time of significant value creation. I remain bullish about Constellation's prospects and believe the company has the right strategy in place to produce top tier performance for many years to come. I look forward to creating value for Canopy shareholders including Constellation in my new role in Canopy growth. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hey, good afternoon everybody. David Congratulations question on seltzer it's obviously going to be an incredibly competitive category for calendar 2020. What's going to make your your proposition different and how are you thinking about of our marketing spend and investment given that it seems like it's really building up to be a pretty significantly competitive category this summer? And then second separately, on your deleverage comments are you happy to keep the levels that where they are now and everything incremental from here is a buyback to manage to those levels or should we be thinking about it differently? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure, I'll take the first half of that, we're very excited about Corona hard seltzer in part, just because of the refreshment DNA that's attached to the Corona brand. We obviously have done a lot of product testing a lot of product research to make sure that we have a product that meets or exceeds the other key players in the marketplace. So we are quite comfortable with the sheer quality of the product that we're going to bring to the table. And as usual
Kaumil Gajrawala: Marketing department will bring outstanding consumer communications as I always do around our critical brands. The last thing I would say is, we still believe that there is a lot of upside in the total size of the Seltzer business. It was roughly 60 million cases in 2019. And we believe there could be a 2 to 3 times -- two to three opportunity going forward and we expect to take a significant share of that opportunity.
Bill Newlands: Yeah comment on the buybacks, our targeted range is three to four times. Our preference would be at the midpoint of the range but now that we're now that we're back in the range we will definitely look to be opportunistic as we move forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Nik Modi: Yeah, thanks, good morning everyone. David, let me -- secondly , congratulations on your new opportunity. So the question is really around, if I can go back to capital allocation still, obviously a lot of investors for years have been concerned about constellation, capital allocation decision and the last few months have been tough right with Ballast Point with Canopy value declines. So maybe just kind of give us a state of the union, from your perspective, kind of what you've learned as an organization from Ballast point in particular and how you think about just capital deployment outside of obviously the buyback stuff that you guys have already committed to you can get people a sense of kind of how you're thinking about it Philosophically as you kind of go into year two of being CEO of this company?
Bill Newlands: Sure. I think I think one of the things and David just pointed out, we remain as committed as we always have to getting ourselves into the range and as he said, we're pleased that we have gotten into the top end of our range, earlier than we had anticipated. We have a tremendous amount of opportunity with our core existing franchisees you have seen and you will continue to see a relentless focus on the critical categories and brands that we see as high margin, high-growth opportunities and we will invest to take significant share within those where we see issues and problems, much like you point out the Ballast Point or the low end of our wine business, we are prepared to take action to make sure we are focused on where the consumer is going rather than where they have been. And those are two examples of that. I think what that will do -- that will allow us to continue to focus all of our attention on the premiumization play both in the beer business and the Wine and spirits business so that we continue to be the leader and when someone sits in this chair 10 years from now, they'll be able to tell the same story that I just told, which is a great decade of tremendous growth for our company and for our shareholders.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivian -- with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Corporate Participant: Hi, good morning. My congrats to you, David I really look forward to working with you. It's part of my coverage of Canopy. So, Bill I just wanted to follow up on your commentary around the dislocation that you think hard seltzer is driving based on the consumer insights you offered. You think it's kind of broad-based and it's under indexing to imported beer. How are you think not asking for guidance for fiscal '21, but are you expecting that dynamic to shift given the introduction of Corona hard seltzer and perhaps put it more specifically how much cannibalization might you guys be expecting in terms of interaction between your core Corona offerings and that hard seltzer proposition, thank you.
Bill Newlands: Well, I think that excites us about the Corona seltzer introduction is that first of all, the category appears to continue to have real strength. And this is a lot of growth potential in it. As I said a moment ago I think there's probably 2x to 3x where it sits today, which creates tremendous opportunity for those of us, we're going to play in the category. I think on our expectation would be that we would have a similar type of cannibalization profile that we saw around Premier, which is as you might recall, was in the 70% to 75% range Incremental so this, we think this is a great opportunity for us. But, I would also encourage all of you on the call to keep in mind as they -- exciting is this launch will be Modelo Especial is likely to be our single biggest grower next year. This continues to be a brand that is absolutely on fire. It grew 15% and the most recent period and it had 30 plus consecutive years of double-digit growth. This is a brand that's going to be and remain a significant foundational play for this company for many, many years to come.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Kevin Grundy: Hey, good morning everyone. And David, I want to extend my congratulations as well. I wanted to pick up on the beer guidance so Bill, you sounded pretty positive. Despite some of the slowing that we saw on the Nielsen data . I think you attributed to pricing, but as I look at the midpoint, if my math is right, it implies about 7.5% organic sales growth. The year-over-year comp is easier if you do get an additional selling day. Can you talk about maybe what you're seeing in the business -- Corona looks a little bit light, Premier looks like it's decelerated a bit, is there anything that gives you cause a bit of pause here with the base portfolio in terms of some deceleration. And then given that as we look at the 7% to 9% longer-term growth that you've expressed confidence in over the intermediate term the fact that we had to tweak it modestly lower this year should that be at all concerning for investors looking out to next year. Thank you?
Bill Newlands: Sure. No, I think you should be very positive about our expectations around our core business. We were particularly excited that the Corona Extra business returned and renewed in growth in the third quarter. As I stated, certainly the price increases that we talk, particularly in the State of California gave us a very brief factor that you saw in the most recent IRI data, but we do not expect that to have any impact on our longer-term trends in the back as I alluded to earlier, our December depletion growth profile overall was in the high single-digit range, which is ahead of our year-to-date trends. So we remain very very bullish. And when you think about things like Modelo and Pacifico and the addition of our seltzer business. I think you're going to see a continued strong delivery against our business in the range that we had said we would do. And with that we will deliver for this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning guys. Also want to extend my congrats to David. Just two quick clarifications on the beer business. Bill, you mentioned that the high single-digit depletion growth in December. I think that included an extra day though, so ex the extra day what type of rate are you trying to get and then David, you mentioned the contractor and inventory timing benefit of margins in the quarter, can you give us a sense of how much that was. And those are more clarifications, if you give me the benefit of additional question. You guys did comment on the fabulous track record of beer volume growth over the last decade and kudos for that obviously an amazing track record, but if you do look at the year-to-date depletion growth of 7%. It's below that 9% to 10% pace from the prior few years. I know it's close to what you guys originally expected. But just at a high level, taking a step back, just curious for your perspective on if the slowdown this fiscal year, that's just more of a natural maturation as you move the larger case volumes if we should expect sort of a gradual slowdown in depletion over time on larger numbers or if there were more discrete issues driving the sequential slowdown this year and this is not sort of the start of a moderation trend as you look out longer term. Thanks.
Bill Newlands: So relative to the our depletion trends for the fourth quarter we expect fully expect that our depletion trends for the fourth quarter are going to be in the high single-digit range much like December presented itself. Look we remain extremely bullish about the long-range prospects for our beer business
Dara Mohsenian: We are significantly, significantly outperforming the overall category as well as the high end of the category as well and that's before we introduced hard seltzer product, which will compete [indiscernible] admittedly has gotten very big, very fast. So this will provide us with I think renewed opportunity for growth and we are very excited about the cost base for that going into the new fiscal year, obviously as a reminder, we will give fiscal guidance during our next call. So we will refrain from doing that at this point in time but certainly, we're very excited not only about the fourth quarter and finishing our year very strongly but for next year as well.
Bill Newlands: Yeah there on the contractor settlement even in the year S/4HANA kind of production build that we did in Q3 that gave us a benefit you know these are all a few to several million dollars each. And if you think about last year -- rewind to last year I think in Q3, we had an issue with glass production in the quarter. So we get these impacts every single quarter that are -- call it $3 million to $7 million each and sometimes they kind of aggregate in our favor, sometimes they go against us. But if you look at our total operating margins in say FY '18 we're at 39.5% FY19 we're at 39.3% and this year we're saying we're going to be between 39.5 million to 40 million. I think by the time you get to the end of the year all these little timing let's go away and we end up in a pretty consistent margin range in this business, which I'll point out maybe for the last time is by far our best-in-class in North American.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Sharma: Hi, good morning everyone.
Bill Newlands: Hi good morning.
Amit Sharma: Just a couple of questions, one on beer. Bill talked about the long-term outlook and it looks like you're still confident on high-single digit. Can you talk about Modelo in particular -- still growing double-digit but some people are little bit concerned about the detail that we saw recently. Can you talk about what is in the pipeline from a Modelo perspective. As you look to continue this momentum and then wine David good to hear 30% operating margin outlook still intact with that business. Can you talk about the timeline of the stranded cost as they come out post the divestiture of the lower price brands. Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure, I'd say, and I've said this many times I think Modelo remains the single largest opportunity for this company.
David Klein: It is just beginning to craft into the general market if this had a very, very strong run with its core Hispanic base and continues to grow with that audience and as many of you know, we do have a great tailwind with the growth of the Hispanic consumer. In the United States, which will continue to give us a tailwind for a fair amount of time, but as you know our advertising in our marketing activities around the Gallo have been expanded to a broader audience and the growth profile within the non-Hispanic consumer is tremendous. So we see our remaining tremendous upside in Modelo going to your question that about what else we will be introducing the more products, so in different size we have size opportunities. And as you all know we have done nothing truly to innovate around Modelo outside of the business which has done extremely well for us. So we think Modelo is going to continue to be a not well into the next decade, and we will likely be the single largest growth product and brand for us going forward.
Amit Sharma: Yeah, on the topic of stranded costs, it's a bit of the story we told at the beginning of this year, almost on a one-year delay. We, we're saying it's a $130 million stranded costs without getting into specifics, that will be included, when we provide guidance next quarter. You can assume that a quarter to a third of those costs come out in FY '21 the rest in FY '22, because we have the flow through COGS to hit before it hits our P&L, so like FY '23 will be the first real clean year where we can take a look at that, seeing a lot of stranded costs coming up or being [indiscernible].
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Lauren Lieberman: Great, thanks, good morning. So I was hoping you can talk a little bit about the increased marketing spend on Corona because last quarter. Right you took the opportunity to say look beer profitability is coming in a bit of had a plan, we'll put some extra money behind Corona clearly, there's been some reaction at the same time, the marketing spend on beer came in a little bit light of plan. So if you can just give us some color on why the spend was a little bit lighter kind of plans looking forward, and what in that marketing mix is particularly had a particularly attractive return would be interesting. Thanks.
David Klein: Sure, and I'll comment on, on the kind of timing of spend and it really is, it's a timing issue. We expect that we will finish the year that said, in the 9.5% to 10% range of net sales. At the same time, we expect
Lauren Lieberman: That we will see an uptick in our marketing spend in Q4 this year versus Q4 last year. Some of that having to do with incremental investment behind our core brands, but also some of it having to do with basically production costs around the seltzer marketing campaign that Bill outlined earlier. So I think for marketing for us, it really is just a function of timing as we still are focused on a 9.5% to 10% range.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Robert Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. A couple of just kind of follow up clarifications. First, it looks to us that the price mix was about 1.6%. Can you give us a sense of what that would have been without Ballast Point and then second, following up on some of the comments on Corona seltzer you made some comments that it's being well received by retailers, can you give us a sense of how you see the shelf sets coming out next year where Corona seltzer is going to be positioned on the shelf versus beer versus other white claw. And then if you look at the White claw trends they've been unbelievable. Right. I mean, they've been they're actually increasing share. I think the latest share is something like 67% up from 60. What gives you the confidence that this is actually a hard seltzer segment as opposed to a white claw segment and that there is room for a lot of new competitors. Thank you.
David Klein: Sure. So let's talk about the sets and where we expect to see Seltzer. Seltzer is in all likelihood not going to take space from our core beer franchise the consumer views it is something different. The retailers viewing it as something different, whether it's on the shelf or in the cold box. So we think there will be a distinct differentiation of product location versus just cannibalizing existing shelf space. That's the way it's been so far, we believe that will continue. This -- the answer to your question regarding whether this is a category or a brand. I think we've solved that answer for ourselves with Research. Our consumer and the seltzer consumer is very interested in the idea of Corona hard seltzer. In part because of what I said earlier, which is a whole refreshment DNA around the core Corona brand. The strength of Corona in that whole refreshment
Bill Newlands: The Beach experience is perfect for this. As we said earlier, that the these seltzer consumer -- has generally been increasing their overall consumption of the total alcoholic beverage category, which I think speaks well for the overall category of seltzers going forward and the strength of the Corona brand name together with the investment that we're going to make against it, we're quite bullish on it.
Robert Ottenstein: And Robert on the price mix question, it might be, if we were just looking at imports, it might be 10 to 15 basis points, but not -- additional to that -- not much more .
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Steve Powers: Thanks and congratulations from me to David maybe coming at the beer outlook from another direction. Just coming back and coming into calendar '19 at the beer event in Chicago, you guys are pretty adamant the beer margins would trend flattish, more or less in line with where you finished last year, call it 39.5 as you said. But now we're three quarters into fiscal '20 beer margins have exceeded expectations three quarters in a row, raising the full-year outlook and arguably 4Q would seem to have potential upside embedded in that -- as well. Acknowledging some of the 3Q benefits that could reverse, I guess as you step back does any of that change your go-forward thinking as to where beer margins could ultimately aspire to especially without the recent drag from Ballast. I mean is there, I guess is there a structural upside to your prior outlook or do you attribute the recent strength. Just to some of those timing that's that you had mentioned earlier, David.
Bill Newlands: So I'll start with that, David, can add as we would like. During that discussion. One of the things we were quite clear about relative to our guidance is there will be some years where things go our way cost are better, FX is better certain things just simply are favorable to what we would view as sustainable long-term proposition around our margin structure, this year has been one of those and we're certainly happy to take it, but it's also realistic to recognize that those things can go either way. As I said, this year it has gone in our favor, and we continue to work. As you would expect on our, on our operational footprint to make sure we are extracting every ounce of opportunity as it relates to cost, but this year on our way and we're quite pleased that it has. David, you want to.
David Klein: Yeah, -- Steve, I would say that we are, please. I'm convinced we have some of the best operations people on the planet. In order to produce the results that we do on a consistent basis. A new -- caution
Steve Powers: Is that -- I think we've been clear about this is that when we are in the launch year from a seltzer standpoint. We know that we're going to be driving towards the high end of our marketing spend as a percent of SG&A range. We also know as I said in my script that there are going to be some drag on gross margins as we come out of the gate on Seltzers. However, we've also said that we believe over time Seltzers don't have to be a drag and we don't expect them to be a drag over time. Right, so I think you're going to see puts and takes in our business as Bill outlined, but I'm actually pretty pleased with the consistency of margins in, as I said 39.5% percent range for three years in a row.
Bill Newlands: I would just add to David's comments that much like our beer margin structure is best of class. I think you would expect that our seltzer margin structure as we get to critical mass, will also be best-in class versus the competition.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Andrea Teixeira: Hi, good morning, David. Congratulations also on your promotion and thank you for your work as a CFO on Constellation. So my question is a follow-up on the comment about increased investment on the Seltzer marketing should we budget part of it already in the fourth quarter and also increase in early first quarter in fiscal 2021 because I understand the launch is early -- fiscal year in March, -- early March. So relative to the typical launches or the typical innovation that happens around [indiscernible]. And a clarification, if I will in Shifting gears a little bit for wine and spirits. So the implied fourth quarter wine and spirits profit guidance it's down so far it's down 13% year to date. So the full year is down 8 to 10, which implies that you have an improved performance in the fourth quarter. So if you can elaborate on that as well? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Yes, so on marketing spend. Yeah. We expect that that our spend will be up on a year-over-year basis in Q4. And that's -- you can kind of calculate back to get into that 9.5% to 10% range. As I said, that's most likely to be seltzer production marketing production costs and then we think that this has been -- will be a little bit weighted to the first quarter and certainly the first half of the year. Well, we're just getting the product on the shelf. We'll want to make sure that we're driving a consumer activity at that point in time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk with MKM Partners. Your line is now open.
Bill Kirk: Thank you, so I have a quick question on cannabis obviously you've worked with Canopy on the beverage launch up in Canada, and as I understand it Acreage can bring Canopy IP technology including that beverage technology to the US. So I guess my question is, would you want acreage in the US to start making the products that you developed with Canopy.
Bill Newlands: Yeah, I think the best thing that, so it's not our decision. Let me just be clear about that is acreages decision, but to the extent that we develop outstanding products for use in the Canadian market if Acreage can bring those to the US and they’re comfortable to do so, we think that's a home run all around like throughout our cannabis ecosystem, if you will, that's a benefit to Canopy that's a benefit to acreage in some of our Constellation team has been helpful in making sure that the products are meeting the expectations of the consumer in the marketplace.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sean King with UBS. Your line is now open.
Sean King: Hi, thanks, you called out Refresca as the growth driver, but it's still, it's pretty small in the track channels. Where do you stand in terms of I guess the national rollout strategy and how do you expect Seltzer to interact with Refresca I guess on the shelf.
Bill Newlands: Yes, we're very pleased with the Refresca, it has outperformed what our expectations were. And we're going to continue to invest behind it to make sure it continues to grow, as I said a little earlier, we don't expect the shelf interaction to get in the way between our Seltzer and our and our Refresca businesses. We think they serve different needs although admittedly, there is some interaction between in FMB consumer and Seltzer consumer. But we think there is room for both of those products in the market and we're looking forward to seeing continued acceleration of both the Refresca franchise as well as the, as well as -- Hard Seltzer when it comes out.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Bill Chappell: Thank you so much. And David, congratulations -- two quick ones. Any kind of guidance on what the peso versus the dollar impacted a beer margins this quarter or is that more to come. In future quarters and then also in terms of kind of what you talked about marketing spend in following Andreas question
Bill Newlands: Is this, similar, when we look at the first quarter of 2021 to what we saw 18 months ago with the rollout of Premier in terms of kind of pulling forward marketing more spending very front-end loaded or is it more balanced throughout the year?
David Klein: Yes, so on FX and again, we get some volatility in FX in the IR team. I think that’s a nice job of trying to lock in bumps in the peso which gives us a little tailwind -- especially given the volatility between the USD and the peso over the last couple of years. Right, so we think that in the quarter that was about 60 basis points of impact on margins. And then -- yeah, I think you can think about it a lot like Premier. So kind of the spread throughout the quarters of the year should look just like the Premier launch.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
Laurent Grandet: Yes, good morning, Bill. And David, I'd like to have a question on Corona Premier and Familiar, specifically regarding Familiar when looking at the Nielsen data over the last few payouts. We are seeing an accelerated decline, so is it deliberate choice as it seems, and you keep mentioning it -- you are incurring Corona in the refreshment space that Familiar may not fit and to provide pretty more space for Modelo to grow. And then on Corona Premier growth is plateauing. It seems like it's getting to the size of Corona. So is there any sense you can revamp that brand and reaccelerate the growth or are you satisfied with the current performance of Corona Premier so just one. Thank you.
Bill Newlands: So relative to Familiar. Familiar continues to do very well, particularly in the core Hispanic community, which is where it was originally targeted. So we continue to think that Familiar is going to be an important part, particularly with the Hispanic consumer in very specific demographics and very specific geographic regional opportunities. Relative to Premier, Premier continues to do very nicely and we're excited about it, obviously there has been some impact. The cannibalization that has occurred has been impacting Light as you would expect to some degree. But Premier also opens up a bunch of new consumers to our franchise as well who are looking more for that low-carb positioning that Premier presents. So we remain very bullish on the future for Premier, and we're going to continue to invest against that franchise going forward. And again, it goes right back to -- we are always pleased when more and more consumers spend more and more dollars against the overall Corona franchise. People believe in this franchise. It is the number one, as I said before, number one most trusted brand with both Hispanic and non-Hispanic consumers 21 to 54 and that gives us the chance to continue to leverage -- new introductions like Refresca, Premier, and Hard Seltzer which is obviously coming in this coming fiscal year. So we remain very bullish on the overall Corona franchise and I think the fact that franchise was one of the few growth brand franchises over the course of the last decade, shows the real longevity for that brand.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Bill Newlands for closing remarks.
Bill Newlands: Well, thanks very much. And I guess I'd be remiss David if I didn't say that all the congratulations you just received are well deserved. We're certainly going to miss you on this side, but we'll be happy to get our 37%. Thank you everyone for joining our call today. Before our closing, I'd like to reiterate what a powerful decade this year been for Constellation our results over the past 10 years are a testament to the dynamic strategic efforts made by our strong management team, through our current initiatives and priorities. We are positioning this company for a sustained long-term success and therefore we are just as excited and optimistic that the next 10 years will continue the momentum into the fourth quarter as well as a strong finish to this fiscal year. As a reminder, during our next quarterly call. As I said earlier, we will be providing guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. So thanks again everyone for joining the call. I wish you all a safe happy and prosperous New Year and new decade thanks everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2019-10-03 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands Q2 Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be open for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Joelle. Good morning and welcome to Constellation’s second quarter 2020 conference call. I am here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and David Klein, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any other non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now here is Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Patty and good morning everyone. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation’s second quarter sales and earnings results. We delivered an excellent quarter driven by strong performance of our beer business. And while our wine and spirits portfolio continues to be impacted by transition activities related to the Gallo transaction, I am pleased with the pace of progress and the strategic transformation of this business. Now that we are at the halfway point in the year, I would like you to focus on two key points as the second half of the year unfolds. Number one, Constellation and Gallo are working in full cooperation with the FTC, while they continue to review our wine and spirits deal. We are confident in our ability to close the transaction, which we now expect will occur by fiscal year-end 2020. For now, we have updated our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance to assume that we close at the end of the third quarter, but we will adjust accordingly as we get more clarity on exact timing. Meanwhile, we are fully committed to supporting our entire portfolio throughout the transition. Number two, during the second quarter, Constellation’s beer business remained the number one market share leader in the high-end of the U.S. beer market, representing 25% of high-end growth with Constellation growing share in every summer holiday. This is the 38th consecutive quarter of growth for our beer business and I remain confident in the prospects for this collection of iconic consumer-loved brands well into the future. Why are David and I so confident? Several reasons, high-end trade-up is a continuing trend for the entire U.S. total beverage alcohol market. Premiumization is becoming more prevalent in U.S. middle market states like Ohio and Michigan, where a significant amount of beer consumption occurs. Legal drinking age Hispanic population growth is expected to continue at a CAGR of roughly 3%. We have ample distribution runway with traction from key initiatives like shopper first shelf, which is a compelling opportunity for our retail partners. We have significant opportunities to increase household penetration with key brands and our beer innovation pipeline is strong and will continue to complement the other growth opportunities we have for the portfolio. As most of you know, the Modelo and Corona brand families are the powerhouse brands that represent the foundation of our business. So, let’s drill down and discuss some details of the opportunities we have for specific brands within these brand families. Let’s start with Modelo Especial, which generated the most dollar sales growth in the entire U.S. beer category during the quarter. Modelo Especial continues to [indiscernible] and recently achieved a significant new milestone becoming the number one import beer and the number five overall beer in the U.S. beer market. Modelo Especial alone contributed almost 30% of the total category growth during the second quarter with double-digit depletion growth in 44 out of 50 states. Modelo is growing with non-Hispanic acculturated Hispanic and multicultural consumers, and there remains significant upside to grow both penetration and by rate with these consumers. As a matter of fact, in calendar 2018, we estimate that only 5% to 6% of non-Hispanic beer consuming households drank Modelo Especial. For reference, that’s roughly half the penetration that Corona Extra has in non-Hispanic beer households. Because Modelo has great growth momentum and excellent velocity, it should command more shelf space at retail compared to other top beer brands. And then the on-premise, Modelo Especial currently has distribution in just over 50% of the accounts that carry Corona Extra. We have already had excellent success this year with the launches of Modelo Especial 32-ounce bottles, Modelo Chelada Limon y Sal, and Modelo Negra 24-ounce cans. Bottom line, we have significant runway for growth with this brand well into the future. Now moving on to Corona, which is the number one high-end brand family in the U.S. beer market. This spring, the Corona brand family grew shelf space at retail almost 15%. One of the key drivers of this trend was Corona Premier, which experienced accelerating depletion growth throughout the summer months, while posting double-digit sales and distribution trends in IRI channels during the quarter. With our increased focus on Corona Premier in the on-premise this summer, it has become the fastest growing beer in this channel, a key channel to drive consumer trial. Corona Refresca has quickly become a top five share gainer in the high end of the U.S. beer category with the Refresca variety pack becoming the number three new item in IRI channels during the second quarter based on dollar sales. Interestingly, Corona Refresca has higher velocity trends that one of its key competitors in this space, the Mike’s brand family. We are very excited to announce that our new seltzer launch planned for next spring will be the next big innovation for the Corona brand family. Now, admittedly, this has been one of the worst kept secrets. But as you all know, Corona carries unbelievably strong brand equity as the number one most loved brand among both Hispanic and total population drinkers age 21 to 54, and that’s why we have decided to put the Corona brand name on our new seltzer. And of course, the refreshment characteristics of seltzers perfectly match Corona refreshment DNA. We believe that seltzers are here to stay and will therefore accelerate the volume shift into category from the low-end to the high-end, where we are the market share leader. Corona hard seltzer will be introduced in four flavors, including tropical lime, mango, cherry, and blackberry lime. The brand will weigh in at 90 calories with the 4.5 ABV with zero carbs and zero sugars. So, let’s now move on to Corona Extra, which is the number six beer brand in the U.S. market and boast velocity trends that are 2x the entire category. There continues to be runway for future Corona Extra growth with the incremental contributions coming from draft and can formats as well as the Coronita product, and we plan to increase our marketing investments throughout the remainder of our fiscal year for this brand. Last, but certainly not least, Pacifico produced double-digit depletion growth this past quarter driven by the national advertising campaign and retail promotions as we will continue to support the independent spirit of this brand with the Live Life Anchors Up marketing campaign. As you can see, we have tremendous opportunities to grow the beer business through a combination of enhanced distribution, innovation, and executional opportunities across the portfolio for years to come. Considering these factors, we remain confident in our ability to achieve 7% to 9% net sales and EBIT growth for our beer business in fiscal ‘20 and beyond. Moving now to wine and spirits, as I mentioned, we continue to work with the FTC to finalize our wine and spirits transaction with Gallo. Meanwhile, business performance continues to be impacted by transition activities with distributors who have begun to reposition their portfolios for the change in ownership of brands upon the close of the pending transaction. In addition, we are overlapping a very strong second quarter last year. At that time, we executed select promotional activities for key power brands that we didn’t repeat this year as they did not meet the returns and the target returns for the business. Why you might ask? The wine and spirits business transformation strategy is evolving under a new set of strategic imperatives that have a higher return target for these types of promotional activities based on a more disciplined revenue modeling tools that we have implemented similar to what we do in beer. While our year-to-date depletion trends for our power brands are flat, we are confident in our ability to deliver depletion growth for this portfolio of brands in the mid single-digit range for fiscal ‘20 and September has reflected that expectation. We are also pleased with the consumer takeaway trends for the power brands, which grew dollar sales 6% in IRI channels during the quarter, outperforming total U.S. wine growth of 3%. This demonstrates that the brands that will fuel our growth going forward have significant consumer-led momentum, which we believe will continue in the second half. What are the reasons to believe? As I mentioned, we are experiencing strong consumer takeaway trends for these power brands. In addition, we have an impactful innovation pipeline primed with new products launching for the key holiday selling season which begins this month. We are especially excited about our wine in a can launches, which we will capitalize on one of the fastest growing trends in the U.S. wine industry. We believe that our can format is the most attractive in this segment in terms of both taste and appearance and we have a successful proof point with Crafters Union, which was our inaugural launch of wine in a can earlier this year. It has since become the number one growth brand in canned wine and a top 5 share gainer in the super premium price segment. In addition to launching the number one Sauvignon Blanc in the U.S. that being Kim Crawford in a can format, we will also introduce Kim Crawford Rosé cans, that being the fastest growing SKU in this format. And we will not only plan to launch Woodbridge wine in a can, but in a tetra-pack format as well. In addition to our efforts in cans in tetra, the Robert Mondavi Private Selection Buttery Chardonnay is slotted for release this fall as well as the Rye Barrel Aged Red Blend, which was recently introduced into the market. As you would expect, we will continue to support our innovation and brand building efforts throughout the remainder of the year with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build the portfolio. On the spirits front, SVEDKA Vodka continue to post robust consumer takeaway sales growth trends of 6% in IRI channels during the quarter bolstered by our marketing campaign Bring Your Own Spirit. SVEDKA Rosé continues to outpace our expectations, while the core offerings in the portfolio remain extremely healthy as well. Our American whiskey High West has been growing double-digits in IRI for the 3 years that we have owned the brand. Driven by an award-winning taste, brand authenticity and strong distribution gains, we continue to expect High West to remain a solid growth contributor to our portfolio going forward. During the quarter, we signed an agreement to sell Black Velvet Canadian Whisky to Heaven Hill for $266 million. This action aligns with our consumer-led premiumization strategy to deliver accelerated growth as we continue to execute the transformation strategy for our business. Our ventures team was quite active during the quarter as we made two new minority investments. The first is Montanya Distillers, a Colorado-based award-winning American craft rum maker. Montanya’s rums are currently distributed in more than 40 states and 7 countries overseas and can be purchased online. The second is Durham Distillery, a craft gin, vodka, liqueur and ready-to-drink canned cocktail producer that was recently recognized as the number one craft gin distillery in the U.S. by USA Today. Additionally, Durham has earned more than 50 national and international awards. Both these investments are part of our Female Founders initiative which makes meaningful investments in female-led businesses doing disruptive and innovative work across beverage alcohol. Overall, we will continue to maintain our focus on premiumization, innovation and brand building as the transformation strategy evolves for our wine and spirit business. Now, a few comments about our investment in Canopy Growth, which continues to be the global leader in total cannabis sales. During the quarter, Canopy Growth and Acreage Holdings received overwhelming shareholder approval for the agreement that grants Canopy the right to acquire Acreage and enter the U.S. cannabis market once federally permissible. As you know, this opportunity provides the path for Canopy to have a leading position in the U.S. upon federal cannabis reform. And speaking of that reform, I was excited to see that the U.S. House of Representatives recently passed the SAFE Act by a wide majority. While this bill also need Senate approval, it would deliver access to traditional banking services for thousands of legal cannabis businesses in the U.S. and shows positive momentum in the legalization debate moving forward. We are also looking forward to the launch of Rec 2.0 in Canada when Canopy will unveil their portfolio of value-added higher margin products in various form factors, including drinks, edibles and bake. In the U.S., the Canopy team has been actively developing a range of high-quality CBD products and related marketing plans as well as securing the production resources necessary to bring these products to the U.S. market by the end of their fiscal year. New CBD product offerings include skincare and cosmetics, therapeutic creams, beverages, edibles, oils and softgels. Overall, we are pleased with the progress of the Canopy team and what they have done in the last few months. In closing, I am extremely pleased with the progress of our business at the halfway mark in the year. Our beer business continues to deliver industry leading results and our wine and spirits business is successfully executing their transformation strategy. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to returning cash to shareholders with the share repurchases we made during the second quarter and I am bullish about our prospects across the business for the remainder of this year. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David who will review our financial results for the second quarter.
David Klein: Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. In Q2, we continue to produce strong beer operating performance and we delivered superior cash flow results. Our wine business delivered results in line with our expectations as we execute this transition year. Share repurchases during the quarter reflect confidence in our ability to produce top tier growth well into the future and our commitment to generate returns for shareholders. We have increased and narrowed our full year comparable basis diluted EPS range to $9 through $9.20. This range excludes Canopy equity earnings impact. Our increased guidance now assumes the transaction with Gallo closes at the end of Q3 and the divestiture of Black Velvet Canadian Whisky closes on November 1. Now, let’s review Q2 performance and our full year outlook in more detail, where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results starting with beer. Net sales increased 7% on volume growth of 5%. The reversal of the shipment timing benefit in Q2 was less than expected. This helped Q2 net sales coming ahead of our mid single-digit growth guidance, which we provided last quarter. Depletion growth showed continued strength at more than 6%. When adjusted for 1 less selling day in the quarter, the business generated 7.5% depletion growth, reflecting accelerating trends for some of our key brands during the summer selling season. We expect this acceleration to continue into the second half of the year when we are no longer of lapping the Corona Premier and Familiar launches. As a note, in Q3, selling days are flat year-over-year. Beer operating margin increased 50 basis points to a record 41.8%. Benefits from pricing in foreign currency were partially offset by higher COGS. The higher COGS primarily reflect materials inflation mostly driven by contractual increases in glass and cartons. I am pleased with the success of our first half productivity initiatives. These productivity savings were achieved earlier in the year than originally anticipated and helped us offset other cost inflation headwinds in the business. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 20 basis points to 9.1%. Marketing spend came in lower than planned as we revised the cadence in magnitude of marketing spend for the year, which I will discuss in a minute. For fiscal ‘20, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth of 7% to 9%. This includes 1 to 2 percentage points of pricing within our Mexican portfolio. We now expect our full year operating margin to be flattish compared to the prior year result of 39.3%, which is an improvement compared to our original guidance of 39%. We continue to expect our gross margin to be flattish for the year as cost inflation headwinds and growth investments are expected to being mostly offset by product pricing and productivity initiatives. Some of the cost headwinds that we originally projected are not materializing to the levels we anticipated. However, operating margin will be impacted in the back half by the reversal of the remaining shipment timing benefit from fiscal ‘19 and our implementation of SAP S/4 HANA ERP system in Mexico. In addition, we now expect fiscal ‘20 marketing as a percent of net sales to be closer to the top of our 9.5% to 10% range. We believe it’s prudent to reinvest some of the margin upside from our first half success to support our brands in the second half. Our increased investment will mostly focus on the Corona brand family. As mentioned earlier, the shipment timing benefit at the end of fiscal ‘19 partially reversed in Q2. We expect the remaining shipment timing benefit to reverse in Q3. Over the last 2 years, Q3 has been our lowest margin quarter primarily driven by lower seasonal plant throughput and marketing investments. We expect Q3 marketing as a percent of net sales to be greater than 11%. As a result of these factors, we expect Q3 operating margin to be just over 36%. Moving to wine and spirits, net sales declined 9% and shipments down 10%, depletions declined 13%. These trends were largely driven by our lower end brands and transition activities associated with the transaction. Wine and spirits operating margin decreased 330 basis points to 22.8%. This decline was primarily driven by higher COGS and marketing investment. Higher COGS primarily reflect freight cost headwinds, lower volume throughput and increased transportation costs. We now expect fiscal ‘20 wine and spirits net sales to decline 15% to 20% and operating income to decline approximately 25%. Our revised guidance reflects the transaction close assumptions discussed earlier. As a result of the Q3 close guidance assumption for the wine and spirits transaction, we now expect our fiscal ‘20 stranded cost removal to approximate $20 million compared to the $35 million to $55 million previously disclosed. However, we remain committed to the total stranded cost removal of approximately $130 million by the end of fiscal ‘21. I remain confident that the wine and spirits transformation strategy is working. Power brand performance continues to benefit from our increased focus in marketing investments, which is reflected in the solid consumer takeaway trends for these brands in IRI channels. In fiscal ‘20, we continue to target mid single-digit power brand depletion growth. Longer term, we expect the business to produce mid single-digit net sales growth while migrating to an operating margin of 30%. As we work through the process to close the transaction with Gallo, the business continues to be impacted by transition activities. Therefore, we expect Q3 wine and spirits net sales and EBIT to decline 15% to 20%. To finalize this discussion, I have one other point to note. We now believe it’s likely that a portion of the wine and spirits transaction purchase price will be in the form of contingent consideration based on future performance of the brands targeted for sale. Accounting rules govern our election to record the contingent consideration when it’s determined to be realizable. Therefore, in the third quarter, we expect to recognize the loss of up to $300 million on the write-down of the assets held-for-sale. Now, let’s proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expense came in at $97 million. We expect full year corporate expense to approximate $215 million reflecting a second half ramp in IT spend, which includes our SAP S/4 HANA implementation. In Q2, interest expense increased 27%. This reflects interest expense of approximately $39 million related to the funding for our incremental Canopy Growth investment in November of 2018. Fiscal ‘20 interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $430 million to $440 million. This reflects incremental interest due to the wine and spirits transaction timing. Our Q2 comparable basis effective tax rate, including Canopy equity earnings, came in at 13.9% versus 18.4% last year. The decrease reflects a lower rate on foreign earnings and higher stock-based compensation benefits. Our fiscal year-to-date comparable basis tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings is 16.8%. We continue to forecast our full year fiscal ‘20 comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact, to approximate 17%. Moving to free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.1 billion for the first half of fiscal ‘20. This represents an impressive 10% increase. Free cash flow improvement primarily reflects strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. The lower CapEx is primarily due to timing. We continue to expect full year CapEx spend of $800 million to $900 million. This includes approximately $600 million of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion, including investments in the Obregon and Mexicali breweries as well as the fifth glass furnace at the Nava glass plant. We now expect fiscal ‘20 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and operating cash flow to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. This increase reflects an additional quarter of EBIT from the wine and spirits brands targeted for sale as well as cash tax benefits. Shifting to our investment in Canopy Growth, the total pre-tax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $757 million. In Q2, we recognized a $1.2 billion gain on our modified Canopy warrants partially offset by approximately $400 million of loss in equity and earnings, which reflects CBI share of additional loss on the modification. This net gain resulted from shareholder approval of Canopy Growth’s proposed acquisition of Acreage and was more than offset by the decrease in fair value of Canopy investments for the quarter. These impacts were excluded from comparable basis results. As summarized in the earnings release, second quarter fiscal ‘20 comparable basis diluted EPS, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact, totaled $2.91 per share. Canopy’s business is rapidly evolving and their financial results will likely be volatile as they continue to focus on their path to profitability. I would like to remind everyone, Canopy equity earnings recognized in our income statement are non-cash and we have not factored Canopy equity earnings into our fiscal ‘20 comparable basis EPS guidance range of $9 to $9.20. This allows us and our investors to focus on the performance of our core business. In July, we issued $800 million of senior notes at an attractive fixed rate and used the proceeds to redeem higher interest rate debt. We are pleased with the progress we’re making toward our de-leveraging goals, excluding Canopy equity earnings. In fact, we’ve reduced our net debt level by more than $650 million since the end of fiscal ‘19. This allowed us to opportunistically repurchase $50 million worth of stock during the quarter. In closing, I’d like to reiterate, we are committed to returning $4.5 billion to shareholders from fiscal ‘20 through fiscal ‘22. The share repurchases we’ve made during the quarter reflect the confidence we have in our long-term business model. We believe our combination of strong cash flow and future growth prospects creates a best-in-class opportunity within the CPG space. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Bryan Spillane: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Bill Newlands: Hi, Bryan.
Bryan Spillane: Hi. So I guess, my question is, given the pipeline of innovation that you will have going into next year and kind of the spending levels that you had this year behind the beer business, this is to support the innovation and initiatives yet this year, is that 10% or so of revenue still a good sort of basis baseline to use in terms of marketing investment to support the business going forward or if innovation is going to step up or will it potentially have to step up more?
David Klein: Bryan, we’re still in the process of finalizing our - all of our spend plans for next year, but we do expect it to be consistent with the range that we’ve done in this fiscal year, so somewhere in that 9% to 10% range.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Hey, how are you? Can you talk a little bit about the contribution from some of these innovations over the last couple of years to your depletions at the moment, and then maybe if you want to give some insight on how you expect it to contribute going forward?
Bill Newlands: Certainly, the Premier introduction has been everything we expected. It’s appeal to a new consumer sub-segment, which is those individuals who are looking for a low-carb offering. And as we noted, we continue to see acceleration, particularly in the on-premise during this quarter. So, we’re very pleased with that. We’ve seen the addition of the bottle format for Familiar, the smaller bottle format has been very good for us as well. As David noted, we overlapped all of those early introductions during this quarter, which I think shows the strength of our overall beer business with our depletion growth on a days adjusted basis of roughly 7.5%. It’s pretty powerful given the lapping that we had from last year of those two introductions. You then add Refresca, which has exceeded our expectations as well. As I noted in my script, the velocity of that is better than one of our key competitors in the FMB space, [indiscernible] and we expect strong things from that in the future as well. It shows that the strength of the Corona franchise and its refreshment DNA that we are able to extend that brand into other sub-categories.
David Klein: Yes. And I would add to that Kaumil that in our algorithm, we say that we’re going to grow net sales in our beer business high-single digits over the next few years, and 25% of that growth is really made up of innovation, and clearly that includes Premier and the new Corona seltzer that we’re talking about. The other thing I just want to point out to as it relates to our overall growth in the business, we called out the last sell day in Q2, which really drives our depletion growth to that 7.5% range. That has us continuing to grow significant share in the beer business, and a big driver of that is the innovation work within the beer business.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Kevin Grundy: Hey, good afternoon, guys.
Bill Newlands: Hello.
Kevin Grundy: Question, Bill, on the spiked seltzer rollout for next year, so a handful of questions all related to that, based on your internal models, how big do you think the category can become over, say the next 3 to 5 years? How are you defining success for the Corona spike seltzer rollout? And then, how do you think this product is differentiated in what is a fairly undifferentiated product category at this point. The ABV calories and sugar content all sounded pretty similar to the existing brands, of course pace will be paramount, but any comments you have there would be helpful? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure. I think that’s an evolving answer. I think, everyone has been somewhat surprised by the aggressive growth that we’ve seen in the seltzer business, particularly over the course of this selling season. What I would say is this. I think Corona brings a unique refreshment profile to this particular category. We would expect to gain a significant amount of share in the high-end as we have with anything else that we introduce amongst our franchises relative to the product. I would look very carefully at what we said. This is a zero carb, zero sugar product. I don’t think you will find that with any of the other products that have been introduced into the market. And I’d add one more point. We said on our prior quarter discussions that we would not be entering this category unless we felt we could do it with a superior product with superior margin and profitability structure. I can assure you that this will be a superior product with superior margin and profitability structure versus other competitors in the marketplace.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Kirk with MKM Partners. Your line is now open.
Bill Kirk: Hey, thank you for taking the question. So just one for me on the transition of the divested wine brands, it seems you are saying the loss cases have had negative growth is the result of distributors maybe not giving those brands as much attention since they may be leaving their houses. One, is that fair? And two, is there an additional aspect of maybe you are not putting as many trade dollars or putting as much spending into those brands since they are leaving your system?
David Klein: Yes. So Bill, look, we continue to support the brands, but when distributors understand that Brands won’t be in their house, as you said, it’s difficult to get them to continue to drive the brands the way we would like them to. In general, to switch back to our portfolio, we have called out full year depletions for our power brands of mid-single digits. Year-to-date, we’re below that, but we remain confident that we’ll get to that number over the course of the year as a result of the more disciplined execution strategy that Bill talked about in his comments.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. So, I was just hoping to be able to kind of reconcile. I know there is definitely a difference between the track channel and obviously what you deplete. But obviously when you when you still look at, so I was just hoping to see if you can reconcile some of the comments on the on-premise and off-premise and granted that you’ve been making a lot of inroads on the on-premise, on cans and also on draft. So I was hoping to see if you’re saying, obviously as the track channels skew more into California where you are, and then always going to trail your numbers, but if you can clarify, I think it would be helpful for investors. Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Yes. So, Andrea, thank you for that question, because we normally operate with a 200 to 300 basis point disconnect between depletions – our depletions and IRI. Meaning, our depletions run lower than IRI. When you adjust for the sell day and remember that the market data, the IRI data is just 12 rolling weeks. We are back within that 200 to 300 basis point delta, right. So there is not really a disconnect. It’s any more unusual than we normally experienced. So then when you look at individual channel, when we look at the on-premise in aggregate, we continue to grow share in the on-premise being up, we were up in the quarter low single-digits. I think the industry was down low-single digits or somewhere in that area. So, we continue to perform well across all channels for our beer business.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO. Your line is now open.
Amit Sharma: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Bill Newlands: Good morning.
Amit Sharma: Just two clarifications. One, Bill, you talked about South having a superior margin to competitors, is it also superior to your beer margins as you think about it? And then, the second – for David, so if there’s 200 to 300 basis point delta to IRI is the right metric I mean IRI trends show pretty meaningful acceleration in August and September. So what does it say about Q3 depletions certainly going to be at least looking back at the data, much stronger than what you did in Q2?
Bill Newlands: Yes. So, I think, to take the first question, we expect all up all into be over time when we’re fully yet scale production in seltzer that we will deliver kind of a similar margin case to the one that we have for the rest of our beer business. And we without really commenting on September depletions, we expect our depletions as I said in my comments to continue to accelerate as we go through the year and we’re past to the launch of last year of Corona Premier and Corona Familiar.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Your line is now open.
Nik Modi: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Bill Newlands: Good morning, Nik.
Nik Modi: I had two quick – good morning, two quick questions. Bill, have you guys tested the seltzer concept yet? I mean I know you’ve already go this pretty fast in terms of the turnaround here, but just curious if you have any things you can share with us on the test market. And then, the bigger picture question is, on the wine and spirits transaction with Gallo, I mean, is – can this deal be revised? Is there a potential to realize more value from some of the brand, but maybe the FTC is looking at with other buyers. I mean, any context around that would be helpful?
Bill Newlands: Sure. Relative to the question of testing, we obviously have not done a market test. But we, as we always do, when we introduce any new product, we do a battery of consumer testing around it to make sure that we both have the right look. And by that I mean packaging that we have the right flavor profiles that will perform at our better than the competition. As I said in my prepared remarks, we think this product is going to be a demonstrable winner in the category or we wouldn’t have launched it. David, do you want to answer the other?
David Klein: Yes. So, Nik, we remain confident that the Gallo transaction will get done. We need to work our way through the process to see kind of the final form that it takes. As I called out in my script, and you’ll see in the Q, we will recognize in the third quarter of $300 million loss on part of the dispositions that right and what I mean by that is we have a set of brands including the Gallo brands that we listed out and the Black Velvet brand that we’ve also talked about that. We’re disposing of as a result of the wine transformation that we’re going through, and we’re pretty confident that when we’re done with all of the work that’s required around that portfolio that we’re dealing with that, we’ll end up with neither a loss nor a gain will end up with about a push in that regard. And then, we’ll have our business really well positioned to focus on the high end of the industry and a portfolio that can grow mid-single digits and deliver 30% operating margins.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Your line is now open.
Rob Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much and my apologies. But, some – a few more questions on Corona seltzer, tried the product in Atlanta yesterday, it’s a great product, very exciting. What are your thoughts on cannibalization both in terms of your beers and then also in terms of the category how accretive is it’s in the beer category in your view as you kind of 50-50 cannibalizing beer 50 wine and spirits, are you thinking about it differently? And then finally, do you – are you set up for automated lines for the variety pack? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure. Well, I’m glad you liked it, will add you to our consumer panel next time, Robert. So, we like it as well. Here’s what I would say. We expect that this to be heavily accretive to our overall beer franchise. Obviously the growth that we’ve all seen in seltzers had some impact on our franchise and many other beer franchises during the summer months. But if – I will take you back to what we have done most recently, which is Premier and Familiar, both of which had more than 50% accretion to our overall brand portfolio, with Premier being closer to 75%. So, we would certainly expect that this is going to be very additive to our overall portfolio for the Corona brand franchise going forward, and a big factor is going to be just what you said. These are delicious tasting products.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning.
Bill Newlands: Good morning.
Lauren Lieberman: Bill, you went through like bunch of stuff in all of the major brand franchises and trends. So when I was thinking about the depletion number, in total with Modelo growing as strongly as it is, they feel like it medium size of rest of the portfolio. In aggregate, it’s sort of flattish. And I guess, is that reasonable and if so like what are the pieces we didn’t really talk about today? Is Corona Extra, Corona Light, we expect you to cannibalize by Premier, but what are you seeing from Corona Extra? And as you think about stepping up spending from here, outside of the seltzer launch, what are the areas in particular that you’re targeting on Corona to accelerate performance? What do you think you can do differently? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure. We obviously are increasing our support for Corona Extra for the remainder of this fiscal year. And you are correct. Year-to-date, Corona Extra itself is roughly flattish. And there are some obvious interaction between Modelo, which is, as I noted on fire, and Corona. So we would expect a little bit of that movement within our own franchise, but overall the Corona brand family continues to grow. And a lot of that growth remains in things like Premier Refresca with continued strong performance with Corona Extra, given there is a lot of other family members now than there was not so long ago. Pacifico as I noted on the call was up double-digits in depletions during the quarter and we continue to be happy with the acceleration in that area. I realize, Robert – going back to Robert for just a second, I apologize I did not answer your second question about automation. We have an approach that we think is ready to go to create efficiencies within how you pack for a variety pack, which is I am sure the real answer to your question – the real question that you have in your mind. So, we are set up to do that within our current operation structure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Gerald Pascarelli: Hi. This is Gerald Pascarelli on for Vivien. Thanks very much for taking the question.
Bill Newlands: Yes. You don’t sound like Vivien.
Gerald Pascarelli: So, Bill, mine is on Corona Refresca, just based on some of the share gain commentary that you offered, can you just provide us some color on where you believe you’re sourcing share? And then, maybe some color on specific consumer demographic trends around the brand. Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure. We are still developing some of those answers. As you can imagine, we’re still in the early stage. One of the things that we have noted is that the Hispanic demographic had been generally less aggressive in their adoption of FMBs, but because of their strong affiliation with the Corona franchise, we have noted a strong uptick with our strong demographic base the Hispanic community around Refresca. However, we are also seeing, as you can imagine, this product is largely shelved and largely placed in the cold box in a different place and competes much more with the FMB categories rather than competing with our core Corona offerings. So, we’re very pleased that we’re broadening our audience and broadening our appeal to new use occasions with Refresca and are very bullish on the future for that sub-brand as well.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Dara Mohsenian: Yes, hey, guys. So, a follow-up question on Corona seltzer. I guess, can you help us understand why an existing beer brand, albeit one with incredible equity, and Corona is the right choice for a brand in the seltzer category, given it looks like hard seltzer is more of a distinct segment versus traditional beer. And a lot of the companies that have launched brands there have used new brand names instead of the traditional beer brands. So, maybe are you seeking what others is adding but help me understand why that’s the right decision in your minds and what your consumer research is telling you. And then, the second, any concerns over a longer-term brand equity to the traditional Corona beer business from a hard seltzer launch and how do you guys think through that? Right?
Bill Newlands: You bet. As you can imagine, we tested that question very, very deeply. The whole essence in the whole DNA of Corona is all around refreshment. I mean, when you discuss that across any of the sub-brands, that’s the first thing that comes back in the consumers’ mind is, this is a refreshing beer. It’s a refreshing product no matter in which category falls – fall it fall similarly as a response to Refresca. One of the key elements that the consumer is looking for in seltzer is refreshment. Therefore, the match with that DNA is perfect, to go along with Corona’s core DNA and why we felt that if we were going to enter this category, we would do it with a brand that had deep trust with the consumer. As we noted earlier, it is the number one trusted brand with Hispanics and non-Hispanics 21 to 54. Therefore, we believe this will be a very strong entry in the seltzer space.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Bill Chappell: Thank you. Good morning.
Bill Newlands: Good morning, Bill.
David Klein: Good morning.
Bill Chappell: Follow-up on the wine business can you just give us a little more color on the distribution changes, and how that’s – it sounds like there are some collateral damage at least in the near term to your existing brands from the divestiture, and so trying to understand if more color on that and then how you then going forward reduce the dissynergies, it would seem like you would need to continue to have a fair amount of spending behind their – personnel behind there to kind of keep their presence the same?
Bill Newlands: We have focused our attention on continuing to deliver results against the entire business. There is no question that the transition that is occurring has been distracting to our distributors and to our internal population. With that said, we continue to remain excited by the power brand results of up 6% in IRI during the most recent quarter, and SVEDKA falls into the exact same number 6% growth during the most recent quarter as well. So, we remain very bullish that as we get this transaction completed that what will remain will be high-margin, high growth potential businesses and franchises and brands that are going to be a very strong consumer products play for a long time to come.
Operator: Thank you. I’m not showing any further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for any further remarks.
Bill Newlands: Well, thank you, everyone. I appreciate your joining the call. And let me say, as we close out the discussion of our quarterly results, David and I are both pleased with the strong start to the first half of this year and we remain very bullish on the future performance of our powerful collection of consumer connected brands. Our next quarterly call is scheduled for early January. Please be sure to have a safe and happy holiday season and remember to enjoy some of our great products during your celebrations with family and friends. Thanks again for coming on the call and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2019-06-28 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands Q1 Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Daniel. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's first quarter 2020 conference call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and David Klein, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the Company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now here's Bill.
William Newlands: Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation’s first quarter sales and earnings results, which reflect an excellent start to our new fiscal year. Before I get started with our business review, I would like to emphasize three key takeaways on this morning's call. Number one, we are confident in our ability to close the Wine and Spirits transaction with Gallo, which we expect will occur in the second half of calendar 2019. For now, we have updated our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance to assume that we closed at the end of the second quarter, but we will adjust accordingly as we get more clarity on the exact timing. Meanwhile, we are fully committed to supporting our entire portfolio throughout the transition. Number two, the transformation strategy for our Wine and Spirits business is working, led by the power brands in our portfolio, which achieved over 4% depletion growth in the first quarter. This collection of faster-growing, high-margin brands is expected to drive the growth of the business going forward. And number three, we posted strong net sales and margin results for our beer business in the first quarter, driven by continued outstanding performance by our growth engine that is Modelo Especial. In addition, we are pleased with the nearly 7% overall depletion growth, even with Corona Extra seeing some impact from unfavorable weather in several of our largest markets during the quarter, while overlapping last year’s highly successful launches of Corona Premier and Corona Familiar. Bottom line, we remain confident in our ability to achieve 7% to 9% net sales and EBIT growth for our beer business in fiscal 2020. Speaking of beer, during the first quarter, the Constellation Beer business continued to gain share with growth across all channels, driving one-third of the growth of the high-end U.S. beer market. Modelo Especial was the most significant growth contributor within our portfolio for the quarter. This exceptional brand has excellent marketplace momentum and achieved the number one spot as the top share gainer in the U.S. beer category with depletion growth of more than 17%, a sequential acceleration compared to our fourth quarter trend. We continue to reap the benefits of our Modelo advertising investments which are resonating with both our core and new consumers. We recently launched the Modelo 32-ounce bottle as we continue to take advantage of the single-serve and distribution trade up opportunities we have in the off-premise. We also made excellent progress in the on-premise with the Modelo draft format increasing more than 20% for the quarter. Corona Premier continues to drive the Corona brand family performance. The National TV advertising campaign as well as the draft rollout are propelling the momentum of this brand, which was a top share gainer in IRI channels while also posting double-digit depletion growth during the quarter. This summer, Corona Premier began a multi-year sponsorship deal with the United States Golf Association to be a proud supporter of the U.S. Open. And the newest innovation in the Corona brand family, Corona Refresca which launched nationally at the end of May, has already gained all commodity volume or ACV distribution of more than 30 since its introduction. Pacifico also produced strong double-digit depletion growth this past quarter driven by the national advertising campaign and retail promotions which are increasing Pacifico’s in-store presence. Overall, I believe we are well positioned throughout the remainder of the summer selling season with a great lineup of marketing and promotional activities to support the ongoing growth momentum of our entire beer portfolio. Moving now to Wine and Spirits. As you know, Robert Hanson was recently hired as our new President of the Wine and Spirits business. Robert was previously a six-year valued member of our Board of Directors and has extensive consumer product experience from his prior senior management roles at John Hardy, American Eagle Outfitters, and Levi Strauss. Robert shares the Constellation passion for developing brands that consumers love and we are thrilled that he has joined our executive management team. Welcome to Robert. The Wine and Spirits business delivered first quarter results that exceeded our previously communicated expectations. As I mentioned, our power brands posted industry-leading depletion growth of over 4% for the first quarter. This portfolio includes key brands like Kim Crawford, Meiomi, SVEDKA Vodka, The Prisoner and High West, which continued to outperform the market and gain share. Overall, we expect these brands to be the key drivers of the business long-term and we are extremely bullish on the future runway for these higher growth, higher margin brands. In addition, our Wine and Spirits innovation agenda has been successful with a focus on fast-growing categories, emerging formats and new flavor combinations. We will continue to expand our Bourbon Barrel Aged innovation program, which has been a resounding success, selling over 1 million cases in its first two years. A great example includes the new Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Rye Barrel-Aged Red Blend, which is the first Rye Barrel-Aged wine introduced at a super premium price point. In July, we'll begin shipping Eternally Silenced, which is the first Pinot Noir addition to the Prisoner portfolio. This premium product introduction will be sold in the over $50 price segment. We will continue to support our innovation and brand building efforts throughout the remainder of the year with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build the portfolio. We have solid programming in place for our key power brands this summer, including the launch of a new TV advertising campaign for the Woodbridge portfolio. In addition, we have forged a relationship with the NFL to not only promote and sell our Woodbridge brand, but to introduce our new Crafters Union, Wine in a Can, which is the perfect format for football games and tailgating. Kim Crawford continues to align with consumers through its partnership with the U.S. Open and other major tennis events and recently launched a new TV and digital advertising campaign that will be featured this summer. These campaigns and sponsorships are just a few examples of the initiatives we have planned to strengthen the portfolio, drive consumer awareness and incremental growth. Our spirits portfolio has recently gained momentum with increases in growth and velocity across the SVEDKA portfolio bolstered by the new Bring Your Own Spirit national advertising campaign, plus the new innovation in the product line up SVEDKA Rose is already exceeding expectations. During the quarter, Constellation Ventures acquired a majority stake in Nelson's Green Brier, which is an iconic Tennessee Whiskey that plays well in emerging categories of American whiskey and craft. It is the first Ventures investment that will be fully integrated into the Constellation sales and distribution network, which provides a significant opportunity for growth of this brand. With our market reach, distributor partnerships and consumer insights, we are especially excited about the introduction of Nelson's Green Brier unique Tennessee whiskey to consumers this fall. While the award winning Belle Meade Bourbon brand continues its rapid market growth. As we begin the transformation journey for our Wine and Spirits business, I would like to reiterate our long-term goal for this business as we intend to grow net sales in the mid single-digit range with operating margins migrating to 30%. This quarter, we have made progress toward that goal and we look forward to shaping our Wine and Spirits business to be a best of class consumer goods portfolio with a market leading sales and margin profile. Now a few comments about our investment in Canopy Growth, which continues to be the global leader in total cannabis sales. During the quarter, Canopy Growth and Acreage Holdings entered into an agreement that grants Canopy the right to acquire Acreage and enter the U.S. cannabis market once federally permissible. We are excited about this opportunity as it provides a path for Canopy to have a leading position in the U.S. upon federal cannabis reform. Recently, Canopy and Acreage shareholders overwhelmingly approved this transaction which will provide the opportunity for Constellation to extend the duration of Canopy warrants which provides long-term financial flexibility for cash deployment to our shareholders. David will provide additional details on that later in the call. And while we remain happy with our investment in the cannabis space and its long-term potential, we were not pleased with Canopy's recent reported year end results. However, we continue to aggressively support Canopy on a more focused long-term strategy to win markets and form factors that matter while paving a clear path to profitability. We believe some of these branded form factors include vape, beverages and edibles that will command higher margins. These products in Canada as well as CBD products in the U.S. are expected to come on line during the fourth quarter of this calendar year. In closing, I am pleased with our strong start to the year. Excellent execution of our first quarter results demonstrates that we continue to deliver on our key strategic imperatives across our Beer, Wine and Spirits businesses, and I'm excited about the prospects across the business for the remainder of this year. With that, I would like to turn the call now over to David who will review our financial results from the quarter.
David Klein: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2020 is off to a great start. Core business results exceeded expectations with operating cash flow up 18% and free cash flow up 30%. These strong results were primarily driven by our Beer business, which generated 12% operating income growth. We've increased our full-year comparable basis, diluted EPS range to $8.65 through $8.95. This range excludes Canopy equity earnings impact and now assumes revised transaction timing to sell a portion of our Wine and Spirits business that Bill outlined. The $0.15 increase in EPS guidance represents one additional quarter of EBIT from the portion of the Wine and Spirits business that we've agreed to sell, partially offset by a delay in cost savings realization now expected to be at the low-end of our fiscal 2020 range of $35 million to $55 million and incremental interest expense due to debt paydown now targeted for the second half of fiscal 2020. After the transaction closes, we continue to expect to eliminate a total of $130 million of stranded costs from our Wine and Spirits business by the end of fiscal 2021. Now let's review Q1 performance in more detail, where I’ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales increased 7% on shipment volume growth of 5%. Shipment volume was higher than expected, primarily due to additional shipments made at the end of the quarter as part of efforts to mitigate potential tariff risks. As a result, the beer shipment timing benefit at the end of fiscal 2019 is now expected to reverse during the remainder of fiscal 2020 since it didn't occur in Q1. Depletion growth came in at 7% continuing our streak of excellent portfolio performance during the key Cinco and Memorial Day holidays. This growth is compared to strong depletion growth in the prior year of 9% driven by new product launches generating two-year average growth of 8%. Beer operating margin increased 150 basis points to 39.3%, as favorability in pricing and FX were partially offset by higher transportation and logistics costs. Marketing as a percent of net sales increased 20 basis points to 11% driven by planned upfront marketing investments to support our brands leading into the summer selling season as outlined by Bill earlier. For fiscal 2020, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth of 7% to 9% and our full-year operating margin to approximate 39%. This includes 1% to 2% of pricing within our Mexican portfolio. As a reminder, we're facing a 10% depletion growth compare for Q2. In addition, we expect some of the shipment timing benefit mentioned earlier to reverse in Q2. And as a result, we expect Q2 net sales and EBIT growth to be in the mid-single digits range. We continue to expect our gross margin to be flattish for the year as cost inflation headwinds in growth investments are expected to be mostly offset from product pricing and productivity initiatives. Gross margin will also be impacted by the reversal of the shipment timing benefit in the remainder of fiscal 2020. We continue to expect fiscal 2020 marketing as a percent of net sales to increase around 20 basis points to 9.5% in support of our innovation and growth initiatives. Q1 fiscal 2020 Wine and Spirits net sales and operating income decreased 8% and 4% respectively. Q1 fiscal 2020 shipment volume declined 8% due to the fiscal 2019 shipment timing benefit mentioned last quarter. This mostly reversed in Q1, we expect the remaining fiscal 2019 shipment timing benefit to reverse in Q2, and this along with a difficult year-over-year comparison are expected to result in Wine and Spirits net sales in EBIT for Q2 fiscal 2020 to decrease 5% to 10% and 10% to 15% respectively. Our fast-growing, high-margin power brands like Kim Crawford, Meiomi, SVEDKA Vodka, The Prisoner, High West, and Schrader generated depletions of greater than 4%. Overall depletion trends of minus 1% were muted by lower-end brands. Wine and Spirits operating margin increased 90 basis points to 25.9% primarily due to favorable pricing along with lower marketing in SG&A costs partially offset by unfavorable mix. The lower marketing and SG&A benefits were due in part to a shift in timing of spend into Q2 as we have a significant ramp in spend to support the power brands during the summer selling season. This shift helped us outperform our original Q1 EBIT guidance. We now expect fiscal 2020 Wine and Spirits net sales to decrease 20% to 25% and operating income to decrease 25% to 30% due to the revised timing of the Wine and Spirits transaction discussed earlier. I'd like to echo Bill's confidence that the Wine and Spirits transformation strategy is already working. And as a result in fiscal 2020, we're targeting mid single-digit power brand depletion growth. Longer-term, we expect the business to produce mid single-digit net sales growth while migrating to an operating margin of 30%. In Q1, we recognized $72 million of charges in connection with ongoing efforts to gain efficiencies and reduce the cost structure of the business. These charges, which are primarily related to the Wine and Spirits business, were excluded from comparable basis results. The charges include costs associated with certain write-downs of excess inventory, contract terminations, and organizational structure changes. Roughly, half of these charges are related to cash outlays expected to occur in fiscal 2020, which have been factored into our operating cash flow guidance. Interest expense for the quarter increased 31%, which reflects interest expense of approximately $40 million related to the funding for our incremental Canopy Growth investment in November 2018. Fiscal 2020 interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $425 million to $435 million, which reflects incremental interest related to revised timing of the Wine and Spirits transaction, partially offset by anticipated rate favorability. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 17.6% versus 21.4% for Q1 last year, primarily driven by the overlap of unfavorable one-time items and a lower rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation benefit. We anticipate that our Q2 fiscal 2020 effective tax rate will be similar to the Q1 rate in the 18% range. However, we continue to forecast our full-year fiscal 2020 effective tax rate to approximate 17% with stock-based compensation benefits expected to be weighted towards the second half of the year. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated $437 million of free cash flow compared to $336 million last year. This impressive 30% growth was primarily driven by strong beer operating cash flow results and lower CapEx. We now expect fiscal 2020 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, and operating cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion. This reflects revised timing of the Wine and Spirits transaction. We continue to expect CapEx of $800 million to $900 million. This includes approximately $600 million of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion, including investments in the Obregon and Mexicali breweries, and a fifth glass furnace at the Nava glass plant. Shifting to our investment in Canopy Growth. The total pretax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $1.6 billion. In Q1, we recognized an $828 million decrease in the fair value of the Canopy Growth investment, which was excluded from comparable basis results. As Bill mentioned, Canopy Growth and Acreage shareholders approved Canopy Growth's proposed acquisition of Acreage. As a result, certain Constellation warrants were modified to include longer duration and revised pricing. We expect to recognize a material gain on our modified Canopy warrants in Q2 to reflect these changes and will exclude that gain from comparable basis results. These warrant modifications allow Constellation more time to assess how the cannabis landscape is progressing before the warrants expire. Coupling our new warrant structure with our businesses strong cash generation provides incremental long-term flexibility for cash deployment to shareholders. So we remain committed to returning $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends from fiscal 2020 fiscal 2022. As summarized in the earnings release, first quarter fiscal 2020 comparable basis diluted EPS excluding Canopy equity earnings impact totaled $2.40 per share, representing growth of 9%. Canopy's business is rapidly evolving and their financial results will likely be volatile as they invest in growth opportunities. Similar to this quarter, we plan to release an 8-K after Canopy reports earnings to disclose Canopy's impact on our quarterly results. I'd like to remind everyone, Canopy equity earnings recognized in our income statement are non-cash and we've not factored Canopy equity earnings into our fiscal 2020 comparable basis EPS guidance range of $8.65 to $8.95. This will allow us and our investors to focus on the underlying performance of our core business. In closing, we're off to a strong start for fiscal 2020, as we continue to benefit from secular trends like premiumization and favorable demographics. We believe the investments we are making in support of growth opportunities today, position us to generate industry-leading growth, while we deliver on our fiscal 2020 commitments. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Judy Hong: Thank you. Good morning.
William Newlands: Hi, Judy.
Judy Hong: So I guess I want to zero in on the beer depletion growth particularly around the Corona brand family. Clearly, the weather was a factor, but sort of how much does your analytics kind of point to weather being a factor versus Modelo obviously accelerating and you've talked about the cannibalization impact for Modelo and then clearly the Spiked Seltzer category kind of booming, how much is that also cutting into the Corona brand family? And kind of dovetailing that, if you think about the mid single-digit depletion guidance for second quarter, can you just talk about the drivers of that other than just a comparison, how much is really the shipment on their performance or is there a little bit more caution around depletion just given the poor start to the summer given the weather? Thank you.
William Newlands: All right, Judy. We will try to wrap that into one thought. So here we go. Look, we are comfortable with where Corona is as a brand. If you look at the most recent IRI trends through 6/16, Corona Extra is up admittedly against very tough overlaps with the weather challenges that we had during the first quarter. It's also appropriate to recognize that with the accelerating Modelo trends of 17% growth that certainly has some impact within the overall portfolio as well. And certainly, it's worth noting that Seltzer business has become a larger factor in the high-end than it had been in prior years. So all of those things certainly have some impact on the overall business. With all of that said, the overall family is roughly flattish. We are comfortable with where that business is looking, and as you noted, our overall depletion profile across our entire business was up just under 7% in the first quarter. If you in fact, look at June, while taking out the single day which happened to be a Friday that we lose in this quarter versus comparable quarter a year ago, the actual depletion rate in the month of June would be above the year-to-date depletion rate.
David Klein: Yes. I want to just expand on that last point that Bill made. So in Q2 when we report our results, we lose a day of depletions, which doesn't come back until Q4. So it's an anomaly that you guys should factor into your models.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning.
William Newlands: Hey, Bonnie. Good morning.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. Just a few more questions on Corona. First on Premier, I just wanted to hear from you guys were the results in the quarter better than you expected and if so why? And then on Corona Light, it's really still not where you want it to be. So maybe drill down a little bit further on any initiatives you might have to improve the brand? And then finally, how much further do you think you can extend the Corona brand? For instance, you're missing an opportunity right now in Seltzer, which just kind of touched on, is there a way to leverage one of your existing brands possibly Corona, and what could be the timing of that? Thanks.
William Newlands: Sure. So let's talk first about Premier. We were very pleased with the results of Premier in the first quarter. Keeping in mind, it was going against a year ago, when we introduced it, which automatically has the normal stock-up scenario when the brand was introduced. With all that said, it was up double-digits, and as you know, we have raised the advertising profile of that brand, and we'll be doing so for the remainder of this fiscal year. Relative to the overall family of Corona, as you know, we're very excited about Corona Refresco. We're off to an excellent start against that, and by the way, if any of you haven't had it I would strongly encourage you to do so. They are really delicious and very refreshing. So that is certainly the focus of our approach for this fiscal year and this summer selling season just to make sure that we maximize the potential of both Premier as well as Refresca in the overall mix of the Corona brand family. With all of that said, we continue to be excited about the opportunity that we have with Corona going forward. We do recognize that relative to your question about Seltzers that Seltzers have taken a larger piece of the growth profile in the high-end than they had in previous quarters and years. And certainly, our view is this. We explore all options where we have the ability to profitably participate in categories, and we will continue to do that. That's a standard way we operate. We will do that again going forward.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Nik Modi: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
William Newlands: Hey, Nik.
Nik Modi: The question is on Wine and Spirits. So I guess this new Mondavi Woodbridge ad campaign is hitting the airwaves now. Can you just talk a little bit about the process here that's different? Now that Jim has kind of taken over the CMO role, and do you have plans to do similar types of campaigns on other of your power brands in the near-term?
William Newlands: Yes. As you know Nik, the Woodbridge brand is a critical brand for us just because of its sheer size and profitability. The advertising campaign that Jim and the rest of the marketing team have put together, we're very excited about. I don't know if you've seen it yet, if you haven't, I think it's highly compelling. We showed it to our Board yesterday, and we've just launched it this week, and we're very excited about the potential because it really speaks to Robert Mondavi's original goal to put great wine at every price point on every table. And I think the advertising that was developed does an exceptional job of suggesting just that. But we're not limiting our advertising efforts to that brand. As you've seen, we've spent and raised our profile in SVEDKA Vodka and the brand has responded. The SVEDKA growth profile has accelerated versus prior year. We will also be spending during the course of the summer months on both Meiomi and Kim Crawford. Kim Crawford in particular with its lead Sauvignon Blanc is a terrific wine for the summer season, and both that and Meiomi in addition to the others that I mentioned will all be supported during the coming selling season.
David Klein: Yes. I'd add to that Bill that we've – I mentioned in my script that we had favorable price in our Wine and Spirits portfolio and that was primarily driven by our ability to get higher realized pricing for Woodbridge and SVEDKA. Two brands that we're investing behind and it's that kind of approach to really nurturing CPG brands, where we're going to be able to charge appropriately for the equity that exists in the brand, but then we're going to spend back to help the consumers understand the value proposition that we're offering. That's why we're all really excited about our new approach to our power brands.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Lauren Lieberman: Thanks. Good morning. We definitely got asked many times to the quarter sort of our view on the said discounting on Corona cans that was in some of the industry trade press. If you guys could just comment a little bit on pricing strategy for the Corona brand family overall? And to what degree that was sort of these plans and what went on during the quarter was already part of the full-year plan, and within that 1% to 2% pricing expectation for the portfolio or was something kind of newer that came up with the poor weather and so on? Thanks.
William Newlands: Well, as you know, a lot of individual programming occurs with local retailers. It happens all the time on particular formats and sizes. While that was said, we achieved strong pricing in the quarter, up 1% to 2%, and we certainly have no uniform discussion of pricing and price promoting. Again, as I said a moment ago, price promotion occurs on a local level a lot, and it occurs usually on particular formats to get particular price points during key selling seasons. So we have not moved away from our normal expectation of 1% to 2% pricing. And in fact, we were quite successful in achieving price promotion during the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good morning. Bill, I really appreciated your candor in your prepared remarks about your view of Canopy's most recent earnings results. So I just wanted to dig in on that. In terms of your disappointment in the quarter, I mean certainly the expanded EBITDA losses stand out, but was there any concern around the topline? So any more color around just that specific comment. And then as a follow-up to that, can you talk about your expectations relative to previous public commentary from CAGNY around the financial results for Canopy going forward? Thank you.
William Newlands: Sure. We continue to expect that the run rate topline profile by the end of the next fiscal year will be in the $1 billion run rate range. With that said, and we need to all recognize. There are going to be splits and starts around a business like this when various form factors and products either have better acceleration or weaker acceleration of what everybody had anticipated. As you know, Ontario, which ultimately should be the biggest province has been a little behind some of the other provinces, in terms of opening stores, which always impacts things. So there is going to be some splits and starts in this thing. I think what we remain excited about is that this is going to be a big long-term business, and we are working with Canopy almost on a daily basis to ensure that we are all focused on the right things. The things that are going to drive the business, the things and the form factors that are going to matter in a way that gets to ultimate profitability for that business in an appropriate time frame.
David Klein: Yes. Vivian, I'll comment on our previously made commentary around the business being accretive to our results in 2021. Those comments were predicated on Canopy's performance in Canada, their performance in their existing rest of world medical markets, return from our $4 billion investment, and they assumed we wouldn't have legalization in the U.S. because of course we know legalization in the U.S. would drive large P&L investments, which we'd all be happy to make to be able to participate in that large market. So let me just pick through those and talk about the current state. So in Canada, we know that this business is volatile as Bill outlined, but we think it's mostly on track with all of our expectations. We know that as it relates to FY2021 that the slight delay in edibles including beverages in Canada will likely impact our FY2021 because it's unlikely that Canopy will have the broad array of products in the market by calendar one – quarter one, calendar 2020, which will affect our first quarter of next year because of the two month lag on which we consolidate Canopy or we recognized income on Canopy. So Canada is on track, but we expect it to be volatile and the team at Canopy is quite good and really working their way through any execution issues that they may have had in the past. From the existing rest of world medical markets, we think those markets are on track, again real strong performance in those spaces by the Canopy team that we're pleased with. In terms of investment returns, we're very happy with the investment in Storz & Bickel, which you saw in their results last quarter. And we're extremely excited about the agreement with Acreage which, while expected to be a profitable company won't be consolidated and reported through the Canopy results in a way that would affect our numbers in the foreseeable future until there is a triggering event in the U.S. And then the last point is really on the unexpected legalization of CBD in the U.S., which will require a significant amount of investment, which Canopy has already announced. And we think that that's a good place for them to focus their money and their resources to really take advantage of what could be a very large and profitable market in the U.S. And we're really happy with how they're positioning themselves there. So look, we still are very bullish on our Canopy investment, and we're very happy, we made the investment when we did into this space which more and more people are starting to wake up to. As it relates to its effect on our financial results, we're going to continue to assess as we go through FY2020 as to how we will adjust our statements on the accretion or dilution effects on Constellation.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, guys.
William Newlands: Good morning.
David Klein: Hi, Dara.
Dara Mohsenian: Clearly, beer margins came in better-than-expected in the quarter versus your flat implied expectation. I guess some of that was less of a Q1 inventory drawdown than expected. But that would appear to be only a modest portion to beer. So just curious for the lack of a full-year margin raise on the beer business, despite the big Q1 beat, is that more – we're just still early in the year or are there other factors in the remainder of the year that might reverse some of that Q1 upside? How should we think about that?
William Newlands: Yes. So Dara, I think we still have concerns about the wage rate inflation in Mexico and increased costs of glass and other forms of packaging. We still have freight and logistics headwinds in the business that we continue to see. In Q1, we had some really good benefits from primarily pricing and FX, and some productivity improvements that were offset by the things that I just listed out. So and as you said, we had a bit of a benefit from over shipments in Q1, which works its way down to the growth in bottom line operating margin. In a comment on Q2, we expect that our marketing spend will be up slightly year-over-year in Q2, which will – have this coming probably a little lower than the 41.2% margin that we achieved in Q2. We tend to kind of max out our margins in Q2. So we'll run a little bit lower than that this year. And then I think any further growth in margins, away from the 39% target that we put out, which we feel is the right number for us for this year, will really be driven by maybe outsized gains in pricing or unexpected benefits from FX. So I think the 39% represents a pretty balanced view of the remainder of our full-year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Robert Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. Just want to get a little bit better feel for kind of the underlying consumer demand? It's a tricky quarter to do that, given some of the comps. And I was just wondering perhaps you could give your best guess of the impact of weather. We are thinking it could be, maybe 100 basis points, 200 basis points, is that too high? And also – we are also hearing that you got quite a nice amount of incremental shelf space in the quarter finally. Can you talk about that in terms of if that's right roughly the kind of timing of that in any way to quantify it? Thank you.
David Klein: Yes, I'll take a shot at it and then Bill can fill in the hole. So I think from a consumer demand perspective, we've seen this volatility over the past few years, where we had a very strong April as you've seen in our results. And I think there is clearly a large effect from weather across the country, in particular in markets where we over index. I can't really comment on your range, our numbers – we can get it to that level of detail across the entire industry. But the biggest competition, the biggest change in consumer demand in the market that we've seen has been the result of the acceleration of Seltzers. It hasn't really been anything outside of weather, the result of other factors says affecting our portfolio of brands.
William Newlands: The only thing I would add to that David is, and then we've touched on this a bit before, is that we are overlapping a very strong growth profile from last year in the same quarter with both Premier and Familiar. So to show the kind of overall depletion growth that we had in the quarter of just under 7%, we are quite pleased by. Any time you have two major overlaps and they were both very successful. And as you can see, Premier continues to be very successful overlapping the introduction. You will have some impact on your business. With that said, with almost 7% growth in the quarter, we're quite pleased with how the year is setting up.
David Klein: And just one other point, Robert you mentioned a growing shelf space and you know that that's an important component that our sales team is laser-focused on. We've also seen in particular Corona Premier's 12-week based volume velocity increased by almost 25%. So we're seeing some really good signs in the marketplace, as it relates to our brands.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Kevin Grundy: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Questions for David, housekeeping on the guidance, and then one on return on capital, so quickly on the EPS guidance, despite the strong margin performance, it sounds like the upward revision to your EPS outlook is entirely due to the timing of the wind of divestiture, if you could just confirm that? And then with respect to the return of capital, you're maintaining the prior guidance of $4.5 billion in dividends in repurchases over the next few years, but that was prior to the more favorable terms of the Canopy warrants as part of the Acreage transaction. Maybe you can just comment on the greater flexibility that you have to potentially see that guidance? Thank you.
David Klein: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. So yes, our guidance revision really reflects one additional quarter of the brands that are to be sold, offset by an increase in interest expense because we won't be receiving the cash from the sale in the same timeframe as we had anticipated, as well as because our – the transaction closes later in the year, our ability to get to the high-end of that $35 million to $55 million stranded cost takeout range is a significantly hindered, which is why we said we're more likely to be at $35 million for the year. But for clarity, still on track to hit $130 million total stranded cost takeout. And so the guidance change was really solely focused on the Wine and Spirits divestiture. As I said, we remain of the belief that we will end the year at 39% operating margins in our beer business. And in terms of cash return, Kevin, yes, we're really happy with the incremental flexibility that we get from the revisions to the warrants and we're just continuing to focus on the $4.5 billion of return to shareholders. I guess, that we want to as quickly as possible return $4.5 billion and then we'll decide what we do after that, but again, we simply remain focused on getting as much as we can out of our Canopy investment and returning cash to our shareholders.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Bryan Spillane: Hey, good morning everyone. I wanted to follow-up on the Focus brands within Wine and Spirits. And I guess there is some more advertising and marketing that you mentioned in response to Nik's next question earlier. Can you talk about maybe just over in the next year or two, kind of a longer timeframe? Are there like distribution opportunities or merchandising opportunities that like aren't optimized today that might give you kind of a runway of growth in those brands that are maybe similar to what you saw in beer over the last couple of years?
William Newlands: Sure. You bet. We are doing a lot of analytical work around what is the best way to present our brands to the public. As an example, much like we have done in beer on space assessment, we're doing the same kind of space assessment work in our wine business as to whether or not more facings are better than something else, as an example. So we do believe that there is interesting and significant upside for that set of brands. They first of all, they're growing brands, they participate in growing categories, and we're going to support those and many of them with consumer advertising, at the same time, while we are increasing our analytical capability to leverage things like you note, which is where do we focus our incremental time and attention of our distributors and our sales organization, so that they maximize the potential for those brands. So the short answer is, yes. All of those things are being done and that should give us significant upside opportunity within our, the brands that are in the power sector of our business.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Kaumil Gajrawala: Hey, good afternoon everybody. First one, just a quick one, how severe your 6.6% depletions came from your new products collectively? And then the second question, on the wine deal, is it structured as all or none, or are you able to carve out certain brands and effectively you have to keep them if it ends up going that route? And the reason why I ask is, if you look at the market shares at certain price points turns that they, they can be quite high, and so as we go through this kind of second request in information process, and curious if you have to sell the whole thing, or if you have the options to sell pieces of it or not?
William Newlands: Go ahead, David.
David Klein: Yes. So Kaumil, I'll start on that one. Look, we remain committed to the transaction that we've agreed to with Gallo, we're working our way through the FTC process, and we expect that we'll reach a successful conclusion. We've also stated for clarity that while we've extended our guidance through the end of Q2, we want to be clear that as stated in the 8-K, when we announced the additional work that we needed to do with the FTC that we would close, we expected the transaction to close in the second half of the year. So we'll provide a little more clarity, when as we get closer to a final resolution.
William Newlands: And as to your piece of your question about the depletion growth obviously with 17% growth in Modelo Especial and the sheer size of that business that was actually the single biggest driver of our depletion growth profile coupled with double-digit growth in both Corona Premier and Pacifico. So – and at this point, we view Corona Premier as part of the franchise. We don't necessarily view that as a "new product" at this point. Obviously, Refresca had some benefit during the quarter, but it was relatively minimal compared to the sheer growth that existed on those mega brands of Modelo and the Corona Premier/Pacifico groups.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Sharma: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
William Newlands: Good morning.
Amit Sharma: Bill, can you talk about your on-premise trends for the beer business? I mean, lots of us focus on the IRI data and that data showed your depletions maybe a little bit weaker than where you came out to be. Is that the run rate going forward or should we think about that? And then on innovation, the question is as you focus on the Seltzer side of the business, do you believe you have the brand extensions already in the marketplace to go into that category? Or would you like to extend one of your brands as you think about the Seltzer category going forward?
William Newlands: Sure. Let me start with your question about on-premise. On our on-premise business, we see as being up mid single-digits for our overall beer portfolio compared to an industry that's probably off low-single digits. So we certainly are outperforming and as I think, I noted in my original remarks that we're seeing an excellent uptick of 20% plus in Modelo draft as an example, which obviously occurs entirely through the on-premise arena. Our focus admittedly as I have said, we are watching Seltzer category very carefully. But I'll also say this. Our Refresca business is where we are focusing our attention this year. We think it's critically important when you introduce a new product and a new brand that you put the intensity of focus on that to get that into the mouths of consumers who are interested. And as I said earlier, as good as they are getting it into their mouths is a critically important element because they are just delicious. So our focus and intention is entirely around Refresca for this season, but as we said earlier, we will continue to explore all options where we can profitably participate in all of the areas of the business where we think it makes sense for us to do so.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Andrea Teixeira: Hi, thank you. So hi, Bill and David, and Patty.
William Newlands: Hi.
Andrea Teixeira: How are you? I just wanted to go back to the comment on the Corona family leaving the quarter and the one less day in the Corona family, we are accelerating in the most recent read from depletion standpoint, I appreciate our comment. But removing the noise from the inventories the one less day, if you think of the final consumer demand all channels, including the commentary that you gave on the on-premise, do you think the family can go back to that sweet spot and re-accelerate from flat to low single and or even mid single-digits from a consumer takeaway standpoint? I know you're comparing the plus 8 that you had last year from the plus 4 to the plus 8. But just to give us some perspective of the final demand and how we can put everything together all channels?
William Newlands: Yes. We expect that the Corona family is going to have a very solid year with growth across the family, and again I would include the entire family. That would be Corona Extra. That would include Premier, Familiar etc. So we are continuing to expect that that business will perform well as you know. Our advertising has been increased against the Corona franchise for this year. Well, while many others actually are doing the opposite. So our share of voice within the beer category will be up during this summer selling season and we are very optimistic that Corona is going to be an important part of our growth profile acknowledging that we are 30 years and counting on our double-digit growth with Modelo and we're off to an amazing start this year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is now open.
Timothy Ramey: Maybe a quick one and then a different one. Any early thoughts on CapEx for 2021 and the wine in cans initiative is really interesting. It's been a super hot growth category. Any expectations on what that might look like?
David Klein: Yes. So I'll hit the CapEx question. Yes, if we look at our CapEx over a three year horizon. So FY2020, FY2021 and FY2022, we expect that will be a net $700 million to $900 million range and we're headed toward that and that's inclusive of $200 million to $400 million of kind of maintenance CapEx within our business. So I think, even though this year's guidance is $800 million to $900 million total CapEx, which is going to be in that range for the next couple of years.
William Newlands: And relative to the question around the wine in a can, as I commented in my previous remarks, our Crafters Union brand, which we are very excited about is it was part of our tying with the NFL and we think it's a great format. We're also looking at the idea of other can opportunities. I'll give you an example. Kim Crawford. We're looking at single serve Kim Crawford in a can as well. It is a great packaged for on-the-go and for certainly summer events and it seems like the consumer based on our research, the consumers are comfortable with a can format for wine. And therefore, we will participate with the brands that we feel are appropriate and where there is going to be real consumer demand within our portfolio.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Steve Powers: Hey, great, thanks. A follow-up on your guidance, I guess, question is for David. I understand that the puts and takes that you ran through specific to the year and the quarter. But just stepping back at the risk of your loss in the numbers, if I take what you've said at the midpoint, so beer profits up 8% after 19 days, wine profits down say 27.5%, $430 million for interest expense. And then I add $30 million or so for Opus take away $200 million or so for corporate costs and tax effected out 17%, but the math that I'm running through just seems to point to something closer to like $9.20 in EPS, $9.20 so well above your current range. So just – am I missing something either in the math or in my logic or just can you bridge that gap for me, thanks?
David Klein: Yes, I think it comes back to the things I pointed out earlier, Steve, which is really the, we take our previous guidance. We add one quarter of wine EBIT for the brands that are going to be sold. And there are a couple of things to consider with that. First of all, those brands and we put it in our earnings release, their performance last year, those brands are declining. There are stranded costs that we won't be able to take out because we used to have nine months to take cost out of the business, we will now have six months to take cost out of the business. So the incremental and we have the incremental interest expense on that. So I think when you factor all of those in, our guidance range makes sense. Maybe one other thing to think through is that, if you look at last year's numbers, I think we were in the maybe $20 million-ish of NCI, the NCI number is going to be in the $30 million to $40 million range.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean King with UBS. Your line is now open.
Sean King: Hi guys, good morning. I apologize if I missed this one, but are you holding to your full-year expectation for Premier Growth? I know that with the track channels decelerating somewhat, but or is that more sort of offset by the accelerating strength in Modelo Especial?
William Newlands: I'm not sure if it's yes or no. The answer is, we're expecting that it will be the previously expected growth profile. We're very pleased with the start the Premier is off to, and as David alluded to a little bit before we are seeing accelerating velocities against the Premier franchise. So yes, we're comfortable with where we expect that to go.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
Laurent Grandet: Yes. Good morning, everyone.
William Newlands: Hi, Laurent.
Laurent Grandet: Two quick questions, so one on spirit guidance. So in a previous communication after the 4Q, you guided Wine and Spirits organic sales growth between low single-digit and mid single-digits, and high single-digit organic operating income growth. So you are not providing any more, any guidance this quarter. So how should we read this? And my second question is about Refresca, I mean I know it's still very early on. But could you share any feedback you are receiving from wholesalers, retailers and maybe having, the first I mean trying this with consumers. So that would be very helpful. Thank you.
William Newlands: Yes, so what you're referring to, I think is inorganic sort of guidance for Wine and Spirits. And so we would expect that to be flat to slightly down. Now both topline and bottom line based upon the incremental quarter. And relative to your question on Refresca, it's early days and it's always dangerous to make too many projections on 30 days worth of selling. With that said, we are very pleased with where our ACV distribution has gotten to after the first month. And we've noticed that the variety pack has been particularly successful in the early days. Now whether or not that continues, I think it remains to be seen. It could very well be consumer sampling and deciding, which of those they happen to prefer, but certainly the early response in the variety pack has been – has exceeded our expectations.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Chappell: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to go back to Woodbridge, and just trying to understand with a sub $10 brand, which is still part of the portfolio, and your kind of thoughts of these – the power wine and spirits brands growing at a much faster rate both next year and going forward. Just trying to couple that with what you've seen in the category for that kind of price points and with the competition in up years and down years, how confident, I mean that Woodbridge doesn't pull that growth down or that it can actually contribute as part of that?
David Klein: Yes. So we've said in the past that when you look at our portfolio, Woodbridge is required for us to, we feel retain appropriate critical mass in our production facilities and with – and to retained clout with retailers. And as a result, we needed in our portfolio, understanding that just the category plays in, even if it continues to grow share in its category, it will be a drag on the total portfolio, and it's about Woodbridge represents about one-third of the remaining business kind of post sale. But we think this is a very important brand for our portfolio. And Jim Sabia and Robert Hanson are very focused on driving this brand's growth, and as evidenced by the new spots that we're seeing come onto TV over the last week, because we need this brand to be healthy, and we think that we can get some outsized share growth in its category. And at the same time, be able to give ourselves a little bit of pricing power with the brand. So we feel a lot of upside to Woodbridge and we're pretty excited about having it as part of our power brand portfolio.
William Newlands: And Bill the other thing that I would purely add is keep in mind the 15 which is the larger size, no pun intended. It's the larger size within the portfolio sells for $12.99. So it gets into a plus $10 price point, when the consumer is pulling out their wallet to pay for our brands. So I echo what David said is Woodbridge has done an excellent job of outperforming the category in which it competes, and with the additional support and investment that we're going to make against it, we expect that that will continue to and be an important piece of our remain co as we go forward.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to William Newlands for closing remarks.
William Newlands: Thanks very much, Daniel. So thank you all for joining our call today. The excellent start to fiscal 2020 has nicely positioned our business for another very successful year. The summer selling season is now in full swing, and our team plans to capitalize on the momentum we have underway, as we are well positioned with outstanding advertising and marketing initiatives across our entire portfolio. And as July 4, holiday is just around the corner, I hope your responsible celebrations with family and friends will include our fantastic beer, wine and spirit products. So thanks again everyone for joining the call and have a great summer.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-04-04 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands Fiscal Year Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation’s year-end fiscal 2019 conference call. I’m here this morning with Bill Newlands, our CEO; and David Klein, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the Company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now, here’s Bill.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal year 2019 year-end call. I’m sure you’ve all seen the announcement we made last evening, indicating that we have signed an agreement with Gallo, to sell a portion of our wine and spirit business for $1.7 billion. This strategic action is a result of our ongoing efforts to identify value-enhancing opportunities to better align our portfolio with consumer trade-up trends and to strengthen the financial profile of this business. Our remaining wine and spirits business will primarily consist of wines at a greater than $11 price point and will include fast-growing, high-margin power brands, like Kim Crawford, the number one Sauvignon Blanc in the U.S.; Meiomi, the number one U.S. Pinot Noir; SVEDKA Vodka, the number one imported vodka in the U.S. Meiomi, I already mentioned, the Prisoner, Robert Mondavi, Ruffino as well as iconic brands like Schrader. With the tighter focus on this powerful collection of consumer-loved brands, we will be able to accelerate growth while increasing brand awareness, consumer demand and household penetration. I’m confident that this optimized portfolio of wine and spirits brands will enable us to consistently deliver growth, exceeding the trends of the U.S. wine market, while migrating to an operating margin profile of 30%, a significant improvement from the 26% margin achieved for this business in fiscal 2019. In a minute, I’ll get into some of the exciting marketing initiatives we have planned for this year, but first, I’d like to highlight that several of these key brands achieved significant milestones and accomplishments this past year. We received Impact’s 2018 Hot Brand awards for Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Ruffino Prosecco and Robert Mondavi Private Selection. Our portfolio was also called out in the Beverage Information Group’s 2018 awards, where four of our brands achieved Fast Track status, recognizing their impressive growth. Those included Kim, Meiomi and the Prisoner. In addition, 10 of our brands were named Rising Stars and 7 more received Established Growth Brand awards. We also have a strong innovation pipeline planned for the coming year. Some of those keys are new product launches for Woodbridge Rosé and Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Rye Barrel-Aged Red Blend. We are already having excellent success with some of our recently launched innovations, including SVEDKA Rosé, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Rum Barrel-Aged Merlot, and Crafters Union, Wine in a Can. We will continue to expand our Bourbon Barrel-Aged innovation program, which has been a resounding success, selling over 1 million cases of volume in its first two years. This initiative has reinvigorated Robert Mondavi Private Selection while also becoming the foundation for some of our other innovations like Cooper & Thief. We’re also ramping up our consumer marketing efforts in the coming year. For the first time, we’re taking advantage of new sponsorship opportunities with the PGA, the U.S. Tennis Association and several NFL teams for Meiomi, Kim Crawford and Woodbridge brands, respectively. And our new SVEDKA marketing campaign, Bring Your Own Spirit, has been a resounding success, recently driving double-digit consumer takeaway growth trends in IRI channels. These efforts will help to achieve our goal of accelerating growth for a more premium collection of powerful wine and spirit brands. Now, let’s move on to our beer business. Constellation continues to be the cornerstone of growth in the U.S. beer industry, delivering 36 consecutive quarters of growth, dating back to the beginning of fiscal 2011. High-end beer is driving virtually all the U.S. beer category growth. And our beer business is the leader in high-end beer. For fiscal 2019, Constellation drove 40% of the U.S. high-end category growth and 100% of the import segment growth. We grew share in every U.S. sales region with accelerating trends on the West Coast, where we already have significant market share. There are very few industry segments where this level of growth has been sustained over this length of time. Fiscal 2019 also saw a monumental shift for the Corona brand family as it expanded its offerings from Extra and Light into a more comprehensive beer family with the launches of Premier nationally, Refresca in test markets and the expansion of Familiar. The Corona brand family generated 7% depletion growth for fiscal 2019, selling over 150 million cases, which positions Corona as the number one brand family in the high end. It is also expected to surpass Coors as the second largest brand family in the U.S. retail in short order. Corona Extra remains the engine of the Corona brand family and continues to be the number one, most loved beer among general market and Hispanic consumers. For fiscal 2020, incremental media investments are expected to ignite Corona’s core growth, including Corona draft, and can formats. As part of these efforts, we are increasing both English and Spanish language media across digital, social and TV, including heavy emphasis on the NFL and the NBA where Corona is expected to have a number one share of voice during the NBA playoffs and finals. Corona Premier was the number one new brand introduction in both volume and dollars last year and was larger than the number two and the number three product innovations combined. We are seeing strong repeat purchases with consumers motivated by the low-cal, low-carb benefits of Corona Premier’s premium image. Corona Premier is winning across all demographics, including our core Hispanic consumer base. To continue the momentum on Premiere in year two, we plan to increase our marketing investment double -digits across marketing channels including the launch of new creative for this brand. We are also significantly increasing support in both English and Spanish language media to reach Corona Premiere’s diverse drinker base. Corona Premiere’s national TV advertising focus will air in March through October with strong presence in sports programming, including sponsorships like the U.S. Open golf tournament, where we’ll be a proud sponsor through at least 2021. New incremental distribution opportunities for Corona Premier include the launch of 18-pack bottles to provide trade-up opportunities in larger format channels as well as the national launch of Corona Premier Draft to lean into the momentum of brand and to provide opportunity for consumers to sample in on-premise. And last year’s regional launch of Corona Familiar 6 and 12 packs, that brand became the fourth largest growth driver in the category and a top-10 high-end beer brand. The Corona Familiar 12-pack was the top package innovation in dollars and volume last year. And we believe this incremental runway for this brand, particularly with unacculturated Hispanic consumers. To fuel over additional growth, we recently launched Corona Familiar 24-pack bottles regionally to capture larger social occasions with current Hispanic consumers. For fiscal 2020, Corona Familiar’s expansion will be supported through double-digit increase in Spanish language TV as well as digital, social and in-store merchandising to drive incrementality at retail. Let’s move now to Casa Modelo. Modelo Especial is the leading growth engine in the entire U.S. beer market, posting double-digit depletion growth in 26 of the last 27 fiscal years. It is the fastest growing major beer in the industry, accounting for almost 40% of total category growth. Across the country, Modelo Especial is now the number one brand in three markets and the entire state of California and the number two brand in five additional major markets, growing double-digits in 41 of the 50 states. From a channel perspective, Modelo Especial continues to be the fastest growing brand in the on-premise with draft growing more than 25% last year. And in the off-premise, it became the number one selling beer in 7-Eleven, the biggest retailer and the biggest class of trade in beer. Modelo Especial has incremental momentum and its superior velocity should command more space at retail when compared with other top-10 brands. The number of Especial drinkers is up versus last year for both Hispanics as well as non-Hispanics, as we continue to grow both penetration and loyalty with our core Hispanic base and the general market consumer. We’ve seen an incredible 60% increase in general market drinkers over the past two years but we still have lots of opportunity as we estimate that less than 5% of the general market currently drinks Modelo. So, with this much momentum on Especial and the household penetration that still under indexes major brands, we believe that this brand has a long runway for growth. For fiscal 2020, we expect to make our biggest ever investment in marketing support behind Modelo. We plan to continue to engage our core Hispanic consumer by increasing our investment in Spanish language TV and we’ll be a major player in live sports, led by soccer, rounded out by strong presence in the NFL, Major League Baseball and NBA games. We will be upping our game on NFL Sundays and will strengthen our college football presence with the new addition of NCAA football for the first time. We plan to complement our live sports activity with significant investment in top rated entertainment programming across Univision and Telemundo while increasing our digital and social media activities as well. We will also be launching literally one of our biggest new items with the rollout of the Modelo 32-ounce bottle as the single-serve segment continues to be on fire. It also offers a trade-up opportunity as almost 75% of the volume in this 32-ounce format is held by domestic low-end brands that are in decline. Let’s turn to Pacifico, our up-and-comer brand of our portfolio, selling almost 10 million cases this past year. The brand is attracting new drinkers, especially outside its core California market and has seen double-digit growth in many of these markets through increased awareness with the national expansion of Live Life Anchors Up campaign. For fiscal 2020, we plan to push Pacifico aggressively through increased investment behind national media and sponsorships as well as expansion in digital, via Facebook and Instagram. We’re increasing our national TV presence for additional engagement with consumers on key entertainment properties, like The daily show as well as live sports like the NBA playoffs, the NHL playoffs and Major League Baseball. And with more than 50 million Americans now participating in action sports, Pacifico is continuing its partnership with ESPN as the official beer sponsor of action sports’ biggest events, the summer and winter X Games. We’ve added a new Pacifico partnership with the U.S. ski and snowboard team, and we will be the official beer sponsor of the Burton U.S. Open of Snowboarding. The growth opportunities though don’t end there. Innovation is the second piece of the equation. It gives us confidence in our high single-digit top-line growth expectations for fiscal 2020. We’re building a strong pipeline of new, innovative products, leveraging the power of our existing brands to fill gaps in our portfolio and complement our core franchises. We will continue to invest in early stage emerging brands that are both scalable with high growth and high margin potential. Our goal is to drive sustainable, high-end share growth through consumer-driven innovation that recruits new drinkers, expands occasions and adds value to the category. But, we will do it in a very disciplined and focused way. During fiscal 2020, we’ll extend the Corona master brand to take advantage of consumer trends with the national launch of Corona Refresca. Corona Refresca brings a completely new drinker to the Corona franchise and allows us to carve out a space within the large and growing FMB category that’s anchored in Corona’s carefree lifestyle. Beginning this month, we’re launching Corona Refresca nationally, in guava lime, and passionfruit lime 6 packs, plus a new variety 12-pack with the added flavor of coconut lime. This year, we’re also testing Wildish which is to be introduced as a seltzer in the Northeast and as a tea in one to two additional test markets. It is being positioned as a platform to capture the opportunity driven by the health and wellness trend. And then, there’s western standard, one of my personal favorites. This offers a high-end fashionable sessionable, full flavored beer that will be available in five states, this coming year. Alera and El Grito [ph] are products specifically developed to meet the needs of the fast-growing Hispanic consumer. Alera is an FMB that was created for bicultural and acculturated Hispanic and general market women, and will be offered in four test markets this year, while El Grito [ph] is a newly created beer that will be part of our planned Four Corners expansion. Now turning to the operations side of our beer business. As planned, we have completed the 30-million-hectoliter capacity expansion, at Nava, which brings our existing capacity, including Obregon to 34 million hectoliters. This marks a monumental achievement over the past five years to provide ample supply to meet the growing demand for our beer portfolio, while completing the project on time and on budget. Furnace number five is underway at Nava and expected to be producing glass by the end of this calendar year. And we will continue to make progress ahead of schedule with the 5-million-hectoliter expansion at Obregon, which I highlighted last quarter. The Mexicali capacity expansion continues with expected completion by fiscal 202023. As a reminder, upon completion, this planned expansion project will represent roughly 10% of our beer capacity in Mexico. To sum it up, I am excited about the strong, high single-digit growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2020. As you can see, we have excellent opportunities to grow our business through a combination of enhanced distribution and consumer innovation across our portfolio. And now just a few comments about our investment in Canopy Growth, which continues to be a leading share in the Canadian recreational cannabis market, supported by solid product inventories, a national sales force and the rollout of value-add products, including soft gel caps, oral sprays, and pre-rolls. Throughout calendar 2019, we expect Canopy to benefit from favorable changes in the recreational Canadian market as brick and mortar retail stores come online and stimulate new growth in larger provinces like Ontario. Canopy is also preparing to deliver incremental value-added recreational products, including vapes, beverages and else, which are related to come on line in the fall of this year in Canada. We share Canopy’s view that a significant opportunity exists going forward for the inclusion of cannabis as an ingredient in future consumer products and medical therapies. Canopy’s current patent portfolio includes more than 35 issued patents and 195 patient applications, including those related to a unique process it has developed to produce cannabis-based beverages, which are expected to be available when Canadian regulations open up this fall. So, in closing, I hope your key takeaways from my comments this morning are as follows. One, I am confident in the ability of our beer business to generate industry-leading, high-single-digit growth trends for fiscal 2020 with the initiatives we already have underway for this year. Two, fiscal 2020 will be a dynamic year for our wine and spirits business. A tighter focus on high-performing brands strengthens the business and strategically positions it for future growth and success. Three, we are working closely with Canopy Growth on a focused long-term strategy to win markets and form factors that matter, while paving a clear path to profitability. We are confident in their ability to achieve the previously communicated run-rate of $1 billion next year. And with that, I would like to now turn the call over to David who will review our financial results for fiscal 2019 and provide guidance for the coming year. David?
David Klein: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. In fiscal 2019, we grew net sales and comparable basis EPS by 7% and produced a three-year comparable basis EPS CAGR of 20%. In addition, we generated over $2.2 billion of operating cash flow, returned over $1 billion of cash to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, and completed our incremental investments in Canopy Growth. Let’s look at full-year fiscal 2019 performance in more detail where I’ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results, starting with beer. Net sales grew 12%, primarily due to volume growth of 10% and favorable pricing. Depletion growth for the year came in at 9%, depletion growth was lower than shipment growth, primarily due to year-end timing as poor weather conditions, especially on the West Coast, muted our February depletion result, after experiencing strong depletion trends during the winter holiday months of December and January. As a result, distributor inventory levels finished the year higher than expected. Beer gross margin increased 10 basis points to 54.4% as favorability in pricing was essentially offset by higher COGS, which were primarily related to transportation cost headwinds. Given the challenging cost environment, I’m pleased with this result, as our operational cost and efficiency initiatives helped offset the impact of other cost increases, like depreciation. Marketing, as a percent of net sales, increased 30 basis points to 9.3%, reflecting incremental investment in support of successful innovation activities. This result came in 20 basis points lower than our previous 9.5% target as we tactically balanced our marketing investments. As a result of the above mentioned factors, operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 39.3%, which is best-in-class amongst North American brewers. Moving to wine and spirits. Shipment volumes were down 1% and net sales were flat, reflecting a slight pricing benefit. Shipment volume ran ahead of depletion volume for the year. Operating margin decreased 70 basis points to 26.5%, primarily due to higher COGS and unfavorable mix, partially offset by favorable pricing. The higher COGS primarily reflect increased freight and transportation costs. Corporate expenses increased $32 million, primarily in support of growth and technology initiatives. Comparable basis interest expense for the year increased 17% to $387 million. This reflects approximately $55 million in interest expense related to the funding for our incremental investment in Canopy Growth in November of 2018. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the year moves down a percentage point to 18% which was in line with our guidance. Now let’s review Q4 results. Beer net sales increased 9%, primarily due to volume growth of 8% and favorable pricing. This net sales result came in ahead of our previous expectation due to the shipment and depletion timing items I mentioned earlier. Beer gross margin increased 50 basis points to 53.8%, primarily due to pricing and FX benefits, partially offset by higher transportation costs. Marketing as a percent of net sales was 6.4% or 160 basis points lower than Q4 last year. Primarily, as a result of these factors, operating margin increased 240 basis points to 40.5%. Wine and spirit shipment volume was down 9% and net sales were down 8%. While Q4 shipments ran below depletions, we finished fiscal 2019 with shipments outpacing depletions. Operating margin increased 60 basis points to 27.7%, primarily due to benefits from lower SG&A and favorable pricing, partially offset by higher COGS, driven largely by increased grape and transportation costs. We recorded $17 million of equity loss on a comparable basis or $0.06 per share related to our Canopy investment. As a reminder, we’re recognizing our share of Canopy’s earnings on a two-month lag. As such, we recognize our share of Canopy earnings for only two months, November and December, which is included in Canopy’s third quarter fiscal 2019 results. In our Q4 reported basis financial results, we recognized an additional $1.2 billion pretax net gain from the change in fair value of the Canopy warrants and convertible notes, bringing the total pretax net gain on our Canopy fair value investments to almost $2 billion for fiscal 2019. We also recorded a $108 million impairment charge related to the trademark value of Ballast Point. While this investment has not met expectations as the craft marketplace has slowed since our acquisition, it has increased our leadership position in the high-end of U.S. beer, and provided us an innovation in operating platform in the craft and specialty category to contribute to future growth. These items were excluded from our comparable basis financial results. Moving to fiscal 2019 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated $1.4 billion compared to $874 million last year. Operating cash flow totaled $2.2 billion, up 16%, primarily driven by beer earnings growth. Operating cash flow came in below our expectation, primarily due to cash flow underperformance in the wine and spirits business. CapEx totaled $886 million, which was 16% below last year’s spend. CapEx spending was favorable versus our previous expectation, primarily due to timing. Given the accelerated pace of the 5 million hectoliter expansion at the Obregon facility, we’ve been able to shift out the timing of some of the spend, related to our Mexicali brewery build. Moving to our fiscal 2020 P&L and free cash flow outlook. For fiscal 2020, we expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $8.50 to $8.80. This excludes Canopy equity earnings and assumes the transaction to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business for $1.7 billion will close at the end of Q1. Primarily as a result of this transaction, we expect fiscal 2020, wine and spirits’ net sales to decrease to 25% to 30% and operating income to decrease 30% to 35%. During fiscal 2019, for the businesses sold, shipment volume was 28 million cases; net sales was $1.1 billion; and gross profit after marketing was $389 million. We have also identified approximately $130 of standard costs resulting from the transaction. The Company’s developing plans to eliminate these costs during the fiscal 2020 to fiscal 202021 time frame. We currently expect to realize $35 million to $55 million of these cost reductions during fiscal 2020 and have factored them into our fiscal 2020 guidance. For Q2 through Q4 of fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2019, the shipment volume, net sales and gross profit after marketing cost for the businesses being sold totaled 21 million cases, $852 million and $303 million, respectively. When you exclude these Q2 through Q4 amounts from our fiscal 2019 wine and spirits results, our remaining wine and spirits business is targeting net sales growth of low to mid single digits and operating income growth of high single digits for fiscal 2020. We expect to incur a restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in connection with the cost reduction plan that’s being developed. We’ve not reflected this change in our fiscal 2020 reported basis guidance. In addition, we have not included any potential net gain or loss in our fiscal 2020 reported basis guidance. Both items will be excluded from our fiscal 2020 comparable basis guidance. We expect most of the wine and spirits shipment planning benefit for fiscal 2019, that I mentioned earlier, to reverse in Q1 fiscal 2020. As a result, Q1 fiscal 2020 wine and spirits net sales and EBIT is expected to decrease 10% and 20%, respectively. For fiscal 2020, our beer business is targeting net sales and operating income growth in the range of 7% to 9%, and our full-year operating margin to approximate 39%. Our projections include 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our import portfolio. We expect gross margin to be flattish as cost inflation headwinds primarily related to glass, raw materials, transportation and labor cost in Mexico are expected to be mostly offset from product pricing and productivity initiatives. As mentioned earlier, beer marketing expense as a percent of net sales finished fiscal 2019 at 9.3%. For fiscal 2020, we expect marketing as a percent of net sales to increase slightly around 20 basis points to 9.5% to support the innovation and brand growth initiatives outlined earlier by Bill. We expect some of the beer shipment timing benefit that we recognized at the end of fiscal 2019 to reverse in Q1 fiscal 2020. As a result, Q1 fiscal 2020 beer net sales and operating income growth is expected to increase mid single digits. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $420 million to $430 million. This includes approximately $105 million of incremental interest expense associated with the financing of our November 2018 Canopy investment. This brings the total Canopy-related interest expense to $160 million.  Net proceeds from the wine and spirits transaction will be used to pay down debt. And an interest expense reduction of approximately $40 million has been factored into our fiscal 2020 guidance for this item. Our tax rate is expected to approximate 17%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at $195 million. This guidance assumes no share repurchases for fiscal 2020. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest is expected to be in the range of $30 million to $40 million. I would also note that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. We expect fiscal 2020 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and CapEx of $800 million to $900 million. This includes approximately $600 million of CapEx for our Mexico Beer operations expansion, including investments in the Obregon and Mexicali breweries, and a fifth glass furnace at the Nava glass plant. This expansion CapEx spend is below our previous fiscal 2020 guidance as we’ve shifted out the timing of spend for Mexicali. For fiscal 2021 and 2022, we expect total Company CapEx to be in the range of $700 million to $900 million per year. This includes $200 million to $400 million of maintenance CapEx across the total Constellation business. In fiscal 2021 and 2022, we expect beer expansion project CapEx to moderate from the $600 million level in fiscal 2020 as we work to complete the buildouts of Obregon and Mexicali. While our fiscal 2020 comparable basis EPS is moving down due to the wine and spirits divestiture, we remain committed to growing our dividend and have increased our quarterly dividend slightly. As summarized in the earnings release, fiscal 2019 comparable basis diluted EPS excluding Canopy equity earnings totaled $9.34 per share. As mentioned earlier, we expect comparable basis, diluted EPS excluding Canopy equity earnings to be in the range of $8.50 to $8.80 per share. Canopy’s business is rapidly evolving and their financial results will likely be volatile as they invest behind their growth opportunities. Additionally, as Canopy’s planning process for the next fiscal year is ongoing and the Canopy equity earnings we recorded in our income statements are non-cash, we’ve not factored Canopy equity earnings into our fiscal 2020 guidance. This will allow us and our investors to focus on the underlying performance of our core business. In closing, the actions we are taking in fiscal 2020 will provide us a more premium portfolio of wine and spirits with the stronger growth and financial profile. This, along with the opportunities we plan to capture to increase our leadership position in high-end beer has us very excited about the future. With that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey. Good morning, guys. So, clearly, a lot of areas in the beer depletion growth within fiscal Q4 with the great start that you mentioned, and then the weaker end of the quarter dampened, I guess literally by weather. So, I’d love to get more detail on if you think the softness in February was just weather-related or is there any other factors that may linger and any update on march, if you’re expecting sort of if you’re now back with that full -year trajectory that you’re expecting? And then, just second on Premier on the beer depletion front. I guess, what level of growth are you expecting out of that brand in fiscal 2020, and what gives you confidence that it can build and grow in year two? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure. Yes. The entire scenario around the slight weakening at the end of the fourth quarter was driven by weather. The last two weeks in state of California, which as we all know is our biggest market, was literally wet, soaking wet. In fact, only 1% of the state of California today is in drought conditions and just a few years ago that number was in 90 plus range. So, we literally saw everything dampen in the last couple of weeks. You combine that with the polar vortex that we had in the northern tier of states, and it was a literal weather mess for the last couple of weeks of our fiscal. We are, though, very pleased with the start of our march and we feel that it’s consistent with the guidance that we just provided. Relative to your question on Premier, we expect Premier growth to be in the 30% to 45% range this coming year. So, we see significant upside in that brand beyond the results that we saw this past year. As most of you know, Premier virtually doubled what our expectations were in its first year and we expect that acceleration to continue.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open. 
Lauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. I wanted to talk a little bit about innovation. So, a lot of activity in the ABA space broadly. So, first, could you talk a little Refresca from test markets, is it largely incremental? But how big those FMBs when they launched as they hit -- they can hit really big, but sort of trajectory generally speaking for a lot of these brands has been year two or year three is a real struggle. So, as you look for planning out the future of Refresca, how do you manage that kind of boom-bust scenario and what are your general expectations for year one? Then secondarily, you mentioned Alera. So, how does that intersect with Corona Refresca in terms of positioning and marketing, knowing that’s still just in test market? Thanks. 
Bill Newlands: Sure. Let me cover those. Refresca, in our test markets, had tremendous incrementality. In fact, it was even better than Premier was. So, we are very excited about the opportunity to put a strong recognized brand, like Corona packaged as Refresca into a separate area of the store, both on your retail shelves and in the cold box. It appeals to a much broader demographic than what our core beer business does. And we think it opens up a wonderful vehicle with the strength of the carefree lifestyle that Corona represents for our business. Alera, on the other hand is much more focused to Hispanic women, also multicultural women, but Hispanic women specifically. And that will be somewhat different than what we see as the demographic profile around Refresca. As you know Alera will only be in test market. We have a very defined approach to innovation where we test and learn in year one; and as we see success, we expand. Much like we did with Premier, we’re doing the same thing with Refresca and we will do that assessment with Alera and El Grito [ph] and things of that nature as well, so that we have a focused approach and disciplined approach to our innovation agenda.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is open.
Gerald Pascarelli: Hi. This is Gerald Pascarelli on for Vivien. Thanks very much for taking the question. So, just kind of building on Refresca, the national rollout, obviously encouraging and bringing a sale to the market. As you guys look to build out your portfolio, are there any gaps that you see that you might want to invest in and kind of enter, not just across beer but across spirits as well?
Bill Newlands: Sure. We obviously do a lot in our -- through our Chief Growth Officer, and assessing what consumer opportunities and segments are available to us. That’s frankly how we got to Premier, that’s frankly how we got to Refresca and how we’ve gotten to Alera and other things that we are testing. We certainly see an opportunity in higher-end sessionable domestic beer. That’s why Western Standard is being tested in five western states this year. I personally am very excited about the opportunity around that. And it’s a bit of one of those, what I would describe as, category blurring. It is a lager that stand has time in high west barrels. So, it has the benefits and it’s really what we’re calling a Saloon Lager. It’s a great opportunity to leverage existing capabilities that we have but also put us into a new area as consumers continue to trade up. We’re also evaluating and will continue to evaluate new things. I used the example of our Bourbon Barrel-Aged wine programs, which as I mentioned in my remarks, have generated over 1 million cases from zero and under two years. So, we will continue to find those niche opportunities that we believe are big, impactful and sustainable, whether it’d be in our beer business or in our wine and spirits business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Bonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning. I actually had a question on your update -- or your FY2020 EPS guidance. It excludes the expected dilution from Canopy and I think it appears a bit low, so possibly conservative. So, I guess I was hoping you could touch on that and your level of conviction. Then, I was hoping to get a sense of your level of visibility with Canopy and if you have any sense of when equity earnings from Canopy will inflect positive. And then, I think earlier, you have mentioned that you were expecting that to happen by the end of this year. So, I just wanted to confirm that. And I also wanted to understand, you mentioned that you’re not going to include Canopy in your FY guidance. So, just wanted to confirm that that continues through this year, and how you think about it in the out years, such that Canopy is no longer a drag on earnings, will you possibly start to include it then? Thanks.
David Klein: Yes. So, let me take it kind of in two parts. So, on our base level guidance, Bonnie, our guidance is really out there for beer, in line with our medium-term growth algorithm, in the 7 to 9% range kind of centering on that 39% operating margin which we think is aggressive but achievable, and again, in line with our medium-term expectations. For wine and spirits, once we have closed on our transaction, we have a base underlying business that we think, as a result of more focus from ourselves internally where we can apply our ability to drive connectivity with our consumers, better performance in our operations, maybe some pricing along the way that we’ll be able to deliver over time mid-single digit growth and achieve the 30% operating margins that Bill talked about. The headwind there really for FY20 for us is the stranded cost removal. And so, we’ve baked into our guidance between $35 million and $55 million of cost take out of the total of $130 million. Maybe the reason why we couldn’t be more aggressive with that number is related to timing in the year when the costs come out -- for some of the costs. And the fact that some of the costs will be coming out of COGS and COGS overhead which will take time to come through our P&L and won’t likely show up until next year. So, we think the story stays completely on our medium term guidance. We’d just have to work through some of the near-term work. Shifting to Canopy, we still are confident, as Bill called out that the Canopy business will be generating over $1 billion in run rate net sales at the end of their upcoming fiscal year. We expect to be able to see profitability out of the markets that they were in when we did the transaction, so meaning Canada, medical and rec as well as some international medical markets. We would still expect to be able to see that come through our numbers in FY 2021. So, our view on Canopy hasn’t changed. But, let me just touch on guidance or the like thereof. I’m personally disappointed that we weren’t able to get to be able to provide guidance for the fiscal year on Canopy. But, there are couple of factors that played into that. The first is, the planning process at Canopy isn’t completed. In fact, the Board and the management team will be going through their plans over the next couple of weeks. Secondly, we’re seeing changes literally as we speak, because this week brick and mortar sales started to take place in the province of Ontario. We still don’t have clarity on CBD products, how they’ll be regulated in the U.S. And of course, we expect different form factors to come on line in Canada later in the year, but that timing could move around a little bit. So, we looked at all of these factors and we felt that we would probably just make things less clear to our investors, if we tried to provide some very broad guidance range that would take into account all of these factors. And in any event, we’re going to show Constellation ex-Canopy equity and earnings in our results. And so, that’s what we provided to you today. We do expect at some point to be able to provide, at least a broad range of guidance for Canopy; we were just unable to do it today. And since I’ve already missed on that commitment, I’m not going to commit on when we’ll be able to do that, but we’ll get there as soon as we can.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Judy Hong: Thank you. Good morning. So, I guess, my first question is just one clarification. David, your comment about the mid-single digit sales growth in beer in Q1, can you just clarify how much under shipment you are expecting in Q1 specifically? And then, my broader question is really on your marketing investment. So, throughout fiscal 2019, it seems like that number has come down a little bit. You talked about tactically balancing the investment. I just want to get a little bit more color on what you meant by that. And then, when you look at fiscal 2020, obviously a lot of innovations and a lot of activities even on the core. So, I guess, I’m just wondering if you are looking to grow efficiencies in terms of marketing. Are you looking at that in sort of the different ways or is sort of the return you’re getting, perhaps sort of influencing how much you are spending on some of these brands at this point.
David Klein: Okay. So, in terms of Q1, Judy, let me just kind of step back a little and talk about the ships and depletion growth rate in balances over the last couple of years. So, in FY18 depletes grew faster than ships and in FY19 ships grew faster than the depletes. We would expect in FY20 that we’ll end up with a year where the depletes grow little bit faster than ships, just as a general comment. And by the way, the actual volume deltas between these, really is in -- is small number of cases, call it 1 million or 2 million cases a year. And so, we just have different growth rates as a result of different numerators between ships and depletes. So, in the first quarter, we have an imbalance to unwind. That gets us to the mid single digits even while we are on target -- mid single digit growth in ships in the first quarter even while we are on target for our full-year depletion growth rate. So, again, just timing. And as Bill mentioned that imbalance really happened because of the way we plan out our shipments versus our depletions, happens within a 10-day to 2week sort of window. And the last couple of weeks, the February depletions just slowed down for reasons Bill described. Shifting to the marketing question, our philosophy really hasn’t changed. I would say that our marketing team headed by Jim Sabia does an outstanding job of both getting really good returns on our marketing investment while they’re squeezing as hard as they can on the dollars that are applied to non-working marketing. Our returns haven’t diminished. And so, we remain committed to driving the real value add marketing spend. What really happens is, we believe that we should be spending about 9.5% on marketing. And just as a result of timing of ad placement and that sort of thing, we ended up a little bit light in FY19 but we expect to be that in 9.5% range in FY20.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Steve Powers: Hey, guys. Good morning, thanks. So, I guess, first, just -- I wanted to just confirm that you’re still holding to your CAGNY comments of roughly 10% EPS CAGR off the reported by 9.28 base that you just finished in 2019, just a clarification there. And my real question is on the wine sale, and how -- just a question on how you’re thinking about the valuation. On a trailing basis, it looks like the transaction was done at about 6 times EBITDA, which is more or less in line with some of your prior comments. I guess, I was a little surprised in that context with the magnitude of the strength of overheads, because on a contribution margin basis, it looks like Gallo is paying closer to 4 times. So, just a little bit more color around how you thought about that. And just one last, just clarification, the restructuring charge is in not in your outlook, but I’m assuming that any cash outlays related to that effort are in your free cash outlook and just hoping you could confirm that. Thanks.
David Klein: Yes. So, I’ll start with that one because that’s easy. Yes, anticipated restructuring cash cost we have include in our cash outlook. However, as you highlighted, we excluded that from our numbers from a P&L standpoint. And so, now, I’ll go back to your first question. Yes. We are still on track for a 10% EPS growth. Remember that that guidance was really on a three to five-year basis. But our models, even as we roll our plan into it and have final FY19 numbers, we continue to support 10% EPS growth using FY19 as a base. So, now, let’s talk about the transaction value itself. So, I think we called out in our release some of the details about the contribution after marketing spend. If you look at the brands on a trailing basis, yes, you’re in the 6ish range, between 6 and 7 on a trailing basis. These brands are declining mid to high single digits. So, on forward basis, you’re more in line with 7 or slightly above 7. We also have a fair amount -- most of the can that we sold is branded can. We also have a couple of ancillary businesses such as our concentrate business and our polyphenolics business that were included in the sale as well because they actually reside at the Mission Bell facility. So, when we look at the transaction on a multiple basis, we're comfortable with it. When we look at the transaction on a DCF basis, we're comfortable with it. And on an accounting basis, we are comfortable as well. So, I think the important thing though, the takeaway from the transaction is the strategic merit for Constellation and being able to direct to their attention to these higher margin brands that remain in our portfolio. We believe that if we put the sort of thinking and maybe discipline that we've applied to our very-focused portfolio in beer to this portfolio, and wine and spirits, we can have some pretty impressive results. And that's really the point of the transaction. It's more the strategic merits than the economic merits, but we think it was a fair deal all around.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Robert Ottenstein: Just one quick point of clarification. Have you finished the sales in the wine and spirits business, is this what you had intended, is it done? And then, my real question, can you talk a little bit more about the potential for Pacifico, how you are sizing, how big that brand could be? And what you're seeing in terms of incrementality on that brand?
Bill Newlands: We view this as the optimization effort in its entirety, for your first question. The second question about Pacifico, we were very excited around Pacifico, it has grown double -- grew double digits this past year outside of the core California base as the advertising campaign that we had associated with it kicked in and worked very well. I think we're going to continue to see this brand be a double-digit growth driver for us going forward as it extends itself. As I said in my prepared remarks, we have extended some of our sponsorship opportunities with this brand, and we'll continue to do sort of the edgy ex-gain type of approaches that we think Pacifico has become known for, and we think it's got some continued success to come.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Andrea Teixeira: Hi. Thank you. Hello, everybody. So, my question is on beer. So Bill mentioned -- Bill, you mentioned that you expect a mere to have about 35% growth embedded in fiscal '20 guide. So what is the total assumption for the Corona family as a whole and for Modelo insight guidance?
Bill Newlands: Our expectations is that the Corona family after growing 7% during this past year will probably be in the mid-single-digit range for this coming year. Premier, we do expect, as I said earlier, to be a significant growth driver as part of that and we expect the overall brand family to be in the mid-single-digit range.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy: A quick housekeeping question for Dave and then one for Bill. So David, housekeeping after-tax proceeds in the $1.7 billion sale of wine assets and then whether you had any flexibility to buy back the stock as opposed to paying down debt? And then Bill for you on pricing, just given the protracted volume declines in the industry over long period of time, do you see any potential that the big domestic brewers become less rational at some point? How do you sort of handicap the possibility of that and potential implications for your portfolio? Thanks for both of those.
David Klein: So, Kevin, we are not prepared to really talk about the after-tax proceeds, but it will be a fairly efficient transaction for us from that perspective. We do intend to repurchase stock, as we've said before as soon as we are comfortably within our targeted leverage ratio range of three to four times. We haven't built anything into our guidance. We'll see how the year unfolds, but we would very much like to be buying our stock at this point and we'll do so as quickly as we can.
Bill Newlands: Relative to your question on pricing, I mean, we continue to feel as we have that there is 1% to 2% pricing within our beer business on an ongoing basis. As you know our brands have strong consumer demand attached to those and we continue to feel that opportunity is going to be there for us as we continue into the foreseeable future. Relative to -- and I don't know if that was uniquely to beer I would say, we are putting some of the same capabilities on our remaining wine and spirit business that we have put on our beer through revenue management and we expect to see both mix and pricing benefits coming out of our wine and spirit business, which quite frankly we had been relatively unable to get in the recent past with our remaining portfolio, which we think is much more conducive to pricing and mix benefits.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Bryan Spillane: Just two quick ones. David, do you've any sense on what depreciation and amortization is sort of ongoing asset divestitures?
David Klein: I don't have that off the top of my head, but clearly that's something that we can provide at some point.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from...
David Klein: I think, Bryan -- sorry, she didn't give you chance for your second question.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Shannon, can you let Bryan back on the line, please?
Operator: Sure, one moment. Bryan, your line is open.
Bryan Spillane: And just a question on beer margins, David, can you just walk through a little bit more color on some of the pressure points on cost, on headwinds and cost of goods. I guess like glass and labor inflation that type of thing? And just how fixed that is, as you're kind of through the course of this year, meaning is there up chance or how much volatility could there be in that cost basket?
David Klein: So, Bryan, if I knew you we're going to ask a beer margin question, we wouldn't have got you back on line. So yes, I think I've said this before that we're seeing labor inflation in Mexico in the 4% to 6% range, we're seeing cost contractual cost of glass increasing in the 4% to 6% range, in particular, coming out of our joint venture, which is producing about 55% to 60% of the glass that we use. We expect to see transportation headwinds in likely the high single digit range. We do expect to have some benefit clearly from pricing. But in order to hold our gross margins, not only do we have to get benefits from pricing and possibly FX, we have to also deliver on productivity improvements, which the team is diligently working toward. So I think all in all, given the sorts of headwinds that we're seeing and the pricing environment that we're anticipating with this 1% to 2%, price increase activity we feel pretty good about being able to have flattish gross margins during the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.
Timothy Ramey: Good morning. About the wine portfolio in 2021 kind of skip ahead and take this transition year out, have you modeled what net revenue per case might look like versus the current portfolio? Can you help us to understand where that was and where that's going?
Bill Newlands: We are obviously running models as we speak about what we expect our remainco portfolio. As you would expect in a transaction of the size, the final dimension of what was going to be sold has just been recently completed. So, a lot of work is now being done on our forward looking wine piece. What I would say is this. I think, you should expect it to be significantly higher than what it has been, because as you know, the vast weighting of the portfolio that has been sold is that reflecting under $11 on a retail price basis. So, the overall average out-the-door price point for our remainco brands will be significantly higher than it was. And we'll be able to give you a more concrete answer to that as we get the work done.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean King with UBS. Your line is open.
Sean King: Hi. Thanks for the question. Yes. The $0.75 dividend came in lower than at least our expectation. Are you thinking any differently about the, I guess the cadence or composition of the $4.5 billion return to shareholders over the next three years?
David Klein: No, not at all. We feel really bullish about that, Sean, what -- we've been targeting a 30% payout rate at our business and as a result of the disposition of some of the wine brands as our net income came down are actual at that 30% number, our payout would have come down. We wanted to keep it in line with where it was last year. And quite honestly, show a slight increase, so that's what we offered up. It really is more in keeping on track at that 30% target, more than it is any kind of indication around comfort level with being able to return the $4.5 billion we remain absolutely committed to that.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question is from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge. Your line is open.
Brett Cooper: Thanks. Two questions. What do you guys expect to get in terms of incremental placement, as you go into the spring with the new products that you're rolling out? And then as you're putting more products, more packages in there, how do you guys think about driving velocity growth for the total beer business and the importance of doing that?
Bill Newlands: Sure. As we've shared it at prior discussions, we believe that as our algorithm for growth that roughly 50% of our growth profile will come out of increased distribution with an increase of the innovation agenda to 30% and then various other miscellaneous things. So, we continue to feel that there remains a lot of opportunity in distribution as well as in formats like cans and draft and so forth that we alluded to earlier on the call. Relative to velocity, as you know, a lot of work has been done by our -- in our space management approach, that we have definitively proven improves the overall results in a beer section when our shopper first approach is undertaken. We are radically increasing the number of retailers that are engaged with this particular program, which we expect to have a significant and helpful velocity improvement, based on improving the overall space in the beer section. So, we believe with that particular element will be helpful not only for us but for the overall category, and we're excited about the opportunity around it.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill Newlands for closing remarks.
Bill Newlands: Great. Thanks very much, much appreciate all of you joining Patty, David and me today. Obviously, we're excited about our organic growth prospects for the coming year, and we're already hard at work, as you would expect to deliver these opportunities while continuing to invest in our brands and in our operations. We look forward to speaking with all of you again in late June, when we share the results of our first quarter for our new fiscal year. Before then, we certainly hope that you will choose some of our fine products for your spring celebrations including Cinco and Memorial Day weekend. Speaking of Cinco, look for us at the New York Stock Exchange, as we will officially kick off the summer selling season by ringing that closing bell. So, thanks again everyone, much appreciate your time. And have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-01-09 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands’ Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn Urlaub: Thanks, Brian. Good morning and welcome to Constellation’s third quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our CEO, Bill Newlands, our President and COO and David Klein, our CFO. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements that we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Rob, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help us to end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now here's Rob.
Rob Sands: Thank you, Patty. Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and got the chance to enjoy some of our fine products during the holiday season. As I reflect on 2018, I'm reminded that I'm very fortunate to be part of the exciting dynamic at ever-changing beverage alcohol industry. I'm also proud of the fact that Constellation continues to be one of the best growth stories in the industry, led by our remarkable high-end beer business, which is generating double-digit top and bottom line growth. Overall, our business is strong and has excellent prospects for the future and for future growth. And that's why I believe it's the right time to hand over my CEO responsibilities to Bill Newlands, while I assume the role of Executive Chair at the beginning of our next fiscal year on March 1. Bill has an excellent understanding and appreciation for the values and strategy that have made Constellation Brands one of the top-performing S&P 500 companies over the last decade. Since joining Constellation in 2015, Bill has made a significant impact on our company, as he's assumed increasing levels of responsibility finding ways to leverage our unique capabilities as a leader in total beverage alcohol and reinvigorating our innovation engine. The company is in good hands with Bill at the helm, and I look forward to continuing to collaborate on key strategic initiatives as I transition to my position as Executive Chair. As such, Bill will be taking the lead with David and the IR team on all future investment calls – investor calls and meetings. Over the years, I've valued and appreciated the ideas, suggestions, and feedbacks I've received from the investment community, and I'd like to thank you for your ongoing support. I'd like to mention that my brother Richard and I recently acquired in excess of 1 million shares, to take advantage of the tremendous value that Constellation's stock currently represents. With that said and as a precursor to my transition to Executive Chair, I believe it's the appropriate time to turn the call over to Bill, who will review our business results for the quarter. Bill?
Bill Newlands: Thank you, Rob. I'm honored to be selected as Constellation's next CEO and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity to lead one of the best growth stories in the CPG category. As many of you are aware, in Rob's tenure as CEO, Constellation has delivered an incredible total shareholder return of almost 800%. Rob, that's quite a legacy and certainly a tough act to follow, so congratulations to you. Let's now turn to the business. I have five key takeaways that I would like to emphasize on this morning's call. Number one, Constellation's beer business continues to outperform the U.S. beer market by a wide double-digit margin. Number two; we have plenty of beer capacity in Mexico to meet the incredible demand for our products well into the future. Number three; we're disappointed with the performance of our wine and spirits business, as we're facing challenges with the low end of the portfolio. As a result, we've changed our guidance for the year and have taken action by pursuing strategic alternatives to optimize the value of that business. I personally have assumed short-term responsibility for the business to accelerate this effort, and we expect to have more say in the coming months as a final outcome is determined Number four, Canopy Growth is committed to achieving their CAD 1 billion revenue run rate target within the next 18 months. And number five, we plan to provide $4.5 billion in cash returns to shareholders within the next three years in the form of share repurchases and dividends. So let's take a moment to discuss each of these points in the order that I outlined them starting with beer. High-end beer is driving virtually all the U.S. beer category growth and Constellation as the leader in the high-end beer is driving a significant portion of that growth. As a matter of fact, in the month of December, which is the largest month of our fourth quarter, beer depletions accelerated to a rate that was ahead of our fiscal year-to-date growth rate of 9%. Our beer business marked the highlight of our third quarter driven by Corona and Modelo brand families, which continued to be fueled by strong velocities, excellent distribution gains, and highly incremental innovation. Corona Premier, Corona Familiar, and Modelo Especial achieved winning spots as the top three high-end U.S. beer industry share gainers for the quarter, while Constellation's overall beer business was the most significant share gainer in the U.S. beer market during this time frame. Modelo Especial continues to have incredible momentum as the number one growth driver in U.S. beer and it is now the number one beer overall in the state of California. Strong NFL media support during the quarter for this brand provided the reach to expand market share with general market consumers while maintaining its leading position with the growing Hispanic consumer base. The Corona brand families’ depletion growth has roughly doubled to 8% this fiscal year fueled by better than expected performance from our fiscal year 2019 innovation initiatives, Corona Premier and Familiar. And we continue to see growing household penetration with Hispanic and non-Hispanic consumers for our Corona brands. I'm extremely pleased with Premiers' best-in-class incrementality which is driving value for distributors and retailers as a trade-up option for consumers in the growing better for you space. Corona Premier has already become one of the top growth contributors in the high-end and we believe Premier continues to have ample runway for growth, as its sourcing much of its volume from the more than 1 billion cases of declining domestic lights. Corona Extra continues to provide the strong foundation needed for the portfolio to grow with strong brand equity as the number one most loved brand among Hispanic and total population drinkers aged 21 to 54. There also continues to be plenty of runway for future Corona Extra growth with incremental contributions from draft and canned format as well as the Coronita product. We also have a very strong beer innovation pipeline now and for the future with ample opportunities to increase distribution and space across our portfolio. Corona Refresca is one of these opportunities and based on our consumer research is more than 80% incremental to our growth. It's our strategy to complement our import portfolio and lay the foundation for future success with domestic sessionable and alternative beverage alcohol products that appeal to general market and Hispanic consumers. Now turning to the operations side of our business. We are currently putting the finishing touches on the final Nava capacity expansion, which we expect to be complete by this fiscal year-end. This marks an incredible feat of expanding capacity to 30 million hectoliters over the last five years, on time and on budget, while providing ample supply to meet the growth demand for our beer portfolio. We also continued the new expansion phase at our Obregon brewery with design, site work and utility installations in various phases of completion. Based on our progress to date, we now believe the new five million hectoliter expansion at Obregon will be completed ahead of schedule by the end of fiscal 2021, which is about one year ahead of the original time line for this project. Construction also continues at Mexicali with brew house tanks in place and warehouse and packaging buildings near completion. While the political environment in Mexicali has been challenging, Constellation has adhered to all regulatory obligations in accordance with Mexican law, which has been verified by the Secretary of the Interior in Mexico. In any event, upon completion of our planned five million hectoliter expansion project, Mexicali will only represent 10% of Constellation's total beer capacity in Mexico. The capacity we have built in Nava plus Obregon when completed will provide more than 400 million cases of beer, which is ample supply for several years to come. Shifting now to wine and spirits. We are currently taking advantage of the premiumization trends that have accelerated in the U.S. wine market with virtually all the growth being driven at the greater than $11 retail price point and that's where we're focused. In the last 52 weeks, we outperformed the U.S. wine market at the greater than $11 level with several of our focused brands growing double digits in IRI channels during this time frame. We believe we have unique and ownable positions with powerhouse brands like the Prisoner, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Robert Mondavi, and Schrader to name just a few. Not only do we have powerful brands at these price points, but our innovation engine is focused on premiumizing the portfolio with mix and margin-accretive brands. Our innovation efforts are paying off with successes like Meiomi Rosé, SVEDKA Blue Raspberry, and Cooper & Thief Rye Barrel Aged Cabernet, all of which are exceeding our expectations. Another great example of innovation success and a turnaround story as well is Robert Mondavi Private Selection, which is currently the second-most significant growth contributor to the Cabernet Sauvignon category driven by the Robert Mondavi Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet, a brand that equally has exceeded our expectations. My goal for the wine and spirits business is really quite simple. It's to drive a powerful portfolio of high-end wine brands that consistently deliver growth, exceeding the trends in the U.S. market, with an operating margin profile in the 30% range. Now, turning to our leading position in the cannabis market through our investment in Canopy Growth. We are seeing strong consumer demand in the Canadian recreational cannabis market. According to the Canadian government, as of the third quarter of calendar 2018, Canadians spent at a run rate of almost $6 billion on cannabis products, the majority of which were purchased illegally for non-medical use. As we've discussed, we believe the emerging cannabis space represents one of the most significant global growth opportunities of the next decade and frankly, our life time, an opportunity that is opening up much more rapidly than originally anticipated. And on that point, the 2018 U.S. Farm Bill was recently passed with one of the key components of the legislation legalizing production of industrial hemp, including CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabis compound that is believed to have significant medical benefits. It also emends the U.S. Controlled Substances Act by removing hemp-derived CBD products from schedule one and allow states to regulate the production and sale of hemp. Canopy Growth provides a single platform for Constellation to address all global markets and product formats including both CBD and THC. They announced in a press release earlier this week their position and advantages relating to the U.S. market entry for CBD products and they are currently awaiting FDA guidelines pertaining to the sale of these products in the United States. Since our investment in August, Canopy has used the proceeds to bolster their global leadership position in the cannabis industry with strategic partnerships and acquisitions including Ebbu, a leading hemp research and innovation firm; Storz & Bickel, a profitable global leader in vaporizer, design and manufacturing; and Battelle who is the world's largest non-profit R&D organization. Canopy and Battelle will work together to advance cannabis medical research and product development. In addition Canopy continues to focus on intellectual property development across medical and recreational opportunities, while also preparing and creating brands and products for new legal recreational cannabis markets across various product formats that will be sold through new and existing channels. It is these initiatives that give me confidence that Canopy can and will achieve their CAD1 billion revenue run rate target within the next 18 months. In closing, as the growth leader in the total U.S. beverage alcohol space, Constellation has a stable, core consumer franchise market with growth prospects that exceed those of our competitors in this sector. And our investment in Canopy Growth provides an even greater long-duration growth play which we believe is being valued as our free call option today with significant value in the future. Combine this with our powerful cash generation capability and our desire to quickly delever and return $4.5 billion in cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, those in combination make Constellation a compelling investment for the future. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to David who will review our financial results for this quarter.
David Klein: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone With a lot of volatility in the equity markets and knowing that our investors must continue to assess where they can get the best returns, I want to offer you why we believe that Constellation provides the best combination of growth and cash returns to shareholders within the CPG space. We've grown comparable basis diluted EPS at almost a 20% CAGR over the past three years using the midpoint of our updated FY 2019 guidance. We remain committed to our algorithm of a 10% comparable basis EPS growth CAGR on a mid to high single-digit net sales growth CAGR over the medium term. This may not be straight line performance, given changing consumer preferences and economic volatility, but we're confident we'll deliver on this commitment. In addition to our growth prospects, we believe Constellation is also a cash return story. We plan to return approximately $45 billion to our investors over the next three fiscal years in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This goal is supported by our historically strong cash flow generation and the ramping down of the CapEx needs in our beer business. It assumes we quickly delever back into and operate within our 3.5 times targeted leverage ratio range, as we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating. It also assumes we exercise the Canopy warrants that expire in November of 2021. Our Canopy investment is like a ventures investment, which positions us to use our capabilities in building brands in a regulated industry to take advantage of the legitimization of an emerging $200 billion global industry. The impact of Canopy on our income statement will be reflected as non-cash equity and earnings from an unconsolidated investment. This will not limit our ability to return cash to our shareholders. In terms of noncash performance to date, we we've recognized $12 billion of unrealized net gains on our investments through the end of Q3. As Bill said, we fully expect Canopy to achieve a CAD 1 billion net sales run rate within 18 months and we continue to expect to receive outsized returns on our total investment in Canopy. Now let's look at our Q3 performance where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Q3 represents another quarter of strong execution by our beer business, which generated double-digit net sales and operating income growth. These strong results coupled with tax favorability helped us to deliver 18% comparable basis diluted EPS growth for the quarter. For beer, we continue to outpace the rest of the beer category by a consistently wide double-digit margin. Net sales increased 16% on volume growth of 14%. In addition to strong demand, shipment volume also benefited from timing as fiscal year-to-date shipment and depletion volume are now fairly aligned. Year-to-date depletions grew 9%. Beer operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 37.3%. This reflects higher marketing as a percent of net sales which increased 70 basis points to almost 11%. Favorability in pricing, FX and SG& A were offset by higher COGS, primarily related to increased transportation. In addition, we experienced higher glass cost in the quarter due to a non-recurring raw material supply issue that impacted glass production at the Nava glass plant. This supply issue has been rectified. Gross margin for the quarter would have been flat when excluding this impact Depreciation expense increased $10 million to $52 million for Q3 and $30 million to $152 million for the fiscal year-to-date period. For wine and spirits shipment volumes and net sales were flat. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 27% as SG&A favorability and pricing benefits were partially offset by unfavorable mix. Our comparable basis interest expense increased 14% for the quarter and our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio moved up to 4.6 times at the end of November from 3.6 times at the end of fiscal 2018, primarily due to the additional Canopy investment financing. Our cash generation profile is strong, as we expect our business to produce over $2 billion of operating cash flow annually. This positions us to quickly delever back into our targeted leverage range and return cash to our shareholders as I outlined earlier. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 14.1% versus 19% last year. The decrease primarily reflects benefits from Tax Reform and increased stock-based compensation benefits. This rate came in lower than our previous guidance due to higher than forecasted stock-based compensation benefits and a lower than expected effective tax rate on our foreign business. Now I'd like to provide an update on fiscal 2019 guidance. For beer, we expect fiscal 2019 net sales growth to be at the high end of the 9% to 11% range including 1% to 2% pricing benefit on our Mexican portfolio. This guidance implies depletion growth above the 9% year-to-date depletion rate. Volume growth will lag depletion growth in Q4 due to timing and a tough compare. We also expect operating margin for beer to approximate 39%. This would represent a 50 basis point decrease versus last year's 39.5% operating margin in our previous guidance which implied a relatively flat operating margin result in fiscal 2019. Forecasted transportation costs are driving gross margins to be fairly flat compared to our previous goal of gross margin improvement for the year, as the benefit from pricing is being largely offset by the higher transportation costs as well as higher depreciation expense. We believe holding gross margin for the year is an impressive result, given the unfavorable gross margin impact we've experienced from transportation cost for the first three quarters of the year. We've been able to accomplish this result in part from the operational costs and efficiency initiatives that we have underway and which we expect to continue into next year. These efforts are important, as we continue to expect some transportation cost headwinds as we move into fiscal 2020, as drivers in freight lanes are expected to remain in short supply. We expect fiscal 2019 marketing as a percent of net sales to be at the low end of our targeted range of 9.5% to 10%. This compares to last year's 9% result. This year's incremental marketing investments are primarily in support of our very successful Corona Premier and Corona Familiar product introductions along with Modelo Especial, which along with Modelo Especial were top share gainers this quarter. Going forward, we expect our marketing as a percent of net sales to fluctuate within the 9% to 10% range and may move toward the higher end of that range depending on the magnitude of our innovation. Moving to wine and spirits. Year-to-date, U.S. shipment volume has outpaced depletion volume primarily due to timing. This timing benefit is expected to reverse in Q4, as a result we now expect fiscal 2019 wine and spirits net sales and operating income to decrease low single digits compared to our previous guidance of 2% to 4% net sales and operating income growth. In addition, we've updated our interest expense projection to a range of $380 million to $390 million. This now includes $55 million in additional interest expense related to the financing of our $4 billion, Canopy Growth investment. This has an approximate $0.25 impact on our fiscal 2019 comparable basis diluted EPS. We continue to expect our fiscal 2019 comparable basis effective tax rate to approximate 18%, which implies a Q4 rate of approximately 19%. This higher Q4 rate is primarily due to lower-than-expected benefits from stock-based compensation. Finally, I'd like to note for fiscal 2019, we expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate 196 million shares, corporate segment expense as a percentage of net sales to approximate 2.5% and net income attributable to non-controlling interest to approximately $20 million to $25 million. Due to the factors I just outlined, we now expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $9.20 to $9.30 per share. Excluding the impact of the incremental Canopy related interest expense, comparable basis diluted EPS for our core business will grow almost 10% for fiscal 2019. We remain on track to generate over $2.3 billion of operating cash flow and $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of free cash flow. And now a few additional words about our Canopy investment. We will be accounting for our November 2017 initial common share investment and the additional common share investment, which closed on November 1st of 2018 under the equity method of accounting. As of November 1st, our Canopy ownership totaled 123 million shares. This represented approximately 37% of the outstanding common shares of Canopy Growth. This portion of our Canopy investment will not change in subsequent periods due to the fluctuation in Canopy's stock price. Instead we'll see fluctuation based upon our share of Canopy earnings. The equity and earnings for our share of Canopy earnings will be reported on a two-month lag. Therefore, Canopy's earnings for November and December, which is included in their Q3 results will be recognized in Constellation's Q4 results. Our Canopy warrants are recorded at fair value. Market fluctuations will, therefore, flow through our reported earnings. We'll continue to exclude changes in the fair value of these warrants from our comparable basis earnings. I'd like to emphasize that the recognition of our share of Canopy earnings in our income statement will not impact Constellation's cash flow. To reiterate, Canopy's equity and earnings are a noncash flow item for Constellation. We continue to evaluate the potential equity and earnings impact to fiscal 2019 in fiscal 2020 results from the Canopy investment. Including any potential comparable adjustments related to the transaction. As a result, Canopy's equity and earnings impact is not factored into our updated fiscal 2019 comparable basis diluted EPS guidance range of $920 to $930. When we begin recognizing our share of Canopy earnings, we will adjust Canopy's reported IFRS results to U.S. GAAP. As such, the fair value accounting impacts related to Canopy's biological assets and inventory will not be reflected in our GAAP or comparable basis results. However, our GAAP and comparable basis results will reflect amortization expense related to the fair value allocated to Canopy's intangible assets. In addition I would also note, we currently expect stock-based expense related to Canopy's acquisition milestone payments, as well as other certain fair value changes to be excluded from our comparable basis results. When we provide guidance for fiscal 2020 in early April, we'll continue to provide net sales and operating income growth targets for our beer and wine and spirits businesses in order to highlight the underlying earnings power of our core business. Separately, we expect to provide guidance related to Canopy's non-cash equity and earnings and the estimated interest expense associated with the Canopy investment and how these items will impact Constellation's P&L. This approach will highlight the strong financial growth and cash generation capability of our core business, which we believe is not currently reflected in our valuation. With that, we're now happy to take your questions
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Rob Sands: Hey, Dara.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning, guys. So my question is around the trajectory of beer depletions going forward. Fiscal Q3 was a bit softer than we've seen from you guys historically at 8%, but it sounds like you're off to good start so far in fiscal Q4. So help me understand that slowdown in Q3? Was it more just industry softness is dissipating a bit now? And just any thoughts around if your forward beer depletion growth can hold up if the industry trends remain softer would help? And then specifically on the innovation front going forward, can you give us some detail on if you think Premier can grow next year, year two post the launch? And the reasons why? And just any frame of reference for how big you think Refresca can be next year? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure. Dara, a couple of things on the depletion trends. As I mentioned during my prepared remarks, our depletion trends in December were actually up higher than our year-to-date rate which was at 9%. So we're still very comfortable with the growth profile of our business. What's also important to note is that our share gaining performance during that quarter remained consistent with our share gaining performance over the course of the year. So our delta to the market remained very, very strong and we're confident that this is going to be a continuing trend. Relative to innovation, we think there's a lot of runway yet to go in Premier. We continued to see accelerating velocities in that business, and we expect that that's going to be an important part of our overall mix for our Corona brand family going forward. Lastly, Refresca, well it's a little early to tell. We're extremely excited about this. Our research and our testing that we've done on Refresca suggests this will be over 80% incremental to our core franchise and will bring new customers into our business. So we think this is going to be a tremendous launch that will occur during the early part of our next fiscal year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Q – Bonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning.
A – Rob Sands: Hi, Bonnie.
Q – Bonnie Herzog: Hi. I had a question on beer gross margins. I guess, I'm still trying to reconcile like you guys said during your last quarterly call in terms of cost and things being more transitory, especially transportation. And then you also talked about several COGS improvement initiatives that were underway to help offset some of the cost headwinds. So could you give us an update on those initiatives? Did something change with timing since they didn't really help to offset some of the gross margin headwinds that you faced in the quarter? And I guess, I'm still trying to reconcile maybe what went wrong in the quarter? And then how we should think about gross margins for the full year? You did mention they’d be flat instead of improving, but just want to make sure they're not worse than flat. Thank you.
A – David Klein: Yes. No we're still comfortable with flat, Bonnie. And if we kind of breakdown the gross – the Q3 gross margin, the transportation and logistics headwind accelerated a little bit for us in Q3, but we still, because of the productivity initiatives, we still were well on track to at least maintain our margins in the quarter. And then we had an issue with some raw material inputs into our glass facility in Nava, which caused us to have to slow down the furnaces and lower throughput for the plant in Q3. That's a one-time issue. But it created a headwind that the other – that in addition to the freight headwinds, we weren't able to overcome. But other – again other than a slight acceleration in our transportation and logistics cost headwind and the glass issue, we remain – we remain on track with where we thought we would be with gross margins.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Q – Nik Modi: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So the – I guess the question is on the wine business and you're talking about some of the strategic alternatives. I know it's probably too early for you to give us some finite viewpoints, but maybe help us understand some of the options you might have available to you? I think there were some discussions in prior meetings about perhaps regionalizing some brands or even making some of the brands private label at certain retailers, maybe you could just help us understand kind of how we should think about it?
A – Bill Newlands: Sure. I think, Nik, the way we're thinking about the wine business is this. We have an entire stable of brands that generate outstanding gross margins and have high growth profiles at the high-end of our business. You've heard me say before something like Kim Crawford has a 68% gross margin. It's a terrific business, as is Meiomi and many of our other brands and the Prisoner and things of that nature. We have been challenged by the lower end of our business, which in totality has been flat to down and we continue to be slightly over-weighted into that sector of the business. So we – as we've said before are taking a strategic look at what our portfolio should look like going forward, which could include disposition of some of the lower end of our portfolio. Our long-term view is that the high-end of the business, which is the – in our judgment, primarily are driven by over $11 price point is where we're going to get the kind of margin structure and growth profile that we think we would like to see for our wine business going forward.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Steve Powers: Hey, thanks. So, I really want to just pick on the $4.5 billion in cash return and just some clarifications around that. Is that – I'm assuming that's a fiscal 2020 to 2022 statement just want to get that out of there? And then any color you could provide on the cadence of that cash return? And as you think about the cash return alongside maintaining the targeted leverage ratio, I know you said you want to delever to 3.5 times then exercise the warrants, which presumably puts you back above 3.5. So as we think about the capital structure over that – alongside that $4.5 billion in cash return at the end of it, are you anticipating it to be at 3.5 times? Or be above that as you think about the next three years? Thanks.
David Klein: So, Steve when we think about that – first of all this isn't necessarily new news in that, our company generates a lot of cash and we know that we're going to have CapEx ramping down over the next few years, the CapEx related to our beer business. And so we look at – we have a targeted leverage ratio of 3.5 times, although we're willing to operate in that three to four times range. And we're really confident that we'll be able to both, return $4.5 billion worth of cash, stay within our targeted leverage ratio range and exercise the Canopy warrants. And I think that's a pretty powerful view of the ability of our business to generate cash. And we don't expect that there would be any share repurchases in the remainder of FY 2019 just given where our leverage ratio is. So clearly your point about it being an FY 2020 through FY 2022 statement is accurate.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Vivien Azer: Thank you. Good morning.
David Klein: Hi, Viv.
Rob Sands: Hi, Vivien.
Vivien Azer: I wanted to touch on wine as well, a two-part question for you. Number one, could you – can you comment anything specific that drove the magnitude of the deterioration over the last three months in the low end, Bill, I heard you loud and clear that the low end has been a problem, but given the magnitude of the guide down it seems like something changed and changed pretty recently. And then the follow-up to that is, how do you think about the impact of potential asset sales in wine, impacting your ability to be a category captain or category leader in that category? So I think historically one of the cases for having a broad wine portfolio was that scale gave you a lot of influence at retail? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Well, certainly the growth profile of the wine business, I think is going to continue to be in that $11. Now we've seen premiumization be an ongoing play for years and years and years and I don't see that changing any. Therefore, I wouldn't see that there would be a lot of difference in the whole question of being able for category captaincy. People look for organizations that have growth profiles and for people that have deep consumer understanding of where the market's going and why. Relative to the decline in our low-end business which is reflective in the earnings position. We've certainly seen that and we said this last quarter, our shipments have been ahead of our depletions, partially driven by our desire to make sure we had adequate inventory levels heading into the holiday season. And frankly that needs to correct in Q4. The low end of the business, which we've said, we are looking at strategic alternatives has suffered the most and that's not surprising when you make a statement of that ilk.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Lauren Lieberman: Thanks. Good morning. I think you've been pretty clear on the Canopy impact on the P&L and delineating cash versus non-cash impacts to net income. But I do think that there's a lot of concern out there around the degree to which you will see dilution to your earnings base in fiscal 2020 and beyond from Canopy. So you've talked about the CAD 1 billion in revenue. Anything that you can add in terms of the current outlook for Canopy's earnings? My understanding from them is that they intend to report Canada separately. So even if they reinvest profit dollars to establish U.S., so whatever it may be, that we'll see they're executing in Canada. But anything you can offer, I think, would be really helpful, because people are struggling with the 20 kind of number that we should be benign with here. Thanks.
David Klein: Yes. So Lauren, so we expect and we've said this, this isn't Canopy, now this is really Constellation's view. We expect the Canadian business to be at that CAD 1 billion run rate. We expect them to have very attractive CPG-like operating margins within their business and that's focused on Canada. And we also know, as you pointed out, that there will be drags on their business from investment in R&D and the cost of opening additional markets. So we've said that, we expect that this transaction will be accretive to us by FY 2021 and we expect that to be the case, or we continue to expect that to be the case. In terms of actual guidance in the near term for Canopy, we're not in a position to provide that, primarily because they've just closed their recent quarter. They'll produce results in mid-February. And shortly after that mid-February results come out from Canopy, we'll then provide a bit of a walk through for the market on how those actual results will flow through our P&L, and that'll be the first time we do it. And then clearly, when we provide guidance we'll provide more specificity around the Canopy equity and earnings number. And I know you said, we've been clear on this, but it's a non-cash measure. We're viewing this as a ventures investment. We've already made that investment. That was the $4 billion investment that we closed in November. And we expect to get an outsized return on that investment, understanding there's going to be some volatility in our P&L, however that volatility will be non-cash in nature.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Sharma: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Bill, a quick clarification on wine and then the beer business. So you said, over shipment will clear in fourth quarter. Should we expect that impact to drag into fiscal 2020? Or by the end of 4Q, you would have achieved right inventory level for wine? And I have a beer business question.
A – Bill Newlands: Sure. No, we expect – the way we have traditionally run is no matter what our situation is coming into the fourth quarter, we get our depletions and our shipments to balance during the course of the fourth quarter. So we would not expect that this would have impact on next fiscal year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Q – Andrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. So in terms of the capital allocation for the strategic alternatives for the wine brands, would an outright sale be doable in that view? And if so, what is the part of use of cash, as you said before in the prepared remarks but could you please rank if that would be pay down the debt first buybacks and leaving the warrants for Canopy for after when you see your own cash flow generation?
A – David Klein: Yes. So in terms of any proceeds of any asset dispositions that may come up over a period time, we would first make sure that we're comfortably within our targeted leverage ratio range. And then beyond that, as we've committed today, we'd be focused on returning cash to our shareholders. With respect to the Canopy warrants, and I want to be really clear about this, we're going to return $4.5 billion to our investors and we can fund the Canopy warrants. However, we'll only fund the Canopy warrants, if it make sense and the business is unfolding as we expect when we get into November of 2021. So if that business is going well, we think our investors will be happy for us to exercise those warrants. And if the business isn't going well, we'll have a lot more cash to return to our investors.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Q – Judy Hong: Thank you. Good morning. So I guess my question is around the Corona brand family performance. And recognizing that obviously this year, you had a very good performance on Premier and Familiar. Bill, I'm just wondering what do you think is going on with the Extra in terms of velocity being down this year? And then as you think about next year, do you think that the broader Corona franchise can continue to grow at this 7%, 8% even if Corona Extra is down a bit next year?
A – Bill Newlands: Yes. One of the things that you see going on with Corona Extra is good news – what I would call a good news, bad news situation. Premier has done so well. And even though the incrementality is over 70%, which is phenomenal, the better it does, the more it has some impact on our other franchises from which it does take some cannibalization. So – and obviously, as you can have all seen, Corona Premier has virtually done twice what we expected it to do heading into this fiscal year. So it's been a phenomenal success. What I do believe is that the Corona franchise continues to have significant upside across the entire brand family. And my – just as a marketing belief, I think that the more Corona brand family we can provide to the consumer and that the consumer buys is outstanding for the long-term equity of the Corona brand family. So we're very optimistic. You then in turn add Corona Refresca, which brings a whole different consumer profile to the table. As I said during my prepared remarks, it appears that that will be in – at the high end of the incrementality that we saw with Premier, which was best-in-class. So again this will help to enhance the number of times that consumers in this country are picking up a Corona brand family product, and I think that speaks very well to the long-term franchise of Corona.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Robert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. So a lot of questions came into us on the gross margin for beer. And you addressed some of it, but I just want to kind of touch on a couple of points. One, shipments really strong, all things equal you would think the shipments would have been a benefit for the gross margin in the quarter. However, there could have been additional transportation costs related to that. Can you address that? Second on the gross margin. Looks like you got around 2% pricing for beer, is that right? And then finally, roughly what quarter do you think the transportation costs will start to ease? Thank you.
David Klein: Yeah. So Robert, the pricing – so if I do a bridge out of our gross margin numbers, we got about 110 basis point benefit from pricing. We got a little bit of a benefit from FX. We had about 160 basis point drag from transportation and logistics, which is larger than it's been on a year-to-date basis. That's the acceleration that we were talking about. And then as I said we had some drag from the glass issue, which was in aggregate – that and maybe some depreciation amounted to about 80 basis points. So a couple of things happened when we get into Q3 and that's that even though we're shipping more we're actually – we are slowing down our production because it's our lowest, kind of, production quarter of the year. And so I think taken altogether, the gross margin worked out as we expected, but for the glass plant – the glass production issue, which is behind us.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Kevin Grundy: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to come back to Canopy and just given the importance here in the focus among the investment community. Can you drill down a little bit on the Canada rec rollout, I think you said strong demand I'm not sure if there's anything you can add to that, relative market share 30% to 40%? Another question, beverage rollout expectations, I think your discussion has been around calendar Q4. Maybe if you can frame the opportunity and what you're expecting there? And then just last in the long-term guidance, what gives you confidence at this point on the 1 billion within 18 months? And then David maybe you could just confirm the 30% to 40% operating margins as well for Canopy. I think you said CPG-like margins. Just want to confirm that you're still confident that 30% to 40% is operating margin is the right number? Thank you.
Bill Newlands: Sure. Why don't I take the first piece of that and I think David will take the last piece of that. Let me just remind everyone upfront that we are in a quite period, they are in a quite period at this point in time. So we will be reflecting things that have been in the public domain. Yes, Canopy has been progressing with the kind of market share, which we have said before is in the 30-plus-percent range of the total cannabis business in Canada. We also if you'll recall projected that the Canadian market as part of our total global projections of where we thought the market would go would be in the $5 billion to $7 billion range. And just this past week the Canadian government has estimated that the consumption of cannabis by Canadians in the third quarter was at a run rate of $5.9 billion, which of course is right smack in the middle of what the initial projections were. I'll remind everyone, beverages are not currently available in Canada. We expect and Canopy expects that that will change later this calendar year. But an exact date of that has not been defined yet. But I can assure you when and if that eventuality occurs and we certainly expect that it will. The Canopy will be in a position to take advantage of that opportunity.
David Klein: And the only thing I might add to that, Bill, is the $59 billion number quoted by the Canadian government includes -- majority of that is illegal sales. So really the build to $1 billion is dependent upon the channel shift, if you will, from illegal markets to legal markets, of which we're comfortable with the market share that we've outlined before for Canopy. And I would say that after Canopy's results are released in mid-February, they will have a lot more to say about their margins as will we.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Your line is now open.
Pablo Zuanic: Thank you and congratulations, Bill, on your appointment. Just a quick question. I want to go back to what Judy was discussing. I'm trying to understand better the cannibalization or the opportunity for Premier and Familiar in terms of further distribution gains. The numbers we are looking at Corona Extra, a core brand, is down about 10%; Corona Light down about 20%; Modelo Especial, which I think has been cannibalized from Familiar, has decelerated from the 19% range to 10%, 11%. So there is an impact. And according to our data, 80% of your growth in the fourth quarter November was really Premier and Familiar. Yes, the two brands have done great. So the simple question is, as you rolled out those brands, did you have to take space, existing space from your current portfolio? Or did you gain new space? Or are you in the process of converting that and expanding space? What are the opportunities for Premier and Familiar or even Refresca eventually, if it does well in on-premise restaurants in draft? If you can expand on that, because I think there's a question mark here. Depletions up 10% the last two years, this year running 9%, what happens next year when you're so dependent on these line extensions? And I want to speak to one question, but if you can just at the very end, as you have more extensions and you add more complexity to your portfolio, does that in any way affect your profit margins in beer? Thanks.
Bill Newlands: Sure. So let me answer the last one first. Any of the products that we have discussed, meaning Familiar and Premier and so forth, we're agnostic as to which product actually gets sold. The margin and profit profile of those individual products are virtually the same. Relative, so let's go back for just a minute to the question of cannibalization. We have seen the cannibalization exactly as we expected. In fact, if anything, it's been slightly less, meaning, more incremental than we had expected with Premier and Familiar. One of the things that we have done extensively and we are continuing to do and I think your point's a good one, is we have had the Shopper First initiative, where our emphasis has been, based on in-store research, as to what an appropriate shelf should look like that focuses on the right set of brands for retailers to maximize their benefit in the beer section. Of course, the beauty of that is, we actually come out pretty well on that issue. And that opens up significant opportunities for us to expand distribution and shelf space. And frankly, we need that shelf space, because our portfolio with its share-gaining performance really demands that kind of shelf placement improvement. I would also mention that Refresca, which you asked a question about, we'll probably not be sitting in the middle of the beer section. This is an alternative beverage alcohol product that will placed – be placed in the different door of the cold box. And will compete with other brands, not necessarily directly within our franchise and we think this is great, because it opens up another window coming from the great equity that Corona has and has had for many years.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is now open.
Q – Tim Ramey: Thanks so much. Understand your commentary on the sub-$11 wine business, but is there enough other than Woodbridge in the portfolio that would really make a difference there? Is this a Woodbridge problem? Can you speak directly to the performance of Woodbridge?
A – Bill Newlands: Sure. We're actually very happy with Woodbridge. Woodbridge is in a category that's actually in decline but Woodbridge is gaining share within that category. And obviously, it benefits from the Mondavi franchise halo, as you know we have Mondavi’s franchise covered it in a number of price points. And so, Woodbridge will continue to be an important part of our portfolio. And yes, we have a substantial amount of assets in the under $11 price point outside of Woodbridge. And that gives us significant options of what to do going forward and as we said earlier – in fairly recent time, we’ll be able to talk about that more extensively.
A – David Klein: Then we've also said in the past that, about 30% of our volume comes at the greater than $11 price point. And then if you look at Woodbridge. Woodbridge by itself is about 20% of our volume. And of course, when we're looking the greater than $11 price point, we get a lot more dollars out of that volume. But that gives you a sense for what else is in the portfolio.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Q – Kiernan Conway: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Kiernan on for Bill. We just had a question on the spirit side of the wine and spirits business. We have been talking about that much this morning. So hoping to get some comments may be on the SVEDKA national marketing program and any other more kind of commentary on the general portfolio?
A – Bill Newlands: Sure. It's early days on the new creative that we have put out in the marketplace but I can assure you from our initial testing, this is one of the stronger campaigns, certainly that this organization has put out in the recent past. So we're very excited of how that campaign could work for us. And I think it's a great example of some of the work that Jim Sabia has done to bring some of his outstanding marketing efforts in Beer to our wine and spirit efforts as well. So we're very optimistic about it. SVEDKA has already been performing in a positive manner versus the vodka category and we think this can only help it. I'm sure you've also seen, we have very good results as it relates to High West and Casa Noble and continue to see the more premium aspects of our spirits portfolio as important going forward as well.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
Q – Laurent Grandet: Yes. Good morning, everyone and thanks for the opportunity. I like to discuss about the Mexicali new water issue. I mean, more and more reports in the Mexican press that there are potentially some risk associated to order rates at the Mexicali brewery, and the impact it has on the local community. So could you please give us some more color about that issue? And let us understand how you are planning to mitigate those risks?
Bill Newlands: Sure. As I said in my prepared remarks, our efforts in Mexicali have been totally in compliance with all Mexican law and has been done with a deep understanding of water usage. We do not believe this is a major issue, and we believe that all is going to proceed as planned with our Mexicali site. I will say and I said this also with the completion of our Nava facility as well as our expansion at Obregon that after the five million hectoliters of Mexicali comes online that facility will only represent 10% roughly of our total capacity in Mexico one way or the other.
David Klein: Yeah. And said in another way more from an investor's standpoint I would say that we can with Obregon and Nava, Bill said this in his script, we have the ability to produce 400 million cases of beer from Obregon and Nava.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Bryan Spillane: Hey, good morning, everyone. David, I just wanted to follow-up, you had referenced I think in your prepared remarks just the medium-term growth targets. And – so just had a couple of follow-ups on that, one is the diluted EPS expectation. The EPS growth of around 10%, does that now include share repurchases given what you've said about capital allocation? And I think the second, you kind of referenced that it's not linear. So I guess as we're kind of looking into fiscal 2020, it's kind of sounded like beer margins may be under pressure for a little while longer, not sure with the past to low – mid-single-digit growth on operating income in wine and spirits is? So if you kind of meant to refer that next year may – could potentially be in off algorithm year? Thanks.
David Klein: Look, Brian, we haven't even finished rolling up our estimates for next year. What we do know is when you look out over the medium term with our beer business, we still expect that high single-digit net sales growth. We still expect to have very robust margins. And then Bill talked about the wine and spirits view, which is kind of mid-single-digit growth and 30% operating margin. So we think that along with our ability to make investments in the business and buy back our stock as well as getting – working our way through the early years in the choppiness in the equity and earnings in the Canopy investment, we expect that we'll continue to see that 10% EPS growth target that we put out before.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue. So now I'd like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Bill Newlands for any closing comments or remarks.
Bill Newlands: Thank you, everyone for joining our call today. I want to take this opportunity to wish all of you a safe and happy and prosperous new year. And as Rob said at the beginning, hopefully you'll do that while enjoying some of our fine products. I'm honored to assume the role of Constellation's CEO in just a few short months, and I look forward to capturing the great opportunities that lie ahead of us for our company. We look forward, David and I to seeing many of you at the CAGNY Conference in late February, where we'll be providing an update on our strategic business initiatives. As a reminder, during our next quarterly call we will provide our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. So thanks again to everyone for joining the call and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program and we may all disconnect. Everybody, have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands’ Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Shannon. Good morning and welcome to Constellation’s second quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Rob, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will help us to end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance. And now here is Rob.
Rob Sands: Thank you, Patty. Good morning and welcome to our discussion of Constellation’s second quarter sales and earnings results. I would like to kick off the call with a reminder that Constellation has an outstanding core business that consistently delivers top tier growth within the consumers’ product space as reinforced by our second quarter double-digit organic net sales and comparable EPS results. These results were driven by the Constellation beer business, which delivered exceptional performance with industry-leading depletion growth of 10% and record operating margin results. During the quarter, our beer business was the number one share gainer in the U.S. beer industry driven by accelerating Corona brand family dollar trends and Modelo Especial’s position as the top share gainer in the market. Corona brand family trends accelerated from 4% depletion growth in fiscal 2018 to 8% for this year’s first half driven by the successful launches of the Corona Premier and Corona Familiar product introductions, both of which have significantly exceeded our expectations. Corona Premier has achieved record speed-to-shelf and has become the 10th largest brand in the high-end and the number one high-end share gainer in very, very short order. The incrementality rate for Corona Premier is best-in-class for the launch of a new consumer product, with almost 75% of Corona Premier volume being sourced outside the Constellation beer portfolio, mostly from domestic light beers. The Corona Premier English and Spanish language TV campaigns that aired throughout the first half of the year will continue into the fall to drive broad brand awareness during major league baseball as well as the NFL and NHL seasons. Corona Familiar also achieved a healthy share of the U.S. beer category and its regional expansion at a rate of about 50% incrementality for the brand with velocities outpacing our plans. Corona Extra continues to provide the strong foundation needed for the portfolio to grow with strong brand equity as the number one most loved brand among Hispanic and total population drinkers aged 21 to 54. There continues to be plenty of runway for future Corona Extra growth with incremental contributions from draft and canned format as well as the Cornita [ph] product, and we continue to see growing household penetration with Hispanic and non-Hispanic consumers. The Casa Modelo family of brands has been the number one growth driver in the U.S. beer category with a CAGR of almost 20% for the last 5 years. The Modelo Especial power brand with volume of 100 million cases last year continues to be on fire capturing not only the top spot as the number one growth brand but also the number one share gainer in the total U.S. beer industry during the second quarter. To sustain this incredible momentum, we are increasing the media investment for Modelo Especial in the second half to drive additional demand especially during the football season and the holidays. During the quarter, we purchased Four Corners Brewing, local Dallas craft brewery whose bicultural brand, inspired flavors, capitalized on one of the hottest trends in beer, Hispanic influenced products. This high performing brand has grown sales 5x since 2014. Our new brand entrants in test markets within the alternative beverage alcohol space are doing exceptionally well as a growing market opportunity that has been incremental to the beer category. Corona Refresca is exceeding our expectations in current test markets with early indicators suggesting that this product is at least 80% incremental to our portfolio. As a result, we are planning a phased national rollout beginning next spring with the focus on retail chain space. And the new SVEDKA Spiked Premium Seltzer, which is also seeing excellent results in Northeast test markets has planned and expanded rollout next spring in select markets. From an operational perspective, during the quarter we continued the new expansion phase at our Obregon brewery with detailed design and site work in various phases of completion. The phase – the final phase of the 30 million hectoliter expansion project at Nava is on track as we add capacity for production, fermentation, and filtration with completion planned for the end of fiscal 2019. Our Nava glass plant, which we are already underway with work on, the batch house and furnace foundation in anticipation of the build-out of furnace #5 which we expect to complete by the end of calendar 2019, and construction continues at Mexicali with warehouse and packaging buildings nearly complete. Overall, I am excited about the existing momentum and the ongoing growth prospects for our beer business. We remain committed to delivering industry-leading targets for this business with net sales and operating income growth in the 9% to 11% range for fiscal 2019. Moving to wine and spirits, our wine and spirits business benefited from strong shipment volume growth in the second quarter to ensure that the portfolio is well positioned for a head start to our peak selling period when we believe that freight lanes may be in short supply. We are performing particularly well in the greater than $11 price point at retail, a level that is driving much of the overgrowth – overall growth in the U.S. wine industry. Our attention to this higher retail price point is paying off as we posted depletion growth of more than 6% for this price segment during the second quarter with Meiomi, Kim Crawford, SIMI, and Prisoner Focus Brands all posting solid growth trends. I would like to remind everyone that our total Focus Brands portfolio currently represents more than 70% of the net sales and profitability for the wine and spirits business. This collection of brands has also consistently grown at a rate of 3x to 4x the U.S. market rate.  Our high-end spirits brands like High West, which is also included in our Focus Brands delivered accelerating depletion growth of almost 35% for the quarter driven by American Prairie Reserve and Double Rye! with Casa Noble tequila posting second quarter depletion growth of almost 15%. Current initiatives are also driving growth with successes like Clos du Bois Lightly Bubbled Chardonnay, Black Box Sangria, and our collection of newly introduced Rose brands, including Meiomi, Kim Crawford, and Band of Roses. Our innovation pipeline is already planned for the upcoming holiday selling season with new brands like Meiomi Sparkling, Cooper & Thief Rye Barrel Aged Cabernet, The Snitch, a new Prisoner brand chardonnay as well as Black Box spirits which will continue to expand in the phase rollout. While our fiscal 2019 wine and spirits guidance of net sales and operating income growth of 2% to 4% range remains intact, we’re facing some challenges with the low end of our portfolio that make our targets challenging to achieve. The U.S. wine market is slow particularly at the less than 11% retail price point and our non-Focus Brands are in decline. Therefore, while we continue to focus on initiatives to drive growth at the higher end, we’re also developing plans and considering options to optimize value at the low end of the portfolio so that we can direct our innovation and investment dollars to Focus Brands particularly those at the greater than $11 price point. We have plans in place for the remainder of the year to improve our COGS management capabilities with planned initiatives for yield improvement, production efficiencies, blend optimization and procurement savings. We expect these initiatives to offset some of the headwinds we continue to face including higher transportation and credit costs. In addition, we will continue to support our innovation plans and brand building efforts throughout the remainder of the year especially during the key holiday selling season with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build the portfolio. Now before turning the call over to David, I’d like to take a few minutes to walk you through the strategic rationale and highlights of Constellation’s pending investment in Canopy Growth and why we believe that Canopy is the best partner to align with in the cannabis space. With our focus on continuous growth, we’ve recognized the significant opportunity that the emerging cannabis space presents as potentially one of the most significant global growth opportunities of the next decade. Our incremental $4 billion investment increases our interest in Canopy to approximately 35% and include warrants that provide us with the option to take our ownership position to greater than 50% over time. This will be the largest investment to-date in the cannabis space, a market which is expected to reach more than $200 billion in retail sales globally within the next 15 years and one that is opening up much more rapidly than originally anticipated. So why Canopy Growth? Canopy is the largest publicly traded cannabis supplier in the world and the leader in the medical cannabis market in Canada. We work closely with Canopy throughout the last year to better understand the cannabis market, the unbelievable opportunity it presents and Canopy’s market-leading capabilities in the space. With world-class expertise in R&D, innovation, product development, scaled production and international expansion, Canopy is poised to capitalize on the emerging global cannabis opportunity. They have already established a global presence via numerous joint ventures and partnerships. Canopy Growth has the largest legal cannabis production footprint in the world and in Canada, and they are the only producer currently participating in all Canadian provinces. They also have been awarded approximately 35% of the supply contracts announced throughout all Canadian provinces to-date that are dedicated to recreational cannabis, a market that will become legal in Canada later this month. Going forward, we will be working exclusively with Canopy as we believe that having a single platform to address all markets and formats globally is essential to winning in this space. Canopy plans to use the investment proceeds to bolster their global leadership position in the Canopy – cannabis industry by building or acquiring key assets needed to establish global scale. Strategic priorities beyond Canada include the U.S. in the nearly 30 countries presently pursuing a federally permissible medical cannabis program. In addition, Canopy plans to focus on intellectual property development across medical and recreational opportunities while also preparing and creating brands and products for new recreational cannabis markets. Canopy has a portfolio of the most recognized cannabis brands in Canada and they are building a suite of new offerings across various product formats that will be sold through new and existing channels. A strong online platform currently supports Canopy’s ongoing direct to patient medical business and they are building a network of brick-and-mortar stores across Canada as they ramp up for participation in the legalized recreational market. Canopy’s shareholders recently approved their pending transaction and I look forward to working with Bruce Lin and his Canopy team who have built a phenomenal business. As the growth leader in total beverage alcohol space, we expect to reap the benefits of our cannabis investment, which we see as being incremental to our core beer, wine and spirits portfolio. I am very excited about the excellent prospects for this business as the global cannabis space emerges. In summary, I am pleased that we have been able to increase our EPS guidance range for the year based on our year-to-date results and the plans we have in place for the remainder of the year. Given Constellation’s leadership position in the high-end U.S. beer market further runway for margin expansion throughout the business, unique leverage to the emerging cannabis space and an attractive valuation, I believe Constellation will continue to be a multiyear double-digit EPS compounder. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David who will review our financial results for the quarter. David?
David Klein: Thanks, Rob and good morning everyone. For Q2, we generated 16% comparable basis diluted EPS growth. This reflects particularly strong operational and marketplace performance by our beer business during the key summer selling season. These results along with favorability in our tax rate and interest expense have allowed us to narrow and increase our full year comparable basis diluted EPS projection to a range of $9.60 to $9.75 versus our previous guidance of $9.40 to $9.70. This excludes the impact of the additional $4 billion investment in Canopy growth, which is expected to close at the end of October. We plan to finance the Canopy investment, primarily with term loans and senior notes and estimate the interest expense associated with this transaction to approximate $60 million with an approximate $0.25 to $0.30 impact on fiscal ‘19 comparable basis EPS results. Our Q2 reported basis results reflect a $692 million unrealized gain for the increase in fair value of our current investments in Canopy growth during the quarter, which was excluded from our comparable basis results. The cumulative unrealized gain since our November 2017 investment is $1.3 billion. Now, let’s review Q2 performance and our full year outlook in more detail, where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer, net sales increased 11% on volume growth of 9%. Depletion growth showed continued strength at 10% as we won the key summer selling season with excellent execution across all channels. Beer operating margin increased 10 basis points to a record 41.3% as benefits from pricing and strong operational performance were offset by higher transportation costs and marketing investments. Marketing as a percent of revenue increased to almost 9% for Q2 and to nearly 10% for the first half of fiscal ‘19. This compares to 8.4% and 9% for Q2 and first half of fiscal ‘18. The increases are primarily due to the upfront marketing investments for the Corona Premier and Corona Familiar introductions as well as ongoing investments to sustain the growth momentum within the portfolio. Marketing spend came in lower for Q2 than our previous estimate as we decided to shift some planned spend into Q3. We continue to target fiscal ‘19 marketing as a percent of net sales in the range of 9.5% to 10%. Back half marketing spend is expected to be weighted toward Q3 and approximate 11% to 12% of revenue as part of our brand building efforts during the important fall sports season. I would also note that beer segment depreciation for the first half of fiscal ‘19 increased $21 million to $100 million. For fiscal ‘19, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth in the 9% to 11% range. This includes 1% to 2% of pricing targeted for our Mexican portfolio. Full year beer operating margin is expected to be similar to the prior year’s 39.5% result. For the year, we continue to expect to increase gross margin, even with the headwinds from higher transportation costs. From a quarter perspective, Q3 operating margin is expected to be below the prior year third quarter and Q4 above the prior year fourth quarter primarily due to the timing of marketing spend that I just outlined. Moving to wine and spirits, we saw strong Q2 U.S. shipment volume drive net sales growth of 9%. The U.S. shipment volume outpaced the U.S. depletion volume primarily due to timing as we positioned ourselves for success ahead of the key holiday selling season as we expect freight lanes and carriers to remain in tight supply. We expect most of the shipment timing benefit experienced during the second quarter to reverse in the third quarter and as a result, we expect our third quarter wine and spirits net sales and operating income to be down low single-digits. Wine and spirits operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 26.1%. This decline primarily reflects higher COGS, mostly due to increased grape and transportation costs and marketing investments for key Focus Brands and innovation initiatives, which was mostly offset by favorable pricing in SG&A. As a reminder, the 2015 Opus One Vintage to be released this fall is expected to be smaller than the previous year. Therefore, Q3 fiscal ‘19 equity earnings from Opus will be below Q3 last year. Even though the lower end of the wine and spirits market and our depletion performance has been challenging during the first half of fiscal 2019, we are still expecting fiscal ‘19 wine and spirits net sales and operating income growth of 2.4% or 2% to 4% driven by continued focus on our portfolio premiumization efforts and productivity enhancements across the business. The increase in corporate expenses primarily reflects investments in people to support our growth organization and our digital enablement and Fit for Growth initiatives. Interest expense increased 8% primarily due to higher average debt balances. Excluding the projected impact of additional debt to fund our pending Canopy growth investment, we now expect fiscal ‘19 interest expense to be in the range of $335 million to $345 million. The decrease in our interest expense guidance of approximately $20 million primarily reflects interest favorability at our glass joint venture partially offset by an increase in the net income attributable to the non-controlling interest line of our income statement, which we now expect to be approximately $20 million to $25 million for fiscal ‘19. As mentioned earlier, we expect incremental interest expense related to the funding of the Canopy growth investment to be in the $60 million range for fiscal ‘19. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of August totaled $9.7 billion, a $379 million decrease from our net debt balance at the end of fiscal ‘18. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio moved down to 3.4x at the end of August from 3.6x at the end of fiscal ‘18, while we continued to invest in our Mexican operations and return cash to shareholders, with $504 million of stock repurchases and $279 million of dividends paid during the first half of the year. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 18.4% versus 20.6% last year. The decrease reflects benefits from tax reform and lower taxes on our foreign earnings partially offset by a lower stock-based compensation tax benefit. For fiscal ‘19, we now expect the effective tax rate to approximate 18% versus our previous guidance of 19%. The lower tax rate for Q2 and the lower rate projected for the full year is primarily the result of lower taxes on our foreign earnings. This is being driven largely by a structure change in the foreign legal entities that reduced certain tax accruals. Most of this decrease will not be recurring. I would also note that we expect stock-based compensation tax benefits to be weighted toward Q4. As a result, we expect our Q3 tax rate to be higher than our full year rate at around 21% to 22%. We also now expect fiscal ‘19 weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate $196 million. This reflects the estimated impact of our year-to-date share repurchases. We don’t plan to make additional share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal ‘19 as we will focus on de-levering after completing the additional investment in Canopy. As a result of the aforementioned factors, we now expect our full year comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $960 to $975. Our comparable basis adjustment excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. It also excludes any impact related to the pending additional Canopy growth investment. After completion of the transaction, we expect to account for investment in the original and new shares of Canopy under the equity accounting method. At the date of the transaction close, the equity investment, original and new shares, will be reflected on our balance sheet. Accordingly, this portion of our Canopy investments will not change in subsequent periods due to the fluctuations in the value of Canopy’s stock price and the equity earnings for our share of Canopy earnings will be reported on a 2-month lag. In addition, our Canopy warrants, original and new, will be recorded at fair value and we will continue to exclude changes in the fair value of the warrants from our comparable basis earnings. We continue to evaluate potential comparable adjustments related to the transaction and the impact on equity warnings to fiscal ‘19 results. Moving to free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated strong free cash flow of $968 million for the first half of fiscal ‘19 compared to $598 million for the same period last year. This improvement primarily reflects strong operating cash flow growth and lower CapEx. The lower CapEx is primarily due to timing as we still have significant spending plan for the balance of the year. Our full year CapEx guidance of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion remains unchanged and we continue to expect fiscal ‘19 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. In closing, we are focused on our portfolio premiumization and innovation activities, while working to drive productivity enhancements across our wine and spirits business. Our beer business continues to deliver impressive operational, marketplace and financial performance. These efforts have positioned us to continue generating top-tier sales and profit growth for this year and beyond. With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Bonnie Herzog: Alright. Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping to ask you guys a little bit more about your beer margins in the quarter which were strong and quite a bit above what you were guiding. So, could you drill down just a little bit more on some of the drivers there? And then just want to get a sense on your expectations for the full year, is it fair to assume that beer margins will in fact be higher now given some of the strength we are seeing? Thanks.
Rob Sands:
–:
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Caroline Levy: Good morning. Beer looked pretty spectacular, and I do note that you didn’t spend as much as you expected on marketing and yet you’ve got a really strong depletion growth. So, I am wondering if you can look out for us a little further and just talk about what sort of legs you think Premier has, and the incrementality seems to be even higher than we originally thought at 75, not 70. Has there been any supply shortage on Premier? Do you think you can sell significantly more over time, and how is Familiar playing out? And again, just a little more detail on the other new initiatives you have in beer would be great? Thank you.
Rob Sands: Yes, Caroline. I think that we can say at this stage that all of our NPD in beer and in particular, Premier and Familiar, has been performing extremely well. And as you noted, the incrementality on Premier and Familiar has outpaced our expectations. So, we did frontload some of our spending on marketing this year as you probably recall in the first quarter, which we had highlighted even prior to the first quarter and that marketing spend I think has really paid off for all of our initiatives. As you can see, in that the Corona brand family and the Modelo, Casa Modelo family have been performing extremely well, both as reflected by our depletions and as reflected in IRI. I would say that we don’t really see any reason why that momentum should not continue throughout the remainder of the year enabling us to make the guidance which we put forth of roughly 9% to 11%. So generally, I would say that the beer business is hitting on all cylinders. Strong consumer takeaway, our marketing is working really well, incrementality on our new products is higher than expected, we have been able to achieve distribution on those products to a greater extent than we even believed that we would be able to achieve. So, there is really nothing in the horizon that would suggest that the beer business won’t do anything other than to achieve the guidance that we have put forth.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Grundy: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Rob Sands: Good morning.
Kevin Grundy:
–:
Rob Sands: Thanks.
Kevin Grundy: I wanted to come back to Canopy, Rob, if we could.
Rob Sands: Yes.
Kevin Grundy: Can you talk about what you’ve learned, I guess, in recent months since you announced the larger stake, anything that makes you bullish or bearish? There’s naturally a lot of questions out there among investors. Can you also talk about potential timing and other considerations around the decision to exercise the warrants at some point in the future? And last, understanding you may be limited given that Canopy is obviously publicly traded, is there anything you can provide with respect to near to intermediate term impact from equity earnings from the investment? Thanks for that.
Rob Sands: Yes. So, I would say that if anything we continue to be extremely bullish, if not more bullish since we have announced the deal. I mean, we are right on the cusp in the next couple of weeks of recreational marijuana becoming legal in Canada on October 17. I would say that the overall market projections on that haven’t really changed. I think some – it’s a pretty wide spread, but I think that most people are predicting somewhere in the $5 billion market wise in Canada, $5 billion to $6 billion or $7 billion range for legal recreational cannabis. As I noted in my script, Canopy has secured approximately 35% of the supply contract, so we expect to take a significant share of that business as it develops over the next call it 12 to 18 to 24 months. So, I think we’re feeling pretty good about Canopy’s position and the results or how that position will be reflected in the results. No, we don’t – we really haven't given any guidance on the equity earnings as of yet, I think that we really need to take a little bit more of a latency approach to that element of our guidance in the future. So, once I think that we get recreational, it becomes legal and we get a little history under our belt, we’ll be able to address that better as time goes on. I think that another thing that shouldn’t be lost on anybody is that Canopy has significant positions outside of Canada and that those markets are developing very quickly and Canopy is extremely well-positioned to take leading positions in major markets where medical in particular is going to become legal. And the – that the history of a lot of markets which is a little different than the United States is that, first medical becomes legal, which is why we want to participate in that category and the governments then are able to establish the regulatory bodies, the regulatory frameworks sort of settle in with that reality and then recreational follows after the governments have as I said establish their oversight mechanisms. We see that happening largely all over the world in very large countries like Germany, in the UK and Western Europe in general, and we’re poised through Canopy to participate in all of that. That said, I think something that David has said all along, we premised our investment really solely on Canada and the countries that Canopy already had a strong foothold in, and we see nothing to suggest that our returns on those investments won’t be as we expected. United States, we pretty much counted nothing, but things are moving very quickly in the United States on the legal front. It looks like perhaps after the election we’ll see the Farm Bill, enacted the Farm Bill legalizes CBD, and that will be an interesting market to see how that develops in the US, which will be poised to participate in. And there was certainly a lot of talk that eventually there will be some form of decriminalization of marijuana at the federal level meaning that taking of it off the schedule one list and therefore really leaving it to the states to determine the legality, and of course, that’s moving quickly too with two states having the recreational legality on the ballot this November and eight states already having made it recreationally legal and a large – those states are big states. So, a large percentage of the population in the United States already in states where it’s recreationally legal. So, we think that we’re by far the best company in the world or in the best position in the world of any company to capitalize on what is absolutely without a doubt going to be a huge market over the next 10 years, hundreds of billions of dollars. So, we’re addressing our position on every front meaning that we need to be a key player in the development of the science, that’s really important. Branding, we have got top people and top agencies and firms working on branding, because like all businesses of this nature and consumer products, branding is going to be the key to success of the future. And we are leaving no stones unturned in any of those areas through our Canopy investment and also with regard to our Constellation folks who are dedicated to that element of our business. So we are excited. We see very positive future in that regard.
Kevin Grundy: Thank you very much. Good luck.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.
Lauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to talk a little bit more about the wine business and suggest any color you can offer, I know you definitely specified kind of the below $11 price point above $11 price point performance of your focus brands, but I was curious on overall category performance and then also the difference between high end and low end. And the Nielsen data or IRI data seems to show no correlation to your business at all, so if you could just commented on why you think that is the same mix of what’s available in those channels. And my final question was just the price mix in that business year-to-date is less than 1% and I would have thought that mix alone should be driving that line to be pretty positive, so if you could talk about anything that might be a downdraft in terms of actual pricing in the business or promotional activity will be great? Thank you.
Rob Sands: Yes. So I would say that the – if you look at the wine business in the U.S. over the long run, it’s been consistently growing at sort of the low or to mid single-digit range. And although it’s off a bit from that or at least the near-term historical performance, we don’t really see anything that suggest that as the entire category over the long run is going to grow at any rate different from what it has historically which is significantly above almost all other consumer products categories. So I think it remains a very strong category to participate in. There continues to be significant premiumization in the business with the low end becoming softer as time goes on and it’s a very large segment. And the high end continues to perform well certainly above $11 with growth in the high single-digit range and sometimes in the lower double-digit range. And obviously we continue to position our portfolio to take advantage of that, at the same time our lower end portfolio also continues to I would say deteriorate consistent with the market and we certainly in terms of how we are running the business, focusing all of efforts on our focus brands and on the high end we have all of our NPD against the high end. And we are certainly taking our results in the low end and I will say reinvesting that in the high end to accelerate the mix change. So I would say the first half of the year for us on a depletion basis was kind of lackluster, but we have lot of plans and programs in place for the holiday season and the remainder of the year, so we are expecting to see significantly better depletion growth in the second half of the year based on how we timed our programming. We do expect to see better leverage as a result of the premiumization meaning we expect to see our premium brands outpace our popular price brands, which should drive some positive mix. So generally we are favorable about the business going into the second half and hence we have maintained our guidance of 2% to 4% on the top line and the bottom line which I think will be pretty good result. I would say that the wine business in general the wine and spirits business is the strong business. As I said both the category outpaces consumer products in general. If you look at margins our margins in the wine business if it’s still alone everybody would think it was a great business, it all looks like an ugly step-child in comparison to the beer business which there is basically no company in the world of any size that’s performing like our beer business across the top line and with the kind of margins that we have in that business. I mean it’s really a unique business in terms of the kind of totally outstanding performance it’s generating. So it is a little – there is a little bit of relativity involved in that. People are very focused as they should be on the beer business and it tends to perhaps overshadow the wine business which continues to be a very good business. So our focused brands constitute about 70% of the business. We have got good growth in the focused brands, the above the $11 segment continues to grow in the high single-digits and our business is actually outpacing that. In IRI the high single-digit growth we gained share in other words in the above $11 segment. And that’s really where all of our focus is. We have got strong operating ROIC in the wine business, high double-digits and in general say that the business is performing well plus our TBA, Total Beverage Alcohol platform I think is really paying off. Some of the things that I think have been lost in terms of what the press has been reporting are things like the entire Pacific Northwest where we consolidated our wine, beer and spirits business in one distributor, Columbia millions of millions of cases. And that consolidation has actually gone extremely well. Columbia has done a fantastic job on the wine side and we have seen accelerating results through Columbia in particular. So we have also done a lot of interesting things in that for instance our SVEDKA Seltzers, SVEDKA being a spirits brand which historically and continues to go through the wine and spirits distribution network we have created the seltzer product which is malt based which we therefore had put through our beer network. So we are binding all kinds of ways that we can use our very, very strong position in both networks to drive our business. And then retail – most retailers have single organization that deals entirely with or deals with all beverage alcohol. The may split it up, below the top people, but they are looking at their beverage alcohol category continues to be the most important category at retail because this is the most profitable and has the most growth of the other large categories and Constellation continues to be the number one growth provider by a factor of probably 3 to 1 at retail with our beverage alcohol portfolio. So we are the ones who are driving all of the growth or a large percentage of the growth at retail for the retailers, that puts us in a very strong position. And as I often like to say about our sales guys where I say to our sales guys when they are going and talking to retailers, that’s our story you can’t make up, okay. It doesn’t get any better than that when you have those kind of bets at hand when you are going in and talking to our retail customers. And we can say straight out that we are the number one growth provider by far and therefore the squeaky wheel ought to get the grease. That is a great story versus going in hand and hand and having them not generating any growth in fact having to deal with how are you going to explain the declines and the continuing declines and trying to figure out how to make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear. So I think we are in very good shape across the board.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Vivien Azer: Thank you. Good morning.
Rob Sands: Hey, Vivien.
Vivien Azer: So, Rob and David, I was wondering, is you’re working with Canopy Growth and presumably helping them with some of the forecasting exercises, which is admittedly a tough exercise trying to size an illicit market transition. But as part of that exercise, is there any discussion around alcohol cannibalization, is that part of the calculus at all? Thanks.
Rob Sands: No. I would say straight-out, the answer is no. We see no evidence whatsoever especially in the United States and the legal states of alcohol cannibalization. So, I’d say as we sit here right now when we think about the cannabis business and our position in the cannabis business, it’s probably going to be close to a 100% incremental for us talking about incrementality. So, this conversation comes up a lot of two things, okay, number one is it a defensive move, the answer is no. We’re not playing offense, defense, we’re playing offense. This is an offensive move. We’ve got a fantastic core business and as you can see from these results and our projected results on our core business for the remainder of the year, we’re very positive, we have a lot of confidence in that business and we see nothing in the horizon that suggests that it’s going to be anything other than great as its continued to be. We’re playing offense on this and that we think that this is another very aligned category, that’s going to develop very fast and very large and it simply presents another opportunity for growth for Constellation in addition to our core business. Why would we do this, okay, we did it because first of all, we got to involve with Canopy in a joint venture to develop beverages, okay. As that progressed, it became evident to us that the whole market, all channels, all forms is going to be explosive and therefore, there was really no reason why we should only participate in a relatively small segment of that market, which is beverages when other channels i.e. medical for instance and other forms are going to develop very quickly around the world and we have a – and we had a platform, which we had a minority interest in that we can take advantage of. So, as we said, we’re completely optimistic, it’s completely offensive on our part. We didn’t do it because we have any concern whatsoever about the core business, I’ve heard that suggestion made. I can tell you that our core business is stronger than ever and that had no bearing on why we did this, totally offensive, totally incremental, another leg of the stool that Constellation can add to continue as probably the number one growth company in consumer products in the Fortune 500. So that’s really the bottom line.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrea Teixeira: Hi, hello everybody and congrats on the results.
Rob Sands: Thanks.
Andrea Teixeira: I do appreciate the color on the beer margin and the cadence going forward. So, my question is on the beer pricing, I understand the negotiations are taking place now. So is your guidance embedded in the typical low single-digit pricing and what are you hearing from the training in terms of passing on aluminum and transportation cost pressures. So, if you can – and if you can also offer, there's a lot of news I mean, press release is about or press comments about hearing some noise in terms of beer distributors consolidation along with the wine distributors as well. So, I think Rob you mentioned that, that has been productive on the wine side. So, I wonder if you can offer us some comfort on the beer as well? Thank you.
David Klein: So, I’ll take the pricing and I leave the second question to Rob. But – so from a pricing standpoint, yes, the letters are in the market. We’re not seeing any pushback, it seems – the market seems fairly conducive to price increases this year especially maybe compared to over the last several years. And our full year guidance includes the benefits that we expect to receive from the price increases that we are putting out at this point.
Rob Sands: Yes. And I would parrot what David said in that regard. Our pricing continues to be as it has been in the past completely normal in that 1% to 2% range. The environment for that pricing is probably I would put it as better as opposed to worse if you were just saying how is the market absorbing price increases, I would say we are on the better end of that scale this year than we have even better on the past where it hasn’t been a significant issue. On the distributor consolidations and my comments on wine, in the Northwest we consolidated wine, beer and spirits and while I was focusing on wine that whole consolidation across wine, beer and spirits and for beer as well has worked very well as we are a major, major player with that distributor. As to some of our moves in really Southern California that had done it in the press, it’s really about very specific instances and examples in some of our most core markets where we have the highest market shares, where consolidation provides an opportunity to create significant efficiencies especially in distribution otherwise that will directly benefit our brands in those areas where we have consolidated by taking some of those efficiencies that have been created and being able to apply those against our brands in terms of manpower on the street, in terms of marketing dollars that can be available at local levels against those brands. So these were moves really intended to accelerate what is already good performance. And I would say one of the hallmarks about Constellation and what I am about to say even relates to the Canopy transaction is we are not a company that’s sitting around waiting for some element of our business to turn down or get bad before we jump in and we take action to improve our results. We are really quite the opposite of that. We have a fantastic business. It’s performing better than it’s ever performed in the past. And we are really applying all of our thought and effort against actually accelerating the great position that we are in as opposed to sitting around waiting for it to turn bad and then we are all going to jump in with some kind of fix it attitude, because that’s too late in business. When it turns bad, turning something around is a 900x harder than it is to play off that’s from an already very strong position. So that’s a lot of our mentality and a lot of the things that we are doing both in our core business something like our distributor consolidation moves in Southern Cal, it’s truly about playing offense and accelerating an already strong business platform.
Andrea Teixeira: That makes a lot of sense. Thank you both.
Operator: Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Judy Hong: Thank you. Hi everyone.
Rob Sands: Hi Judy.
Judy Hong: So on beer sales guidance 9% to 11% not changing despite the fact that you have 11% year-to-date, I don’t think that second half comparisons are that different than the first half, so I guess I am just curious sort of the decision not to raise at least the low end of that, is it just conservatism, is there anything that we should be mindful of. And then a little bit of more of the longer term question, as you are lapping some of the innovation benefit this year particularly on Premier and Familiar just given the success of those products, how do you think about sort of the lapping that innovation into 2019 or fiscal ‘20? Is your expectation that we will see continued growth of those innovations really being still a big contributor or do you think that other innovations like the Refresca and others have to kind of carry the load going forward just from a contribution standpoint?
David Klein:
– :
Rob Sands: Yes. And I guess I would add that your questions, Judy, almost presume the answers. We will be overlapping the distribution games on some of the new products. On the other hand, we are going to turn our attention then to building velocity on those new products. And as we build velocity on those new products that will provide some incremental performance that will help offset the overlap question that you asked. Refresca is looking like it’s going to be a huge opportunity for us. I think you all know that the alternative category is really one of the stellar performers in the beer category overall with numerous brands now performing extremely well. So we think that that’s a big opportunity in that. We think that Corona Refresca certainly based on our test markets and given the strength of the Corona franchise and the Corona name and the continued demographic tailwinds that we have in the business, I think that Refresca is a huge opportunity. And then let’s not forget about some of the secondary brands like Pacifico, which continues to be a huge opportunity like even Victoria. Take a look at IRI on Victoria, okay. Victoria is growing now high double-digits. So I think that in the beer business in general, not only do we have the opportunity to drive velocity on some of our NPD that’s already in the marketplace, we have new NPD that’s going to go national, i.e., Refresca, which is going to give us more growth opportunities. And then we have the smaller secondary brands that we can jump to as well to continue to provide strong growth against the whole portfolio. And then you have got Modelo Especial, which is a huge brand already and continues to grow high double-digits. So, we really see opportunity across that whole portfolio. On the wine and spirits side, we have brands like High West that are growing wildly and spirits brands like Casa Noble tequila and wine brands that are really unparalleled in terms of the potential for both like the Prisoner, like Kim Crawford, which is already a very large and profitable brand, just to name a couple. I could name many more, but I would say that therefore the opportunities across the whole portfolio remain very strong.
Judy Hong: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Amit Sharma: Hi, good morning everyone.
Rob Sands: Good morning.
Amit Sharma: Dave, quick question for you and one for Rob. Dave, so as pricing goes through as you are saying, as pricing regs are in the marketplace already. Your gross margins are already tracking around a year ago level, maybe little bit higher, why shouldn’t we expect a little bit more contribution on gross margin as pricing comes through right? And then Rob, you talked CBD and how the Farm Bill could accelerate legalization of at least that aspect of the cannabis. Can you give us a little bit of understanding of if you are planning on bringing a product based on CBD, is that going to be in partnership with Canopy, so you only derive equity income or could that come directly under Constellation?
David Klein: Yes. So on the gross margin question, I think you are hearing this from everybody else in the industry with the headwinds on freight and little bit of headwinds in some of the commodity areas. And so we think that our operations team is doing an outstanding job to be able to deliver a quarter, where we have best ever gross margins in that kind of headwind environment and we expect that environment will continue for the rest of the year, but as we said we also believe that our gross margins in our beer business will expand albeit slightly, but will expand over the full year. And then we have incremental marketing spend to continue to drive our brands, which brings us back to the place where our operating margins are roughly in line with the prior year. We think by the way that’s the best way to grow the business, because we are focused on driving that top line growth in a business that has almost 40% operating margins we want to keep as much growth coming as we possibly can.
Rob Sands: Yes. And to your next question, the answer is both. It could be reflected in the Canopy equity earnings as well as directly in Constellation. So, number one just to be clear, Canopy is one of the largest CBD producers in the world. So, it’s very possible that depending on exactly how the law works and whether imports are permittable, the CBD could well come from Canopy and then assuming that we produce CBD beverages and they can be sold through the normal retail channels, obviously, maybe not to everyone, but to us, the product would be distributed through wine, beer and spirits network to retailers. So obviously that element of it would be reflected in Constellation’s business. So, the answer is really both that it has the potential to be reflected in the equity earnings, with Canopy already being one of the biggest CBD producers in the world and in Constellation’s earnings as we potentially introduce CBD beverage, which doesn’t necessarily mean it’s alcoholic, probably not through our wine, beer and spirits networks.
Amit Sharma: Rob, can you just give us a little bit color on the potential size of that market of the CBD?
Rob Sands: I can’t really speculate on that at this point. I don’t think that there is a lot of prognostication on exactly what the size of that market is in the United States. I would say given the chatter about companies like Coca-Cola looking at it as well, I would say that it could be immaterial or tiny if other major beverage companies are looking at it as well. So, I think it’s got a lot of potential. CBD is one of the non-psychoactive components in cannabis. Although that said I would say that there is a lot of science as well as general belief that CBD as an organic compound has many positive and curative in fact health benefits I think you maybe aware that FDA just recently approved the first CBD drug in the United States to treat childhood epilepsy or seizure disorder. And then CBD has other qualities potentially that people are seeking organic, inorganic products, so the market could be very big. As we have said it’s not a psychoactive component, but it has properties that I think the consumer would be interested in.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Bryan Spillane: Hey, good morning everybody, I just had one question, I think in the prepared remarks Rob you talked a little bit about part of the motivation to ship ahead in this quarter and wine and spirits was to get ahead of maybe some potential freight shortages, so could you just add a little bit of color to that, is that sort of freight coming out of California. And also just as we are looking forward is that a potential sort of variable or factor that we have to think about over the next couple of quarters?
Rob Sands: Sure. So little is a good word and that we always have shipped more during the first half then we deplete as we always want to build inventory prior to the OND holiday season October, November and December. I would say little is a good word because we probably should a little more than normal versus depletions and that there is some tightness in terms of shipping. But that said I think to directly answer your question I don’t think that we see that as you know any kind of material problematic matter for really wine, beer or spirits. It’s just something that we have to keep in mind and we have to take into account so that our products are well positioned in the marketplace. I know David has talked a little bit about higher shipping costs as it relates to beer, but these are things that we have otherwise offset to the creation of other operational efficiencies and its not huge dollars for us. So the fundamental answer especially on wine and spirit side is no, we don’t see it, there is really nothing like totally something to be concerned about, it’s really sort of just more a minor business matter we are shipping lanes, it is tough to get shipping lanes. But that said we expect to – we have got everything well under – well in hand and we don’t expect it to be particularly impactful on the wine business and on the beer business as David has said we would largely offset any cost increases there that we have seen. So we are in pretty good shape on shipping and shipping costs and availability throughout the whole business in the remainder of the year.
Bryan Spillane: Alright. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Robert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on a terrific quarter. You have over the various quarters done a nice job keeping expectations down on beer margins on the one hand, on the other hand you highlight record margins this quarter and we understand I think that the timing on the marketing side, but even in regardless of that you had a very nice progression on the gross margin, also in your opening comments, there was talk about further runway for margin expansion in the beer business. So, I'm just wondering if you could give us your latest assessment of the medium-term outlook on margins for the beer business, please?
Rob Sands: Yes. I’ll let David address that, but I’ll just say that our expectations are in that 39% to 40% range sort of as simple as that. You already cited some of the factors that have contributed to the slightly outside margins in the second quarter, but we’re expecting margins to be relatively flat for the whole year. There are some headwinds which we talked about, we’ve offset those headwinds. So, I think that we’re going to maintain approximately the same margins. David?
David Klein: Yes. So, Robert, first of all, I think I’ve said this to you before, but the – we being our team comes in everyday trying to make our margins as high as we possibly can. So, when we talk about holding the line on margins, it's we are trying to expand them as much as we can. But I would say this is playing out kind of the way we had anticipated over the last few years as there was a lot of I'd say exuberance around where our margins could get to and we had a view that we had existed in a benign commodity pricing environment for a long period of time in a pretty favorable peso environment for us for a long period of time and that we know we have a lot of potential things that we can do from an operation standpoint to continue to enhance our margins and maybe even possibly from a pricing standpoint to enhance our margins over time. But we just want to be prudent about where that can get us to because we know we have these headwinds and it seems unrealistic to just talk about the positives without being really clear about what the potential drags could be in. I would say that this year is kind of playing out that way. We’re seeing some really good things happening from an operations perspective that are helping to be a bit of a driver for improved margins, but we’re also seeing drags on margin like the freight topic that we and everyone else is talking about at this point.
Robert Ottenstein: Will your distributor consolidation presumably that can help on the margin side?
David Klein: We are not expecting that we get margin enhancement from that sort of activity. Again, we – everything we do is built around driving growth in our business. Again, we’d be really happy to have a business that for the next several years grew at this rate at 40% margins.
Rob Sands: I would say however that to the extent that our distributor consolidations create efficiencies and therefore improve distributor margin on our business that creates an environment where the distributors are more willing to invest behind our brands than the opposite. So that is part of the thinking behind this and then the distributors’ actual investment behind our brands should drive continued strong results if not better results for our business, which will translate back to us on even better sales and growth than otherwise would be the case everything remaining equal.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.
Rob Sands: Hi, Brett.
David Klein: Hi.
Brett Cooper: Hi. Two questions if I can slip them in. First off just wondering if you could offer your views on what you're seeing in terms of fall shelf resets and what you'd expect from Spring I guess specifically looking at beer? And then on the cannabis front, when you're talking to regulatory authorities, do you guys have a particular view in which you are trying to get to in terms of what the retail format and distribution format looks like in the future? Thanks.
Rob Sands: On the first question as I said historically a lot, we retailers should be giving Constellation and our beer business more space in general because we’re their largest growth provider and probably their most profitable supplier. And I think that, that is resonating and therefore we do continue to make distribution gains and therefore acquire more space for our portfolio, which as I said is the number one growth portfolio and profit provider to many retailers. So, I think that that’s all going well and that’s part of what we call our shoppers’ first programs, probably historically referred to as category management, but now shoppers first is what we call it. And then on your second question, the answer to that – I think you sort of phrased it in terms of talking to regulatory bodies and this and that. In the United States, it’s really more about talking to politicians. We have got to get over the hump of decriminalization first. And then in the states that are legal, we are really not talking to anybody, because we are not participating in that because of the federal illegality. In Canada, we are definitely talking to regulatory bodies and the government about how the product is going to be sold and through what channels. I mean, Ontario is probably a good example of that, where initially it was planned to go through the LCBA, the Ontario Liquor Control Boards. And then very recently, the Ontario government changed direction and decided to allow it to be sold through private retailers. As you may know or may not know, Canopy bought a company of private retailers called Haiku and their brand for their stores is called Tokyo Smoke. And that’s one of the formats that we are developing our stores in, but one of the things that Canopy has done and I think with a lot of forethought is already gone out and secured prime retail locations even in Ontario to put our Tokyo Smoke branded stores and Tweed branded stores in anticipation of being able to have private stores and outlets in Ontario and of course in the other provinces. Originally, Haiku and Tokyo Smoke had stores in British Columbia and is developing stores in British Columbia. So, we are well-positioned from a branding point of view to control, so to speak, the whole ecosystem around the brands that we are developing in particular in Canada and the vertical integration, which will be very profitable as well in Canada.
Operator: Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Rob Sands for closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Well, thank you everyone. And let me say, as we close out the discussion of our quarterly results, I would like to reiterate the confidence that we have in our ability to drive the future growth of our business while generating very strong cash flows that allow us the flexibility to make strategic investments in long-term growth opportunities with significant upside. Our next quarterly call is scheduled for early January, so please be sure to have a safe and happy holiday season and remember to enjoy some of our great products during your celebrations with friends and family. So, thank you again for joining our call and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thanks for your participation and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands’ First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Laurie. Good morning and welcome to Constellation’s first quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Rob, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will have us end our call on time. Thanks in advance. And now here is Rob.
Rob Sands: Thank you, Patty. Good morning and welcome to our discussion of Constellation’s first quarter sales and earnings results. These results were in line with our expectations and reflect significant investment across the business designed to ensure that we maintain our growth momentum well into the future as well as other timing issues. We have maintained our earnings guidance as the top line is responding to these investments, including digital enablement for our e-commerce initiatives and our new ERP platform as part of our Fit for Growth initiative. We continue to work with Canopy Growth to develop and build cannabis brands. Our investment in Canopy is certainly paying off as we have recognized gains of more than $700 million in our reported results since we made this investment last year. Now most importantly, we continue to invest in brand building through our innovation and new product development initiatives across the country. Our most significant investment includes an increase in beer marketing to support our newly introduced products, which are exceeding our expectations and fueling sales momentum. The successful launches of Corona Premier and Corona Familiar are the first two major Corona initiatives in more than 25 years. Premier has achieved record speed, record speed to shelf with velocities increasing each month since launch and Familiar has already achieved a healthy share of the category in its regional expansion with velocities outpacing our expectations. These innovations help drive industry’s leading depletion growth of 9% for our beer business during the first quarter despite unfavorable weather related impacts early in the quarter in some of our largest markets. As a matter of fact, this quarter marks 32 consecutive quarters of growth as the winning streak continues for the Constellation beer business. We remain the leader in the high-end of the U.S. beer market contributing more growth than any other supplier during the first quarter. Constellation also won the Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays driven by strong execution and sales increases across the Modelo Especial, Corona Premier and Corona Familiar brands. All of which were top 5 share gainers in IRI channels during the quarter. We are well positioned throughout the remainder of fiscal 2019 with a great lineup of marketing and promotional activities to support the ongoing growth momentum of our portfolio. I would like to take a minute to highlight some of the activities we have underway for the summer selling season, the Corona Extra Summer campaign is currently in full stride leveraging new strategic partnerships and increased media activities. Corona Premier launched new English and Spanish language TV campaigns during the first quarter, which will continue throughout the summer and into the fall to drive broad brand awareness. New Premier programming has been developed that is relevant for live sports including golf, Major League Baseball and the NHL. Earlier this year, Modelo became the official beer for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which is one of the fastest growing sports in America. Throughout the year, Modelo will celebrate UFC’s 25 years of fighting spirit through fight sponsorships and national retail activation. And this summer Casa Modelo will celebrate soccer as the beautiful game through a national retail promotion as well as Spanish language broadcast of the World Cup. During the first quarter, we executed a nationwide launch of the Pacifico 12-pack can to build on the success of 24-ounce SKU. In support of Pacifico’s national expansion, the brand aired its first ever national TV ad campaign and is poised to be a top 10 national TV beer advertiser this summer. In addition to the Corona Premier and Familiar rollouts, we recently launched new brand entrants into test market within the alternative beverage alcohol space, which is a growing market opportunity that has been incremental to the beer category. The new Specta-spiked premium seltzer is targeted as the female consumer who is looking for better-for-you, light options that fit an active lifestyle. Three new flavors made from natural ingredients have been introduced in select Northeast test markets. We have recently introduced Corona Refresca in three test markets. This premium spiked refresher in two tropical flavors is being supported by English and Spanish language TV as well as sampling events in targeted digital and social media activities. Western Standard, a high-end barrel finished easy drinking lager will be available in test markets beginning in August. We are leveraging the equity and authenticity of our high-end small batch high west whiskey brand and building off trends of craft sprits and barrel-aged beverages. From an operational perspective during the quarter, we began the new expansion of our Obregon brewery while continuing to make progress at our Mexicali and Nava sites. The final phase of the 30 million hectoliter expansion project at Nava is on track as we add capacity for production, fermentation and for filtration. And furnace #4 at our Nava glass plant is now fully optimized and running at capacity. Construction continues at Mexicali with brew house tank fabrication nearly completed. We are also progressing well on the packaging hall and site utility installation. Overall, I am very excited about the ongoing growth prospects for our beer business. We remain committed to delivering our fiscal 2019 targets for this business, with net sales and operating income growth in the 9% to 11% range. Moving to wine and spirits, our wine and spirits business delivered first quarter results that were consistent with the guidance we provided last quarter. As previously discussed, we experienced the Meiomi supply shortage, which caused the timing overlap versus last year’s first quarter. In addition, this year’s first quarter depletion trends were muted following a better than expected finish to 2018. However, we continued to see strong consumer takeaway trends for our wine brands in the U.S. marketplace during the quarter as we gained share in IRI channels and we continued to make progress in executing a steady evolution to the high-end of the U.S. wine and spirits category by capturing growth at higher price points to achieve mix and margin benefits, particularly at the greater than $11 price point at retail. A good example of our success in this area includes key focus brands at these price points that posted double-digit depletion growth during the quarter, including Franciscan, High West, Robert Mondavi and the Prisoner portfolio. Currently, Constellation’s wine business at the greater than $11 retail price point, is growing 12% versus market growth of 10%. Overall, our Focus Brands continue to drive growth of our wine and spirit portfolio and have consistently delivered growth at the 3x to 4x the U.S. market rate. From an innovation perspective, we are well-positioned with a strong pipeline of new brands including Black Box spirits, Robert Mondavi Selection Rum Barrel-Aged Merlot and Spoken Barrel, a Washington state red blend. In addition, we have expanded our rose offerings to include Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Black Box, Band of Roses, a Cheryl Smith brand to capitalize on this hot growing category within the U.S. wine industry. We will continue to support this innovation and brand building efforts throughout the remainder of the year with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build the portfolio. During the course [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. I apologize that there will be a slight delay in today’s conference call, please hold and the conference will resume momentarily.
Rob Sands: …..indicate that our total beverage alcohol strategy is working as we achieved the most retail sales growth by a wide margin among our U.S. beverage alcohol peers. As such, we remain one of the best growth stories within the U.S. CPG space. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David who will review our financial results for the quarter.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Operator, this is Patty Yahn-Urlaub, are we back online?
Operator: Yes, ma’am. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Okay, thank you.
David Klein: Thanks, Rob and good morning everyone. Q1 results were in line with our expectations and were on track to achieve our full year comparable basis diluted EPS goal of $9.40 to $9.70. Now, let’s review Q1 performance in more detail, where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer, net sales increased 11% on volume growth of 9% favorable pricing and a $10 million federal excise tax reduction related to tax reform. This benefit will not recur in the remaining months of calendar 2018 as we reached the maximum barrel-aged level allowed for this excise tax reduction. Depletion growth came in strong at 9%, with excellent portfolio performance during the key Cinco and Memorial Day holidays. This growth is even more impressive considering the 12% depletion growth we are overlapping from Q1 last year and weather-related softness experienced throughout the industry in March and April. Beer operating margin decreased 230 basis points to 37.8% as the benefit of favorable pricing was more than offset by marketing investments, higher COGS and unfavorable foreign currency. The higher COGS reflect increases in transportation costs and depreciation. Beer segment depreciation increased $10 million to $49 million for Q1. Marketing as a percent of revenue increased 110 basis points to 11% of net sales driven by the upfront marketing investment supporting the successful Corona Premier and Familiar introductions. For fiscal ‘19, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth of 9% to 11%. This includes 1% to 2% of pricing within our Mexican portfolio. As a reminder, are facing a 12% shipment growth comparison for Q2 and 6% shipment growth comparison for Q3. We continue to expect operating margin improvement for fiscal ‘19 although benefits from product pricing, glass sourcing and operational efficiencies are expected to be mostly offset by marketing investments, increased transportation costs and higher depreciation. We continue to target fiscal ‘19 marketing as a percent of revenue in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% versus 9% for fiscal ‘18. This increase primarily reflects investment supporting our innovation activities and is weighted towards the first half of the year in an effort to generate strong marketplace performance throughout the key summer selling season. As a result, Q2 marketing as a percent of revenue is expected to be in the range of 10% to 11% versus Q2 fiscal ‘18 which came in at 8.4%. This marketing investment in the overlap of the strong Q2 fiscal ‘18 shipment volume is expected to move our Q2 fiscal ‘19 operating margin into the 39.5% to 40% range versus our record 41.2% operating margin result achieved in Q2 last year. Q1 fiscal ‘19 wine and spirits net sales and EBIT decreased 3% and 15% respectively. This was in line with our expectations as we overlap strong Q1 fiscal ‘18 wine and spirits financial results where EBIT grew approximately 20% and U.S. shipment volumes significantly outpaced depletions. Net sales were impacted by the overlap of strong shipment volume in Q1 fiscal ‘18 driven by replenishment of Meiomi supply, which was constrained coming out of Q4 fiscal ‘17. U.S. depletions were down 4% as overall depletion performance was muted following strong Q4 fiscal ‘18 results. Wine and spirits operating margin decreased 430 basis points to 25% primarily driven by higher COGS mostly reflecting increased grape and transportation costs and marketing investments for key Focus Brands in innovation initiatives. We recognized approximately $5 million of income from our Opus One investment during Q1 due to a first time spring release of certain older vintages. The 2015 Opus One vintage to be released this fall is expected to be smaller than the previous year. As a result, fiscal ‘19 investment earnings from Opus are expected to be similar to our fiscal ‘18 earnings, but Q3 fiscal ‘19 investment earnings will be below Q3 last year. In Q2, we expect to see ongoing cost pressures and marketing investments impact wine EBIT performance. However, we expect financial performance to improve in the back half of the year, which includes the key holiday selling season. As a result, we continue to expect wine and spirits net sales and operating income growth of 2% to 4% for fiscal ‘19. For wine and spirit sales, we continue to target low single-digit volume growth and mix benefits from our premiumization efforts. We continue to realize benefits from the increased marketing spend on brands like Meiomi and Kim Crawford over the next several quarters. As Rob mentioned, the wine business gained IRI market share in the first quarter and has a strong innovation pipeline and solid programming in place for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect mix benefits and COGS productivity enhancements which are targeted for the back half of the year to be mostly offset by higher grape and transportation costs and marketing investments. Even with some of the cost pressures I just noted, we expect full year operating margin expansion for both business segments. However, we expect the deltas between sales and operating income growth to be contained within the guidance range provided. The increase in corporate expenses primarily reflects investments in people and consulting services in support of our growth organization, cannabis investments and our digital enablement in Fit for Growth initiatives. These investments will continue in Q2 when corporate expenses as a percent of sales, is expected to be similar to that of Q1. Interest expense for the quarter increased 7% primarily due to higher average borrowings. Fiscal ‘19 interest expense is still expected to be in the range of $355 million to $365 million. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $10 billion, a decrease of $199 million since the end of fiscal 2018. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.5x at the end of May versus 3.6x at the end of fiscal ‘18 while we continue to invest in our Mexican operations and return cash to shareholders with $141 million of dividends paid and $100 million of share repurchases for the quarter. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 21.4% versus 19.2% for last year. Our rate benefited from the new 21% U.S. federal statutory rate, but was more than offset by higher tax on foreign earnings and lower benefits from stock-based compensation activity due primarily to timing. We anticipate that our Q2 fiscal ‘19 effective tax rate will be similar to the Q1 rate in the 22% range. However, we continue to forecast our full year fiscal ‘19 effective tax rate to approximate 19% with stock-based compensation benefits expected to be weighted toward the back half of the year. Moving to free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated $336 million of free cash flow compared to $165 million for Q1 last year. This improvement primarily reflects lower CapEx and strong operating cash flow growth. While CapEx was down for the quarter, we still have significant spending planned for the balance of the year as our full year CapEx guidance of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion remains unchanged. This guidance includes approximately $900 million targeted for our Mexico beer operations expansion. We expect fiscal ‘19 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.55 billion and the CapEx spend that I just outlined. In Q1, we recognized an additional $258 million pre-tax unrealized gain from the change in fair value of the Canopy growth investment and warrants bringing the total pre-tax gain on this investment to over $700 million. Earlier this month, we acquired CAD$200 million worth of convertible debt securities issued by Canopy in support of their growth initiatives. We also recognized a $101 million net gain on the sale of our accolade wine investment. The gains I just noted were excluded from our comparable basis financial results. As mentioned earlier, we continue to project our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $9.40 to $9.70. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments which are detailed in the release. Before closing, I’d like to note we adopted new accounting standard guidance for revenue recognition at the beginning of the year. Under this guidance, we are recognizing certain sales incentives earlier than we have historically. We have provided restated income statement information for fiscal ‘17, fiscal ‘18 and fiscal 18 quarters in the investor overview section of our website. As a result of this activity, our fiscal ‘18 comparable basis diluted EPS was restated from $8.72 to $8.70 per share. In closing, we are executing against our plans and on track to achieve our financial performance goals for fiscal ‘19. While our first half financial results are being impacted by the investments behind the marketing, innovation and growth initiatives I noted earlier, we are confident that we will produce top-tier financial performance versus CPG for fiscal ‘19. We also believe the investments we are making in support of growth opportunities today position us to generate industry leading sustainable and profitable growth in FY ‘20 and beyond, while we deliver on our FY ‘19 commitments. With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. 
Bonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Rob Sands: Good morning, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: I was hoping you could help us understand your conviction levels for the rest of the year given the weak Q1 results and your ability to hit your guidance ranges for the full year specifically for beer. When you look at the midpoint of your guidance, it implies that beer margins for the balance of the year need to expand 80 bps. So, could you drill down just a little bit more on the key drivers of that? And I guess I am just concerned that this might be tough given the spending and strong commodity and transportation cost inflation you touched on? And then does your guidance assume a price increase, for instance? Thanks.
Rob Sands: Yes, Bonnie, I will start off and I will let David address some of your points, but our convention level is very high. I think that as I said in my comments, the first quarter was very much in line with our own internal expectations. We had planned to invest behind in particular the new products and the beer portfolio as well as some other investments in a big way during the first half of this year and in particular the first quarter and we did make those investments and we see the top line coming through. And that’s what I would say is the most important thing that everybody should be looking at is, is the top line coming through? And in that regard, the top line is probably a little bit above our own internal expectations and our new products are performing I would say, a little bit above our own internal expectations. So, our confidence level on the year and the guidance I would say is very strong. David?
David Klein: Yes. So, Bonnie, let me start out with GP margins in beer. So, GP margins in beer benefited from robust pricing and then that was offset by incremental depreciation which we had planned on as well as about 70 basis points drag from incremental freight and logistics costs as a result of a tighter trucking market in the U.S. It also was impacted by a headwind on FX meaning the peso. Now that may seem a little counterintuitive, but the weakening of the peso really happened at the very end of May and our production cycle is such that transactional FX benefits or headwinds actually don’t flow through for about 30 days. So, we didn’t get any benefits from the weakening peso at the GP line in Q1. We expect the remainder of the year to have a – to experience a tailwind from FX. We also have had several COGS improvement initiatives underway that we believe will offset the transportation headwinds that we are facing. We fully expect to expand GP margins in FY ‘19 versus FY ‘18. Now, I will also go on and talk about overall operating margins. So, in Q1, we had about 110 basis point headwind versus last year from the marketing investments that we made behind our brands in particular, Premier and Familiar. We expect in Q2 that we will spend about 10% to 11% of net sales on marketing, primarily because the brands are getting real good traction in the marketplace. As Rob outlined, the distribution performance has been astounding and we now want to make sure that we continue to drive increasing velocity on the shelf. However, we are still committed to being in that 9.5% to 10% marketing load for the full year. So, when you kind of do all of that math you get to the place where confidence in the top line understanding that we have a path to expanding GP margins and getting the timing right on our marketing investments that we are very confident that we will deliver both our top line and bottom line guidance in the beer business.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: Hi, guys. So, first just a couple of follow-ups. The drag from freight that you mentioned in the quarter, is that fairly consistent in the guidance in the balance of the year in terms of the year-over-year drag you are expecting in the balance of the year? And then on the beer pricing front, are you guys looking to perhaps be more aggressive with pricing given the rise you are seeing in transportation costs or do you look at it really more from a competitive standpoint in consumer demand elasticity than being tied to cost spikes? And then just the last one on the innovation front, can you just talk about Premier repeat rates at the consumer level so far. Obviously, you mentioned the distribution was strong, but what are you seeing in terms of repeat rates and cannibalization across the rest of your portfolio? Thanks.
David Klein: So, I will start out and I will leave Rob to talk about the cannibalization, so yes, we, in our thinking about the rest of the year, we have fully internalized the effects of the transportation drag and expect to be able to cover it. From a pricing standpoint, we typically talk about being able to take price of 1% to 2% a year across the portfolio. We are seeing a fairly robust pricing environment in the high-end. I wouldn’t expect that we will go outside of our pricing range that 1% to 2% range, although that work is going on literally this month as our teams are working through pricing.
Rob Sands: And then I’d say consumer takeaway and repeat on Premier in particular which is what we asked about. As I said, Premier is responding probably a bit above our expectations. We were very – we were able to gain distribution on the product at a pretty rapid rate, you see velocities at rates which we think are very strong. So I’d say all good for Premier. We don’t see any cheeks in that armor. We think it’s going to be a very, very successful brand launch, plus we put a lot of investment behind the marketing of the brand. And I think that we are seeing the response to that. And then to your question on cannibalization, we are not seeing cannibalization at a rate greater than what we expected in the first place. So, pretty much, I mean that’s the bottom line. So I would say as it relates to the new products, I put that above expectation, I’d say as it relates to the entire Mexican portfolio, I’d have to say that, that’s also slightly above expectations as well. That business, our Mexican beer business is performing very strongly as we go through this fiscal year. So, we see no issues whatsoever there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.
Caroline Levy: Thank you so much. Just a couple of quick ones. Could you just discuss the level of beer inventories with distributors at the end of the quarter? How that looked versus where you are comfortable, is it a little high or little low and are there any other stock issues? Were there any other stock issues as a result of the new products being managed? The second thing really is just I have never in the past decade, I don’t think I heard you call out grape costs, so it sounds like those are creeping up if you could explain why? Thanks.
Rob Sands: Yes. So in terms of inventory levels at distributors, they are in line with where we typically are at this point of the year perhaps a bit on the low side. So I don’t think there are any distributor load issues clearly and there weren’t significant out of stocks to the best of my knowledge. From a grape cost standpoint, the callout is really based upon the flow-through of a tight NAPA harvest year 2016, which is starting to come through our P&L. Also, there was issues in Italy as well in terms of the grapes that are coming through that are driving increased cost. Now that said, the operations team in the wine business has some overhead initiatives and some blend management initiatives that we have put in place that will start to see flow through the P&L over the remainder of the year. So, I don’t think there is anything that’s worrisome there. It’s just a callout in terms of our margins in line.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: Hi, good morning everyone. So, I want to just perhaps go back to the kind of depletion trends and how you see it evolving for the rest of the summer and on the price – and the pricing commentary that you gave, in terms of timing – is it the timing around October, which is the typical historical trend for the industry or given the cost pressures you may anticipate this price increase will perhaps reduce the promotional levels as we go? And then related to that just so as a clarification, so you are saying the second quarter pressure is on gross margin for the beer business would be slightly less than what we saw and then compounded the cadence through the rest of the fiscal year given that FX has been more favorable now that the beers are depreciating or should we still see some sort of the same magnitude pressure on the second quarter? Thank you.
David Klein: So let me start with the last one first. So in terms of gross margin in Q2, we expect that some of – we will still have some transportation headwinds we actually expect instead of having an FX headwind will have a bit of an FX tailwind and we will get some of the operational benefits that I touched on earlier. So, any operating margin pressure in Q2 will really come from the incremental spend behind our brands that I talked about from a marketing standpoint being in that 10% to 11% range of net sales. We are working through our price increase process. Our revenue councils have been meeting working with our sales people to try to arrive at our pricing increase, which will take place in October, it will be announced before then. So, we see no changes on that front. And depletions I would say that 9% were quite strong, especially given the weather effects that we are seeing across the country, but in particular for us, in California, which is in our largest market. So, we are very happy with those depletion trends and we are feeling pretty bullish on the performance of that business throughout the remainder of the year.
Andrea Teixeira: Thanks, David. And on depletion, can you give us like how much was each quarter so that we can see the cadence?
David Klein: No, we don’t really give depletion guidance.
Andrea Teixeira: Okay. And I am saying within the month of the fiscal – the first quarter fiscal ‘19?
David Klein: Yes, we don’t break it out to that level, but again, just generally and you can assume that March was soft in California, April was soft elsewhere in the country and May looked pretty strong, so.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: Hi, thank you. So, I wanted to touch on Premier and Familiar as well please. So, two questions. In terms of the distribution gains, can you contextualize how your kind of ACV like has changed and perhaps like kind of the size of your shelf set has changed with this incremental innovation, one and number two, any callouts in terms of competitive responses? Thank you.
Rob Sands: Yes, Vivien. ACV is a great story. We built ACV in Premier thus far to 63% and Familiar without it being introduced everywhere to 37%. So, we are pretty excited about that. And as I sort of indicated, I placed that in the category of excellent results and even potentially above our own expectations. And then I would say in terms of the shelf, we are fundamentally getting incremental shelf space for these products, which is great and makes a lot of sense for the retailers. I mean I would say that retail is getting it, okay, retail understands and they are getting that they can increase their own sales and profitability by getting behind this portfolio, Constellation’s portfolio. So, we continue to be by a factor of many folds, the largest provider of growth at retail of any beverage alcohol company period in the United States. So, we are pretty pleased with these results which is one of the reasons I would say why we have the stomach, okay, to invest behind the portfolio, the way that we have invested behind the portfolio. So, we are pretty confident as we sit here right now that this is going to work out well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: Hi. So, one is just a quick follow-up on gross margins on beer, David, just was there any impact on Q1 related to any of the trades been linked to the Premier and the Familiar expansion? And then secondly the broader question just really on the Corona brand family, so obviously the new innovations are lifting the gross rate of the entire family, which is positive, but you are seeing slowdown in terms of the Corona Extra and the Corona Light declining? And I know Rob you talked about cannibalization actually being pretty close to your expectations, so what do you think is happening to those particular brands? And is there any concern that even though the family is accelerating that particularly those brands are a little bit soft as you think about the growth rate into maybe next year as you lap the innovation driven growth this year?
Rob Sands: Yes. I guess, I will comment on the last point. As I said, cannibalization is well within what we expected and predicted. We don’t see cannibalization really being a huge factor except perhaps against Corona Light, which I would say is what we expected. Any impacts on Corona – Corona Extra, which is performing very well is probably mostly weather-related in March in the first month. And frankly, I don’t really like to bring the weather off, because it doesn’t really matter and I think that we fully expect the portfolio and the base portfolio to respond or to perform as we expected. If you take a look at the whole Corona family, for instance, we were tracking, I don’t know, 200 or 300 basis points or 200 basis points behind where we were for the first quarter. So, that only appears to us that one plus one meaning the base portfolio plus the new products is adding up to 3, not just 2 or even below 2. So I think we are at 14.7% IRI, so – and higher than that for the latest. So, on consumer takeaway is very, very strong across the entire portfolio. As I said, Corona Light, we expected some cannibalization there.
David Klein: And Judy, there was no real meaningful effect on the drag on margins as a result of the new product launches. Those were quite smooth based upon some really good work out of our production folks.
Judy Hong: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.
Robert Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. Rob, I was wondering if you could perhaps reflect on how you are looking at the cannabis opportunity touching on what roughly kind of your investment level and e-cannabis related projects this year. Do you see that being more or less than what you thought it would be 6 months ago? And in addition, can you address the potential of doing something in California, Loginetis is coming out of a product in 1 to 2 months, is there anyway in which you can create a separate subsidiary or something that would give you regulatory comfort that you could enter that market at some point in the future even if we don’t get full federal legalization. Is it even a remote possibility? Thank you.
Rob Sands: So, first of all, Robert, our investment in cannabis is completely in line with what we expected, but that said, we are making a significant investment in Canada from an operating point of view. We all know of our investment in Canopy and of course that’s working out quite well, but we didn’t do it specifically to speculate on Canopy stock, because that’s not what we do. We did it to, in essence, have a stake in Canopy and to create what’s almost a joint venture between ourselves and Canopy to develop product for the world market, okay, including the U.S. So, we have a team and a significant team of people that both came out of Constellation as well as new hires sort of the full accouterment that’s necessary to really develop products. They are headquarters, we call them, Green Star, they are headquartered in Toronto and they are working diligently with many of the major both advertising firms and marketing firms and consulting firms for that matter. We also have Bane engaged on that topic meaning cannabis, so that we are ensuring that we are covering all fronts on that. I think that as to your question about the United States, the answer is, is that we are not going to do anything that is violative of federal law, but that said, we are looking closely at precisely that issue and making sure that we understand what we can do and what we can’t do. And sort of as you implied there maybe things that we can do and we will do them if we can do them as I said it’s not violative of federal laws and we would like to. So, yes, we are aware of the Loginetis. What they are saying, let me put it that way, I don’t have any really true inside knowledge of exactly what they are doing and how they are doing it, but we are pretty interested in what they are doing and how they are doing it and we don’t intend to get caught and becoming from behind. So I suppose therefore the answer to your question is yes, we are looking at it pretty carefully and if we see that opportunity within the confines of what we can legally do, we will do it.
Robert Ottenstein: Terrific. That’s very clear. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group.
Tim Ramey: Thanks so much. Hey, good morning. I think Rob probably continued talking in the couple of minutes that you weren’t on the call and if it was true to form previous calls it might have been when you are discussing some of the brand performance in beer, Modelo Especial, we didn’t hear any commentary on that if there was some? So that would be one question to maybe repeat some of that. And second of the wine grapes, based on my data, it looks like 2017 would have been flat to down from ‘16 so you understanding your FIFO structure, should we expect some easing of that as we roll forward?
Rob Sands: I will let David address that. Yes, I think we have some technical difficulties in the call. And I believe I was talking about wine and spirits and perhaps what the part that was deleted was the fact that, that I said that we would reiterate – we wanted to reiterate that we are committed to growing net sales and operating income for our wine and spirits business in the 2% to 4% range in fiscal 2019, which is what our original guidance was, so. And then I think I was talking a little bit about appointing Jim Sabia, who is our beer marketing guy, historically to the position of Chief Marketing Officer for the whole company. So, I think that that’s what was cut out. And then on Modelo Especial, I think that I was saying that we had double-digit depletions in Q1 and so we see everything to be all good with Modelo Especial. Like some other brands, March was a bit dicey in the beer industry as a general proposition, especially in California in our largest market, but I think that the good news there is that we outperformed everybody else probably to the same extent that we have in the past and we saw everything bounce back. And if you look at Modelo Especia’s latest IRI, it’s up 20%. So, we just don’t see anything there that’s indicative that our Mexican beer portfolio will perform in accordance with our guidance and in fact, we think it’s performing above – a bit above our expectations at the current time. So, we are very optimistic in general about hitting both the beer guidance and the wine and spirits guidance. I will just talk a moment about the wine side of the business, which first quarter was weaker than we would have liked on the depletion front and that was largely due to a couple of factors, really two factors, number one, strong finish to last year, so I think that there was some timing there and some borrowing perhaps at retail from the first quarter, but nothing untoward and I think that we will see that made up as we go forward here. I think we will see depletions fundamentally performing at sort of the historical level and you have been looking sort of the 12-week or the 52-week and sort of see what that is. And then last year we had – we ran ourselves out of Meiomi and I say ran ourselves out of it was really due to the fact that sales were so stellar that we ran out of Meiomi and then we rebuilt that pipeline in the first quarter, as you recall we have like this, why are we good first quarter last year in wine and spirits. And so we are overlapping that still, which also accounted for some of the performance below expectations on wine and spirits for the first quarter, but we don’t really see that necessarily impacting the whole year and we see the wine and spirits business performing in line with the market as we have been saying for quite a long time now and we don’t see any real chinks in that armor. There is nothing happening with our brands that is contrary to what’s been happening in the past. And in fact, we have got a lot of really strong marketing programs that are hitting strong promotional programs that are hitting our innovation pipeline on the wine and spirits side. I think it’s the strongest than it’s ever been. So, we are optimistic on wine and spirits as well.
David Klein: And on the COGS question, Tim, so last year we finished with gross margins in the wine business kind of just sub 45% and then coming out of Q1 where we are just above 43%. We expect to grow our gross margins year-over-year in the wine business, so yes, that implies a combination of mix improvements some work we have done from an overhead and operational standpoint as well as blend improvements, which are inclusive of grape costs.
Tim Ramey: Is it a fair statement that ‘17 was flat to down versus ‘16 in terms of grape costs?
David Klein: Yes, I am not sure as it relates across – as it ties out across our portfolio, but we can get back to you on that.
Tim Ramey: Fair enough. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
Rob Sands: Hi, Bill.
Bill Chappell: Hey, good morning. Just following back upon Premier and Familiar, you have given out the ACV numbers, can you just kind of give us some color of where you thought they were going to be this quarter, because you last reported 3 months ago and something happened obviously in the 3-month timeframe to pull forward the marketing, was it a big customer added more or was it just across the board, there was much more ACV than you had expected kind of going into the planning process, just trying to understand how, maybe it seems like it was a pretty quick shift and meaningful shift in a very short amount of time? So maybe even just from ACV, what you thought it would be?
Rob Sands: So, Bill, we don’t really plan ACV quite that specifically in terms of the numbers. So all I really say is I think that the numbers that I quoted were above what we expected, which basically means that we had more, even better retail take-up than we expected. I mean, it’s sort of as simple as that. I’d say like whether it’s 300 basis points or 400 basis points or whatever and I think it would be sort of soft history to start talking about those numbers in hindsight. And then on the marketing, we did not pull it forward. We plan to do what we have done. In actuality, we thought that we had communicated that pretty specifically that we were going to be making significant investments behind the introduction of these new products in the first half of this year. We thought we had communicated that. And the only reason I’d say I thought we communicated that, I think that people seem a little surprised about it. But to be clear, we didn’t pull anything forward at all. We did exactly as we plan to do and there is no way around it, we have significant investment spending in the first quarter against these new products. The good news is, this is not a plan to invest money for some long-term – on some long-term basis that is immeasurable. We do think it’s a very, very good investment for the long-term, but in terms of seeing our return on this investment, we expect to see the return on this investment this year. So, that’s why – and we are seeing it and that’s why we are confident in the guidance and that’s why we were able to give the guidance that we gave in the first place, which we think is pretty robust performance for our company and for consumer goods company, I mean it still puts us, I mean, in a percentile that can hardly be measured. So, that’s basically the story.
Bill Chappell: That helps. So, it’s just reading it and I understand what you are saying the comments at our conference maybe a few weeks ago was more of we said this before, we on the Street just didn’t hear it clearly and so we are trying to reemphasize that. Is that the right way to think about that?
Rob Sands: Yes, I would say that. And again I just reemphasized one thing in particular, which is we didn’t do anything. Our explanation is not that we did something this quarter that we were fully planning to do. We did what we plan to do and based on our internal expectations things performed as well as we expected if not better. So, we are on track for our guidance for the full year. I mean, I guess in the end, you can wait and see how the year turns out rolling in the first quarter.
Bill Chappell: Perfect. That’s crystal clear. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane: Hey, good morning. Two quick ones. One, David on the FX effect on beer gross margins, just how much of a headwind was it in the first quarter and how much of a like tailwind given where the exchange rate is now be expected to be in the balance of the year?
David Klein: Yes. So, there are really two components of FX was the small headwind to GP in Q1, but it was a larger headwind through at operating income, because we have as the peso weakened in the quarter and we have the reval or peso receivables with the biggest one being our VAT receivable, there was a reasonably sized SG&A drag on our beer business. So again, at the operating income line it was a larger drag than it was at the GP line. And then going forward we are about just over 80% hedged for the year at reasonably favorable rates and so actually the pace has been a bit volatile leading into the elections this weekend. So I would say it’s probably too early to say, but we know we had a headwind in the first quarter and we are pretty confident it’s a tailwind for the rest of the year and I guess the size will be determined on what happens maybe even in the election over the weekend.
Bryan Spillane: Okay, great. And then just one second one on Corona Premier, can you give us a sense of where it’s sourcing its share from. So is it coming from domestic premium light, is it coming from above premium or even outside the sector, is it coming from spirits, just any sort of color or early indication you have of where it’s pulling its consumers from? Thank you?
Rob Sands: I would say, it’s pretty much pulling its consumers from across domestic premium as a general proposition. So I think that your characterization of it is probably correct meaning it’s – I think it’s probably pulling its consumers from domestic premium lights and that kind of makes sense when you think about it, because it’s a low calorie, low carbohydrate beer, I would say that it’s primary competition, Michelob, also continues to perform well. So, yes, I don’t think there is evidence that it’s pulling necessarily from there, but Mic Ultra and I think Corona Premier is pulling from the premium light is probably the bottom line. People are drinking the light beer in the first place, aren’t all of a sudden switching from non-light beer to light. There you made the decision that they weren’t going to drink light, so I think that the simple logic would suggest that this is a premium choice for the already health conscious and light consumer. That’s what I would believe.
Bryan Spillane: Okay, great. Thank you. Have a great weekend everyone.
Rob Sands: You too.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
Rob Sands: Hi, Lauren.
Lauren Lieberman: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Two quick things. One was just one brand you haven’t mentioned, which is Pacifico outside of your prepared remarks and I know I get Nielsen data, which doesn’t seem to be all that representative, IRI seem to do a better job for you guys, but Pacifico even as the weather improved looks to not be performing terribly well again in the scanner data. I was just surprised to see that as you are kicking off the national launch of the 12-pack on the TV. So I would just be curious to hear any commentary on Pacifico performance and what the scanner might be missing? And then also just on the distribution footprint, so there is the trade press, the gossipy stuff isn’t a lot of chatter about some changes you guys have been making in your distributor footprint. So, any color you could offer there on what’s been driving decision-making process and if there is any records to be set straight versus what’s kind of been reported again in the trade press would be great? Thank you.
Rob Sands: Sure. So, first of all, on Pacifico, Pacifico is almost in the vast, vast majority of it is very regional in largely Southern California. So, it was probably affected by the weather in Southern California in the earlier part of the quarter to a greater extent than others. If you look at the performance outside of Southern California, it continues to perform at double-digits. And in general, it’s looking very good. We see no real issue with Pacifico other than that. That market has been – was pretty weak in the first quarter and Pacifico was affected by it, but it continues to be a very strong brand that I think that we have very high hopes for and we don’t see anything dashing those of. Now, on the distributor question, number one I would say that we have the best distribution network in the country, we call it the Gold Network, we call it the Gold Network for a reason, because it’s like making gold, it’s as simple as that. The one change that we made in Southern California was the only one change. So I think that characterizing it as some kind of change in our distributor footprint in general or some kind of change in our philosophy of how we deal with or treat our distributor partners is simply incorrect, I think that it was kind of interesting news and there is a lot of pundits that we have a lot to say about it. But the fact of the matter is, is that it was one change in a market and the change made a lot of sense, because we were able in that particular market to give that territory to another one of our very important distributor partners. So, that change as I said made a lot of sense to us. Interestingly, I think that the trade press glossed over another change that we made, which I think is very significant and probably more significant, which is the fact that we gave our entire wine and spirits business in the Pacific Northwest, i.e., Washington and Oregon to our longtime beer distributor up there at Columbia, which I think is an interesting thing, because it is aligned with our total beverage alcohol strategy, not that, that’s necessarily something that we intend to do either on a broader base and so in either case, it’s just simply not appropriate to extrapolate what we did in either one of those cases necessarily to any broader, I’d say, point about the network other than what we did in those specific instances. So, we have a great relationship with our wholesalers. We are the company that’s really providing 100% of their growth in many cases now, especially as you see craft having slowed down a bit. And I have to say that the results that we have achieved in our beer business and that we continue to achieve in our beer business is in a large part due to the efforts and the investment and really the skill of what we call our Gold Network and those distributors. So, the only thing I would say is you can’t take one move and extrapolate it to mean anything whatsoever in a network that has 500 or 600 distributors across the entire United States, there is always something going on in stock market relative to the network. And I would say we have better relationships than anybody. I would say we will have better relationships than anybody and I would say that the network is completely intact and a very, very strong network. They may change the name of it from the Gold Network to the Platinum Network in fact.
Lauren Lieberman: Alright, thank you.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets. Amit, your line is open. Please state your question.
Rob Sands: Well, that’s an easy question to answer, Amit.
Operator: Sir, your phone is on mute, please un-mute it. There is no response from that line. I will now return the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Okay. Well, I want to thank everybody for joining our call today. Let me just reiterate that our business prospects remain very strong and I’d like to reiterate that we are confident in achieving our full year goals as we are expecting a strong back half to the fiscal year. As the July 4 holiday approaches, I hope that everybody gets to enjoy some of our fine beer, wine and spirits products at your celebrations with family and friends. So, thanks everybody and have a fantastic rest of your summer.
Operator: Thank you for participating in the Constellation Brands’ first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be open for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks Maria. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's year end fiscal 2018 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Rob, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will have us end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance. And now here's Rob.
Robert Sands: Thanks Patty. Good morning and welcome to our year end call. Fiscal 2018 marked another year of excellent execution and impressive results for Constellation that generated EPS growth of almost 30%. This is the fifth consecutive year that we've achieved industry-leading EPS growth of more than 20%, an accomplishment of which I am very proud. I believe it's worth reviewing some of the key accomplishments that drove this result, as they illustrate our commitment to sustaining profitable growth and building shareholder value. I'll follow that up with a review of our business performance along with some of the great initiatives we have underway for fiscal 2019. Throughout the year, we made value-creating portfolio moves that aligned with our premiumization strategy and enabled us to capitalize on U.S. market trends that favor high end beverage alcohol brands. This included our acquisition of Schrader Cellars, a highly rated portfolio of fine wines sourced from Napa Valley, Vineyards that sell for $225 to $250 per bottle to customers on its mailing list as well as Funky Buddha, a regional craft brewer in South Florida, where it is the largest craft brewery by size and volume. Each of these additions boast award-winning, high end products and excellent growth prospects. These activities were complemented by Constellation Ventures' investments, including the Real McCoy, a high-end rum, Aging American Oak bourbon barrels as well as Copper & Kings, a high end American-craft brandy that is naturally distilled in copper pot stills and matured in Kentucky bourbon barrels. I'm also excited about our investment in Kennedy Growth, the largest publicly traded cannabis supplier in the world and a leader in the medical cannabis market in Canada. This investment provides Constellation with the first mover advantage for a potentially significant, emerging consumer opportunity and aligns with our long-term strategy to identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, while maintaining focus on our core total beverage alcohol business. From an operational perspective, we made planned strategic investments in our beer business and completed the next expansion phases of our Nava and Obregon breweries, which collectively now provide 31.5 million hectoliters of brewing capacity for our fast growing beer business. We also fired up furnace number four at our Nava glass plant, which is already showing excellent performance as we begin to optimize its efficiencies. We recently launched our fit for growth initiative, which is a multiyear program designed to prioritize resources across the company in support of our most critical growth opportunities. And we promoted Bill Newlands to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer. In this expanded role, Bill has oversight and accountability for all operating aspects of the company. I look forward to working closely with Bill to execute our growth agenda. Overall, our strong financial results and record operating cash flow generated in fiscal 2018 created flexibility that enabled value creating investments to support the ongoing growth of our business. And we returned more than $1.4 billion to our shareholders through a combination of significant share repurchases and a sizable dividend increase. Collectively, these accomplishments helped us remain one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Index. Let's move now to the excellent business performance that I just mentioned as a critical component to our success. Our beer business continues to be a powerhouse for growth, with its winning streak of 31 quarters of consecutive growth as the number one brewer and seller of imported beers in the U.S. market. Constellation also remains the number one high end beer company and growth contributor to the U.S. beer category, outperforming the overall U.S. beer industry and all key competitors. As we look back at the past year's accomplishments and ahead to fiscal 2019, let's begin our discussion with Corona Extra and Modelo Especial brand families, which drove strong execution and sales increases throughout the past year. Corona Extra achieved record case volumes in fiscal 2018 and has steadily been growing base velocity for five consecutive years. It has gained share every month throughout the past year, and it is the only top five beer brand that is in growth mode. And with Hispanics, Corona Extra continues to have the highest brand awareness, certainly signs of a very, very healthy brand. The Corona brand family closed out fiscal 2018 with strong growth momentum supported by strong TV, video and social media marketing and advertising activities. Corona Familiar gained distribution following its regional expansion of 12-bottle packages in the key states and became the number three high end share gainer. And Corona Premier prepared to launch nationwide with the first national Corona line extension in more than 25 years. We are well-positioned in fiscal 2019 with a great lineup of activities to support the growth, momentum of this brand family. Corona Extra kicks off a new sponsorship as the official cerveza of the San Francisco Giants and will become the official import beer of this year's Kentucky Derby. English and Spanish language national TV campaigns will be launched to support the brand with this year's increased media investments focused on sports properties. New TV ads featuring Corona Extra and Corona Light together will begin running in advance of the Cinco de Mayo holiday and we will begin launching our new TV ad campaigns in support of the Premier and Familiar lunches beginning next month. Now moving to Casa Modelo, this trio of brands, which includes Modelo Especial, Negra and Chelada, has been an amazing growth story, quadrupling to more than 110 million cases in 10 years, making this brand family the number one source of growth in the entire U.S. beer category for the past decade. In fiscal 2018, Modelo Especial alone achieved the 100 million case milestone and grew depletions 17%. Modelo Especial was the fastest-growing draft in the on-premise channel and the number two share gainer in the off-premise last year. It's now a top five beer brand in 11 major U.S. markets, including New York, D.C., and Denver. And even more impressive, Modelo Especial is now the number one beer in the State of California, fueled by its number one position in L.A. and San Francisco. Last year, Modelo Especial had the highest increase in household penetration in the entire U.S. beer category. Casa Modelo has plenty of upside from ongoing distribution expansion opportunities in the coming year. Dedicated media spend will increase by more than 20% in fiscal 2019, which will be heavily weighted the high profile programming on ESPN and other entertainment networks as well as live sports property, such as the NFL and the NBA. And as of January 1st, Modelo became the official beer for the UFC, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which is one of the fastest-growing sports in America. Last year, the Modelo Chelada family grew almost 40%, with the launch of Tamarindo Picante, which became the number one single-serve item in the U.S. beer market and propelled the Chelada family to greater than 30% market share of the Chelada category. Modelo Chelada Especial was also awarded the prestigious Nielsen's Breakthrough Innovation Award of 2017, a feat that only 18 brands achieved from a pool of more than 4,500 new CPG items. As you are aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our biggest brands. In fiscal 2018, Pacifico was the second fastest growing major beer brand in the U.S. beer category and a top 15 share gainer and we believe it has the potential to be the next big national brand in our beer business. In fiscal 2019, we are executing a national launch of the Pacifico 12-pack can to build on the success of the 24-ounce SKU. The 12-pack can format will be a big part of Pacifico's first ever National Cinco de Mayo retail program and we are launching our first ever national TV campaign and our largest retail programs in the history of this brand. As such, you'll see Pacifico on high profile programs, like the Walking Dead as well as NBA, NHL, Major League Baseball, and college football. And Pacifico will, once again, be the official beer sponsor of the Burton U.S. Open of snowboarding as well as the Summer X Games, two of the largest and best known action sport events in this country. In addition to Corona Premier and Familiar, I'm also very excited about the new product lineup we've planned for 2019. We are introducing Western Standard, a barrel finished easy drinking lager that will be available in three test markets this summer at a high end price point. We are leveraging the equity and authenticity of our high end, small batch, high west whiskey brand and building up trends of craft spirits and barrel-aged beverages, which we're seeing in the wine and spirits space. We believe that this is the trend for the next American beer, sessionability, yet favorable. Another segment we are excited about is the ABA space. This is a growing market opportunity, and it's incremental to the beer category. Specta-spiked premium seltzer will be introduced in three flavors and is made from natural ingredients and contains no artificial flavors. At 100 calories, it is targeted as the female consumer, who is looking for better-for-you, right options that fit an attractive and active lifestyle. We plan to begin test marketing this summer. We will also begin test marketing Corona Refresca, a premium spiked refresher in two tropical flavors that are very, very refreshing. Our craft and specialty portfolio continues to stabilize. Last fall, we launched Ballast Point, Phantom IPA and recently began a national rollout of Phantom IPA draft. This new brand is already the third-best selling craft brand in our portfolio. Now, throughout fiscal 2019, we plan to continue our Ballast Point distributor transition to the Gold Network, drive focus around and across our core brands, deliver innovation and leverage our new tasting rooms to build stronger, local brand presence. Funky Buddha will continue to expand distribution in select new markets and we have a series of new product launches planned throughout the year. From a beer operations perspective, I've mentioned earlier that our current Nava and Obregon expansion projects have been completed as planned. As we evaluated our plans for fiscal 2019, including the future growth prospects of our beer portfolio, it became clear that we would need to expand capacity beyond what we have already planned due to the industry-leading growth being generated by the business. As such, we plan to increase our Nava footprint to 30 million hectoliters and expand Obregon by an additional 5 million hectoliters, while also continuing the buildout of Mexicali to 5 million hectoliters. Collectively, these projects will provide about 44 million hectoliters of capacity by fiscal 2023. We are in the enviable position of being the growth leader in the U.S. beer industry and these investments represent smart usage of our cash. David will discuss the magnitude and timing of these capital investments in just a few minutes. Overall, I'm excited about the growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2019. As you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business through enhanced distribution, excellent execution opportunities, and consumer-driven innovation across the portfolio. As a result, we are targeting beer business net sales and operating income growth in the 9% to 11% range in the coming year. And now I would like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business, which achieved significant margin improvement for the year, while gaining market share in the U.S. wine category. These results demonstrate that our wine and spirits premiumization strategy is working. Our brand investment strategy is driving positive mix and margin enhancement and we are winning in the marketplace as evidenced by our market share gains. These successes combined with our operational initiatives are contributing to operating leverage in the P&L. These results were primarily driven by our fast growing; higher margin Focus Brands, which grew depletions almost 7% for the year. Many of these Focus Brands achieved significant milestones and accomplishments last year. Several of our Focus Brands received impact 2017, Hot Brand Awards, including Meiomi, Black Box, Ruffino, Kim Crawford and Nobilo. Our products were also called out in the Beverage Information Group 2017 Awards, where five of our brands achieved fast-track status recognizing their impressive growth, including Black Box, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Nobilo, and the Prisoner. 14 of our brands were named rising stars and seven listed as established growth brands. Casa Noble took top spot multiple tequila categories in cigar and spirits, the best of 2017, while whiskey advocate named High West Campfire, one of the top 20 whiskeys of 2017. Now, from an operational perspective, we have improved our cost of goods sold management capabilities. We are using enhanced consumer insights to ensure that we are spending our COGS dollars on product attributes that are valued by consumers. We were also driving asset utilization to improve ROIC by getting the right fruit of the right vineyards for each brand, including international sourcing. We have improved yields as a result of process optimization and value engineering throughout the entirety of the production process and we've engaged in packaging simplification and optimized our production footprint. From a strategic perspective in fiscal 2019, we are focused on delivering against select key objectives. We will continue to execute a steady evolution to the high end of the U.S. wine and spirits category by capturing growth at higher price points to achieve mix and margin benefits, particularly at the greater than $11 price point at retail. This includes driving growth from our Focus Brands, which grew almost seven times the rate of the entire portfolio last year and represents approximately 70% of the profit of the wine and spirits business. We have plans to accelerate our consumer-led innovation and brand-building efforts. As such, we're focusing on capitalizing on hot trend opportunities, like rosé, creating higher price points with cross category innovation and developing new brands like, DERANGE, which is a red blend that retails for $100 per bottle. It's actually one of my personal new favorites. We are excited about the innovation brands we have currently launched and are planning to launch this coming year, including 7 Moons, SVEDKA Blue Raspberry Vodka, Cooper & Thief, especially the Sauvignon Blanc aids in Casa Noble tequila barrels and Black Box spirits, including whiskey, vodka and tequila, will be introduced in a phased rollout beginning this quarter. These collective efforts will be supported by impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build new and existing brands. We will continue to evolve our three-tiered e-commerce TBA strategy as well as our direct-to-consumer initiative as we clear plans to drive growth from these channels. And we have a long runway to continue to improve our operational capabilities in forecasting, asset utilization, flexibility, and throughput. Overall, we will continue to optimize our route-to-market strategy, revenue management, sales enablement, and operational processes. As I mentioned last quarter, while we have seen a slowdown in the U.S. wine industry, it has stabilized and remains healthy overall, with trends that continue to exceed U.S. CPG category growth. In addition, our SKU rationalization efforts are creating a headwind as we continue to carefully rationalize a subset of our portfolio of tail brands to simplify and premiumize the overall portfolio. Ultimately, we are committed to growing our wine and spirits business -- businesses ahead of the U.S. wine and spirits industry, while targeting margin expansion from ongoing price mix benefits and cost of goods activities. In closing, it has certainly been another exciting year at Constellation. Our achievements are many and have driven a year of strong, strong financial, commercial, and operational performance. In 2018, we delivered industry-leading market results from our beer business, while continuing to enhance our operational platform in Mexico to support the growth of our iconic Mexican beer brands. Within our wine and spirits businesses, we maintained our focus on premiumization, innovation, and brand building, which drove enhanced margins and wine market share gains. We are very, very proud to have delivered another rewarding year of value to our shareholders, and I'm pleased that our results can support a significant dividend increase and an enhancement to our dividend payout ratio in the coming year. With all of that, I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our financial results for fiscal 2018 and provide our outlook for fiscal 2019.
David Klein: Thanks Rob and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2018 was another tremendous year, as we continue to generate top tier growth in the CPG space. We generated over $7.5 billion of net sales and 7% organic net sales growth. We expanded operating margins in both businesses and improved our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by 270 basis points. We increased comparable basis EBIT by 13%. We increased comparable basis diluted EPS by 29%, which follows the 24% EPS growth we generated in fiscal 2017. And we produced over $1.9 billion of operating cash flow, which is an increase of 14%. The strong earnings and operating cash flow growth provided us with significant financial flexibility, as we continue to make capital investments in our Mexican beer operations, return cash to shareholders with more than $1 billion in stock repurchases and $400 million of dividend payments, while making investments in canopy growth and brands like Schrader and Funky Buddha. The stock repurchases represent 4.8 million shares at an average price of $216. Approximately, 75% of the repurchases occurred during the fourth quarter, as we believed the benefits of U.S. Tax Reform and our top line growth prospects were not appropriately being appreciated by the market. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio finished at 3.6 times versus 3.7 times at the end of fiscal 2017. We expect fiscal 2019 to be another year of strong financial performance as we're targeting healthy net sales, EBIT, comparable basis diluted EPS, and operating cash flow growth. While we continue to invest in our Mexican beer operations, our brands and in other areas in order to capture future growth opportunities. In addition, we're increasing our dividend by more than 40% and our dividend payout ratio to 30%, while we remain committed to our 3.5 times leverage ratio target. Let's look at fiscal 2018 performance in more detail where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales grew 10%, primarily due to volume growth of 9% in favorable pricing. Depletion growth for the year came in at 10%. Beer operating margin increased 320 basis points to 39.5%. We're extremely pleased with this operating margin performance, which we believe is best-in-class for North American brewing. The margin increase was driven primarily by lower COGS and favorable pricing. The lower COGS reflect strong operational performance, driven by glass and material sourcing benefits, foreign currency favorability, and supply independence from ABI. These benefits were partially offset by a $54 million increase in depreciation expense, which totaled $168 million for fiscal 2018. For wine and spirits, excluding the impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture, net sales increased by 5%. This includes 3% organic growth, driven primarily by favorable product mix, partially offset by lower volumes, along with the acquisition benefits from the Charles Smith, High West, and Prisoner brands. Total U.S. depletions grew 1% for the year, while our Focus brand portfolio posted 7% depletion growth. Wine and spirits operating margin increased 160 basis points to 27.4%. This improvement primarily reflects mix benefits from the portfolio premiumization efforts, including the Canadian wine business divestiture, partially offset by marketing investments in higher COGS. As a reminder, as part of our premiumization efforts, we've been rationalizing lower margin value brand SKUs. These actions impacted wine and spirits revenue growth by almost 100 basis points for fiscal 2018 while improving operating margin and ROIC. Interest expense for the year decreased slightly to $332 million as the benefit of lower average interest rates was mostly offset by higher average borrowings. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the year came in at 19% versus 26.8% last year. This reflects an increased benefit from lower taxes on foreign earnings in the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires excess tax benefits from stock-based payment awards to be recognized in the income statement. The fiscal 2018 rate also benefited from the new 21% U.S. federal statutory rate for the last two months of the fiscal year. Now, let's review Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $1.90, up 28%. Beer net sales increased 12%, primarily due to volume growth of 10% in favorable pricing. Beer operating margin remains steady at 38%, as pricing, along with operational and foreign currency benefits, were mostly offset by higher SG&A, including increased marketing spend for the quarter. Wine and spirits organic net sales increased 8%. This primarily reflects mix benefits, driven largely by strong sales of the Meiomi wine brand, which experienced tight supply in Q4 last year as strong consumer demand outpaced expectations. Wine and spirits operating margin increased 80 basis points to 27.4%, as benefits of favorable mix were partially offset by higher COGS in marketing investments. The higher COGS primarily reflect the impact of lower volumes for the quarter and the overlap of certain inventory cost benefits in Q4 of fiscal 2017. In Q4, we recognized an additional $236 million pretax gain from the change in fair value of the canopy investment and warrants, bringing the total pretax gain on this investment to $453 million. We recorded a net tax benefit of $363 million as a result of U.S. Tax Reform, which is comprised of a benefit from a reduction of our net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a one-time transition tax related to unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. And we also wrote down $19 million of bulk inventory -- bulk wine inventory due to smoke damage sustained form the California wildfires. We are pursuing insurance reimbursements for this loss. These items were excluded from our comparable basis financial results. Moving to fiscal 2018 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated $874 million compared to $789 million last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.9 billion, up 14%, primarily driven by our earnings growth; and CapEx totaled $1.1 billion, which was 17% above last year's spend. The CapEx in below our previous expectations due to timing. Moving to our full year fiscal 2019 P&L and free cash flow outlook. For fiscal 2019, we expect to leverage our ongoing portfolio premiumization efforts and execute the marketplace initiatives, outlined by Rob, to deliver another year of strong financial performance as we're projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $9.40 to $9.70 per share. The midpoint of this guidance has us growing EPS by approximately 10%. Our beer business is targeting net sales and operating income growth in the range of 9% to 11%. Our projections include 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. In fiscal 2019, we expect to see gross margin improvement, primarily from product pricing as benefits from glass sourcing initiatives and operational efficiencies are expected to be offset by increased depreciation. Looking closer at depreciation expense for the beer segment, it totaled $168 million in fiscal 2018. We expect that to increase by approximately 30% in fiscal 2019. We expect gross margin benefits to be mostly offset by incremental marketing investments in support of our innovation and other growth initiatives. These investments include $35 million for the national launch of Corona Premier as well as a regional expansion of the 12-ounce format of Corona Familiar. We're also rolling out our first-ever national advertising for Pacifico to drive awareness across the U.S. and supporting other programs like the Modelo Especial UFC sponsorship. The additional marketing spend in fiscal 2019 is expected to be weighted towards the first half of the year as we prepare for the upcoming Cinco de Mayo holiday and the summer selling season. Beer marketing as a percent of revenue finished fiscal 2018 at approximately 9% and the additional marketing spend that I outlined for fiscal 2019 could move that percentage up by 50 to 100 basis points. For the wine and spirits business, for fiscal 2019, we expect net sales and operating income growth of 2% to 4%. For sales, we're targeting low single-digit volume growth and continued mix benefits from our premiumization efforts. We expect mixed benefits and COGS productivity enhancements to be mostly offset by some cost increases, including higher grade and transportation cost and technology-focused SG&A investments, which will create operating efficiencies as we go forward. I'd like to remind everyone, from a first quarter standpoint, that in Q1 fiscal 2018, wine and spirits EBIT grew 22% and U.S. shipment volumes significantly outpaced depletions. This was driven by replenishment of Meiomi supplier, which was constrained coming out of Q4 fiscal 2017. As a result, our Q1 fiscal 2019 wine and spirits EBIT could be down 10% to 15%, with sales down low to mid-single-digits. This first quarter was contemplated when we set our guidance of 2% to 4% growth on the topline and bottom-line in our wine and spirits business. Shifting back to the full year fiscal 2019, to be clear, we are planning to expand operating margins in both business segments. However, we expect the deltas between sales and operating income growth to be contained within the range as provided. As I mentioned at the recent CAGNY Investor Conference, we've begun a multiyear program to make us fit for growth, whereby we will reengineer our business processes and implement a company-wide ERP platform to create better digital connectivity with our consumers and our customers. For fiscal 2019, in our corporate segment, we're planning approximately $20 million of incremental spend related to digital enablement activities, like the ERP platform I just mentioned and e-commerce initiatives as well as investments in personnel and resources to build brands and open new markets in support of our cannabis investment. These initiatives should help us stay ahead of trends to meet the needs of the perpetually evolving consumer. Let's transition to our tax rate where we are pleased with the overall net benefit resulting from U.S. Tax Reform, which will primarily be reinvested to support the long-term growth of our business. We expect our tax rate to approximate 19%, which is in line with our new 18% to 20% medium term effective tax rate. As a reminder, we were targeting a low to mid-20% tax rate prior to tax reform. While the year-over-year tax rate is expected to be flat, fiscal 2019 reflects the anticipated benefit from the new 21% U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily offset by an increased in our effective rate on foreign earnings, which will occur due to the adoption of ASU 2016-16. Under this accounting change, we will record a deferred tax asset at the beginning of fiscal 2019 for the future tax amortization of certain intangible assets. As a result of this amortization, we expect our cash tax rate to run at least 700 basis points lower than our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. For fiscal 2019, our tax payments are also expected to be reduced by prior year refunds. As a result, we expect our fiscal 2019 cash tax rate to be almost 10 percentage points below our effective tax rate. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $355 million to $365 million, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at 197 million. For clarity, our guidance assumes no share repurchases during fiscal 2019. I would also note that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. We expect fiscal 2019 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.55 billion and CapEx of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion. This includes approximately $900 million of CapEx for our Mexican beer operation expansion, including investments in Obregon, Mexicali, Nava, and the fifth glass furnace. We expect to finish fiscal 2019 with approximately 34 million hectoliters of brewing capacity. At this point, I'd like to highlight ASU 2014-09, the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which was effective for Constellation at the beginning of 2019. Under the new guidance, we'll recognize certain sales incentives earlier than we have historically. This change will shift net sales recognition between our fiscal quarters, but is not expected to have a material impact on full year net sales. We'll recast full year fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, along with fiscal 2018 quarters and provide this information in connection with our first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release. In closing, we believe we're well-positioned to continue to deliver best-in-class topline growth over the long-term. Our fiscal 2018 results, along with the growth-focused investments we are making while we project strong fiscal performance for FY 2019, demonstrates our commitment to create shareholder value through sustainable and profitable net sales growth. And with that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey guys. On the beer topline front, your beer portfolio market share accelerated in Q4 within a weaker category. So, any highlights on what drove the market share momentum, and does that give you visibility, as you look at to fiscal 2019 that you can aid your volume goals, even if the industry softens further? And also, can you just tease out specifically the net impact you're expecting from innovation on beer volume in fiscal 2019 guidance and a review of how the Familiar expansion and Premier launch are trending in the market so far in March?
Robert Sands: Yes, Dara. I'll comment on it all. I mean, first of all, yes, the fundamental answer to your question is yes. I think that our performance in the fourth quarter gives us a significant amount of confidence going into the first quarter and the fiscal year, regardless of what's happening in the beer category in general. In fact, I don't really think that the two are connected to the extent that we're looking at the beer category ex-Constellation's beer business. So, I don't think that there's that kind of interaction in that -- the beer category exclusive of Constellation really has much to do with how Constellation's beer brands are performing or will perform in the future. So, we feel pretty good about where we're going. And if the beer category softens further, it just probably means that we're going to have larger market share gains as we go into this year. And then new products, they are contributing to our growth this year. Our new products are performing, I would say, extremely well. I'm talking about the Premier and Familiar. And when I say performing well, reorder rates are very strong. And by all indications, it's looking like it's going to be an extreme -- they're going to be extremely good introductions and therefore, we're real optimistic. It's probably providing 200 to 300 basis points of our growth in fiscal 2019.
Dara Mohsenian: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.
Robert Sands: Hi Caroline.
Caroline Levy: Good morning. Thank you and what a great year. As we move forward, you're adding a lot more capacity than you'd originally planned for very good reasons. Do you think that that's the way this is going to continue, that each year, where initially, we thought there might be a falloff in CapEx in the outer years. If you keep up, a sort of close to double-digit topline growth rate, will you continue to add capacity at a similar rate?
Robert Sands: Well, we're planning out quite a number of years. So, I think the answer to your question is no. We're not going to continue to simply add capacity like this every year. But as we get out four, five years, if the growth continued to be, I'd say, outsized, we will have to add capacity at some point in the future. But I think that what we've -- what we're doing now pretty much covers us for a significant period of time. So, I don't think that you should be expecting more capacity projects in the near future. I think this takes us up to about 44 million hectoliters of capacity, okay, which should clearly get us to where we need to be through 2023. So, no. We're not going to be adding capacity at this rate in the near future.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
Lauren Lieberman: Good morning.
Robert Sands: Good morning.
Lauren Lieberman: I was curious if you could talk a little bit more, actually, about fit for growth. So, you mentioned it in the context of ERP systems, but I guess, other investments that are necessary to, kind of, go after the cost savings and any kind of quantification you could give and timeline for what you're expecting to be able to get out of fit for growth, and if that's -- where are those dollars are expected to go? And then just one follow-up was Rob, you said 200 to 300 basis points of growth coming from Premium and Familiar. I'm just assuming that's a growth number, that's not net of assumed cannibalization?
David Klein: So, I'll take the fit for growth and then also cover up on a -- on the cannibalization point. But -- so from a fit for growth standpoint, Lauren, we're doing this program because we think that there are ways for us to get more efficient as a company over -- by reengineering our business processes. We expect that the savings, which at this point, we're not ready to quantify publicly, the savings, we would expect that reinvest in growth initiatives like the initiatives that we talked about this year, like building a better digital connectivity with our consumers, with our customers, with our retailers; investing in creating and marketing brands and capabilities in the cannabis space; as well as looking at different ways to get our products to market from a DTC standpoint. These sorts of investments we want to make in our business and we feel that we can mine our current P&L to fund them. And that's really the point of the fit for growth program. We're really in the early stages of scoping out the ERP program and the process redesign work and so you'll hear more about that over the coming months. And then in terms of overall growth in the portfolio, I think the way to think about it, there are two ways to look at it, I suppose. One is we expect our base business net sales in beer to grow high single-digits. And so any difference between that base growth and the NPD, so Premier and Familiar is -- so the difference between the growth in our base business and our guidance is explained by Premier and Familiar. And so I would say that the 200 to 300 basis points is probably exclusive of cannibalization.
Lauren Lieberman: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: Thank you. Good morning.
Robert Sands: Hey Viv.
Vivien Azer: So, I wanted to double back on the beer category dynamics. Clearly, you guys are floating above the fray in terms of the competitive activity that mainstream price points. But we are hearing from the trade press, about heightened competitively at the high end as well, given some of the capacity issues that are happening in craft. So, a two-part question, please. Number one, I'd love your thoughts on what you're seeing in the craft category. And then number two, how does that inform you're thinking around price realization? Thank you.
Robert Sands: So, Vivian, I'd say a couple of things. Number one, I think that unfortunately, we talk about these categories generically and I think that even within these categories, there are subcategories and there's things that are going on that have really no impact whatsoever on other elements of what you're referring to as a category like the high end. So, first of all, if you looked at various definitions of the craft category, what you'll see is, on a total category basis that pricing in craft is pretty much consistent with the whole high end or everything else for that matter. But within craft, what you have seen is antidotal reports of various craft beer companies reducing prices and introducing cheaper, larger pack sizes, basically to do anything to try to stem their declines. These are specific companies. But it's not really across the whole category affecting pricing in the craft category. That's really more a function of the fragmentation of craft and the competition in craft with the hugely expanding number of craft breweries and the trend towards hyper localization and fragmentation for that matter. But in general, craft pricing is pretty stable at about plus 1.5%. Probably, more importantly, the antidotal pricing you're talking about has no -- zero interaction with us. It does not affect us whatsoever. If a particular craft brand, because they're falling out of bed drops, they're price to $9.99 or introduces a 15-pack at some cheap price, it matters not to us whatsoever and really doesn't affect the parts of the business that we play in. So, most importantly, I guess, to get directly to the point, we don't see anything that's going on across the beer industry or any category for that matter that would cause us to do anything differently than our normal 1% to 2% price increase to cover typical inflation in the business. So, we feel good about that. We don't see anything that's occurring that we think would jeopardize that.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Robert Sands: Hi Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: Thank you. Hi. So, I was hoping you guys could drill down a little bit more on your Q4 beer margins, which ended up better than, I think, you guys had been expecting, based on some comments you made few months ago. So, just wanted to understand the key drivers of that. And then, David, you mentioned you expect beer margin expansion in FY 2019, but your guidance really doesn't call for much. So, you touch on that, please, and the factors you expect that could limit beer margin upside? And then I'd just love some thoughts on long-term expectations for beer margins, what's realistic? Thank you.
David Klein: Yes. So, in terms of Q4, the things that were really a little different from may be where we expected it to land was performance in particular continued, really strong operating performance at Obregon from a cost perspective. We also sad some FX benefits that are -- that we got in the fourth quarter, that's may be more of a timing benefit than anything else, because some of the peso strengthening that we were seeing coming into the quarter that we were concerned about actually ended up getting captured in inventory at year-end. So, it's just a timing difference. In terms of the margin guidance, we are -- we expect that, depending on upon where you pick net sales number and where you pick your operating margin number in that 9% to 11% range you can see that there's some amount, although, as you say, limited amounts of margin expansion plant in our numbers. But that's inclusive of the investment that we're making in the launch of Premier and Familiar, which, as we said, would take our marketing spend as a percent of net sales up by between 50 and 100 basis points for the fiscal year. I would say that over time, Bonnie, I probably would say that we -- we'll continue to drive as much operating margin as we can out of the business. We like the trends we're seeing in the -- in gross margin. We think we can get a little sharper over time from an SG&A standpoint. But we'll continue to invest in our brands from a marketing standpoint. So, I would say that we think that there's some amount of margin expansion to be had over the next couple of years, but I would put it in a reasonably small bucket, as we are really going to try to continue to drive the topline of the business. And for me, that's the thing, I think, that's missed a little bit by our story is, the power of the topline growth of our beer business, where last year, we grew 10%. This year, we have a range to grow 9% to 11%. We're setting ourselves up to continue to grow at that rate for the foreseeable future. And so I guess, we would be -- we want to make sure we're appropriately investing in our brands as opposed to just dropping on dollars to the bottom-line.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: Hi. Thank you for taking my question and congrats. Just wanted to follow-up on your guidance for the funding for growth, if you will, this new program. For the expenditures that you're hoping for this ERP, are they included in your guidance within the range of margins that you have on the ongoing -- on the growing margin guidance? And also, if you can comment a little bit on wine. If you, kind of, a normalize after you cycle this impact on the first quarter, what is the kind of growth that you're seeing on depletions? I mean I understand, obviously, the Focus Brands, but if you look at it like excluding these effect, we are looking at, obviously, a much bigger -- if you can do the math, a much better improvement after this effect in the first quarter. Thank you.
David Klein: Yes. So, on the fit for growth in ERP question, that's included in our guidance. Again, that's part of why you see costs -- our corporate costs going up. In terms of wine growth, we -- Rob mentioned that we had seen a bit of a slowdown from where we were over, say, the last five to 10 years in the wine business. We saw a bit of a slowdown in calendar year 2017. We, however, are also seeing a bit of a bifurcation within the wine business, where -- and Bill talked about this at the CAGNY Conference, where above the -- that $11 price point, which is somewhat arbitrary, but above that $11 price point, we're seeing market growth that are in the range of 13% versus 1% growth rate for the brands below the $11 price point. And we believe that you see this capability in our portfolio when you see the growth that we have in our Focus Brands versus the growth in the rest of the market. And so we remain quite bullish on our Focus Brands, while we continue to work the SKU rationalization sorts of activities that we've talked about in the past, which, as Rob mentioned, is creating a drag on the business, so about 100 basis points in FY 2018 and we'll have included in our guidance, some amount of drag, maybe in the 50 basis points range during FY 2019.
Andrea Teixeira: Thank you, David. Just a follow-up on FX. What is embedded in your guidance, in terms of, you always hedged part of your COGS? Can you update us on the range of FX that you disclosed before?
David Klein: Yes. I think, from an FX standpoint, at this point in the year, we're probably around 60% hedged. Our biggest exposure, as you know, is to the peso, and the peso has been fairly stable recently, although, we expect there could be some volatility in the peso, as we go through the public discussions around NAFTA and the elections in Mexico.
Andrea Teixeira: And you're ready to disclose the amounts that you're hedged at or--
David Klein: Yes. I just -- again, I think, we're roughly in that 60% hedged range as we go into the year.
Andrea Teixeira: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank.
Stephen Powers: Great. Good morning guys.
Robert Sands: Good morning.
Stephen Powers: I guess just given how important increased distribution is to the beer-growth algorithm, can you talk about your line of sight to incremental points of distribution entering fiscal 2019 across all the brand families inclusive of Premier, Familiar but also, what you expect on Modelo, Pacifico, and craft? And I guess, as you think about that, I'm curious about two things. First, what portion of the gains embedded in the outlook you feel at this point is more or less locked in versus what you need to go out incrementally win over the course of the year? And then second, just for context, as your conversations with distributors and retailers have taken shape, if there's any way to frame how this year's setup compares to what you might have saw entering fiscal 2018? That'd be great context. Thanks.
Robert Sands: So, our line of sight to getting more distribution is very good, in that we have definitive distribution gaps in big -- parts of our portfolio. And therefore, we have a lot of upside, especially when you look at the Modelo Especial family and when you look at brands like Pacifico, there continue to be huge upsize to be gained in distribution, and our organizations are all tasked and incentivized against getting that distribution. So, I'd say, we have very good line of sight into getting the distribution. And therefore, it's just another factor that goes into the confidence that we have in the business of continuing along the same lines that it has and in the guidance that we've given. So, there's really no magic to any of that. It's all about sales execution and where we are in terms of what the gaps are, and our people are acutely aware of where the gaps are, and they will be continuing to drive against closing those gaps. So, I'd say, a high line of sight.
David Klein: And I would also say, Stephen, that we believe that we've said before 50% of our growth is sourced from distribution. We think that we can continue that for the next several years, meaning that we have, as Rob said, line of sight into distribution opportunities that allow us to continue on that growth trajectory for the next few years.
Stephen Powers: Okay, that's great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Robert Sands: Hi Bryan.
Bryan Spillane: Good morning everyone. Just that -- I wanted a follow-up, I guess, on Caroline's question earlier around CapEx. And forgive me if might've missed this. But David, could you just kind of give us some sense of beyond 2019, how CapEx sort of phases with the capacity expansion, and maybe just remind us of, kind of, where you sit now in terms of what maintenance CapEx levels are? And then sort of what the growth CapEx is going to be over the next several years?
David Klein: So, Bryan, the way I think about it, and when we get out a couple of years in capital, we're all kind of making the numbers up. But when I think about it, we know that we've committed to -- after FY 2019, capital expenditures in Mexico that are in the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion range. And we know that that all needs to be completed by FY 2023. That's likely to be front-end loaded in that time period, because we're building out capacity. In addition to that, in the rest of our business, just broadly speaking, we spend about $200 million in CapEx, that's the corporate initiatives, wine and spirits. And then just as a placeholder, we've been thinking, its $100 million to $200 million of spend in our beer business from an -- on an ongoing business for maintenance as well as for value engineering and return-generating investments in our production assets outside of simple capacity expansion. So, I think that kind of frames up where we see CapEx beyond FY 2019.
Bryan Spillane: So, that would mean, I guess, that like 2020 CapEx might look similar to fiscal 2019, and then it begins to kind of taper from there. Would that be a good way to, kind of, think about modeling it?
David Klein: Yes, I think that's fair.
Bryan Spillane: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research.
Timothy Ramey: Thanks so much. Congratulations. I was interested in your comment on the $19 million write-down of smoke damage to bulk wine. Are you seeing that more broadly in the industry? And does that firm up the bulk wine market? Does that wine, that's written down, still exist for the bulk wine market? Or is it essentially condemned?
Robert Sands: So, we're -- I'd say, interestingly enough, we're probably the first company to talk about this. I believe that there's probably a significant amount of smoke tainted or damaged bulk wine or wine out there in the tanks and in the valley. I think that it's not something that everybody's necessarily telegraphing. I don't know how it's going to affect the bulk wine market other than I don't believe that is -- will have any effect on us, whatsoever. And we're certainly not going to use any of the tainted -- smoke-tainted bulk wine or buy any. And I think that from what I hear, a few others -- some of the most premium guys who are now realizing that there's some smoke-tainted wine out there, I've heard of a couple that are going to skip the vintage. But I don't -- this isn't going to have any impact on us or our ability to meet our guidance. Our wine business is very strong. We've got some fantastic brands that are just really blowing the facts off a lot of the industry. Things like Meiomi and Kim Crawford and Prisoner could get some unbelievable innovation out there, like DERANGE, which is our new high-end wine blend out of the Prisoner Wine Company, part of our business. We've really been leaders in driving the new, sort of, barrel-aged spirits or Bourbon Barrel-Aged wines with our Robert Mondavi Private Selection, which is in significant growth and Cooper & Thief, which is -- I think, it'll turn out to be a significant phenomenon where we've extended that to tequila, Barrel-Aged Sauvignon Blanc, which I'd say try it. It's very unusual wine. So, the smoke taint issue is a small one. We don't expect it to be a recurring matter. It's relatively immaterial to us. And we don't expect it to have any impact on us going forward. But yes, I think that there's some smoke-tainted wine out there in the valley.
Timothy Ramey: Actually I was thinking of it from a positive perspective, given that, as you put it, skipping of vintage and making an insurance claim it's one of the best ways to enhance margins and perhaps pricing and [Indiscernible], would you -- do you think that's overstating it?
Robert Sands: For some companies, I'd say that, that's possibly the case. We're not going to have to skip our vintage in any of our wines as a consequence of this. But it may be the case with some others, and it could work to their advantage or disadvantage. I'm not actually really sure, one way or the other. So--
Timothy Ramey: Thanks Rob.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.
Amit Sharma: Hi good morning everyone.
Robert Sands: Good morning.
Amit Sharma: Rob, a quick clarification and then a bigger question on the Premier. The 50 basis point SKU rationalization impact on the wine business in this year, should we assume that's the end of it? And going forward that is no longer a headwind? And then I have a Premier question.
Robert Sands: So, no. I'd say that in general, SKU rat is going to be the case. I think it's just generally good business practice to call the portfolio every year of smaller and slow-moving SKUs that are non-strategic to the company. It helps to make sure that, fundamentally, the whole supply chain isn't mucked up and that you're managing the balance sheet, in particular, working capital, efficiently by not -- by getting rid of, as I said, small and slow-moving SKUs that can tend to drive inventories up and basically gum up your operations. So, we'll have SKU rat every year, which is a big portfolio like our wine portfolio, would not be unusual at all and it's probably best practice in terms of managing the business and the balance sheet and working capital and efficiencies.
Amit Sharma: Got it. And then on Premier, look our conversation with some of the distributors has been really positive. There is clearly a lot of enthusiasm for how the brand has performed initially. Just as you look maybe two, three years down the road, and you think about the targeted audience and segment, I mean, close to 150 million cases segment, what are the realistic scenario for Premier as a percent of share for that segment?
Robert Sands: Well, I mean, that's a little bit hard to predict. But I said something a little earlier about not getting too focused on categories and it's really about brands. It's interesting to talk about like the super-premium category doing well, because it's not a category, it's one brand. It's Mich Ultra. And then Premier is a new brand or a new sub-brand of Corona, that is designed to appeal to that consumer and has some additional attributes of being more premium than what's out there and successful at the moment. So, we expected -- the introduction's been extremely strong. You've talked to distributors. Distributors are very enthusiastic, retailers are enthusiastic, the consumer seems to like the product. So, we think it's going to be a very highly successful SKU in the Corona brand family. So, we're very optimistic, but I don't think that we can sit here necessarily and predict exactly what share it's going to take of what. As I said, there's no category anyway. It's a brand.
Amit Sharma: Got it.
Robert Sands: So, we think it's going to compete extremely well against the competition, let's put it that way.
Amit Sharma: I understand. Thank you so much.
Robert Sands: And it may be by the way that the competition -- hopefully, the competition does well and Premier does well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Freda Zhuo: Hi, this is actually Freda on for Judy. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on CapEx a little bit and get a sense of what drove the decision-making between expanding incrementally at Obregon versus, maybe, a little bit more Mexicali or building even further with the Nava. And then if you look at like the $900 million guide for Obregon, like 5 million hectoliter expansion, it would imply that the cost per hectoliter is maybe a little bit higher versus what we've seen in some of the other CapEx rounds that you've done. So, if you could provide details to what the drivers to the difference may be for this expansion that would be great. Thanks.
Robert Sands: I'll let David answer part of the question. But I'd say a couple of things. First of all, with the kind of growth that we are having and that we're now predicting in the short-term, it's basically resulted in our deciding that it's prudent, given the lead-time -- the lead times to put more -- to start putting in place more capacity, okay? Why Obregon? We think that geographic diversification in Mexico is also a good idea. These states Baja California, Sonora, Coahuila all have different politics, and we think it's only prudent to make sure that we have capacity in a number of different places in Mexico rather than overly concentrating our capacity in one particular place, even though we don't see any problem or major problem, let me put it that way, in any one of our geographic locations. And then you also have to remember when we're -- when you're talking capacity, capacity is not -- we tend to talk about it in gross terms, right? 44 million hectoliters, which is, I don't know, about 500 million cases. And when I say that you've got to be careful, it's not just sort of the gross -- what we have to have is the capacity to meet our demand in our peak production months. That's how capacity is planned, because it's not even throughout the years. There's certain months leading up into the summer where we have our largest production runs. And therefore, our capacity is determined off of those peak months. So, it's just a process of us continuously reviewing where we are against our long, long-term plans, how we're doing in the near future, we -- and what we expect in the near future and what the lead times are in putting in place capacity. And so we make these decisions to stay ahead of the game, because -- and it's actually a fairly easy decision. I think I've said this probably in the past -- and that -- probably the worst thing that we could do is run out of capacity. So, if you start from that premise, given the growth in the business and the fact that the immediate-term prospects remain consistent with that, it makes sense to be putting in place this capacity, given the lead times, so that we don't run out of capacity sometime in the future, which, as I said, a whole bunch of perspectives, financially, customer service, that would be the worst thing that we could possibly do. So, it's really not a very hard decision.
David Klein: Yes. And then just on the build-out costs. Just to be clear about what we're doing at Obregon is, we're building a brewery that's literally across the road from our brewery. So, it's effectively a Greenfield inclusive of infrastructure, land acquisition costs and so forth. So, from that perspective, it's in line with what we've paid elsewhere.
Freda Zhuo: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.
Robert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much and terrific quarter and year. This, Corona, 6% growth for the family, wondering if you could unpack that a little bit in terms of how much is Corona Extra, how are cans doing, draft? Any sense, so that we can get a better sense of how that number builds up. And then looking out on the next 12 months, can you give us your expectations or rank between Pacifico, Premier and Familiar, which -- how those will rank in terms of adding incremental volume to the company? Thank you.
David Klein: So, in terms of growth within the family, I think about half of the growth rate came from the base Corona Extra, and that includes all packaged formats, Robert. But then the other half of the growth came from the rest of the family but primarily driven by Familiar, the success of Familiar during the year.
Robert Ottenstein: And how was that -- how much growth did cans give?
David Klein: I don't have that. We can get that to you, Robert. I don't have that at the -- of the off the top of my head.
Robert Ottenstein: Terrific. And I'm hearing great things about Familiar. How would you rank, again, Familiar, Premier, and Pacifico in terms of likely incremental contribution over the next 12 months?
Robert Sands: Well, it's a little hard to do, because it's all a little bit different in that -- Premier's sort of a full-blown national rollout. Familiar's more concentrated against the larger Hispanic markets. And Pacifico is really only in the West and has its core business in the -- in Southern California, but is expanding rapidly. So, I think it's good to be some and some. I may not -- I guess, I can't tie up at the top of my head exactly what the ranking is going to be other than we expect them all to make a significant contribution to that, roughly, 200 to 300 basis points that we were talking about in NPD. So, for the moment and you can talk to Patty or whomever more about this, after we looked at it a little bit more closely, I'd say that they're all making a roughly equivalent contribution to the 200 to 300 basis points.
Robert Ottenstein: Okay. And just to be clear, you're including Pacifico in that number as well?
Robert Sands: Yes, I'm -- Pacifico -- you know what? Yes, yes. Absolutely, we're -- Pacifico's not a new product introduction. Obviously, we're just dragging that brand. But interestingly enough, right? Victoria is also growing at high double-digits now, right? It isn't one of our focused brands. Meaning, we're not really putting the same effort right now behind Victoria that we are behind Pacifico, because that's really the -- one of the smaller brands that we think is first in line to really start driving to be the next major growth brand. But interestingly enough, Victoria's looking particularly strong as well. But Victoria is a little bit more like Familiar, in that it's got its main strength in the really concentrated Hispanic communities with large populations of unacculturated Hispanics, because Victoria is a very large brand in Mexico and very well known in Mexico, but is not very well known in the United States and therefore, to the general market and the more acculturated or longer term Hispanic population. So, that's got a lot of promise too, is all I would tell you.
Robert Ottenstein: Great. And on Pacifico, I've noticed, at least in California, that it seems to be priced somewhat less than Corona and Modelo. Is that correct? And do you plan to have, if that is correct, somewhat lower pricing on Pacifico, nationally? Or do you look to line price it?
Robert Sands: So, the answer is no. I mean, I don't know exactly what you're seeing. I think in general terms, it's pretty much priced with everything else. So -- and there would be no -- we would not be interested in a strategy to price it below Corona or Modelo Especial. So--
Robert Ottenstein: Good to hear.
Robert Sands: That's a resounding no.
Robert Ottenstein: Okay. It must've been a retailer's decision and--
Robert Sands: Yes, that can always happen. We always see antidotes -- retailers control their own pricing. So, if they want to really blow something out, they'll do it. But there's -- I think if you even look at pricing in IRI across the Pacifico versus the other families, you're not going to see anything different. And there's -- as I said, resoundingly no on the streets that there's no strategy to do that.
Robert Ottenstein: Right answer. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Will Chappell of SunTrust.
Robert Sands: Hi Bill.
William Chappell: Good morning. It's Bill. Two quick questions. One, just any thoughts update on aluminum and tariffs? I understand that you're probably largely hedged and it's still a small part of your, kind of, input cost. But any kind of initial thoughts of how it could affect you or the industry? And then second, just on a modeling standpoint. On depreciation, I think you said it's up 30% in 2019. Is that straight lined across the year? Or are there any things that come on where it, kind of, build as we go through the year?
David Klein: Yes. So, on the depreciation point, yes, it will build a bit as we put assets into service, but the total will be -- it's that 30%. Not dissimilar to year's number. It'll be that $50 some million additional depreciation for the full year, but it'll build over time. And from an -- from a tariff perspective, as you mentioned, we have a strong hedging program, and so we're protected from a price standpoint. But even from a specific imposition of the tariff on aluminum, it's going to have a deminimus effect on Constellation. And you've asked about the industry, I can't really comment on that. But it's not really going to have an effect on us as a result of our hedging program and our source of supply.
William Chappell: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial.
Mark Swartzberg: Great. Hey, good morning guys. And thanks for taking my question. I like that phrase Robs, SKU rat, I haven't heard it, abbreviated that way, and that's my question--
Robert Sands: We really usually like to talk about rats on a conference call.
Mark Swartzberg: That's fair enough. But you took down your outlook for your wine and spirits business at CAGNY and SKU rat seems to be -- the rat seem to be the factor here. Two questions really. Is that the only factor? And then secondly, if you say that you've set the targets back in November of 2016 and then you've decided to be more aggressive with SKU rationalization, what changed? Are you seeing just higher rates of decline in those SKUs that you want to -- reduced? So that -- those two questions.
David Klein: Yes, I'll let Rob kind of finish up with the answer. But I'll just start-up, Mark, by saying, we're seeing -- we saw in calendar year 2017, a bit of a slowdown in the overall wine market. We still believe that the wine market is the 4% to 5% grower over time. We just saw a bit of a pullback. But we also are seeing this bifurcation in the market where it looks a little bit like beer, where you're seeing the higher end of the market and we -- for CAGNY, arbitrarily drew a line at $11 a bottle of retail. We're seeing that part of the market growing at 13% and below that, growing at 1%. And so yes, we're probably being a little more aggressive than we have been in the past to call our portfolio below $11, so that we have capacity to produce the brands like Meiomi and Kim Crawford, and the Prisoner and other brands in our focus portfolio that are growing high margin brands. And so we're making a bit of an ROIC trade-off, that's causing us to have a bit of a drag on the net sales line.
Robert Sands: Yes, I don't have anything really to add other than the bifurcation that David is talking about, is becoming more pronounced in that the growth is moving up the chain from a premiumization point of view, meaning the fastest growing categories are higher priced now than they even were a couple of years ago. And the lower end of the market is less healthy, even more so than it was a few years ago. Overall, we think the market -- in actuality, that's -- that the positive trend and it's a positive trend for us in particular because I'd say, we predicted this happening. And we've been generally organizing our portfolio and tweaking our portfolio to keep it moving up the price spectrum from an average price point perspective. So, I think we're particularly well-positioned at the current time to take advantage of the fact that these higher priced categories are now where the real outsized growth is. And I think a good example of that is a brand like Meiomi, which is a $20 bottle of wine and a very large brand. Much larger than -- five years ago, there was no brand at $20 a bottle that sold anywhere near -- or had the growth of what Meiomi has. So, these are very positive trends for us going forward. And it's not -- I don't think that's what one really should be looking at necessarily, is our overall growth rate, because of precisely this fact, there will be continued SKU rat at the lower end. And we will be -- and we will continue to focus more and more on the higher price points. And therefore, as sort of looking at our focus brand portfolio, which constitutes the -- of the large bulk of our sales and profits is really where you should look, because -- and there the growth is extremely healthy. I mean, that could be a business all in it of itself, right? A multi-billion dollar business, with growth in high single-digits in consumer products, which -- that would make it probably in the top 10 percentile of all consumer products' companies in terms of growth in CPG. So, that's what I would look at if I were you guys.
Mark Swartzberg: Great. Thank you guys.
Operator: And that was our final question. I will now turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.
Robert Sands: Well, thank you all very much for the call today, and your great questions. I'd like to reiterate how proud I am of our many achievements in fiscal 2018. And our fiscal 2019 guidance reflects the confidence that we have in our business just to sustain our top-tier CPG growth profile. And we look forward to speaking with you in late June, when we report our first quarter results. And until then, of course, we'll be celebrating Cinco de Mayo by ringing the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange and as always, we hope you choose our fine products to enjoy responsibly as part of your spring celebrations. So, thanks again, everyone and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Lori. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Rob, similar to prior quarters I’d like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will have us end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance. And now here's Rob.
Robert Sands: Thank you, Patty, and good morning, and Happy New Year. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had the opportunity to include some of our fine Constellation products in your celebrations with family and friends. As I reflect on 2017, I am reminded that it has been a dynamic time for our business. We posted another year of exceptional stock price performance, with Constellation stock increasing almost 50% for the calendar year 2017 versus the S&P 500, which grew about 20% for the year. Overall, stars, Constellation was one of the best performers among the S&P 500 Consumer Staples stocks. I believe our excellent stock price performance continues to be driven by our strong financial results and the ongoing growth prospects for our business. The confidence in our future business prospects compelled us to seek board authorization for a new multiyear $3 billion share repurchase program subsequent to the recent repurchases of more than 200 million of our outstanding shares. I'm also excited about our recent investment in Canopy Growth Corporation, the largest publicly traded cannabis supplier in the world and a leader in the medical cannabis market in Canada. Founded in 2014 and based in Ontario, Canopy Growth is one of the earliest commercial players in Canada's legal cannabis market and has a global presence via numerous joint ventures and partnerships. Canopy is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and currently has a market cap in the $5 billion range. This investment provides Constellation with a first-mover advantage for a potentially significant emerging consumer opportunity and aligns with our long-term strategy to identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics while maintaining focus on our core total beverage alcohol business. Our plan is to jointly collaborate with Canopy in a number of areas. Initially, we will be learning the cannabis business and the related consumer space and route-to-market while building and developing a successful cannabis beverage business. Now recreational cannabis is scheduled to become legal in Canada this coming summer with recreational edibles including beverages expected to become legal in the summer of 2019. We have no current plans to sell cannabis products in the U.S. or any other market, and we will not consider doing so until it is legal at all levels of government. Our initial investment of approximately $190 million represents an ownership interest of 9.9% of Canopy Growth plus warrants which give Constellation the option to purchase an additional ownership interest in the future. In a few moments, David will review how we are accounting for this investment. And speaking of growth prospects, we posted another great quarter for our beer business, which generated 80% of the total U.S. beer category growth and claimed four of the top 10 share-gainer positions with Modelo Especial, Corona Extra, Modelo Chelada, Tamarindo Picante and Pacifico. Overall, Constellation's beer business remains the leader in the high end of the U.S. beer market and was the clear winner for the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays, with excellent execution that drove share gains led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. These brands continue to drive the growth of the portfolio with ongoing distribution and velocity gains. Throughout the quarter, Corona Extra maintained strong media support and became the official imported beer of four NFL teams while also featuring Jon Gruden in football promotions during the season. Corona Extra also increased relevance with Hispanic consumers through its partnerships with Latin music superstars Enrique Iglesias and Maná. The Modelo Especial fighting spirit campaign continued throughout our third quarter including national TV and promotional activities during the NFL schedule. In addition, national Spanish-language TV support ran through November including a strong presence with live soccer program and top-rated Spanish language TV networks. Social media on Facebook and Instagram also supported NFL, the Mexican Independence Day and the Dia de los Muertos for this brand. Collectively, these initiatives drove depletion growth of almost 17% for the Modelo Especial family of brands for our third quarter. Pacifico continues to make its mark within our portfolio and recently was named Impact Beer Brand of the Year by Market Watch. In addition, Pacifico has become the fastest, the fastest-growing beer brand among the top 40 beer brands based on 52-week IRI dollar growth of nearly 24%. Our plans for Corona Premier and Corona Familiar continue to evolve as we finalize our launch strategies for next year. Corona Premier is the first national Corona line extension in more than 25 years, and we plan to make our largest-ever launch investment of more than 35 million to support the effort. This includes a robust media plan with general market and Spanish language TV advertising beginning in April. Additional support will include print, social media and Hispanic-targeted advertising as well as on-premise sampling and new point-of-sale materials. Corona Familiar will roll out during the same time frame to major Hispanic markets, a key demographic for this brand. Now turning to the operations side of the beer business. During the quarter, we continued to make progress as we put the finishing touches on our Nava capacity addition to complete the 27.5 million hectoliter expansion while also nearing the finishing line with our fourth glass furnace, both of which are expected to come online in the coming months. Glass furnace three is now fully operational and running at peak efficiency levels. The Obregon brewery continues to perform at a very high utilization level, and we remain on track with our brewing and packaging capacity additions, which are expected to be completed before the end of the fiscal year. And construction continues in Mexicali with brewhouse tank fabrication and installation currently under way. During the quarter, we reached agreement with Owens-Illinois to restructure and expand our contracts for glass supply including our joint venture agreement. As you know, the joint venture operates a glass production plant in Nava, Mexico and provides bottles exclusively for Constellation's adjacent brewery, which is our lowest-cost source of supply for glass. The original joint venture agreement included the expansion of the glass production plant from one furnace to four furnaces, and initial expansion plans have been progressing as scheduled, as I just mentioned. The expanded relationships with OI provides for the addition of a fifth furnace, which is expected to come online by the end of calendar 2019 and will be included in our future capital investment plans. Following the installation of the fifth furnace, the Nava plant will be the largest, most modern glass container facility in the world. In recognition of the value-added contributions from both partners, the term of the joint venture agreement has also been extended for an additional 10 years to 2034. David will discuss the high-level details of this new contract in a few moments. Now turning to the wine and spirits business. It certainly has been an interesting quarter for our wine and spirits division. Early in the quarter, hurricanes hit some of our key markets. And shortly thereafter, we were faced with one of the worst natural disasters in California state history as we dealt with widespread wildfires in Northern California. Overall, we are fortunate that these events are expected to have only a minor impact in our business both near term and in the future. To put things in perspective, about 80% of the harvest was already completed when the wildfires started, and less than 5% of our wine portfolio is Napa or Sonoma appellated. Constellation has a long history in Napa and Sonoma, and we're committed to helping our neighbors and our communities rebuild by driving consumer engagement and continuing to encourage purchase and consumption of Napa and Sonoma wines. Please help us support this effort. Third quarter wine and spirits depletions were a bit muted following a strong finish to our second quarter. Key Focus Brands drove depletion growth led by double-digit trends for Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Black Box, Ruffino, Robert Mondavi Private Selection and High West Whiskey. Throughout the quarter, our focused investments for some of these brands were visible in the marketplace and drove excellent results, including the first-ever national TV advertising campaign for Kim Crawford, which drove accelerating growth trends for this brand during the key holiday selling season. Now on a year-to-date basis, the business is expanding margins, generating positive mix, driving innovation and seeing excellent results from acquired brands including Meiomi, The Prisoner, Charles Smith and High West. And our innovation efforts are paying off with successes like Cooper & Thief, which has become the #2 super-luxury red blend; and Robert Mondavi Private Selection Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet and Chardonnay, which together are growing more than 120% in IRI channels. I'm also pleased to report that Constellation Ventures has been busy, recently making two minority investments, both of which align with our strategy of investing in emerging unique and distinctive brands. The first is The Real McCoy, a high-end rum aged in American oak bourbon barrels. This line of 3, 5 and 12 year aged rum is produced by Richard Seale, a legendary fourth-generation master distiller and made at Foursquare Distillery in Barbados. This product has a premium price point of the $20 to $50 range and uses an authentic farm-to-glass production process using high-quality blackstrap molasses with no added sugars, flavors or aromas. The second is Copper & Kings, a high-end American craft brandy founded in 2014 in Louisville, Kentucky. These brandies are naturally distilled in copper pot stills, and the liquid is matured in Kentucky bourbon barrels and retails for $35 a bottle. While the U.S. wine industry remains healthy overall with trends that continue to exceed U.S. CPG category growth, we have seen a bit of a slowdown in the market growth rate versus what we anticipated when we set our original guidance estimates earlier this year. In addition, our SKU rationalization efforts are creating a headwind as we continue to carefully rationalize our portfolio of tail brands. Despite these challenges, we are targeting wine and spirits net sales and EBIT growth for fiscal 2018 at the low end of our previous stated guidance ranges of 4% to 6% and 5% to 7%, respectively. Before I turn the call over to David, I'd like to take a moment to address the topic of tax reform. As a U.S.-based beverage alcohol company, Constellation has been supportive of tax reform that allows U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. While we continue to review the legislation, we are very pleased with the outcome of this historic legislation and believe that it'll be very positive for us going forward. David will provide additional details in a few minutes. In closing, it is certainly shaping up to be yet another eventful year at Constellation. With the fiscal year quickly drawing to a close, I am very pleased with our progress to date. We established a first-mover advantage in emerging consumer category with our Canopy Growth investment, and we continue to make smart investments including the planned addition of a fifth furnace at our glass plant in Nava. We continue to build shareholder value through ongoing share repurchases and stock appreciation driven by our strong results and future business prospects. And I am pleased with the outcome of tax reform legislation. We look forward to leveraging the opportunities that this will bring for our business and continue to thrive. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our financial results for the third quarter.
David Klein: Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here with you today to discuss another quarter of strong execution. On a year-to-date basis, we've grown market share, expanded margins and improved our capital structure while investing in growth initiatives that will benefit us as we go forward. Our fiscal '18 year-to-date comparable basis diluted EPS is up 29% versus last year. Q3 comparable basis diluted EPS increased 2%. The low Q3 EPS growth rate was primarily due to timing as we're increasing our full year comparable basis diluted EPS guidance to a range of $8.40 to $8.50 from $8.25 to $8.40. This improvement is primarily due to anticipated favorability in our full year tax rate and better margin performance in our beer business, which I'll talk about in a moment. We now expect our fiscal '18 comparable effective tax rate to approximate 20% versus our previous 21% guidance. Our EPS and tax rate guidance excludes any impacts from recently enacted tax reform. Before I move further into our results, let me provide some comments on the new tax legislation. First of all, we're pleased with the bill that was enacted and want to thank our friends in Congress for their work to reform the corporate tax code. Like most companies, we're in the process of evaluating the specific impacts of tax reform, but it is clearly favorable to our previous low to mid-20s long-term effective tax rate guidance. For fiscal '18, we expect to benefit in our U.S. federal statutory tax rate. The new 21% corporate tax rate will apply for the last two months of our fiscal year, resulting in a lower blended statutory tax rate versus the historical 35% rate. We expect the new tax legislation, including the impact of the tax rate deduction -- or reduction and the transition to a territorial system of taxation will result in a reduction in our existing net deferred tax liabilities by $300 million to $400 million. This onetime noncash benefit will be reported in our fourth quarter fiscal '18 results and will be excluded from our comparable basis financial results. We expect to provide an update to our long-term effective tax rate guidance as part of our upcoming investor presentation at the CAGNY conference in late February. Now let's take a closer look at Q3 performance and our full year outlook, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. For beer, we continued to see strong operational performance and robust marketplace momentum. Depletion growth came in at 9% as we won the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays. This result was in line with our depletion growth performance year-to-date and our high-single digit depletion growth target for fiscal '18. Net sales increased 8% on volume growth of 6%. Depletion growth ran ahead of shipment growth primarily due to timing. Year-to-date shipments grew more than 8%, putting us on track to meet our net sales target for fiscal '18 as we continue to expect net sales growth to be in the 9% to 11% range. This includes 1% to 2% of pricing benefit in our Mexican beer portfolio. Beer operating margin increased 290 basis points to 37.7% primarily due to lower COGS and favorable pricing. The lower COGS reflect operational benefits driven by glass and material sourcing along with foreign currency favorability. These benefits were partially offset by a $12 million increase in depreciation expense, which totaled $42 million for Q3. We now expect beer operating margin -- or beer operating income growth to be in the range of 18% to 19%. Although we're increasing our guidance to the upper end of our previous range, our Q4 operating margin is expected to moderate primarily due to lower seasonal production volume combined with the continued ramp-up in depreciation, line commissioning costs and headcount additions. In addition, SG&A leverage is expected to be impacted by the seasonality of the business. For wine and spirits, organic net sales were flat due primarily to mix benefits being mostly offset by lower volumes. Operating margin decreased 110 basis points to 26.2% as mix benefits from portfolio premiumization efforts were more than offset by higher COGS and marketing investments. The higher COGS primarily reflect higher operational costs including increased transportation costs and the overlap of a supplier cost reimbursement in Q3 last year. We expect to realize benefits from the increased marketing spend on brands like Kim Crawford, Ruffino and Charles Smith over the next several quarters. For the year-to-date period, organic net sales are up 1% and operating margin has expanded 170 basis points. Excluding the impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture, net sales are up 4% and operating income grew 5% for the first 9 months of fiscal '18. For fiscal '18, when excluding Canadian wine business divestiture, we expect net sales and operating income growth rates to be at the low end of our targeted 4% to 6% and 5% to 7% ranges, respectively, for the reasons Rob mentioned. As a reminder, as part of our premiumization efforts, we've been rationalizing lower-margin value brand SKUs. These actions are expected to impact wine and spirits revenue growth by almost 100 basis points for fiscal '18 while improving operating margin and ROIC. Interest expense increased 5% primarily due to higher average debt balances. We also continue to benefit from our investment-grade status. In October, to improve short-term borrowing costs, we implemented a commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $1 billion of commercial paper. In November, we issued $2 billion of senior notes at attractive fixed rates and used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our variable-rate European term A loan facility. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio moved down to 3.4x at the end of November from 3.7x at the end of fiscal '17 while we invested in our Mexican operation, our portfolio and Canopy Growth and returned cash to shareholders with $301 million worth of dividends paid and $239 million of stock repurchases during the first nine months of the year. The stock repurchases represent a little over 1.1 million shares at an average price of $213 with most of this activity occurring during the third quarter. At the end of Q3, there was $308 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. As Rob mentioned, we're pleased that our Board of Directors authorized an additional $3 billion for share repurchases, which we expect to utilize over the next several years. Our significant capital allocation flexibility allows us to continue to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders while remaining committed to our 3.5x leverage target. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 18.9% versus 16.4% last year. This increase reflects the overlap from recording the year-to-date impact of our election of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings under APB 23 in the third quarter of fiscal '17, partially offset by the fiscal '18 adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires excess tax benefits from stock-based payment award activity to be recognized in the income statement. We now expect the fiscal '18 effective tax rate to approximate 20% versus our previous guidance of 21%. The lower projected rate is primarily due to an increased benefit from lower taxes on foreign earnings. As noted earlier, our updated guidance doesn't include any impact from tax reform. I'd also like to note for fiscal '18, we continue to expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate 201 million shares and net income attributable to noncontrolling interest to approximate $10 million to $15 million. As mentioned earlier, we're now projecting our full year comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $8.40 to $8.50. The midpoint of this guidance has us targeting 25% year-over-year growth. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. I'd like to highlight two significant comparable adjustments that occurred in Q3. The first is the $217 million pretax gain from the change in fair value of the Canopy investment and Canopy warrants. This gain is primarily based upon a CAD 18.43 share price for Canopy at the end of our third quarter as compared to a CAD 12.98 share price at the time of our initial investment. The Canopy share price has moved significantly higher since the end of the third quarter as well. Going forward on a quarterly basis, we will continue to record a comparable adjustment for the change in fair value of this investment and warrants and update reported EPS guidance accordingly. Our current reported guidance assumes that the Canopy share price at the end of our fourth quarter will equal the share price at the end of our third quarter. The second is related to glass sourcing initiative highlighted by Rob, where we reached an agreement with Owens-Illinois to restructure supply contracts and expand our joint venture agreements for the operation of the Nava glass plant by 10 years to 2034. The expanded relationship provides for a fifth furnace to be added at an estimated cost of $140 million. This will be financed by equal contributions from both partners and will be included in Constellation's future capital investment plans. The fifth furnace is targeted to come online at the end of calendar 2019. During Q3, we recorded a $59 million pretax charge associated with the restructuring of our agreement with OI. This initiative will result in more glass being efficiently provided to the Nava Brewery from our lowest-cost source of glass supply, providing Constellation additional opportunities for margin enhancement and a higher return on our investment. Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first nine months of FY '18, we generated $763 million of free cash flow versus $824 million for the same period last year as operating cash flow growth was more than offset by an increase in CapEx. We continue to expect fiscal '18 free cash flow to be in the range of $725 million to $825 million. Our free cash flow guidance reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and CapEx of $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion including approximately $1 billion of CapEx targeted for our Mexican beer operations. At this point, I'd like to highlight ASU 2014-09, the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which will be effective for Constellation at the beginning of fiscal '19. Upon adoption, certain sales incentives will be recognized earlier than they are currently, and we'll make an adjustment to increase accrued expenses with an offset to retained earnings as of the end of fiscal '16. We will recast the full year of fiscal '17 and fiscal '18 along with fiscal '18 quarters. We're in the process of quantifying the changes, but we don't expect there to be a material impact to net sales. We expect to provide recast information when we file our fiscal '18 10-K. In closing, we're well positioned to deliver another year of top-tier financial performance as we close out fiscal '18, and we're excited about our financial prospects heading into fiscal '19. And with that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: My question is on the beer division. First, David, you mentioned a number of reasons behind the expected large year-over-year decline in beer operating margins in Q4. Are those more discrete factors in Q4 causing the year-over-year compression? Are you comfortable those factors don't linger and you get back to expansion beyond Q4? And then also on the top line front in beer, can you help frame the magnitude of contribution you expect from Premier next fiscal year based on what you're seeing in test markets so far and in light of the heavy investment of more than $35 million that you mentioned earlier in the call?
David Klein: Yes. Dara, so in terms of Q4 margins for beer, the real issue for us is that we haven't seen a full seasonality picture of our business really until this year because of being under the interim supply agreement prior to this. And so in Q4, it's our lowest net sales quarter of the year, so we get a bit of a delevering effect at the fixed cost line in the plant as well as on the SG&A line. And then on top of that, we're bringing in employees. So we're adding headcount in Q4 that we will be able to deploy when we get into the peak production season, and we have some line commissioning cost. So I think there's just a bit of a seasonality built in, but we're pretty confident in the margins and being able to deliver strong margins going forward. I'd also say, Dara, that we had concerns both for Q3 and Q4 about some headwinds from FX within our beer margins, but with the peso sitting around 19, we're just not seeing those headwinds this year. And then from a top line perspective, we expect the majority of the benefit from the Premier launch will be seen in Q1 of next year versus Q4 of this year, and so we simply expect to have our distributor inventory kind of at our normal 30-ish days at the end of the quarter when we get to the end of the fiscal year, which is why we expect our net sales to be in that 9% to 11% range for the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.
Sunil Modi: Just as we kind of approach the February shelf set -- resets and obviously you're launching some new products into the marketplace, I'm just curious on what the retailers and distributors are saying in terms of incremental space because I know that's been a big initiative that you guys have been pushing for a number of years now. Can you just provide some context on kind of how it looks now and how it's changed from where you were a year ago?
Robert Sands: Yes. So I think that in general, we're making good progress on our efforts to increase our space commensurate with how we're growing at retail and our contribution from a profitability point of view at retail. So we continue to see good distribution growth. And so I'd say, everything is on track. We've also made some significant organizational additions to bolster our category management activities and have brought in some really great people to continue to drive those efforts. So in general, we're pleased with the progress that we're making. But we start from a position, as I've stated a number of times, of not being where we think we should be or would like to be from a space allocation point of view at retail.
David Klein: Nik, I'd also add that on a year-to-date basis, our effective points of distribution are up double digits, so we continue to do really well in gaining distribution.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: So I was hoping to get your thoughts on the outlook for the beer category. The results from a category perspective despite your very good depletion growth continue to look increasingly sluggish in Nielsen. That's also mirrored in the deceleration we're seeing in PCE growth. And so with your largest market, California, transitioning to legal cannabis, how are you thinking about the overall beer category for calendar '18 and any impact from cannabis?
Robert Sands: Yes. So number one, I think that we think that the beer category is fundamentally going to continue to perform as the beer category in general has been performing. It's a flat to slightly down volumetrically market with all of the growth in the market being in the high end and then the premium end, in particular, giving up shares. So I don't think we'd see anything different there as we move into calendar year 2018 or our next fiscal. And then on cannabis in California, we don't really expect to see any impact from that. I think that one of the things that people don't necessarily appreciate is that cannabis has been generally available as medical marijuana and pretty accessible to almost everybody for 16 years. And therefore, the, I'd say, official legalization on a state level of it for recreational purposes is probably a nonevent is the truth of the matter. And then also, as we track what everybody else is tracking and we look at the numbers, we really can't see any real impact in terms of how it's affecting beverage alcohol in general even in the states -- or now six states, including California where it's been legalized. So as, I guess, I've said in the past, it's probably not worth getting into a big debate right now about whether it's cannibalistic or complementary. There's just not enough information, I think, to really say how that's going to affect beverage alcohol in general going forward. What we do know is it's going to be a big market, however, worldwide.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.
Robert Ottenstein: Just following on the last question. I'm wondering if you could give us any details or further details on your plans in Canada in terms of building out a sales team there, the sort of products you will be looking to develop or codevelop and kind of the general strategy. And I understand this is very early days and it's still very much a learning process, but would just love to get a sense of how you're thinking about it and what sort of investments on the ground that you'd be looking to put in place and thoughts on route-to-market.
Robert Sands: Yes. So we are making investments. We have started building an organization in Canada. I'd characterize it more as a marketing organization than a sales organization because our partner, Canopy, has a sales organization and will continue to build their sales organization as well, and we expect to partner with them. But we have put a team in place to work with Canopy generally in evolving a lot of what they do in terms of consumer research, marketing, a lot of the standard sort of CPG stuff that we have a fairly deep knowledge and expertise in. And they, as a newer company, really focused on a totally emerging category and anticipated extremely high growth, haven't become fully developed in yet. So we've got our team working with their team, and we expect to attack that market together really when, in our case, beverages become legal, which is either going to be with the initial recreational legalization in 2018 or in 2019. I think the sort of the -- right now, the official government stance is that edibles will come in 2019, but it's kind of unclear whether they're lumping beverages into that or what they might do in 2018. So the best guess we have right now or the official word is probably beverages in 2019. And then in terms of what we're developing with Canopy, it is, as it relates to Constellation, beverages, nonalcoholic beverages which would include cannabis, so -- or be infused with cannabis. So we're working on the development of those products and things like branding, et cetera, at this time. But given sort of the time frame, we don't have everything fully baked nor should we or would we at this point in time as to exactly what the product is in terms of flavors, in terms of packaging, in terms of branding. Canopy's got a strong brand of its own even currently, which uses in the medical marijuana side of the business called Tweed, T-W-E-E-D, and I think that brand has a lot of potential as well.
Robert Ottenstein: Great. And just following up on that, what sort of organization would you need in Québec?
Robert Sands: Well, we haven't really, I'd say, gotten that far that we're thinking about organizations by province. But as I said, in terms of like a larger sales organization, that will really be done through Canopy as it specifically relates to Canada. So I wouldn't see us building a huge sales organization necessarily, but we will build some significant capabilities and make some investments next year.
David Klein: Yes. So Robert, when we provide guidance for the year on our next call, we'll talk about investments in cannabis. But clearly, there will be some.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane: Just had a couple of follow-up questions, David, I guess, on the comments on tax. One was just I wanted to clarify the benefit that you're expecting. Is that relative to the fiscal '18 20% rate? Or is it benefit relative to your long-term guidance on tax rate?
David Klein: Well, Bryan, what we said in the script was that it would be beneficial to the low to mid-20s kind of long-term guidance rate. But we'll have a lot more specifics when we get to CAGNY because, as you can imagine, it's complicated even to understand what's in the regs as well as working through how to apply it to our business. But I can say that we're pretty confident that it's going to be below the long-term guidance and likely in line with the 20% rate that we threw out for the remainder of this year or for this year.
Bryan Spillane: And then do you think that it will have a positive effect on free cash flow? So as you kind of look at cash taxes, cash tax rates, any sense yet as to -- in terms of whether there's a real tangible cash benefit that you'd expect to receive?
David Klein: So again, we're still working through this. But before we said -- we provided guidance on an effective tax rate and we said that the cash tax rate would be somewhere around 500 basis points less than that while we're continuing to amortize some of our intellectual property over time. We suspect that, that will actually expand a little bit from 500 basis points, but we haven't -- we don't have final answers. We'll have those in several weeks at CAGNY.
Bryan Spillane: But there's a chance that, that relationship between your cash tax rate and your new lower effective tax rate would be maintained?
David Klein: Correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial.
Mark Swartzberg: A question on wine and spirits, Rob, but just as a point of information, this group called Smart Approaches to Marijuana points out that alcohol consumption has risen in Colorado post legalization. There's a lot of just really useful data there, I found. But wine and spirits, your year-to-date organic revenue was like plus 1%. Your fiscal '18 through fiscal '20 target is mid-single digits annually, and I hear you on the SKU rationalization. But how are you thinking about what's necessary to deliver that mid-single digits? Or do you think the mid-single digits is too high?
Robert Sands: Well, what we expect is mid-single net sales growth for the year. That was our initial guidance range, and we feel pretty confident given sort of where we are right now, and how fourth quarter will go that we will be in that range. Year-to-date, we're about 4% growth on net sales, excluding the impact of Canada, so -- the Canada sales, so we feel pretty good. The market has slowed down a little bit, probably 100 basis points to 200 basis points versus where we thought the market would be for the year. That's probably the biggest factor that's impacting us relative to where we are in our range. We said that we think that we're more towards the low end than the high end of the range. It's probably the market that's impacting that. Lower end wines below premium seem to be being impacted, which actually could turn out to be good news. Because I think we continue to see an acceleration of premiumization, and we're seeing all of the growth really in the wine business starts to coalesce around price points which are substantially higher than they have been in the past. It used to be sort of the $8 to $12 range, and now we're seeing very strong growth, which is I'm sure hurting the lower end, between the $15 and $20 price points, which is still well within the commercial segments of the business. And we are particularly well positioned in some of those price points, and we'll continue to focus on those price points. And so over the last several years, we've become much more focused not in so much on that $8 to $12, but now in the $15 to even plus $20 range, where we think all of the growth is going to be in the future. We expect the wine category in general, there's a little bit of a slowdown in the second half of this year. As I said, could be a couple of 100 basis points. We think that the category will continue to be one of the faster or fastest-growing consumer products categories, outperforming consumer products in general. Year -- the whole -- the growth rate's been mid-single digits, almost 4%. We were at 4%. So we prefer to be at the high end of the range than the low end of the range, but we don't see anything happening here that is unusual or should constitute any kind of a warning sign. And in fact, as I said, the kind of growth we're seeing at the higher end of the commercial premium range, $15 to $20, I'd say is extremely encouraging for a lot of brands in our portfolio in particular.
Mark Swartzberg: I could have been clearer. I was thinking about your fiscal '18 through fiscal '20 objective of mid-single digits. And in the current fiscal year, you're getting about 300 basis points from acquisitions, so the underlying business is doing a 1%. So I was really thinking about, is it just keeping up the pace of acquisitions because, mid-single digits is not how your business is growing on an organic basis?
Robert Sands: Yes. I would say that the -- excluding acquisitions, the underlying business has been a bit softer than we'd like to see it. And the numbers that you quoted are essentially correct, but I don't think that we see the short term or the quarter really being indicative of anything. And in fact, it's probably just timing, whether we're talking about the market or whether we're talking about our business overall, which we expect to be in line with those numbers that you quoted, mid-single digits.
David Klein: Yes, we don't think we need to continue to add to the portfolio to hit those numbers. We expect that our portfolio can hold or grow share as it stands.
Mark Swartzberg: And so do you think you can get margin expansion next year if you want that lift in organic growth?
Robert Sands: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Eunjoo Hong: So on the $3 billion share buyback announcement, it's a multiyear program. So it seems to leave you still with plenty of room for additional cash usage, especially with your free cash flow stepping up in fiscal '19 and with some other tax benefits also accruing. So I guess I'm just wondering why the board came up with this number. And to the extent that you don't have a big M&A opportunity, do you think that you can complete the program earlier than you expected? Just kind of thoughts around that program.
David Klein: Yes. So Judy, we asked the board for the authorization so that we can be opportunistic, and we didn't want a necessarily a time horizon on it. And so they gave us a multiyear authorization, which is consistent with the way that we've always done it in the past. As we said before, after we've invested in our -- for our expansion needs, in particular in beer, it's our intent to keep the business somewhere in that 3.5x leverage ratio range, and we'll do that through returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and then some M&A activity that's probably looks a lot like the M&A activity we've done over the past few years. So I would say that we were looking for flexibility in the multiyear repurchase and will be opportunistic.
Eunjoo Hong: Okay, and then just a quick follow-up on beer depletion. Can you comment at all on the December trend? Just because obviously, last year, we had a pretty weak December, and just wanted to see if you get -- you have any color just in terms of what you saw this December.
Robert Sands: You're talking beer, right?
Eunjoo Hong: Yes, beer.
Robert Sands: Yes, we're expecting a pretty strong fourth quarter on beer depletions is the bottom line.
David Klein: And December is performing in line with us getting to that strong quarter, so we're comfortable.
Robert Sands: I would say in general, our beer depletions are pretty much right where we expected them to be and right where they should be, sort of around that 10% number. So it's good. It's good. The quarter -- this quarter, it was 9.1%. We're expecting a strong fourth quarter in beer.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: I just I want to stay on this topic, just in terms of depletions versus shipments. And certainly recognize, there's usually some seasonality, timing differences, but there's still a decent delta between the two during this quarter, and even the last quarter or two. So could you help us better understand the dynamic? And are these two then tracking more closely right now? Or is there still a pretty big delta? And then curious if you could comment on the end or consumer demand, and how you expect this to progress throughout the year given the planned marketing campaigns that you mentioned as well as your new innovation.
Robert Sands: So in the quarter, shipments were below depletions quite considerably, I think around 6% versus 9%. That would be entirely a timing-of-shipment matter, and we don't expect that delta to be anything like that as we approach the year-end. Year-to-date ships are up 8.4%, and depletions are up 9.5%. So on the year-to-date, we're seeing it a lot closer. But definitely third quarter, there was a timing-of-shipment matter that -- and I say matter, there's nothing unusual. It's just that shipments lagged a little bit more than usual behind depletions in third quarter, but we don't expect that to be a trend or that there'd be anything -- or that there's anything unusual. I mean, it could be how we ship in the last day. I mean, so it's not -- there's nothing going on there. And then your other question, Bonnie?
Bonnie Herzog: Just trying to get a sense of the current consumer demand right now. You have touched on that with the previous question, but I'm more curious how you expect that to progress throughout the year.
Robert Sands: If you're talking about [indiscernible] business, we think that it's very strong. And that would be evidenced by the very strong measured consumer takeaway with IRI, for instance, which is -- was more like at 16.5% for the quarter. So we don't see any issue with the consumer whatsoever. In fact, consumer takeaway is very strong right now especially in the measured channels.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research group.
Timothy Ramey: I kind of wanted to press on the tax issue, not from the perspective on what it will do to your rate. But particularly in the wine industry, there's a lot of goodies there for the industry. And since many of your competitors or most of your competitors are privately held, do you expect this will sort of fall to the bottom line in perhaps accelerated promotion or maybe leaving prices alone when -- because you'll have a margin benefit? How do you think this will play through the market, is kind of the thrust of my question.
Robert Sands: Well, for us, I would say that we would plan on letting sort of the...
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize. There will be a slight delay in today's conference. Please hold. The conference will resume momentarily. [Technical Difficulty].
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: We're back online.
Operator: Yes, you may resume the call.
Robert Sands: I got cut off in mid-sentence, but I was answering Tim's question, and he was asking about the effect of tax reform in general on the industry. And what I was saying was that it was going to be -- we believe it's going to be positive. People are going to have more money in their pocket. And we think that certainly, as it relates to premium products, that's going to be very healthy for the industry. So all good news. No bad news on that front.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank.
Stephen Powers: David, if I could, I want to come back to -- I think it was Dara's original question on beer margins for Q4 and just reframe it in sequential terms versus Q3. I think your comments on seasonality implies some lessening P&L leverage in Q4. But by my math, your Q4 -- your implied Q4 guidance really doesn't show any falloff in sales versus Q3. So could you just maybe bridge the difference between Q3 and Q4 as you see it? I know you mentioned some hiring ahead of kind of first half '19 demand. But was there anything else going on? Because I guess depreciation comes at -- continues to ramp, so I get that. But on the other side, the peso seems cooperative. Glass benefit should continue to build, I would assume, and so on. So is it really just the incremental hiring that forms the delta between Q3 and Q4? Or is there something else?
David Klein: So it's all of the above. So it's incremental depreciation as we bring more assets online. It's continued line commissioning costs, again, as we bring assets online. And remember, once we put something into production, the incremental costs go through the P&L as opposed to getting capitalized. We're hiring employees. I think we have like 100 employees that we're bringing in, production employees in Q4 to be prepared for the ramped up production season. And then there is historically in this year, there is seasonality at the net sales level in the beer business. So again, we're not expecting -- we're not -- I don't want to sit here and really apologize for the margins in the fourth quarter. I'm just suggesting that the margins will be a little bit lighter than they were in say, Q2 when we hit an all-time high. But understanding where we're going to end up with the margins is actually why we took up our guidance in -- or at least tightened the guidance to the top end of the EBIT growth range year-over-year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: I'd like to follow up on the beer volumes commentary. I just wanted to clarify. Did you mean that the fourth quarter shipment will be more in line with depletions or just for the year as you do the year-to-date? As you correctly pointed out, the difference year-to-date is definitely narrower. But you're talking about fourth quarter coming up to be obviously, catching up with depletions and with shipments against depletions accelerating above shipments, accelerating above depletions to match the year-to-date. And then I'd also would like to follow up on the capital structure. Is your new buyback plan an indication that the uses of capital will be more heavily weighted on towards cash return to shareholders or compared to strategic M&A?
David Klein: So on the billings and depletions kind of alignment, first of all, in terms of -- at the end of the year, we'll deplete and ship about the same number of cases. The percentages will be off a little bit just because of the starting point from last year. But we -- I think the best way to do your math is to come back in line with the 9% to 11% net sales growth and the 1% to 2% pricing algorithm, kind of putting you in the very high-single digits in net sales. And again, that's kind of where we are year-to-date on the depletions basis. In terms of capital structure, Andrea, I would say that what the authorization represents is that we're getting closer to the time where we have more and more free cash flow to deploy, and we're saying that we're going to use that in all the ways we have before. But clearly, we're going to buy back a lot of our stock because we continue to believe that the company is undervalued.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.
Caroline Levy: My question's around Corona, your flagship brand. If you could talk about what the trends were like in the last quarter, in the third quarter, and how you're thinking about potential cannibalization with Corona Premier or with Familiar on your existing brand. Is that something you're going to be watching very closely, where you don't want to see your flagship Corona dip, even if it is a positive margin trade? So just to talk a little bit about how should we be thinking about that April launch.
Robert Sands: Yes. So we think Corona remains healthy, very healthy in fact, given its maturity. It was up about 3% in the quarter.
David Klein: Beer [ph] depletions, right?
Robert Sands: Yes, on depletions. And that's pretty consistent with where it's tracking, so we see good growth there and good continued growth. Now Corona is the most -- Corona Extra per se is the most mature of the brands in the portfolio. But given its state of maturity and the large market shares it has in particular places, we think it's doing very well, and we think that it will continue to do well. And then you asked about Premier, and I think that your question was on cannibalization. And yes, I mean, we're looking at that. We tested it. The cannibalization was probably less than we thought that it would be in fact, which was encouraging. The cannibalization is not a problem per se because it's not a lower-margin product. But we, nevertheless, wanted everything to be more at -- we want one plus one to add up to three, which is what all indications were in our test market. So yes, we'll be looking at the cannibalization, but you can imagine that it's two different consumers to a certain degree, meaning the people that are going to be attracted to a Premier are going to be people who are already drinking some version of a light and low-carbohydrate beer, like a Mich Ultra, okay. And people that are drinking Corona are obviously doing so without regard to it being not a light or low-carbohydrate beer. So just logically, we don't expect there to be a lot of cannibalization there.
Operator: Your final question will come from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.
William Chappell: I'll try to do two quick ones. One, just follow up on tax. I understand you're still trying to figure out the final benefit. But has there been any discussion from the board of the company of kind of how much of that will be spent back or reinvested? Or how you would spend the extra money in your pocket? And then my other question, just on the business. Any kind of update on on-premise and kind of how that's trending? We heard from different sources that there've been a lot of taps added for craft and all types of brands on-premise. And it seems maybe, you're not getting the volume terms, and so maybe there's some reversal there. So if you could you give us some update there, that would be great.
David Klein: So in terms of tax, unlike a lot of companies that had -- that are sitting on piles on cash overseas and they're looking for something to do with it in the next several months, our situation's a little different in that we've already heavily invested the cash that we generated overseas into things like our breweries in Mexico as well as our Canopy investment in Canada. And so for us, I think the cash flow benefits that we think accrue over time get deployed along the lines of the rest of our -- or our previously stated capital allocation strategy, which is continue to invest in the business, return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and occasionally where we can get in a growth accretive and ROIC accretive sort of M&A transaction, we'll look at that as well. So I would say that, that piece doesn't change. And then in terms of on-premise, our beer business continues to do really well, I think for the last -- this quarter, we're up high single digits. I think that's been a consistent trend over the last several quarters. And so we're just seeing continued strong performance of our brands and the brands in the on-premise, even while during the same time, overall trends in the on-premise have been down, call it low single digits.
Operator: I'll now return the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.
Robert Sands: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining our call today. We certainly -- we apologize for the line going dead for a few minutes, but we rectified that. I would say that our business has performed exceptionally well for the first nine months of fiscal '18, and we are very confident that we'll continue to sustain our profitable growth by executing on our TBA premiumization strategy. Just as a reminder, during our next quarterly call, we will be providing guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. Prior to that, we look forward to seeing many of you at the Beer Industry Summit conference in a couple of weeks and at the CAGNY conference in late February, where we'll be providing updates on our strategic business initiatives. So thanks again, everybody, for joining the call, and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the Constellation Brands Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we limit each Q&A session participant to one question, which will help us to end our call on schedule. Thanks, in advance and now, here is Rob.
Rob Sands: Thank you, Patty and good morning everyone. Before we get started with our quarterly review, I would like to convey my sincere sympathy to all who have been affected by the string of recent natural disasters and tragedies. Thankfully the earthquakes in Mexico did not have an impact on our production operations there, but our sympathies to all of our affected families. So now, let's get started with our discussion of Constellation's second quarter fiscal 2018 sales and earnings results. We delivered exceptional results for the second quarter of our fiscal year. Throughout the business, we gained share overall, improved margins, continued to generate strong free cash flow, and executed exceptionally well both operationally and end market. These results are a testament to the fact that our total beverage alcohol or TBA strategy is paying-off. We remained a leader in the high-end of the U.S. beer market, and we are reaping the benefits of our wine and spirits premiumization strategy.  As a matter of fact, our beer business which remains the number one growth driver in the high end of the U.S. beer market generated more than 60% of the growth of this market segment during the quarter.  Overall Constellation has been the clear winner during the 120 days of summer for the past four years growing dollar share of the total beer market more than any other leading supplier.  Excellent execution during the July 4 holiday, the most important holiday for the U.S. beer industry, drove significant market share gains for the quarter. During this timeframe, Constellation had five brands in the top $20 share gainers, including Modelo Especial and Corona Extra in the number two and number three positions, as well as Pacifico, Modelo Negra, Modelo Chelada, and Tamarindo Picante for example.  Record level distribution gains and increased media activities continued to drive greater than 60% of our overall depletion growth. Across the portfolio, you can see excellent results of these efforts.  Additional TV advertising and digital support propelled Corona Extra, which was recently named by InterBrand as one of the best global brands of 2017 for the eighth year in a row. The Corona can format grew more than 20% during the quarter, with the launch of its limited edition, Beach in a Can packaging. And Corona Extra was the official beer sponsor of the Mayweather versus McGregor fight, which set the new record for the largest viewing boxing audience. Modelo Especial increased TV advertising and promotional investments beginning with the NBA finals in early June, and was also named the official beer of two prominent soccer tournaments, including the Gold Cup, all of which led to the games in trial and awareness versus a year ago. And Modelo Chelada Especial was recently named 2017 Nielson Breakthrough Innovation Award Winner.  These activities drove depletion growth of almost 20% for the Modelo Especial family of brands for the quarter. Pacifico continues to capture new consumers by building brand awareness and trial across the brand’s priority geographies. During the quarter, Pacifico TV advertising aired across the Western U.S., Colorado and Texas.  Now this activity was complemented by year round social media support on both Facebook and Instagram. In addition, the Summer X Games chose Pacifico as their exclusive beer partner for their competition in July.  As we head into the second half of the year, the beer portfolio is well positioned from a marketing and promotional perspective, supporting the professional and college football season, as well as key boxing and soccer sponsorships. Our innovation test markets for Corona Premier and Corona Familiar continue to be very successful. As a result we plan to nationally launch Premier beginning in fiscal 2019, with Familiar rolling out to all major Hispanic markets, a key demographic for this brand during the same time frame. I’d like to remind everyone that the benefits of these new product introductions have already been included in the growth goals that we have outlined at our New York City Investor Day last November. During the quarter, we added Funky Buddha Brewery to our newly established Craft and Specialty Beer business. Florida based Funky Buddha is a regional craft beer player and South Florida's largest craft microbrewery by size and volume. The acquisition of Funky Buddha is a continuation of our beer strategy to be the leader in the high-end of the U.S. beer market. This brand has great potential and plenty of runway for future growth and we plan to leverage that potential to begin building a stronger presence in the high-end craft beer as this market segment continues to be one of the key growth drivers within the U.S. beer market. Our goal is to continue to grow distribution of the brand throughout the State of Florida, as well as targeted expansions into key new states. From an operations perspective, our capital expansion projects in Mexico continues to be on track on all fronts. The Nava Brewery achieved record production volumes during the second quarter and we look forward to completing the next phase of expansion taking the brewery to 27.5 million hectoliters of capacity by calendar year-end.  Glass Furnace number 3 is now fully operational and ramping to peak efficiency levels. The Obregon Brewery continues to perform at very high utilization levels, and we are currently optimizing existing capacity as we plan to increase capacity in both brewing and packaging before the end of the fiscal year. Construction continues in Mexicali and we are making solid progress. Brewhouse tank fabrication and installation are currently in process; and building structures for brewing, packaging, and utilities are well underway. Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in second quarter are driving the upward revision in our EPS guidance for the year. David will have more to say in this regard in a few moments. Now turning to our wine and spirits business, during the second quarter, we gained momentum for our wine business gaining market share and delivering strong depletion growth of 5%. And while we continue to improve margins for this business, the significant margin enhancement that we saw in the first quarter from positive mix and a divestiture of the Canadian business were somewhat offset by planned investments in marketing primarily for our focused brands as well as promotional activity as shipments and depletions became aligned through the first half of the year. These investments are obviously paying off as we posted depletion growth of more than 12% for our focused brands during the quarter driven by Black Box, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, and SWEDKA Vodka. And within our focused brand portfolio, our top five profit contributors are collectively growing volume 10% with profits also growing double-digits year-to-date. As we head into our key selling season for the wine and spirits business, we have solid programming in place and are well positioned to develop our goals for the year. Planned investments including Black Box Digital Advertising, the launch of a new TV campaign for Kim Crawford beginning this fall, as well as the continuation of Woodbridge TV and digital advertising to increase awareness and fuel momentum for this brand. In addition, the new first ever national digital advertising program for Meiomi will continue leading up to the holidays. Now from an innovation perspective, the 7 Moons Red Blend Wine brand is gaining momentum and has already become a top 10 premium Red Blend. And our recent Rose line extensions have taken off including Meiomi, Kim Crawford and Black Box Rose brands. Our acquired wine and spirits brands are performing exceptionally well, including High West Whiskey and Casa Noble tequila, as well as the Prisoner, Meiomi and Charles Smith Wine Brands. On a year-to-date basis, through the first half, these brands collectively delivered depletion growth of 23% with a gross margin in the 60% range. And following the recent Schrader acquisition Constellation has become a top $100 plus Cabernet Sauvignon wine producer.  Our spirits portfolio posted net sales growth of 2% for the quarter, driven primarily by High West Whiskey. In addition, SVEDKA Vodka gained market share of the vodka category due impart to the successful launch of the new SVEDKA Blue Roseberry flavor. Now in closing, I am pleased with our second quarter results and what we have accomplished in the first half of the year. The total beverage alcohol portfolio remains strong. As many of our high-end beer and premium wine and spirits brands gain share. It is these products that remain growth drivers within the TBA category, which is expected to continue in the future. In addition, our portfolio performance and execution by our commercial and operational teams continues to drive margin benefits, giving us the confidence to raise our guidance for the year. With that I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our financial results for the second quarter. 
David Klein: Thanks, Rob and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone saw our new press release format and found it helpful. We decided to provide the financial press, analyst and investors with our financial results, accomplishments and strategic initiatives in a more concise and easy to use format. Our Q2 results demonstrated continued strong financial performance as we generated 8% organic net sales growth, expanded our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by 340 basis points and increased comparable basis EBIT by 14%. These results include particularly strong operational performance by our beer business, which along with anticipated favorability in our tax rate is driving an increase in our full year comparable basis diluted EPS goal to a range of $8.25 to $8.40 per share. We believe the recent natural disasters had a minor impact on our Q2 results and may have some minimal impact on Q3 results, which we factored into our new guidance. However, we continue to monitor the situation in these affected areas. Let's look at Q2 performance and our full year outlook in more detail where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. For beer, net sales increased 13% on volume growth of 12%. Depletion growth came in at 8% as we won the 4th of July holiday and the rest of the key summer selling season. We overlapped a difficult 14% depletion growth comparison for Q2 fiscal ‘17. Shipment growth ran ahead of depletion growth after we saw the opposite trend in Q1. For the first half of the year shipment and depletion growth rates are both in the 9% to 10% range, this has us on track to meet our net sales goal for fiscal ‘18 as we continue to expect net sales growth to be in the 9% to 11% range. This includes 1% to 2% of pricing targeted for our Mexican portfolio. Beer operating margin increased 420 basis points to 41.1%, primarily due to lower COGS, favorable pricing and foreign currency benefits. The lower COGS reflect benefits from supply independence from ABI and glass sourcing as we saw strong operational performance at our breweries and glass plant during the peak summer production period. Our Nave Brewery generated record production volume and performed ahead of our expectations for the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by a $13 million increase in depreciation expense, which totaled $40 million for Q2.  Given the strong operational performance, we now expect beer operating income growth to be in the range of 17% to 19%. The expected moderation in beer operating income growth and margin for the back half of the year versus the first half of the year is being primarily driven by lower production volume due to normal seasonality, combined with the continued ramp up in depreciation and line commissioning costs including headcount additions to support our expanding operating platform.  In addition SG&A leverage is impacted by the lower volumes that occur in the second half of the year, as a result of the seasonality of the business. Last quarter, we indicated that we expected an unfavorable foreign currency impact due to tougher peso comparisons in the back half of fiscal ‘18. However this headwind has been mitigated through our hedging program and we currently expect an unfavorable currency impact to be fairly minimal. For wine and spirits, we saw a strong Q2 U.S. depletion growth of 5%, which outpaced U.S. shipment volume, primarily due to timing, as we reported shipments ahead of depletions in Q1. This contributed to Q2 organic net sales being down 1% as favorable mix was more than offset by lower volume. Promotional expense was higher in Q2 than Q1 due impart to the increase in depletions we saw in Q2 versus Q1. At the half way mark of fiscal ‘18, organic net sales are up 2% and U.S. depletions are also up 2%, while operating margin increased 330 basis points, driving operating income growth of 5%. For the quarter, wine and spirits operating margin increased 40 basis points to 26.2%. This improvement primarily reflects the divestiture of the lower margin Canadian wine business and favorable mix, partially offset by higher marketing investments. For fiscal ‘18, we continue to expect wine and spirits reported net sales to decrease in the range of 4% to 6% and operating income to be flat. These projections include the negative impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture and the estimated incremental benefits from the High West, Charles Smith, and Prisoner acquisitions.  When excluding the impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture from our fiscal ‘17 wine and spirits results, we continue to expect net sales growth of 4% to 6% and operating income growth of 5% to 7%. The moderation of our wine and spirits operating growth in the back half of fiscal ‘18 implied by our guidance is being driven primarily by Q3 activities, including planned marketing and SG&A investments during the key holiday season and loss of $17 million of operating income from the Canadian wine business, which was recognized in Q3 last year. As a result of these factors, we are targeting and wine and spirits operating income to be down in the low to mid-teens range for Q3 fiscal ‘18 on a reported basis. I’d also like to note, that as part of our premiumization efforts, we have been rationalizing lower margin, value brand SKUs. These actions are expected to impact wine and spirits revenue growth by almost 100 basis points for fiscal ‘18, while improving operating margin and ROIC. Interest expense decreased 14% as the benefit of lower average interest rates was partially offset by higher average debt balances. We now expect fiscal year ‘18 interest expense to be in the range of $330 million to $340 million. The improvement is primarily related to short-term interest rates, trending more favorable than our earlier projections.  We recently announced plans to launch a Commercial Paper Program to improve short-term borrowing costs, which is typical for investment grade companies. The program is expected to be an unregistered private placement and provide for the issuance of up to $1 billion of commercial paper. The program is expected to be supported with available commitments under our revolving credit facility, so it will not result in an increase in the total amount of our authorized debt.  When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of August totaled $8.8 billion, a $230 million decrease from our net debt balance at the end of fiscal 2017. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio moved down to 3.3 times at the end of August from 3.7 times at the end of fiscal '17, while we continue to invest in our Mexican operations, build our portfolio and return cash to shareholders with $201 million worth of dividends paid and $14 million of stock repurchases during the first half of the year. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 20.5% versus 31.8% last year. This improvement reflects the benefit of reinvesting foreign earnings under APB 23 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires excess tax benefits from stock based payment awards to be recognized in the income statement.  For fiscal '18 we now expect the effective tax rate to approximate 21% versus our previous guidance of 22%. The lower projected rate is primarily due to an increase in forecasted excess tax benefits from stock based payment awards and lower effective tax rates on the foreign earnings of our beer business. We expect our Q3 tax rate to be higher than our full year tax rate and Q4 to be in line with that full year rate. I would also like to note for fiscal '18 we continue to expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximately 201 million shares and net income attributable to non-controlling interest is now expected to approximate $10 million to $15 million versus our prior estimate of about $10 million. As mentioned earlier, we're now projecting our full year comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $8.25 to $8.40. The midpoint of this guidance has us targeting 23% growth. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments which are detailed in the release.  Moving to free cash flow, which we defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated $598 million of free cash flow for the first half of fiscal '18 versus $676 million for the same period last year. As operating cash flow growth was more than offset by an increase in CapEx. We continue to expect fiscal '18 free cash flow to be in the range of $725 million to $825 million. We did not revise our free cash flow as the benefit from our projected earnings increase is expected to be offset by unfavorable timing of recoverable value added taxes. Our free cash flow guidance reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and CapEx of $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion, including approximately $1 billion of CapEx targeted for our Mexico beer operations expansion. In closing, our beer business continues to deliver impressive operational and marketplace execution, while generating top tier sales and profit growth. And our portfolio premiumization efforts continue to enhance the financial profile of our wine and spirits business.  With that Rob and I are happy to take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. 
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning guys. 
Rob Sands: Hey, Dara. 
Dara Mohsenian: So first just a detail question. David you indicated hedging offsets a lot of the peso FX margin impact in beer this fiscal year. I'm just wondering if you can quantify if we stayed at current spot rates, can you give us a sense for how much of a drag FX will be to beer margins in fiscal '19? And then the real question is Rob, I was hoping you could flush out a bit more detail on Corona Premier success in test markets. It looks pretty solid at around 3% of sales in the test markets and tracked channels. So just any details around the magnitude of traction for the brand in test markets, the cannibalization that you're seeing on the rest of the portfolio, and then any expectations around the national launch next fiscal year. Thanks.
David Klein: So Dara, on the first part the current effective FX rate, so kind of net of our hedges on a year-to-date basis is probably in that mid-18s range. So to the extent that current spot’s a little lower than that, it would be a bit of a drag next year, but not much.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay. 
Rob Sands: Yes, so as it relates to Premier, the test markets have been very successful. What do we mean by successful, what we are looking at is pretty much things like velocity per point of distribution, which for a new product, Premier’s velocity per point of distribution was high. And the other thing that we are looking at which is in actuality a relatively minor concern is cannibalization, which actually turned out to be significantly lower than we expected.  Now I’d say that cannibalization is a relatively minor concern and that’s cannibalization of our own products because there is no margin difference between Corona Premier and the other products, so cannibalization isn’t really an issue as long as one plus one equals three. And right now I would say that it’s looking definitively like one plus one will equal three, because given our market shares versus the rest of the market, if cannibalization is the right term, we’re really taking share from competitors not to a large degree from ourselves, which makes logical sense. So, looks good. 
Dara Mohsenian: Okay, great. Thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. 
Rob Sands: Hey Bryan. 
Bryan Spillane: Hi, good morning everyone. My question was around advertising. Can you give us a sense David, sort of specifically in beer what type of increase you’ve had in advertising and promotion this year? And then, I guess some color on still are you getting the immediate lift, when you are adding more marketing and advertising in the market, and I think that was the case last year. So just trying to get a sense if you are putting more into the market and if you are still getting that good sort of immediate lift off your advertising?
David Klein: Yes, so, it was still -- we are still running in general in that 8.5% to 9% range. Clearly, that means the dollars are up because of the growth of our business. And just kind of as a note, we will see as a percentage of net sales higher marketing spend in Q3, simply because of the lower sales quarter and we spend money with the NFL property. So again we’re spending about the same percentage as we have in the past. And yet we continue to see really impressive returns on our marketing spend in our beer business, which I think is tribute to the quality of the advertising that our marketing team puts in place, as well as the power of the brands. But we monitor that return on an ongoing basis, and we’re going to continue to invest in our brands in our beer business, and you’re going to see us begin to invest more in our brands in our wine business, which will also see a fairly large increase on a percentage of net sales basis in Q3 versus where we have been in the past. 
Bryan Spillane: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. 
Adam Scott: Hi, good morning. It’s actually Adam Scott on line for Bonnie. Question on the wine and spirits business, obviously really great performance in Focus brands with depletions up 12%, but the implied growth of non-Focus brands was almost down 6%. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the strategy behind these brands and maybe whether at some point it might make sense to divest them or perhaps to reinvigorate them, since they are such a drag. So if you could just touch on that, that’d be great. Thanks.
Rob Sands: Yes, so what you just suggested is not at all unusual in that. Our Focus brands constitutes the vast majority of our sales and profit, it’s almost like a perfect Pareto principle type situation, which almost every company exhibits. In that, a relatively small number of our brands, i.e., our Focus brands which are about 17 or so brands constitutes about 70%, 80% of our profits. And yes, so therefore the rest of the portfolio does represent what we might call tail brands or perhaps more euphemistically technical brands.  The interesting thing in the wine and spirits business is regardless of the growth rate, every brand is profitable and a contributor, therefore to our overall profits. And therefore it makes economic sense to keep them when you look at what the potential value would be to a third party from a discounted cash flow basis versus the value to ourselves. So, that’s why we don’t divest the tail. We also don’t spend a lot of time on it from an operational, marketing, or activity point of view.  Now that said, we have divested lower margin, lower growth tail businesses and brands in the past, where it makes economic sense to do so in the manner that I just described meaning taking a look at what the NPV of the future cash flows of those businesses are compared to what we think that we can sell that for. Canada is a good example of that, a number of years ago, we sold off our value wine business Almaden and Inglenook. We sold of our value spirits business as an example brands like Barton and Crystal Palace, and Mr. Boston and so on and so forth. So we are always evaluating that, but I have given you basically the method under, which we evaluate that and generally speaking the brands that are in our portfolio now are worth more to us than they would be to a third party and that’s why we keep up. And they are profitable and therefore they help fuel the investments that we make in the focus brands.
David Klein: Yes, just one other thing to add to that, Adam, as I said in my script that we have been doing some SKU rationalization, which creates about or create about 100 basis points drag on growth. Nut that’s just good business where we can discontinue a SKU that has a like low 30 margins and replace it with a SKU that has 50% or 60% margins using the same assets.
Adam Scott: Great, thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.
Robert Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. Terrific quarter and very nice press release, well done, I like the new format. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit -- I understand for the year your shipments and depletions are in line, I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about the quarter specifically, why there was such a large difference. Our sense was that they were going to come in close, did that have to do with some year-end slowdown in business or a lot of extra shelf space. So just trying to get a sense specifically for the quarter, why the big difference please?
David Klein: So you are talking about beer Robert?
Robert Ottenstein: Yes, yes, beer shipments and depletions please.
David Klein: Yes, so from -- so when we look at it from a growth rate perspective, what -- I guess so in the first quarter of the year, sorry I am just backing up here. So in the first quarter of the year, we -- you're referencing the fact that we depleted more than we shipped. So we were able to recover in the second quarter, and I would say that we probably did a little bit better job in the recovery than we may have expected thanks to some amazing performance by our operations we’re able to ship a little bit more beer than we would have expected, bringing our distributor inventory days back in line where we would like them to be.
Robert Ottenstein: Okay. So your brewery operations ran more efficiently than you thought they would, so you were able to ship more is that the answer?
David Klein: That's the majority of the answer. And yes, it's not even the efficiency the level of utilization at our breweries was quite high. And again some amazing work by our teams in Mexico.
Robert Ottenstein: Terrific. Congratulations and thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg : Yes, thank you and good morning everyone. Rob and David too, I'm confused why you haven't committed to repo. And the reason I say that is we heard you in November say, we've clarified our leverage objective, it's now 3.5 and we're now sitting at kind of 3.2, 3.3 levels. And there is no comment on repo and the cash flow is going to continue to come. So what's going on and as far as your priorities from an M&A perspective, is it fair to think spirits is your highest priority if you have to consider the comparative share you have there versus your other two businesses?
David Klein: So I'll comment on the repurchase component and I'll let Rob comment on M&A. Our capital allocation philosophy Mark hasn't changed at all. So we said when we were below 3.5 times we would look to buyback our dilution on a systematic basis and more than our dilution say opportunistically. And remember, we’ve repurchased $1.2 billion worth of stock towards the tail-end of last fiscal year. So we waited in Q2 until we got below 3.5 times and then we started with our systematic repurchase of our dilution granted it only amounted to $14 million in the quarter. But that's more of a timing issue than anything else. So we remain committed to our capital allocation principles.
Mark Swartzberg : And then maybe there is a nuance I missed. But is 3.5 the objective or are you willing to go lower than that?
David Klein: So we're going to continue to operate the business kind of targeting 3.5. Now that said, I'm not sure we'll be dogmatic to stay exactly at 3.5, but we will stay in that 3.5 times range over a medium term period of time.
Mark Swartzberg : Got it, okay. 
Rob Sands: And what was your question on M&A Mark?
Mark Swartzberg : Well spirits comparatively high priority versus beer in terms of the size of the assets you might purchase the spirits comparatively higher priority than the other two alcohol businesses.
Rob Sands: Not necessarily. We continue to look across all three categories. So fundamentally, you could see tuck-in acquisitions across beer, wine and spirits. And I'd say we're fairly agnostic relative to the three categories it's more a question of growth and margins and what is -- what we think is opportunistic. So there is good examples across all three categories of tuck-in acquisitions if they were available that would meet the growth and margin and economic criteria that we have. So I wouldn't in any way see performance expect to see from us either just spirits or just beer, just wine I think you’re going to see more of the same kind of the thing that you've seen in the past. So we bought High West, we bought Casa Noble, we bought Charles Smith, we brought Funky Buddha. I mean, so it's been a mix it will continue to be a mix.
Mark Swartzberg : Great, thank you.
David Klein: By the way Mark, if the question also relates to by not staying at 3.5 times are we in some way loading up for something, the answer is no, it just we're going to be around that 3.5 times range and we do intend to buy our stock back as well as invest in our business as well as do M&A.
Mark Swartzberg : Super, I'm glad you so that that exactly what I was trying to get clarity on. Thank you gentlemen.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie. 
Caroline Levy : Good morning and again my congratulations and I think you just set the gold standard in press releases. In terms of the -- I was just wonder if you could help us understand this growth in beer, if you took your biggest brands Corona and Modelo, could you quantify perhaps how much of their growth is distribution gains and how much I mean how happy are you with the trends in velocities at existing point of distribution?
David Klein: Yes, so from a distribution standpoint, we've said that about 60% of our growth has come from distribution gains and in fact the beer sales team has done an outstanding job of executing against their distribution objectives for the year and now we're seeing a bit of an acceleration of our distribution growth across the portfolio. So, a majority of it is based upon the growth in distribution in the business.
Rob Sands: And then to the second part of your question we're entirely unhappy and disappointed with our distribution growth because we don't have the distribution that we ought to have as a company meaning in beer and given the growth and margins to the retailer of our portfolio. So, the good news in that is we're making progress, but there is a lot of room left to go in distribution, which basically means there is a big growth runway ahead of us.
Caroline Levy : Thank you. Just on the velocities, is Corona significantly higher than Modelo or visa-versa?
Rob Sands: Yes, velocity?
Caroline Levy : Yes.
Rob Sands: Yes, Corona would have a higher velocity than Modelo, I believe, we'll double check that.
David Klein : Yes, I don't have the individual brand velocities with me.
Rob Sands: I don't either.
Caroline Levy : Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong : Thank you, good morning. 
David Klein : Hey, Judy.
Judy Hong : So, just, I guess couple of quick questions related to your guidance. So, when I kind of think about your depletion outlook for the balance of the year, I think it implies sort of stable growth versus what you've seen the first half of the year. The comparisons are little bit easier, you had talked about maybe a minor impact from the hurricanes, you've got the Premier launch in kind of the beginning of next year. Just so trying to get a little bit more of an understanding where the upside versus kind of the downside case in terms of depletion guidance. And then David, just in terms of the margin for the back half for beer, obviously it does employ I think something like a 36% EBIT margin. So, kind of the delta between first half versus the second half, is it mostly attributable to really the lower volume related to the seasonality of the business?
David Klein : Yes, so I'll take the second one first. So, if you look at the seasonality of the business and use the last couple years of as an example, we sell about 55% to 60% of our total years beer in the first half of the year. And I think if you look at our fixed cost in our business plus from an operation standpoint plus thinking of SG&A as roughly fixed across the year and you kind of apply the seasonality against that you get a pretty reasonable drag in the back half of the year and we think that's going to be the normal seasonal cycle going forward. In addition to that this year we do have work going on at Nava and at Obregon that will result in line commissioning cost and incremental labor coming on to support the expansion. And then of course we have the continued addition of depreciation as we put assets into service. So, I think we'll when we get through this year we'll be able to outline a better seasonality model, but that's what we're expecting. And then in terms of depletions, we’re -- I would say that we’re pretty balanced in terms of where our guidance is because we have a -- we do have an easier overlap in particular in Q4 from a depletion standpoint with beer. At the same time we’re sitting here at just over 8% depletions in Q2. So, we think that we’re pretty balanced in terms of deplete forecast if you will.
Judy Hong: Got it. Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse.
Laurent Grandet: Good morning everyone. I have got one follow-up from the question from Caroline about the beer segment. So could you please update us on the commercial approach to gain shelf space from slow moving competitive brands specifically craft beer and light beer? How I mean are you assessing your progress on these? And then the second one, as you are one of the best if not the best commercial -- beer commercial organization in the U.S. besides M&A could we envisage you to import or to distribute the beer from Europe or Japan to leverage better your assets in the U.S. Thank you. 
Rob Sands: Yes, so first on shelf space. Our increases in distribution are specifically coming from the kind of thing that you mentioned either shelf space coming from slower moving craft SKUs or slower moving domestic. As we increase our shelf space, because the overall beer shelf space I wouldn’t say at this stage is growing. So, I mean that is precisely the trust and the concept and our discussion with retailers is that they can improve their growth rate and their profitability per unit shelf space by devoting more shelf space to our growth portfolio and high margin portfolio than either low margin domestic beer, or craft that is not moving. And then on your second question, imports other than our own, I would say at the moment don’t [inaudible] are not very exciting to us for a couple reasons. Number one, if you look at imports as a category in the United States, I would say the vast majority if not almost all of the growth in imports with a small exception of a couple of small brands is coming from our portfolio. So, it’s a little bit of a misnomer to think that the growth in the beer category to the extent that there is any is coming from imports, it is not, it is coming from Constellations portfolio of Mexican beers. And then there is also growth coming from the craft segment and that’s about it. And then number two, we’re uninterested, completely uninterested in taking on imports of other companies at an agency basis, in fact we gave up those imports. So we used to have brands like Ching-Dao in the portfolio and St. Pauli Girl and those were agency brands. Now the margins on that kind of business are not consistent with the kind of businesses and the kind of business that we’re interested in, point number one. And then point number two, there isn’t really much growth in imports from any country except Mexico and that’s all coming from our portfolio and of course there is like one or two small exceptions to what I am saying. But they literally are one or two small exception.  So, hopefully that answers your question. 
Laurent Grandet : Yes very clear. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group.
Tim Ramey: Thanks so much, good morning and congrats on a great performance again. Rob you’ve made a great case for incremental distributions and phasings in the beer segment. And it was couple of years back that we did the big distributor realignment in wine and I think the 5% depletion growth in wine in this quarter and particularly the strong growth rates in the focus brands. It leaves me to ask the question do you have the ability to kind of ask -- under this total beverage alcohol discussion do you have the ability to go to retailers and say we’re not getting fair share phasings in wine or make that case to your distribution. How do you think about that?
Rob Sands: Well, I mean the answer to that is yes, especially in when you look at our focus brands and some of our most key brands, I mean the -- what you are describing and I know you know this is sort of the essence of what we call sales execution. But okay, in wine and spirits, it’s slightly different than beer, although very slightly, because what I am about to say really applies all three categories. But in wine and spirits in particular because of the -- and really wine in particular because of the very, very high degree of fragmentation versus beer for argument sake. The total key is merchandising and when we talk about merchandising it’s all about getting the product on the floor and advertised by the retailer with some kind of a deal, that’s really the key to execution in really wine and spirits a little less so in beer where it’s about getting more of that shelf, which continues to be dominated by really just a couple of companies that represent the vast majority of the market share in beer in the country, but have declining portfolios.  That said, merchandising in beer is important too, getting the floor is also important but now in wine a wine bottle on a shelf is one wine bottle and one label amongst 1,000. 
Q - Tim Ramey: Yes. 
Rob Sands: And so, if you really want to have your product in danger of being purchased right, there is no better way than having a display of your product on the floor in front of the cash register and in the stores add with a discount so that consumers can easily pickup a bottle of it as they checkout at the cash register. So as I said that is the essence -- it’s the essence of sales execution.
Tim Ramey: So would you argue that the point of leverage is with the retailer with a discussion on total beverage alcohols, or is it I need to go back to blocking and tackling with the distributor?
Rob Sands: I would say that it’s both, but as far as TBA goes, total beverage alcohol, I think it’s a retail story. And what I mean by that is that there is a number of facts that are extremely important that the retailer needs to understand and really probably doesn’t understand and there is two facts. And I think it if you were back to school, Bill Newlands our COO and David talked about this. A very large percentage of consumers right now are shopping across all three categories at once. So they are buying wine, beer and spirits, I think the number is something like 55% of consumers are shopping and drinking across all three categories, which is far different than it used to be years ago. And so we need to address those consumers’ desires and we would do that at retail by offering our TBA portfolio of premium and growing brands, that’s point number to the retailer. Point number two to the retailer is almost even a more important point and that is that if a retail basket contains all three beverage alcohol products meaning beer, wine and spirits, the total value of the ring will be larger by several hundred percent than a basket that only has one category in it of the three or even two categories in it of the three. So, that's what retail is all about and the most successful retailers in the country are all about how do we increase the average size of the ring i.e., the basket as the shopper leaves the store and there probably is no better way to do that than to get the consumer to purchase all three categories. Because if I do that that consumer is going to be a very big purchaser in that store.
Tim Ramey: Perfect, thanks so much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
Bill Chappell: Thanks and good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on Funky Buddha and just kind of the decision on that and based on kind of the learnings some Ballast Point, how might that be different, how does that lead to maybe looking at other type acquisitions I mean you had kind of taken a break from Ballast Point to this. And so just trying to understand how this might be different in terms of your thought process after having Ballast Point for couple of years?
Rob Sands: Yes, that's an interesting question. And there is some very significant learnings relative to that and what we are doing with Ballast Point relates to that and how we're treating Funky Buddha also relates to that. So, I would say that when the craft beer business as a general proposition was growing at a much faster rate, the modus operandi that most craft businesses had including Ballast Point before we bought it and for a period of time after we bought it was create a whole bunch of products, throw them out, try to throw them out there everywhere and anywhere you can and see what happens and let the consumer decide. As the business has slowed down, as there is a SKU contraction going on that modus operandi really doesn't work anymore because what you found is that just putting the product out everywhere and anywhere around the country in stores that may not have a very high what we call CDI category development index, doesn't make a lot of sense because the stuff just sits on the shelf that gets old and now consumers are sort of realizing that. So, what we've done with Ballast Point is number one we're consolidating the distribution network into our gold network, that's a very important learning and very important to us Funky Buddha if and when we expanded outside of Florida that will be a key tenant number one. Number two, focusing on key SKU that are really driving the growth as oppose to overly fragmenting the portfolio and then driving or marketing against those key SKUs, marketing and promotion. Where we know that there is velocity and consumer interest that's another key learning as oppose to just putting out 50 different things. So driving this usually two or three or four key SKUs that are important. And then the third element, which is really important is not expanding geographically too quick and therefore into markets where there is no consumer awareness of the brand there is really no marketing just throwing the product out there to retailers. Because it will just sit there and won’t be reordered and that's where you sort of see a bit of a slowdown. And a lot of these companies is that they are cycling through having throwing a lot out there and then finding out that it's not repeat business. So, number one with Funky Buddha, we get the beauty of being able to apply those tenants straight off the bat and therefore I would say building a stronger more consistent and more measured growth story with Ballast Point we’re retreating to that approach and philosophy a bit and hence that’s why you see some of the shorter term negative impact in Ballast Point, which I would say that as we move into our next fiscal, you will see us cycle that. And we’re pretty hopeful that our activities there will take hold, because we have moved it to our gold network, they are extremely highly motivated to drive the brand, the liquids are award winning and fantastic. So there is nothing fundamentally wrong with it other than the approach that was previously taken was not I’d say the kind of professional approach that we as a major company could really bring to it. So we’re in that process right now and those are new learnings from our Ballast Point experience. So more to come.
Bill Chappell: Thanks so much, I appreciate it. 
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Tom Coleman of Kentico [ph].
Rob Sands: Hey, Tom. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys, how are you doing? Great job, I got a question, no one has asked it, very important question. How did you guys know to stick with the New York Jet’s Corona Red Zone promotion? Who figured that out, that they were going to be two in two after four weeks?
Rob Sands: It’s pure [indiscernible]. We’re not going to go into gambling, because we probably all be arrested Tom. 
Unidentified Analyst: Good job, good job. 
Rob Sands: Because of these forward knowledge that we have of these matters.
Unidentified Analyst: Exactly alright, well fantastic quarter, hope to see you guys soon. 
Rob Sands: Thank you. 
David Klein: Thanks Tom. 
Operator: Thank you, I will now return the call to Rob Sands, for any additional or closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Okay, as we close out the discussion for our second quarter results, I want to thank everyone, everyone who contributed to the strong performance of our business for the first half of the year. Though the year is far from complete, our new guidance reflects the confidence we have in our ability to sustain our growth momentum in the second half.  Our next quarterly call is scheduled for early January, when we will share the results of our third quarter. Until then we wish you all a safe and happy holiday season, certainly in our business this time of the year is great. And it’s a great opportunity to responsibly share Constellation’s fine beer, wine and spirits products with friends and family. So thanks again everybody for joining our call and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for participating in the Constellation Brands second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your question. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Laurie. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. I am Patty Yahn-Urlaub from Investor Relations and I’m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call.  Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we limit each Q&A session participant to one question, one versus two prior, which will help us to end our call on schedule. Thanks, in advance and now, here is Rob.
Rob Sands: Thank you, Patty. Good morning, and welcome to our discussion of Constellation's first quarter fiscal 2018 sales and earnings results. Our quarterly results reflect the continuation of our winning streak, as we produced results that delivered our 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable EPS growth. I’m also pleased to report that this morning we achieved a new all-time high stock price while significantly outperforming the S&P 500 so far this year. So let’s get underway with a review of the business performance that delivered these fantastic results. We’ll start with Constellation's beer business, which remained the number one growth driver in the high-end of the U.S. beer market, driving 60% of the growth of this market segment, while posting double-digit depletions and significantly improving margins.  Excellent execution during the Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays drove significant market share gains for the quarter. As a matter of fact, Constellation claimed 5 of the top 15 high-end share gainer spots during Cinco de Mayo with Modelo Especial coming in as a number one growth driver followed by Corona Extra in the number three spot and Pacifico rounding out the top five. During this quarter we increased media investments for Corona Extra and launched New English and Spanish language National TV campaigns including a new TV advertisement highlighting limited edition can packaging. Casa Modelo’s flagship Modelo Especial brand is on fire, gaining distribution while delivering depletion growth of almost 20% for the first quarter. Also under the Casa Modelo Umbrella, we launched the new Modelo Chelada flavor, Tamarindo Picante which is supported with a fully integrated marketing and merchandising plan, as well as Modelo Chelada three packs both of which saw strong sales in the quarter. We expanded our national TV advertising efforts during the first quarter for the Pacifico brand, which posted depletion growth of 20%, representing an acceleration from where we ended fiscal 2017. And our new product entrance into the marketplace including Corona Premier and the Corona Familiar are showing strong performance in markets where they are currently available with velocities and consumer acceptance exceeding our expectations.  Thanks to the great effort to the beer team, I am pleased to announce that Constellation recently tied for the top ranked supplier in the latest Tamarron Malt Beverage Supplier Performance Survey.  Now from an operations perspective our Nava brewery completed its expansion phase to 25 million hectoliters last quarter ahead of the schedule and we look forward to completing the next phase of expansion taking the brewery to 27.5 million hectoliters of capacity by calendar year-end. As we speak furnace number three is heating up at the Nava glass plant and is expected to be producing glass later this summer, right on schedule. The Obregon brewery continues to perform at its very high utilization level and we are optimizing existing Obregon capacity and packaging capabilities that are designed to increase output by early next year. These actions have allowed us to take a more measured approach from a timeline standpoint to the greenfield brewery site in Mexicali, while ensuring we have product supply to satisfy our growth expectations. Overall the strong results that the beer business achieved in the first quarter are driving the upward revision to our EPS guidance for the year. David will have more to say in this regard in a few moments. Turning now to Ballast Point, this business has not performed to expectations from a growth standpoint. As a result we recorded an impairment charge related to the trademark value of the acquired brands for the first quarter. However we remained committed to achieving our targeted return on investment for this acquisition. Ballast Point continues to gain distribution and is currently positioned as a top 20 craft brand in the U.S. market.  Going forward we are focused on the following; gaining greater distributor alignment with the goal of distributor network where possible, developing a more focused brand architecture led by the flagship Sculpin brand, investing in Ballast Point’s first consumer marketing campaign and leveraging the import side of the beer business as well as other TBA resources within the company.  Overall craft beer continues to be one of the key growth segments within the U.S beer market. We plan to look for ways to leverage the Ballast Point craft beer platform, as it is an important part of our high-end strategy and we remain optimistic about the prospects for this business going forward. Now before we begin our discussion of results for our wine and spirits business, I’d like to highlight our recent acquisition of Schrader Cellars, which is a California based fine wine company known for producing superior quality distinctive wines. These wines are sourced from the prestigious vineyards of Napa Valley, including the famed Beckstoffer To Kalon vineyards in Oakville, California. Schrader Cellars is America’s highest rated, highest rated maker of Cabernet Sauvignon with 19, 100 point ratings from legendary critics like Robert Parker of the Wine Advocate, James Lobby of Wine Spectator and James Suckling. Today approximately 90% of Schrader’s inventory is sold direct to consumers through an elite mailing list. The reminder is sold through distributor channels to select fine dining establishments with limited availability of approximately 4,000 cases per year. Schrader Cellars typically sells for 225 to 250 per bottles to customers on its mailing list. Overall this world class luxury wine portfolio adds cache to our newly established Fine Wine sales organization. It also provides an opportunity for us to advance our Fine Wine strategy and more fully compete in one of today's fastest growing wine segments, while optimizing our Napa assets and grape supply. During the first quarter our wine business maintained its IRI market share position and delivered excellent margin enhancement driven by a combination of favorable mix and price as well as benefits from our recent acquisition and divestiture activities and our ongoing cost of goods sold optimization initiatives. We have also made good progress against our innovation and renovation activities. After the successful renovation of Robert Mondavi Private Selection, which is currently growing at 10% in IRI channels, we recently re-launched brands including Clos du Bois, Estancia and Wild Horse.  And from an innovation perspective, we launched the new seven moons, Red Blend wine brand as well as Cooper & Thief, which has now become the number three luxury Red Wine brand. Our acquired brands are also performing well with High West Whiskey, the Prisoner, and Charles Smith Wines posting recent IRI channel growth of 78%, 35% and more than 100% respectively. During the first quarter, our wine and spirits depletion trends were impacted by the timing of promotional programs. However, we have solid programming in place for our key focus brands in the coming months including the launch of our new TV advertising campaigns for Kim Crawford, Black Box and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. In addition, we are investing in a new digital campaign for the Meiomi brand which is the first ever national advertising program for Meiomi. Our spirits portfolio posted excellent sales growth of 14% in the quarter driven by High West SVEDKA and Paul Masson Brandy. Overall our wine and spirits business is on track to meet our goals for the year. In closing, I am very pleased with our first quarter results which have set the stage for this coming fiscal year. We’ve delivered exceptional performance across the business that demonstrates our commitment through sustaining profitable growth and building shareholder value. And we remain one of the best performing companies among our consumer peers. With that I'd now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our financial results for our first quarter fiscal 2018. Thank you.
David Klein: Thanks Rob and good morning, everyone. Fiscal ‘18 is off to a great start, our Q1 results demonstrated strong financial performance as we generated 7% organic net sales growth, expanded our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by 530 basis points and increased comparable basis EBIT by 22%. These results include particularly strong operational performance by our beer business, which is driving an increase in our full year comparable basis diluted EPS goal to a range of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. I'll discuss the drivers of this in a moment, but first let's look at Q1 performance and our full year outlook in more detail where I’ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. For beer, net sales increased 8% on volume growth of 7%. Depletion growth came in strong at 11.6% with excellent performance during the key Cinco and Memorial Day holidays. Shipment growth was below depletion growth primarily due to shipment timing. For Q2 fiscal ‘18 we expect shipment in depletion growth rates to be similar and as a reminder we are facing a difficult 14% depletion growth comparison for Q2 fiscal ‘17. For fiscal ‘18 we continue to expect net sales growth for the year to be in the 9% to 11% range this includes 1% to 2% of pricing targeted for our Mexican portfolio. Beer operating margin increased 470 basis points to 40.3%. This strong result exceeded our expectation and reflects lower COGS, foreign currency benefits and favorable pricing. The lower COGS reflect operational benefits, driven primarily by supply independence from ABI including better than planned performance at Obregon, lower materials including benefits from glass supply sourcing and lower freight costs. These benefits were partially offset by a $14 million increase in depreciation expense, which totaled $40 million for Q1. Given the strong operational performance we now expect beer operating income growth to be in the range of 13% to 15%. The expected moderation in beer operating income growth and margin for the remainder of the year versus Q1 is being primarily driven by the continued ramp up in depreciation, planned headcount addition to support our expanding operating platform, anticipated unfavorable foreign currency impact due to tougher peso comparisons in the back half of the year and lower benefits related to ABI supply agreement independence as the year progresses. For wine and spirits organic net sales increased 6%, this primarily reflects favorable mix in price as well as volume growth. U.S. depletions were down 1% and shipment volume outpaced depletions during the quarter due primarily to timing as we expect shipment and depletions to generally align for the full year. As Rob mentioned we have solid promotional and marketing program in place for key brands for the remainder of the year as part of our efforts to achieve our full year goals for the wine and spirits business. Wine and spirits operating margin increased 640 basis points for 29.7%. This improvement primarily reflects favorable mix in price with pricing benefiting from lower promotion spending due to timing, divestiture of the lower margin Canadian wine business and acquisition benefits. For the remainder of the year we expect to see moderation in our wine and spirits operating margin versus Q1, due primarily to higher promotion spending in support of the programming activities I just mentioned. For fiscal ‘18, we continue to expect wine and spirits reported net sales to decrease in the range of 4% to 6% and operating income to be flat. These projections include the negative impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture and the estimated incremental benefits from High West, Charles Smith and The Prisoner acquisitions. When excluding the impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture from our fiscal ‘17 wine and spirits results we continue to expect net sales growth of 4% to 6% and operating income growth of 5% to 7%. Interest expense for the year decreased 3% as the benefit of lower average interest rates was partially offset by higher average debt balances. We continue to expect fiscal year ‘18 interest expense to be in the range of $340 million to $350 million. When factoring in cash on hand our net debt at the end of May totaled $9 billion. This was level with our net debt balance at the end of fiscal ‘17. In early May we announced that we issued $1.5 billion of senior notes at attractive investment grade interest rates. These notes were comprised of three $500 million tranches with 5, 10 and 30 year terms and interest rates of 2.7%, 3.5% and 4.5% respectively. Proceeds from the offering were used to repay $700 million of 7.25% notes that were coming due in May and together with revolver borrowings we repaid the remaining balance of our U.S. Term A loan. Our net debt-to-comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio moved down to 3.5 times at the end of May from 3.7 times at the end of fiscal 2017. While we continue to invest in our Mexican operation and return cash to shareholders with $100 million of dividends paid in the first quarter. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 19.4% versus 31.6% last year. This improvement reflects the benefit of reinvesting foreign current under APB 23 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 which requires excess tax benefits from stock-based payment awards to be recognized in the income statement. As a reminder this benefit can fluctuate significantly depending on the timing and level of stock option exercises. As a result, we expect to see more volatility in our effective tax rate on an annual and quarterly basis. For fiscal 2018, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to approximate 22%. The full year effective tax rate is forecasted to be higher than the Q1 rate, primarily due to an anticipate decrease in quarterly stock-based award activity throughout the balance of the year. Historically Q1 has had the highest quarterly stock-based award activity.  For Q2 we are targeting the effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, I’d also like to note for fiscal ‘18 we expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate $201 million and net income attributable to non-controlling interest to approximate $10 million.  As mentioned earlier, we are now projecting our full year comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $7.90 to $8.10. The midpoint of this guidance has is targeting 18% growth. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. This includes an $87 million non-cash impairment charge recorded during Q1 related to the Ballast Point trademarks. As Rob discussed earlier, we are optimistic about Ballast Point and remained focused on achieving our targeted return on that acquisition.  Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated $165 million for the quarter. This was slightly below Q1 last year as double-digit operating cash flow growth was more than offset by an increase in CapEx. We continue to expect fiscal 2018 free cash flow to be in the range of $725 million to $825 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and CapEx of $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion, including approximately $1 billion of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion.  In closing, our Cellar [ph] portfolio, strong business fundamentals and commitment to generating top tier sales and profit growth will position us to deliver another strong year of financial performance and build shareholder value in fiscal 2018.  With that Rob and I are happy to take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. 
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning guys. So my one question is around M&A, given the expected inflection in free cash flow over the next few years, can you discuss if you think M&A will become an increasing focus going forward, which of the business segments you might be most interested in for M&A. The relative size of deals you’re generally looking at. And then financially just remind us for the key criteria?
Rob Sands: Yes, so I would say that our M&A strategy remains the same and I would refer you back to our capital allocation strategy in general, which continues to focus on keeping our debt levels sort of in that 3.5 range, returning moneys to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, dividends and dividend increases. And selective M&A mostly or I should say almost entirely of tuck-in type brands more of the Meiomi kind of nature. So, we just made one Schrader, which I mentioned. So we are going to continue pretty much along that path, we’ll look for brands across actually beer, wine and spirits that we think fills niches that we don't have, that we think are highly synergistic with the platforms that we have across those three segments. I would say really nothing at all has changed and I don't expect anything different than what we've been doing.
Dara Mohsenian: Great. Thanks, it's helpful.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Rob Sands: Hi, Vivien.
Vivien Azer : Hi, good morning. So, given how robust your trends are, it really stands in very sharp contrast to some of the softening that we're seeing kind of more broadly in the beer category for a number of your competitors? So, a two part question please. Number one, if you could kind of just give us your view of what's happening more broadly in beer? And then number two, given this evolution in the competitive dynamic, how does that inform your optimism around distribution gains? Because I would think given how strong your growth is, it should facilitate that conversation with retailers. Thanks.
Rob Sands: Sure. Now, we've said no two part question, but for your benefit I'll combine that into one answer, okay. First of all what -- because I think it is really one answer. Broadly what's going on in beer alright is you see beer as a generally flat to slightly down market. We believe that the whole beer market in general is fairly tied to the growth or lack thereof and LDAs, legal drinking age, people of 21, that’s flattish and therefore we see beer as flat. However, within beer there is a significant shift going on away from the domestic premiums, the Bud Light, the Coors Light, Miller Light towards the high-end and that's a pretty stark shift that's going on. The beneficiaries in the high-end are largely our portfolio and craft, which continues to be a fairly robust category and continues to grow. And then our business, which is about the same size as craft, the whole craft segment and of course our business remains the most robust portion of the wine business. So, you see the domestic premiums in decline and then you see our portfolio craft and some SMBs like Mike’s taking that all up. And as you’ve seen or read in our previous conferences, we’ve pretty much shown the actual analytics behind how we think that that's going to play out in the future with the domestic dropping quite a bit and our portfolio picking up a lot of that. And of course you see it in IRI where we picked up - Constellation constituted 60% of the growth in the beer market. So, what we've said is going to happen in the past is in fact happening. I think that fundamentally answers your question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.
Rob Sands: Hi, Nik.
Nik Modi : Hi, good morning everyone. So, on Corona Premier, it looks like these test markets are progressing fairly well. How much time do you guys need before you can make an assessment on a national launch? And then just housekeeping item, what were the shipments and depletions in beer ex-Ballast Point if you could give us that number?
David Klein: So on that Nik, the Ballast Point was about a 50 basis points drag on depletions for total beer.
Nik Modi : Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong… 
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Is the national rollout of premier… 
Rob Sands: Yes, so I didn’t answer the national rollout for Corona Premier and Familiar, both I would say are actually exceeding our expectations in test market. We haven’t made a decision on an actual date for national rollout, but I would expect that decision to come fairly soon and I would say that it's likely to be a favorable decision on national rollout. So, that's about as much as we can say at the moment but…
Operator: Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Rob Sands: Hi, Judy.
Judy Hong : Thank you. Hi, so I guess I have to ask a beer margin question. So clearly 40% pretty impressive here. David just I think your comment about this may not be sustainable for the balance of the year, so just trying to get a little bit more color around that. DNA and pricing I think is essentially a wash, the peso I guess is becoming a little bit of a headwind, but when you talk about the headcount increase that’s potentially a headwind, can you just elaborate on - sort of quantify what that means? Can you compare the brewery margins for Piedras and Obregon and other kind of headwinds you’re envisioning for the balance of the year?
David Klein : Yes, so the first thing I want to say is that the operations teams at Nava and at Obregon performed exceptionally well in the first quarter while the plants were operating at high utilization levels. And I would say that a portion of our rational really for increasing our EBIT growth rate for beer was really we have been pleased by the lack of transition friction at Obregon that we have perhaps expected going into the year. So now for the remainder of the year I would -- Judy I think the biggest headwind that we see is really coming from FX in the business. In Q1 on a year-over-year basis in Q1 we actually had a bit of tailwind from FX. But we know that right now the peso is sitting below 18 pesos to the dollar. And we disclosed in the beginning of the year that our guidance was based around 20 pesos to the dollar that presents a pretty significant headwind for us.  Beyond that we also mentioned depreciation that’s quantifiable right, because we have already said that our depreciation is expected to up about $60 million on the year. And then we have as we get -- as we move through the year we’re bringing in more -- as we bring more equipment online we are bringing in about 300 additional heads, which will put a bit of a drag on our business. At the same time the utilization starts to fall up in the plants, right, because remember we run them at high utilization throughout Q1 and Q2 and then it drops off a little bit at the back half for the year. And then I know I say this every single time we talk about margins, but you just have to continue expect volatility in our margins as we try to optimize the lines and brew [trends] [ph] that we bring into service over the course of the year.  So, we are really happy to have achieved 40% operating margins in Q1 and I guess I will say Judy you kind of called that before anybody else, but we do have to be careful because there are some significant and real headwinds for the rest of the year.
Judy Hong : Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: Hi, thank you. Just going back to the point about the cadence of beer during the quarter and there has been obviously a lot of volatility especially from your competitors and your shipments have been lower than depletions, which obviously is a nature of the business itself. But can you comment on the cadence throughout the quarter and if you are seeing acceleration of the shipment as you’re going through your second quarter? Thank you.
David Klein: Yes, I think Andrea the real disconnect in Q1 really was because of the strength of our depletions coming out of Cinco and then going into the Memorial Day Holiday and it’s just the timing issue in terms of getting our shipments to align. Not necessarily on a growth rate basis but on a case rate basis we expect shipments and depletions in beer to align over the course of the year there’ll just be fluctuations between the quarters.
Andrea Teixeira: And a one last follow-up question, sorry, because it was about like the previous question on the FX. From what I understand you're hedged -- from your K, you’re hedging about 50% of your exposure, correct to the peso at the [indiscernible] level and the rest is actually floating.
David Klein: Well so about half of our currency exposure for the remainder of the year is hedged, it’s hedged at a very -- at various different levels, but it’s in included the hedges that we have is included in our outlook. We value the contracts at the same time we are valuing the remaining exposures.
Andrea Teixeira: And you also including that effect on your financial expenses, right. Your outlook for your financial expenses includes the cost of the hedges and the resets of the hedges, correct?
David Klein: Yes correct, correct.
Andrea Teixeira: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much, appreciate. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of UBS.
Stephen Powers: Great thanks. A question on Pacifico and the plans there, just given what you’re seeing from the broader market competitively both old and new competitors and I think the most obvious new catalysts is still moving into most in course hands. Does that change at all how you’re thinking about the timing and or approach to the ramp up of Pacifico overtime?
Rob Sands: No, not at all. There’s always a few Mexican brands that are being introduced by various parties whether it’s Molson Coors or ABI, I mean, that’s not going to change. And what I’ve emphasized about that is that the large part of the growth in the beer business is in our portfolio a lot of people talked about it as it imports or in Mexican while it’s really Constellation’s imports in Mexican portfolio. So these other entrants don’t really concern us very much. And sales been around forever and might sell I don’t know a 200,000 cases in the entire United States. So I don’t see this particularly important. Now Pacifico you asked about that, Pacifico is just also on fire, without are frankly doing too much to drive it and we’re ramping up on our plants to drive Pacifico and we sort of see this perhaps the next big thing right behind Modelo Especial, I mean, we have a lot of sort of anecdotal evidence as far as some market research that indicates the consumer acceptance of the product is wildly overwhelming. Historically we didn’t drive it because we didn’t have the capacity to do anything more than what we’re doing we now have the capacity it’s coming on stream and Pacifico is definitely the next logical thing that really drive behind Corona and Modelo Especial. So we’re I’d say extremely optimistic about that. In addition to our NPD, Premier I think has a huge amount of promise and Familiar is like a phenomena already. So we’re excited about all three things.
Stephen Powers: Perfect, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg: Yes, thanks. My one question wine and spirits margins it’s only one quarter, but they’re dramatically above the way we all on this tree modeled it and yet you haven’t changed your full year margin view. My question is obviously we could have just gotten the modeling wrong, but to what extent did you consider the first quarter disappointing from a revenue perspective and what else has prompted you not to increase the margin guide for that portion of your business?
David Klein: Well so first Mark the thing that I think is becoming or should be becoming more and more obvious is that while there is a lot of focus on the beer business our wine and spirits business is a very powerful business with margins that are approaching 30 and we’ve stated publicly that our goal is to get them to 30. So what’s tempering our expectations for the remainder of the year are really two things, one is we got about 200 basis points of year-over-year improvement in wine margins as a result of the sale of the Canadian business.  For the full year that 200 basis points is more like 100 right because we sold the wine business before the end of last -- well before the end of last fiscal year. So there’s 100 basis points of that benefit that goes away over the course of the remainder of the year. And the second thing is you might recall that our promotions expense is accrued based upon depletions not shipments. So we got some benefit in the quarter because of the difference between our shipments number and our depletions number. So we’re very optimistic about wine margins and our guidance for the year assumes that there is wine margin leverage. And so we remained committed to that, we’re just remaining cautious because of the two items I mentioned. 
Mark Swartzberg: And would it be fair to say that because depletions were down, they were disappointing versus your plan?
David Klein: I would say that we’re on track to achieve our guidance for the year. As Rob called out in his script, we had some planned promotion timing differences that affected our depletions in the first quarter, now clearly we never want negative depletions, but we remained confident in our full year guidance.
Mark Swartzberg: Great, thanks David. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Pablo Zuanic of SIG.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, it’s actually Yatish [ph] in for Pablo. Just one question, in regards to your typical retail store, would you able to comment on average, how many skews you would have for Corona versus Modelo Especial, is it like one-to-one, three-to-one, any kind of rough idea would be helpful. Thanks.
Rob Sands: In the company we have very few skews is a general preposition, but I don’t know the answer exactly to your question, how many skews of Corona do we have versus Modelo Especial, we will get back to you on that. Patty will give you.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay great. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research.
Tim Ramey: Thanks so much. So, as I recall these are the best ever margins in wine and beer and as spectacular as they are, it really the biggest news I think in the quarter is the ability to issue this debt at amazing rates, which gives you a tremendous amount of optionality in the M&A market. Rob you kind of soft pedal debt saying it’s incremental, it’s tuck-ins but there was a rumor of a very large deal this quarter and it seems like with your current balance sheet, you may be really well positioned to do a major deal. Can you talk about not anything specific, but the optionality of significant deal?
Rob Sands: Yes, I mean I think that it remains fundamentally as I said, which is I think the real opportunity is brands and tuck-in deals and that’s something that we can keep doing and do it and meet our financial disciplines which is important part of that, I mean, we buy brands like Meiomi or other brands we can tuck it into our existing infrastructure. These things are growing very high double-digits and we are buying them at reasonable multiples, which post synergies are multiples that generate actually a high return. So I’d say fundamentally that strategy versus buying something really big is a good strategy from a financial perspective and from the perspective of positioning our portfolios across wine, beer and spirits for continued growth, which -- growth and margins, which is -- that’s really the strategy, right. Is to keep driving this kind of growth and these kind of margins and the kind of leverage that we’re seeing in our P&L by at least as it relates to M&A now there is other elements of it like NPD, things like term premier and familiar, but as it relates to the M&A we can keep sort of adding on a very financially viable basis these kind of brands. Now, as far as anything big goes, there is two issues there, one is there is nothing for sale and two, there is very little that would be of any interest even if it was for sell fundamentally for three reasons, right. There is financial element of it will it generate kind of return that we wanted to generate, And then number two, we go back to sales, growth and margins there is very few big things that when potentially be somewhat dilutive to our sales growth and to our margins. So we would tread pretty carefully on anything like that. So yes in the end we’re talking about big things you can count it on a half a hand right, there not much in the business.
David Klein: I would also add to that Rob that…
Rob Sands: And you can exclude ABI.
David Klein: And I would add to that…
Rob Sands: They don’t have the growth either, but they do have the margin.
David Klein: Last year we bought $1.2 billion of our own stock back at $151 a share. So we still think we’re the best buy in alcohol.
Rob Sands: Yes that’s looking pretty good right now that investment.
Tim Ramey: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore. 
Robert Ottenstein: First off just congratulations on a terrific quarter. If you give a little bit of clarity there’s just a question that I have around guidance in a comment that you made Rob earlier on if I got it right and that is despite raising the EPS guidance it looks like you’re keeping your cash flow guidance flat. There was also comment that you said early on that the progress you’re making I think you said at Obregon and some of the other facilities was allowing you to moderate the rollout or the expenditures in Mexicali if I got that right. So I'm just trying to put those items together to think through what your cash flow guidance means here.
Rob Sands: Yes so I’ll let David answer a part of this question, but my comment about Obregon and Mexicali was just really more of the same in other words the guidance that we’ve given thus far on our CapEx as it relates to Mexicali and Obregon hasn’t changed.  And we basically told you about that when we acquired Obregon we basically said that we were going to cut Mexicali the initial first stage of it back to $5 million hectoliters because we didn’t need to go to full $10 million hectoliters on Mexicali given that we bought almost that amount in Obregon and we’ll have that amount as we make some small modifications to Obregon. So there’s really no difference put it this way between what we said previously at the end of the year and what we’re saying now we’re just in essence repeating ourselves. And then as to your point on EPS and cash flow I’ll let David talk about that.
David Klein: Yes, so Robert I think on total cash flow guidance the largest lever as you’re pointing out is our capital expenditures. And I would just say that one quarter into the year it’s too early to call any changes there. But we clearly carefully manage our working capital and our CapEx spend to optimize those numbers.
Robert Ottenstein: Terrific, thank you very much, very helpful.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse.
Laurent Grandet: Good morning, everyone. So with approximately 75% of retail market share in Mexican beer, could you give us some comfort us to why you think retailers will give you more shelves, more market share? Not usually their typical mindset to put all the eggs in one basket usually now that there is a bit more competition coming in Mexican beer? Thank you.
Rob Sands: Yes I think it’s fairly simple and that is that our shelf space relative our market share greatly under indexes. I mean, I can’t even tell you what that number is, but we have a much smaller percentage of the shelf in the store than we have in the market share and the proposition is simple, okay. Increase our shelf space and you’ll sell more of our beer and it’s not just shelf space it’s cold box space as well versus giving that space to declining low margin product. So you get two choices, right, you can give the space to us and sell more of a high margin item or give the space to somebody else and watch your sales and velocity and your margins decline. So, as I go around and talk to retailers, they get that, okay. And I can tell you right now, retailers need to do a significant rethinking of their assortment in beer. Fundamentally their beer assortments make no sense anymore for them. On the assumption that their goal is to improve their sales and margin as a business, okay. It makes no sense; they have 20% of the store allocated to 5 billion craft that nobody has ever heard of. And then to have the vast majority of the rest of the store allocated to low margin declining brands and then a smaller amount of the store allocated to fast moving high margin, high end brands it just doesn’t make any sense. And so, I think you'll see a change in that and we're certainly driving as the high-end leader in beer. We hopefully will be driving that change because I think it’s a change that has to happen sooner or later and that's going to dictate probably as that change occurs, you’ll actually see these trends in beer they’ll actually accelerate, which is part of the reason why it doesn’t occur. Because those who are hanging on are trying desperately to hang on to everything that they've got to mitigate precisely that scenario. And for us it's just a gigantic opportunity because we're punching under our weight. So we have the opportunity to not only generate the kind of performance that we've been generating, but enhance that performance if we could start -- if we could get retailers to understand and act, they understand it, it’s getting them to act on it. So -- and we're having some success in that regard and we expect to have more success in the future. And I think you'll see retailers start rethinking their assortment in beer to take advantage of the high-end and Constellation opportunity in particular.
Laurent Grandet: Thank you very much, Rob.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
Stephanie Spinner: Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Stephanie on for Bill. I’m just trying to get an understanding on the wine business organic growth. So obviously you are entering your first and second year after your Prisoner and Meiomi acquisitions. So, how much of the growth in the quarter is coming from distribution gains and should we start to see some tougher comps in the remainder of the year? Or I guess kind of put in other way is the growth coming from distribution gains kind of compared to the overall growth of the market? So just more color there would be helpful. Thanks.
Rob Sands: Yes, I would say fundamentally organic growth it's hard -- that's an interesting number that's hard to get at. But I think that you can fundamentally look at IRI as the best measure of our organic growth, which I think that the markets growing sort of low single-digit right now call it in that 3% type range with 200 basis points of price mix and we expect to grow in line with that organically and fundamentally with some quarter-to-quarter type fluctuations. But I think we feel fairly confident that that's what the years going to end up looking like in general. And our ships and our depletes will equal each other by year-end. And as I said, I think that you will see sort of a conversions between ships, depletes and IRI in our wine business. That sort of how things are shaping up, which is good. I mean, I think a strong performance, especially given the profitability of that business and the fact that we can then leverage we think that we’ll be able to leverage that as we’ve guided to generate higher even higher bottom-line return. So it’s very, very strong business in many respects. I always like to say that it’s only in contrast to the beer business that these questions even get raised, I mean, as a standalone business generating 30% margins sort of almost mid-single-digit sales growth, leveraging the P&L, if you weren’t looking at it in contrast to our beer business you would be running around saying, this is one of the best businesses that there is. So, even looking at ROIC, which nobody even talks about anymore, I don’t know why, but our ROIC in wine is up in the double-digits. And then if you look at the accretion of ROIC it’s like high-teens low 20s, 20% return on invested capital for any incremental growth that we have in our wine business. So by almost any standard that you can imagine it’s a tremendous business, nothing looks like it expect for other alcoholic beverage companies and too many of them in tobacco. I mean, that’s about it and tobacco to tobacco. Then it’s all downhill from there. So it’s at the pinnacle of performance pretty much, other than our beer business and a couple of other perhaps.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie. 
Caroline Levy : Good morning everyone and congrats. Just digging into your core portfolio, could you tell us how Corona performed as well as Corona Light just to get a sense of your flagship brand -- sorry Modelo Especial and Corona Light? And then just as a major of success for Premier are you looking at it in terms of how much share it takes or whether it impacts Ultra or how are you thinking about things when you said doing well?
David Klein: Yes so, so actually Rob in his script talked about say Modelo Especial approaching 20% depletion growth. Corona Extra was in that 6% range and Corona Light was a little bit less than that. So all of the brands are performing quite well, and Rob maybe you want to take the Premier question. 
Rob Sands: Yes, I think that Premier looks very strong. We are looking at things like velocities per point of distribution, which appear to be very strong. Cannibalization is not something we’re overly concern with because there is really no margins disadvantage. And so as long as one plus one equals three, we are okay with that, now we don’t want cannibalization of something that’s good with something that’s not going to be sustainable. So the big key is just making sure that we believe that from a consumer acceptance point of view that Premier represents a sustainable and growing preposition, which right now I would say our preliminary read on that is that it’s looking pretty good in terms of the contributions that it can make, its sustainability, it's positioning in the marketplace. I mean, well needless to say what are the hardest brands in beer, right of any size. The hardest brands in beer they size are basically Corona, Modelo Especial and Mic Ultra, okay. Premier is a more upscale, more premium competitor to Mic Ultra with the power and this is probably a very important point, right. Because anybody can make a beer with that the calorie and the carb characteristics of Mic Ultra. But with the power of an elite brand behind it with all of the consumer acceptance and recognition that goes with it. So it’s definitely a segment of the market that I think is hot, it’s here to stay, it’s what been driving Mic Ultra, I think it’s going to drive Corona Premier as well, because it's got the characteristic. The liquid in the bottle is great, obviously we test all that and we test it against competitors and we test it with consumers who drink that kind of beer, okay. And we have extremely positive results on that. So, I think it’s looking very good and it’s a point to remember that, right. It’s consumers, the Premier is started the consumers who drink that kind of beer and are looking for precisely that profile of product. So if are a IITA drinker yes, of course you are not drinking Mic Ultra and you’re not going to drink Premier. On the other hand, if you are Mic Ultra drinker I think Premier makes a -- is a nice alternative to that in every respect.
Operator: Thank you, I will now return the call to Rob Sands, for any additional or closing remarks.
Rob Sands: So, thank you very much everybody for joining today’s call. I want to reiterate how very pleased we are with the fantastic execution that drove our excellent first quarter results, and my kudos to our people, our distributors, our retailers who continue to be part of the virtual cycle that drive those results. We are very optimistic about our future business opportunities which gives us the confidence to raise our full year EPS guidance. And as we head into the July 4th holiday weekend, I hope you remember to drink some of our fine wine products, as well as beer products and spirits products to your celebrations and to please enjoy them responsibly. So thank you and everyone should have a great 4th of July weekend.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the Constellation Brands first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we continue our practice of limiting each person to two questions during the Q&A session, which will help to end our call on schedule. Thanks, in advance and now, here is Rob.
Rob Sands: Thanks, Patty, and good morning, and welcome to our yearend call. Fiscal 2017 was a very dynamic and rewarding year marked by milestones that produced impressive double-digit growth in sales, EBIT, and operating cash flow. Our path for these impressive results was paved by great execution in growing our core business supported by investments to enhance our portfolio and our operations. I believe it's worth reviewing our achievements as they collectively illustrate our commitment to sustaining profitable growth and building shareholder value. I'll follow that up with a review of our business performance along with some of the great initiatives we have underway for fiscal 2018. We made a series of value-creating portfolio moves that aligned with our premiumization strategy and enabled us to capitalize on U.S. market trends that favor high-end wine and spirits brands. This included our acquisitions of The Prisoner and Charles Smith wine brands as well as High West Distillery, which paved our entrance into the high-end craft whiskey category. Each of these additions boast award-winning products, premium positioning and exceptional, exceptional growth. In fact, these newly acquired brands grew depletions 47%, 67%, and 34% respectively during our fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the recent sale of our Canadian wine business supports our strategy to focus on higher growth, higher margin business initiatives, and to strengthen the financial profile of our overall wine and spirits business. Even after the sale of this business, Canada remains our largest export market as we have had excellent success selling some of our focused brands in the Canadian market, including Kim Crawford, Ruffino, and Robert Mondavi. Now these activities were complemented by constellation ventures investments to further explore innovation in brown spirits. They include Catoctin Creek Distilling Company, a producer of premium rye whiskey and gin from organic sources. Bardstown Bourbon, the largest new whiskey distillery in the U.S. and Nelson's Greenbrier distillery, a producer of craft whiskeys. From an operational perspective, we made strategic investments in our beer business to ensure we have the capacity, quality, control, and flexibility to support the exceptional industry-leading growth of our beer business and to meet expected consumer demand for our products well into the future. We recently acquired ABI's brewing operation in Obregon Mexico, which provides an immediate source of supply and functioning brewery capacity for our iconic portfolio of Mexican import brands as well as flexibility for future innovation initiatives. During the fourth quarter, we completed the next phase of expansion at our Nava Brewery in Mexico to reach 25 million hectoliters of capacity ahead of schedule. And earlier this year, we fired up furnace number two at our nearby glass plant which is now producing quality glass at optimal capacity levels. Throughout fiscal 2017, particularly later in the year, we repurchased more than $1 billion worth of outstanding shares during periods when our stock traded at prices that we determined to be good value, and we achieved investment grade debt status for the first time in the company's history. So, to recap, the record operating cash flow that we generated in fiscal 2017 provided significant capital allocation flexibility that enabled a sizable dividend increase, significant share repurchases, value-creating acquisitions, and investments to support the outstanding growth momentum of our business. So, let's move now to a discussion of the excellent business performance our team achieved in fiscal 2017 and some of the initiatives we have underway for the coming year. Our beer business continues to be a powerhouse for growth as the number one brewer and seller of imported beer in the U.S. market. For the fourth consecutive year in fiscal 2017, Constellation is the number one, the number one growth contributor in the U.S. beer category, outperforming key competitors and all other imports, and Constellation was the leader and number one share gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market in calendar 2016 with our beer business driving almost 100% of import volume growth. Now as we look back at the past year's accomplishments and ahead to fiscal 2018, let's begin our discussion with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. Our flagship Corona Extra brand has been gaining share and is one of just three brands driving the majority of the growth in the high-end of the U.S. beer market. In fiscal 2017, this brand grew depletions about 5% versus the prior year and also achieved status on Interbrand’s Top 100 best global brands list. In fiscal 2018, for the fifth consecutive year, we're planning double-digit increases in our Corona media investments and this has been a key growth driver of the brand with particular focus on live sports, including the NBA, year-round soccer, boxing, and the NFL, which deliver the highest reach against our target consumers. Some of the several major initiatives in place to continue driving Corona Extra's growth, we recently introduced three-pack 24 ounce cans in California and are expanding to additional markets, and we plan to regionally expand Corona Extra draft beyond where it is available today. Corona Extra cans continue to represent a big growth opportunity. So, upcoming plans this year include increased media investments and a new TV advertisement, highlighting a limited edition can. We also expanded our social media support and partnerships to focus on the can format, the on-premise channel and providing enhanced retail tools. Many of these activities are expected to be in full swing as we launch our 120 days of summer campaign beginning with Cinco de Mayo. We recently launched Corona Premier in key test markets, and while it is still too early to call, we are very pleased with the results to date in these markets. We are also in test markets with Corona Familiar 12 ounce bottles. Corona Familiar quarts are already one of the largest packages in the Corona franchise, and so far we are pleased with the early results in the market test. Moving to Casa Modelo. This trio of brands which includes Modelo Especial, Modelo Negra and Modelo Especial Chelada, is one of the biggest forces in beer, delivering more than 14 million cases of growth to the U.S. beer category in calendar 2016. Modelo Especial which is the Casa Modelo flagship brand has achieved double-digit growth for nearly 25 years and has been one of the largest contributors to US beer category growth over the last five years. Ranked number seven nationally in dollars, Modelo Especial is now a top five beer in eight major U.S. markets and the number one, the number one beer in Los Angeles. Last year this brand grew depletions more than 18% to almost 85 million cases. In fiscal 2018, our biggest opportunity for Modelo Especial lies in expanding distribution and enhancing our innovation pipeline and we plan to continue to advertise across the entire Modelo family, including New TV and digital advertising. We also see tremendous opportunity in the on-premise channel, where Modelo Especial grew almost 25% across draft, bottle and can offerings last year. The draft format alone increased more than 45% making it the fastest growing U.S. draft beer brand and the number one shared on-premise channel in 2016. In fact, in recent syndicated on-premise data, Modelo Especial became the largest volume Mexican draft beer in the entire country. Modelo Especial will have a full lineup of retail programs and consumer promotions delivering execution from Cinco de Mayo to the Christmas holiday in fiscal 2018. Modelo Especial recently became the official and exclusive import beer of the Chicago White Sox. This new marketing partnership offers brand exposure across the White Sox as expansive, marketing assets, digital platforms, arena signage and an all new bar connected with the stadium. In Calendar 2016, Modelo Especial Chelada contributed 95% of Chelada category growth in the U.S. beer market. To capitalize on this trend, Chelada Tamarindo Picante was recently launched becoming the second Chelada flavor to join the Casa Modelo portfolio. In addition, we are launching Chelada three packs to expand our single-serve distribution as well as Modelo Especial 18 packs to allow loyal customers to trade up to larger packages size and hit future price points at retail focused on basket building with larger pack sizes. Now as you're aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our biggest brands, we believe Pacifico has the potential to be the next big national brand in our beer business. In Calendar 2016, this brand sold five million cases in the State of California alone, not only is Pacifico growing double-digits in California, we have had excellent success with our recent expansion efforts in markets like Seattle and Denver with the addition of TV advertising. Pacifico draft velocities are also strong across the country. As a matter of fact, after eight consecutive years of consistent single-digit growth, Pacifico reached the eight million case mark and achieved depletion growth of almost 20% in fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2018, we are launching the Pacifico 12 ounce can to build on success of the 24-ounce SKU. We are doubling our advertising with two new TV spot in channels like ESPN, TNT and Comedy Central, while also investing in live sports including the NBA, MLB and NFL and let's not forget about Ballast Point, which was the number two-dollar growth contributor in the U.S. craft market this past year adding almost 11% of craft industry volume growth and posting double-digit depletion growth. Throughout the year, Ballast Point beers were awarded more than 40 medals including gold for Grapefruit Sculpin and California Ambers at the U.S. Open Beer Championship. They also won the 2016 Champion Large International Brewery Award for Brewing Excellence at the Australian International Beer Awards. In fiscal 2018, our plan is to continue to expand Ballast Point distribution. We have opportunities to drive continued growth through innovation with brands like Monterey, Monterey Double IPA, Red Velvet Nitro, Bonito Blonde Ale and Sea Rose Tart Cherry Wheat Ale just to name a few. As you would expect, I have assembled every one of these unique beers and I believe they are all winners. We are also planning to increase our Ballast Point sales and marketing investments while leveraging Constellation resources like National Accounts. These initiatives are expected to drive the double-digit growth we are targeting in fiscal 2018 for Ballast Point. We continue to build our East Coast brewery in Belleville Virginia and expect to be brewing there this fall. Overall I am excited about the growth prospects for our beer business for fiscal 2018 and as you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business to enhance distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio. As a result, we are targeting beer business net sales growth in the 9% to 11% range and operating income growth of 11% to 13%. Now before moving on wine and spirits, I would like to take a minute to discuss, published IRI and Nielsen Consumer Takeaway Data for our beer business, that corresponds with our fourth quarter results as there seems to be significant discussion related to these growth trends. First IRI channels represent about 50% of our overall beer business at retail and therefore provide only a partial picture of the brand and portfolio performance outside of the sales, shipment and depletion results we report each quarter. With IRI channels throughout the fourth quarter, we experienced significant variability from week to week, especially in the month of December, which was a challenging month for the entire U.S. beer industry. Much of this relates the year-over-year timing and selling day comparison issues for important holidays during the quarter, including Christmas and New Year. We also experienced poor weather versus the prior year in the month of February particularly in California which is our largest market. While consumer takeaway is a standard measurement, depletions represent our entire business and are an even more comprehensive indicator of growth. Given some of the factors I just mentioned, we continue to see an increase in brand relevance and key brands health metrics for our entire portfolio and we are on track to deliver the completion growth of 9% to 10% for the first calendar quarter of 2017. As I mentioned earlier our Nava brewery completed its next expansion phase ahead of schedule and became complete independent from ABI Interim Supply Agreement with the acquisition of the Obregon brewery. The Nava brewery is also ahead of schedule to deliver on the next phase of expansion, which takes the brewery 27.5 million hectoliters of capacity by calendar year end and we are getting ready to fire up furnace number three in the coming months at our adjacent Nava glass plant. The Obregon brewery continues to integrate systems and processes with the Constellation business and is performing at a very high utilization level. We are developing plans to increase our output from this site and are very pleased with the prospects that this brewery brings to our operational footprint and as mentioned last quarter, we have re-scoped our Mexicali project to initially built 5 million hectoliters of production capacity at a more measured pace as a result of the acquisition of the Obregon brewery. And now I would like to focus on our operational results for our wine and spirits business, which achieved strong earnings and margin growth for the year. During fiscal 2017, we executed a key strategic -- our key strategies related to premiumization, innovation and brand building. Overall our wine and spirits portfolio gained total channel volume share in Calendar 2016 while delivering exceptional results for our fast-growing higher margin focused brands, which grew depletions about 9% for the year. Many of these focused brands achieved significant milestones and accomplishments last year. Four of our brands were featured on wine.com's top 100 list for calendar 2016, including The Prisoner, Kim Crawford, which emerges the number one Sauvignon Blanc and IRI channels and Meiomi, which is achieved the one million case milestone. Our products also called out in the Beverage Information Group's Awards where four of our brand achieved fast track status recognizing their impressive growth. Three were named rising stars and seven were listed as established growth brands including Mark West, Ruffino, Simi and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. From an operational perspective, we improved productivity and created efficiencies through our cost of goods sold optimization initiatives and we continue to drive efficiencies throughout our wine and spirits manufacturing operations. For the year, our spirits portfolio posted excellent net sales growth of 9% driven by High West, Paul Masson and SVEDKA. And from a strategic perspective, in fiscal 2018, our goal for the wine and spirits business is to grow profits ahead of sales while improving margin, which is reflected in our fiscal 2018 wine and spirits guidance of 46% sales growth and profit growth in the 5% to 7% range for the year. So what will be the drivers of this goal? We plan to optimize our route to market by evolving our organizational structure to better align with the way we interact with our distributors and our retailers while further developing our account segmentation capabilities to ensure that we are targeting the right products and the right accounts during the right time of the year. Now these changes in our route to market structure provide additional focus on the higher margin, Fine Wine and Spirits part of our business. We remain committed to mix and margin accretive innovation and new product development and have several new products in the pipeline. This requires us to maintain the discipline we have established with our research and development efforts. It also includes continuing the renovation work we have begun with brands like Robert Mondavi Private Selection, which is a great turnaround story. Building on the success of this brand, we have also renovation plans for some of our other brands, including Clos du Bois, Estancia and Clos. We are excited about the innovation brands we recently launched and are planning to launch this coming year including Ravage, Cooper & Thief, Kelly collection, Clos du Bois Lightly Effervescent Chardonnay and Meiomi just to name a few. We plan to aggressively manage our core business and drive acceleration of key focused brands that have scale, growth, momentum and higher margins. This is going to require increased marketing investment to achieve this goal. For example, we are launching a new TV advertising campaign for Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, which is the largest wine brand in our portfolio and we are significantly increasing our digital investments. We also have plans to rationalize our portfolio of hotel brand and have already begun the process of discounting about 15% of our lower margin value brand SKUs in an effort to simplify our portfolio and drive focus on those brands that will drive higher profitability and higher returns and for the fourth consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases for selected products within the portfolio. Finally, we are committed to operational effectiveness with an increased focus on safety, service and quality while delivering new capabilities from our technology investments. This also includes an expansion of wine and spirits sourcing initiatives to optimize supply by achieving the right style, quality and margins structure across our brand portfolio and we plan to improve production efficiencies through ongoing footprint consolidation. In closing it has certainly been another exciting year at Constellation. We are very proud to have delivered another rewarding year of value to our shareholders and I am pleased that our results can support a significant dividend increase in the coming year. We've delivered exceptional performance and continued growth momentum and remain one of the best performing companies among our consumer peers. In fact, Constellation drove more dollars sales growth in the next three beverage alcohol companies combined and we constricted 25% of the overall U.S. total beverage alcohol industry growth in calendar 2016. That's why we believe that Constellation provides the best-in-class combination of sustainable topline growth and profitability in the consumer products space. I would like to thank our employees for their outstanding efforts this past year and our shareholders for their continued support. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein will review our financial results for fiscal 2017 and provide the outlook for fiscal 2018. Thank you.
David Klein: Thanks Rob. And good morning, everyone. Fiscal '17 was another exciting year as we continue to generate top-tier growth in the CPG space. Our businesses turned strong marketplace performance into strong financial performance as we generated over 7.3 billion of net sales and 12% net sales growth, expanded operating margins in both businesses and improved our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by 140 basis points, increased comparable basis EBIT and diluted EPS 18% and 24% respectively and produced $1.7 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of 20%. The strong earnings, operating cash flow growth and divestiture of the Canadian wine business helped our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio finish at 3.7 times, even as we made capital investments in our Mexican operations, purchased the Obregon brewery, acquired The Prisoner, Charles Smith and High West and returned cash to shareholders with $315 million of dividends paid and $1.1 billion in repurchases of stock. We expect fiscal '18 to be another year of strong financial performance as we're targeting healthy net sales, EBIT, comparable basis EPS and operating cash flow growth, while we continue to invest in our world-class Mexican beer operating platform and increase our dividend per share by approximately 30%. Let's look at fiscal '17 performance in more detail where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results starting with beer. Net sales grew 17%. Organic net sales increased 13% primarily due to volume growth of 11% and favorable pricing. Depletion growth for the year came in at 10.4%. These results were in-line with the enhanced beer guidance we provided at the second quarter. I would like to point out that previously reported beer shipment and depletions volume have been restated for a correction related to the conversion of 7-ounce Coronita cases to 12-ounce 24-pack case equivalents. This restatement had an immaterial impact on previously reported growth rates. We've added historical shipment and depletion information to our segment schedule located in the financial history section of our investor website. Beer operating margin increased 140 basis points to 36.3%. Benefits from pricing and foreign currency were partially offset by marketing investments and consolidation of the Ballast Point business. For wine and spirits, net sales increased 6%. This reflects a 4% increase in organic net sales driven by volume growth and favorable mix and an acquisition benefit from Meiomi and The Prisoner. Total U.S. depletions grew 3% for the year while our focus brand portfolio posted 9% depletion growth. Wine and spirits' operating margin increased 100 basis points to 25.8%. Benefits primarily from the addition of Meiomi and The Prisoner along with favorable mix were partially offset by investments in SG&A and marketing. Interest expense for the year increased 6% to $333 million as higher average borrowing rates were partially offset by lower average interest rates. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of February totaled $9.1 billion an increase of $1.1 billion since the end of fiscal '16. This activity primarily reflects the funding for The Prisoner, Charles Smith, High West and Obregon acquisitions as well as our stock repurchases, partially offset by proceeds from the divestiture of the Canadian wine business and our free cash flow generation. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.7 times at the end of fiscal '17 versus 3.8 times at the end of fiscal '16. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the year came in at 26.8% versus 29.6% last year. This reflects a benefit of the APB 23 Accounting on part of our current year foreign earnings. As a reminder, during Q3 fiscal '17, we determined that a portion of our foreign earnings would be indefinitely reinvested. This assertion allows the company to record income taxes on certain foreign earnings using the applicable foreign jurisdiction tax rates rather than the higher U.S. tax rate. Now let's review Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS came in at a $1.48 per share up 24%. Organic beer net sales increased 10% due to volume growth of 9% and favorable pricing. Beer operating margin increased 320 basis points to 38%. This increase was primarily driven by foreign currency as the benefits from pricing was essentially offset by higher depreciation. Wine and spirits' organic net sales increased 4% mostly due to volume growth. Wine and spirits' operating margin increased to 160 basis points to 26.6%. Benefits from the divestiture of the Canadian wine business and the acquisition of The Prisoner and Charles Smith were partially offset by investments in SG&A and marketing. Moving to Fiscal '17 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated $789 million compared to $522 million last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.7 billion up 20% primarily driven by our earnings growth and CapEx totaled $907 million, which was slightly above last year spent. Moving to our full year fiscal '18 P&L and free cash flow outlook, for fiscal '18 we expect to leverage our ongoing portfolio premiumization efforts and execute the marketplace initiatives, outlined by Rob, to deliver another year of strong financial performance as we are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $7.70 to $8 per share. The midpoint of this guidance has us targeting 16% growth. Our beer business is targeting net sales growth in the range of 9% to 11% and operating income growth in the range of 11% to 13%. Our projections include 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit from our Mexican portfolio. We're pleased that our beer operating margin finished fiscal '17 a little over 36%, which was a little above the high-end of our most recent guidance. The outperformance was primarily driven by FX favorability that I discussed earlier. Our fiscal '18 beer segment guidance had us targeting operating margin expansion for the year. In fiscal '18, we expect to see positive growth margin benefits from product pricing, ongoing favorability from foreign currency, glass sourcing initiatives and supply independence from ABI. These benefits will be partially offset by our ramp up in depreciation as we continue to bring assets online and optimize new capacity. Looking closer at depreciation and amortization expense for the beer segment, it totaled $115 million in fiscal '17. We expect that to increase by approximately 50% in fiscal '18. We also fiscal '18 SG&A and marketing spend rate as a percentage of sales to be similar to fiscal '17. For the wine and spirits business for fiscal '18, we expect reported net sales to decrease in the range of 46% and operating income to be flat. These projections include the estimated negative impact of the divestiture of the Canadian wine business and the estimated incremental benefits from the High West, Charles Smith and The Prisoner acquisitions. As outlined in our press release, for fiscal '17 through the mid-December divestiture date, net sales and operating income that will no longer be part of our wine and spirits segment as a result of the sale of the Canadian wine business, totaled $311 million and $50 million respectively. When excluding these amounts from our fiscal '17 wine and spirits results, we expect net sales growth of 46% and operating income growth 5% to 7% as our premiumization activities continue to drive operating margin expansion. In addition, we expect our tax rate to approximate 22%. The decrease versus the fiscal '17 tax rate reflects additional anticipated foreign tax rate benefits through the APB 23 assertion on a larger portion of our foreign earnings and an anticipated benefit from a new accounting standard related to stock-based payment awards, which Constellation will adopt starting in fiscal '18. Let me spend a few minutes on this. In fiscal '17 in prior years, accounting standards required excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards to be recognized in equity and the cash benefit to be reflected in the financing section of the cash flow statement. The new standard now requires this benefit to be recognized as a reduction of tax expense in the income statement and presented in the operating section of the cash flow statement. Our tax rate guidance includes an estimated 3% benefit related to the adoption of this new standard. This benefit can fluctuate significantly depending on the timing and level of stock option exercises. As a result of this, we expect much more volatility in our effective tax rate on an annual and a quarterly basis. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $340 million to $350 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at $201 million. This does not assume additional share repurchases. I would also note that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. We expect fiscal '18 free cash flow to be in the range of $725 million to $825 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and CapEx in the range of $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion. This includes approximately $1 billion of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion. Fiscal '18 should represent the peak spending year for these activities. In closing, we believe we have the right strategies in place to capture the growth opportunities in beverage alcohol over the long-term. Our impressive fiscal '17 results and our business initiatives and financial goals for fiscal '18, demonstrate our focus on generating sustainable growth and top-tier financial performance in the CPG space as part of our efforts to increase shareholder value. And with that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey good morning, guys.
Rob Sands: Hey Dara.
Dara Mohsenian: So, Rob on the beer volume front, you continue to perform very well from a growth standpoint and obviously from a market share standpoint within the industry. It's not much of a change versus the larger brewers, but we have seen more recently a large slowdown in the craft segment and getting more fair share of merchandising and distribution has already been a focus for you guys in terms of your beer portfolio. So in light of those factors, I was just hoping you could review for us, the rated distribution expansion you're expecting in fiscal 2018? Should we expect an acceleration versus recent trend, and then secondly, also on the beer volume front now that you have more capacity in place, are there any big opportunities across your brand portfolio or on the innovation front that you're now pursuing more aggressively as a result of the capacity growth, thanks?
Rob Sands: So yeah, we are expecting to increase the pace of distribution growth across our beer portfolio. In fact, we expect roughly 70% of our growth in beer next year Dara to come from distribution growth. So, this is really the key variable in achieving our results and with the momentum behind our portfolio and the nature of our portfolio entirely on the high end and really being one of the most important profit drivers at wholesale and at retail, okay, we expect that we will achieve our distribution growth goals and therefore our overall growth goals. Now to your next question about production capacity and innovation, the answer to your question is 100% totally. We are well set up now to really drive, number one, parts of the business that we haven't been driving really because we were concerned while we were under the interim supply agreement and we didn't have necessarily the capacity in place to start driving business that we were uncertain that we could supply. So certainly in terms of existing brands, other brands in the portfolio like Pacifico where we're really starting to make a push to driving that to be one of the key growth providers in the portfolio is an example and then clearly our NPD in beer, which we’ve recently launched right, Corona Premier and the Corona Familiar product are examples of NPD that we weren’t in a position to do up until now, but now we are extremely well positioned with two big breweries Nava and Obregon fully on stream as well as a third brewery well underway. So, we're very optimistic about what both we can do now with yet another brand that we think is going to be a big growth driver of Pacifico and what we can do with NPD, and the business which appears to be very successful at least in test markets thus far.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay. That's helpful and then David on the beer margin side, the expansion of 60 basis points implied by the midpoint of the initial fiscal '18 guidance, it still seems conservative despite the depreciation increase when you consider the historical expansion and all the positive factors you mentioned like the glass savings pricing, topline leverage moving off ISI etcetera. So, it seems like those positive factors would overwhelm significantly the depreciation increase. So are there other prohibitive factors limiting the margin upside as you look to next year beyond the depreciation or are you just being conservative this early in the year.
David Klein: I think of our $2 billion of COGS and beer, there are just a lot of moving parts, things that swing your way things that move in the other direction. I want to just make clear that our guidance implies a peso rate of about 20 pesos to the dollar right, and we know that's running a little bit less than that. It's in the high 18s as we sit here today. So, you I think it's -- I think we're suggesting continued margin expansion, but I think we're just being prudent at this point in the year.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: Thank you. Good morning.
Rob Sands: Hi Judy.
Judy Hong: Hi. So, I guess just going back to the beer volume, certainly the Nielsen IRI could be very pretty volatile, but it looks like your depletion growth has also been pretty volatile in the last few months. Cagney had talked about 8% depletion for the fourth quarter. You came in at 6.2%, which implies obviously a pretty big slowdown in February and then March looks like it's got better. So just a little bit of color just in terms of what's going on, obviously, the broader industry has been pretty soft, but certainly the weather is having an impact, but any color just in terms of the cadence of your depletion growth and then what you've seen so far from a March perspective would be great.
Rob Sands: So yes, Judy, as it relates to our fourth quarter performance, I would say that February ended up a little softer than we had expected at the time, and I think there's a danger in watching the week-to-week or even month-to-month depletions. I think if you look at our overall trends in the business, we continue to gain share in the business at about the same rate as we have been over the last 12 to 24 months. Clearly total beverage alcohol has slowed down a little bit over the past 12 months, but that seems to be mirroring what's happening in the broader CPG category as well. So, we feel pretty confident to be sitting here in early April and putting out I think some pretty strong guidance for our fiscal '18. So, despite the volatility that we're seeing, we're pretty confident in our ability to deliver these numbers.
David Klein: And I guess I'll just add Judy that what's becoming I think obviously to everyone is that in the short term, sort of as a result of where holidays fall, the number of sell days in a particular month etcetera, there's a lot of fluctuation in the short-term that can affect short-term volume, whether you're talking depletions or otherwise. And I would encourage everybody to sort of focus on stacked results as opposed to focusing on these very short-term numbers, which there is a lot of volatility associated with those short-term numbers and you can see it in December numbers, which were across the industry not very good okay and is driving a lot of the slowdown. And in December basically what you had were holidays falling on weekend and instead of the middle of the week. So instead of people drinking twice during the week, they were only drinking once during the week on the weekend. Okay, this really affect things. In March okay and April, you're going to see a shift which by the way I think this will affect wine and spirits more than it will beer, you're going to see a shift of Easter into April this year, right, mid-April this year from March last year. So that's really going to affect the numbers that you're going to be looking at on a short-term basis and this is especially in wine and spirits because there tends to be more of a wine and spirits drinking holiday than a beer drinking holiday, but I think you have to look at those stack results now. In our case right, fourth quarter yet depletions in beer looked a little lackluster and then you look at first quarter of the calendar year and I would say everything basically bounced right back to be very consistent with the growth that we're expecting throughout the remainder of the year and we see nothing at all right now that would suggest to us that just on a general proposition whether it's across -- whether it's beer or wine or spirits, maybe talk about the industry as a whole, I think that we're fairly confident that you'll see things reverse to the mean as it relates to industry growth across TBA and I think on our own growth, we see nothing inhibiting us from achieving our guidance across the wine, beer and spirits portfolio, which I think will be very strong continued results.
Judy Hong: Okay. Got it. And then secondly, just on beer pricing outlook, so I think you're sticking to the 1% to 2% pricing for 2018. There is obviously been some pricing permission in the high end within Ultra. How do you think about your ability to get to that 1% to 2% pricing? Have you taken some of that pricing already in some of your markets and sort of your comfort level on that front?
Rob Sands: Sort of a same story. We see no innovation or issues in achieving our pricing guidance. You point out every quarter and basically every year we're talking about some skirmish that has occurred especially in beer the constitutes some tea leaf reading, right. So whether it's low prices on Mic Ultra, somewhere for some reason or whether last year it was the giving away of goose CAGS in the Northwest, there is countless -- there is countless examples of this stuff all the time, but fundamentally speaking we don't see pricing in the beer market portending anything other than that guidance that we had given and what we expect which is 1% to 2% pricing, which really will take very strategically market by market, brand by brand and again we're confident that we'll achieve that goal.
David Klein: And Judy you know that pricing in beer for the most part is taken in the fourth calendar quarter of the year right. So, the pricing that -- the preponderance of the pricing that we're counting on to achieve our guidance is already in the market. 
Judy Hong: Yes. Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital.
Nik Modi: Yes. Good morning, everyone. A couple collections, just first David on the guidance on the peso, is that inclusive of hedges, just wanted to clear that up? And then the broader question is so certainly CPD volumes across all industries have slowed lately and I'm just curious you guys are in kind of a unique position because you're gaining so much market share, but I am just curious on your overall take on what you see with the consumer. I understand the timing of calendar and holidays and things like that, but it looks like something else is going on, I would be curious to your thoughts.
David Klein: So, Nik, I'll take the peso question and then Rob can respond on the market, so we're just saying that we're targeting in our guidance around the 20 pesos to the dollar. That includes our hedge program that's already in place and I would say that we're probably about 50% hedged on the peso.
Nik Modi: Got it.
Rob Sands: So, Nik, on the consumer side, I think that we definitely saw some softening in consumer confidence in the fourth quarter and efforts of that are highly speculative, but I would say it's certainly around a lot of the political uncertainty and what has transpired across a lot of areas in that regard. On the other hand, as we move now past the first quarter right, we're seeing some signs of increased consumer confidence, the jobs number, which came out very recently was higher than expected and by the way, we track things like the correlation of various statistics like job growth, like GDP against our beer performance over long periods and I think a good example of that job growth tends to be a positive for our business and is GDP by the way tend to be a positive for our business. So, as we see some of these things improve, I think that you're going to see consumer confidence improve, but you only have to sit around and watch the news to understand that there will continue to be a lot of political uncertainty for the next I guess nobody can, the next is uncertain. The next period of time. Or I think you can say that we are totally uncertain about how long there will be political uncertainty.
Nik Modi: Fair enough. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: Hi. Good morning.
Rob Sands: Hey Vivien.
David Klein: Hi Vivien.
Vivien Azer: So, Rob, I really appreciate your commentary on a bunch of the transitory factors that are impacting both your results and Nielson as well as the more constructive commentary on some of the March data. As we kind of look back on fiscal 4Q, is there any way to quantify any of that just opposing California where the weather was really bad relative to your national trends. Anything to help us understand the magnitude of some of that option.
Rob Sands: It's all about December right. December was a weird month. If December had been normal, the results would have been normal. That's basically the quantification of everything. So yeah, I told you and I'm sure you're already aware about the holidays and how they fell in December versus the previous year. You brought up the weather, I didn't. I don't like to talk about the weather because the one thing that we know for sure is that there's always going to be weather okay and we're in the very fortunate position of not having necessarily to reverse to the weather okay as our excuse for everything. So really, I think it falls back to December and you could basically normalize December and you would've ended up with normalized results. As things have thus proved themselves to be the case, following December and looking at the first calendar quarters. And then the December thing was across wine beer and spirits. So, I think as it related to our portfolio in particular we've given our guidance and we're confident on our guidance for the year of 2018. So, I think that that's really where the proof is right. It's in the guidance and looking at the first calendar quarter on beer. And the IRI to some degree as well which has only constituted 50% of the business, but it remains a fairly decent indicator and IRI looks good.
Vivien Azer: Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic of SIG.
Rob Sands: Hi Pablo.
Pablo Zuanic: Hi. Look just two big question, one, can I just only drill a little bit deeper on the state of the consumer, particularly your Hispanic consumer, you say that that represents about 40% of U.S. sales. Just give us any color you have there.  Obviously, you have better pulse of the consumer and most bigger companies giving your exposure there, that would be helpful. I understand you're touching the political situation, but just expand on that. And the second question in terms of your relationship, if I just briefly on the relationship with the wholesalers, obviously, distributers they are the gold network, must be very happy with your performance right, you're driving the industry growth, you made good profit margin. But here you are bringing more SKUs to them.  You said 70% of your growth is going to come from distribution. You're also bringing balance to them. Is that straining in any way the relationship with the distributors especially when you're counting on distribution being such a big distribution expansion being such a big driver of your growth. Thank you.
Rob Sands: Yes. So, I'll take both questions. I think that as it relates to consumer confidence, as you said drilling down on that, if you look in the fourth quarter in particular I do think that we saw a disproportionate negative impact on Hispanic consumer confidence and that's for all of the obvious reasons I think, which is related to all the very unfortunate rhetoric with regard to Mexico coming out of the Trump administration and the news. Now that said, I would say that the Trump factor has diminished somewhat and therefore consumer confidence among Hispanics has probably increased a bit with all of the latest rhetoric, which is I wasn’t able to get ACA repeal and replace through that's brought a lot of uncertainty around what they are or are not going to be able to do relative to tax reform. I'm sure you saw the comments from the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kelly over the last two or three days basically saying that there isn’t going to be a wall built that will stretch from border to border. Maybe they’ll put up a couple of fences and this and that, but they’ve completely backed off or at least Trump's cabinet has backed off of the long rhetoric which I don't think that the wall is one of the big factors that we're particularly concerned about but it is a concern to our Hispanic consumers and does relate to the consumer confidence. So, I think on the Hispanic front, especially Mexican Hispanic, I think the fourth quarter things were a bit disproportionately poor, but I think that it's improving because as things continue to move forward it becomes more obvious to everybody that a lot of this stuff is rhetoric and sort of business as usual in Washington as it relates to elections and election promises versus whatever -- what actually happened. So many do have the actual hard statistics like jobs being better than anticipated in the recent jobs report. So that my commentary on that. And then your second question was on yes, relationship with wholesalers, now relationship with wholesalers is not being strained in any way, shape or form. Our relationship with our wholesalers on the beer side couldn’t be better. In fact, we are 100% of their growth okay, but Constellation okay, their businesses would be going backwards and their profits would be going backwards. Where their growth driver and in many instances today, we are their largest profit contributor period. As you know, we're largely or at least the majority of our distributors are Miller Coors houses and many of the major ones we moved ahead of Miller Coors in terms of profit contribution and as I said, we're providing the growth. They're very excited about new high-end products from us and in fact dying for it is the truth of the matter. And then you take a look at a product like Ballast Point, our distributors have not given up in any way, shape or form on the craft strategy, on the craft category. I would say that they are beginning and I think this is a good thing not a bad thing, just like the retailer to take a more measured approach to it and realizing that it doesn't make sense for them to carry every SKU under the sun and that they have to pair down in that regard. But clearly as business people both at retail and at wholesale, what they're thinking is we're going to pare down to the brands that are supported from an execution, from merchandising, from an advertising perspective by companies that have the wherewithal to invest behind these brands and they're basically going to get rid of all this no-name stuff that they know that is fly-by-night and the company is behind them don't have the wherewithal to support the brand. So, I think that shake out is going to work greatly to our favor and then I think with -- they see that we're bringing resources to this that the other competitive brands can't necessarily bring to the party. Some can. Some can't. And when I say resources, it's resources like our national accounts connections, team, hey just -- it's our wholesalers, right, it's a virtuous circle. We bring to them the products that are driving all of their growth, they turn around and focus on the products that are driving all of their growth, which causes those products do better than the other products. So, I think that Ballast Point bodes well with and then the positioning of Ballast Point right, the premiumization of it right, this is just, this is exactly what the beer guys are looking for are true premium, high margin beer products and that's both our wholesalers and our retailers. So, I believe they think that it's an exciting proposition and they will continue to drive that business.
Pablo Zuanic: All right. Thanks. That's very helpful.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg: Thanks for taking the question. Good morning, everyone. I guess two questions, one for you David and a broader question for you Rob, but there was an impairment charge David of $37.6 million in the quarter. So, what was that for? And then Rob if you think about your wine and spirits business, which is performing well and better than it did historically, you have a little bit bigger business in spirit. I'm wondering if that's aiding distribution for your wine brands and if you can give us an update on your appetite for additional spirits bolt-on and then on the wine component of your business, how would you characterize the promotional environment generally and your ability to deal with promotion against your brands from competitors and why
David Klein: So, Mark on the impairments, that's really just a continuation of our premiumization strategy. So, we had some wines in particular mostly sub $5 labels. We didn't sell a lot of cases of brands like Tallas or Marcus James that we elected to discontinue in order to shrink the number of brands in our portfolio and drive the premiumization trend. So that was just good housekeeping I would say, from a skew management perspective.
Mark Swartzberg: Fair enough. Great.
Rob Sands: So, Mark, to your questions, one spirits distribution and how that relates to wine, I would say it's separate largely and they were not. There is no strategy here to use spirits distribution to somehow drive wine distribution. In fact, we created a separate spirit salesforce to give more focus to our spirits business because yes, we think that that's a great both growth and margin driver in the future for us, but our early trends use spirits drive wine distribution or necessarily vice versa, except to the extent that we do have a TBA approach and when we are dealing with our major retail customers particularly the chains and mass merchandisers and clubs right where business is gravitating and we're talking to the people who alcoholic beverage roles up to, which there is usually an alcoholic beverage person, we're certainly taking advantage of the fact that across TBA, total beverage alcohol, we're providing all their growth or a large percentage of their growth and we're providing more profit to them largely than anybody else in the industry. So this is how we take advantage of our position across beer, wine and spirits with our major customers in that TBA continues to be the most important category in all of retail and especially with the big chains clubs and mass merchandise where that business is also gravitating to is the best profit provider, if you look at their top categories, which are CSR, carbonated software and CRDs and tobacco and alcoholic beverages right, well alcoholic beverages is really their stand out in terms of growth and profitability and dairy right is another category. These are all largely declining, highly commoditized categories versus beverage alcohol. So, we do use our TBA position to drive distribution, but as it relates to wine and spirits not really, but the big opportunity does exists for us with spirits and our spirits portfolio we intend to drive that. And yeah if we see any tuck-in acquisitions for spirit that we make sense, within our disciplines right, we haven’t put aside any element of our financial discipline on anything that we do nor are we going to. Okay. So, we will be selective if tuck-in opportunities. We're not going to -- our financial discipline on some theoretical basis tied around strategy and that isn’t quantifiable into our financial discipline. So, you can fundamentally count on that. And then you talked about promo, which…
Mark Swartzberg: Can I just interject real quick on the promo just to put that aside for a quick moment, with the cash flow profile of the business being what it is and the dividend increase and the repo you completed over the last fiscal year, I would think that if I'm in your shoes, the ability to pick up the pace of bolt-ons whether they're in spirits or wine or segments of beer is picking up right. So that what's driving my question still focused on spirits, but am I right to think that your attitude to pick up the pace is picking up because of the nature of the cash flow situation?
Rob Sands: That's an interesting question and my answer is that in terms of our capital deployment strategy okay, it probably hasn't changed or I should say and have chanced okay, as we continue to see our cash flow generation build, we are going to strike the same kind of balance that we have struck between paying down debt and keeping debt levels within our target of the mid three's okay. We will also continue to focus on returning value and dollars to shareholders, whether it's through things like our dividend increases or more stock repurchases okay to offset the normal dilution that occurs in our business annually and tuck-in acquisition. So, I don't see much changing with regard to any of those three things and we will continue to balance it and then on the tuck-in acquisitions specifically to your question about spirits, that's more a function of deal flow right, like what good things are there out there that will become available that meet our financial discipline like that's a very unclear -- there is no clear answer to that question. So, if the deal, if all of a sudden lot of things became available, again balancing those three things, the debt flow, our ability to offset dilution and return money to the shareholders proving back stock, we will look at all of the good deals that are strategic for us, both financially and otherwise in the portfolio as they come along. And I say strategic for us, what do I mean by that? Well that's our financial discipline as number one and then number two right, it's got to be high margin, high growth okay. We're not interested in much anything else, but that is in high margin, high growth okay where we wouldn't just do a financial deal on something that was something that did fit into the portfolio and what we're trying to do with the overall business and portfolio. So, it's got to be in a category to be high margin and high growth. There is large categories in beverage alcohol. There is insignificant to favor at the current time and we're probably not going to go there nor are we necessarily going to chase the absolute latest and greatest at any moment in time on the other side of that. So, it's all a big balance.
Mark Swartzberg: Very, very helpful and on wine, I was just -- the short version, the promotional environment, how would you characterize it as what you're seeing vis-à-vis your portfolio or what you're looking at into the coming fiscal year?
Rob Sands: Well when you think about promotion because there is so much promotional activity in wine, I think that we tend to think more about it in terms of net price realization whether it's through promo or frontline pricing. I would say that in terms of net price realization, wine is some robust than it has been in the past meaning in very simple terms whether it's through reduced promotion or for better frontline pricing, there's a little bit more pricing power and pricing, positive pricing activity, increased pricing in wine than there has been in the past. And I think that even in our portfolio, we're probably this year planning on taking more pricing than we have even in previous years. So, I would say that's getting to be a fairly robust environment. Everybody is sort of realizing that often the difference between a great business, a good business and a bad business is around how much pricing power there is in the marketplace. And wine continued to preimmunize at a very fast rate and with the premiumization and focus becoming now more around wines priced between $15 and $25 as opposed to be between $5 and $10 right, the price sensitivity on all this stuff is somewhat diminishing right because if you're looking at a bottle of Meiomi or other products that are now getting to be in the sweet spot of the commercial part of the business all of a sudden $0.49 is critical as if you were talking about a $5.99 $7.50 or $0.99 is a gigantic percentage. So, I think a positive news.
Mark Swartzberg: Great. Thank you, Rob.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.
Andrea Teixeira: Hi. Thank you. And congrats on the results. So, I would like to go back to beer, it sounds impossible, your beer gross margins expanded nicely to all-time highs of 52% and you also you also had an EBIT margin that grew nicely. So, you're probably driven by this new capacity and the end of the supply agreement, but would you expect us to see more reinvestment in SG&A as you alluded to in the prepared remarks across beer and wine as well and your guidance for the whole company actually implies some of the investment, but I also like margin, gross margin expansion and it's likely EBIT expansion. So how should we think of the balance of gross margin, operating margins going forward, especially as you have tougher competitors into the year and related to this if you can expand on the beer utilization I know you probably also have some higher fixed cost. So, do you expect any volatility as we see going through the quarters? Thank you.
Rob Sands: Yes. So just thinking about margins kind of at the EBIT margin level Andrea, we do believe that will have some benefits during the years, as I said earlier from FX and some benefits of -- some benefits of coming off of the ISA and in glass sourcing and so forth, offset by depreciation and one-time line commissioning cost because there is still going to be some noise in our COGS as we bring more capacity online. I think so you're going to see a little expansion there. I would say that from an SG&A and marketing perspective, you can assume that that's a percentage of sales, that will remain consistent year-over-year. I will say however considering a lot of other consumer products companies talking about the work that they're doing to take cost out of their business, we're doing all of that same work with a view of being able to redeploy resources to initiatives that are going to continue to drive the topline growth of our business. So, we are getting some benefits on the SG&A and marketing line, but the benefit is really more effectiveness and more, more topline growth as a result of that work. And then from a capacity utilization standpoint, I would say that we're going to be flat out at Obregon and Nava, as we go through the summer selling season. So, I don't expect that we'll see fluctuations in our cost as a result of utilization issues on overhead and in fact our ops guys are really good, but I don't think we'll see I don't think we'll see a lot of spare utilization that they have to try to manage for a couple years yet.
Andrea Teixeira: Okay. Thank you. And then for any spirits if I can just add my second question on how -- what are you seeing there because we didn't have a chance to discuss and so organically we're seeing the continuous trends on that category?
Rob Sands: Yes. So, we're continuing to see strong growth in the categories that we're playing in spirits right. So, our brand spirit Tequila continue to do well. Our brand in particular continue to do well and the recent IRI High West is up 79%. So, we're seeing good trends in the spirits business as I said in particular in the place where our newest brands like Casa Noble and High West play.
Andrea Teixeira: All right. Thanks David. Thanks Rob.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein from Evercore.
Rob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. A couple questions, so in the fourth quarter there was a little bit less than a 300-basis point difference between the depletions and the shipments, what does that mean for the first quarter and maybe you talk a little bit about where inventory levels are and what we should expect between shipments and depletions in Q1?
Rob Sands: Yes. So, we don't necessarily manage quarter ends all that tightly in beer because the inventory turns pretty quickly. We keep around 30 days of inventory on hand at our distributor on average across the portfolio and we're roughly in line with that at yearend maybe we're up a little bit, but that's to be expected going into this summer selling season. So, we're right where we want to be and we don't -- we're not purposely building inventory at distributors, again we like that 30-day mark.
Rob Ottenstein: Terrific and then could you talk a little bit about Obregon in terms of its impact in the quarter and in the following year in terms on the income statement and your margins? Is it having a positive impact, negative impact, how should we think about it?
Rob Sands: I would say that Obregon's probably it's thin line, it's not accretive or dilutive to our margins. We get some benefit of being off the ISA. We get some mile freight benefits, but to the West Coast shipments, but it's a more costly facility in general to produce in for a whole bunch of reasons, which we're going to try to address over time. So, I would say in the near term it's about a wash.
Rob Ottenstein: But it sounds like you have a pathway to actually make it accretive over time.
Rob Sands: I think what you'll see over time is you'll see us, yeah, yeah, right and then what we're really looking forward to the date when we actually have three facilities functioning and we can optimize our production runs through those facilities to really try to drive the best possible margins. But at this point we're producing and selling all the beer that we can get out -- we're selling all the beer that we can get out of our production facilities.
Rob Ottenstein: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse
Laurent Grandet: Yes. Good morning, everyone and congrats on the strong quarter. The first one is very quick, its confirmation on tax. You guided 22% tax rate for the fiscal '18, is that the new run rate. I understand there will be more volatility here or is it just for full year '18. That's for your David.
David Klein: Good question, Laurent because we talked about mid-20s at our Investor Meeting and I would say that the 22% is a bit of a refinement. So, we would expect that we go forward in that 22 to 25. So, it's kind of the low-end of mid-20s. But keeping in mind the point that you made, there will be more volatility because of stock-based comp.
Laurent Grandet: Okay. Thank you. And my second question really is more for your Rob, you mentioned 70% of the gross would be coming from distribution in the beer segment. Can I have a bit more granularity on this, what would be coming from Corona Can and Modelo versus what would be coming from brands like Pacifico or Ballast and then what's the balance of this 30% shelf space, you're gaining from this year or is it something else, thank you.
Rob Sands: Sure. So probably the biggest opportunity for growth is in Modelo Especial where there is a lot of room for distribution growth to get a brand like that up to say the same distribution levels as Corona Extra. So, the focus will be on building Modelo Especial distribution. And then Corona cans is another huge opportunity for distribution growth as well as, as I said some of the other products like Pacifico and then Ballast Point is hardly -- hardly has distribution outside of California. So, there's a big opportunity to drive the growth in Ballast Point through targeted distribution in other states. So, bottom line is sort of across the portfolio with probably the exception of Corona Glass 12 packs, there's a lot of -- there's just a lot of distribution growth opportunity and distribution growth is the primary way to drive volume growth.
Laurent Grandet: And then about the balance of the 30%, is it shelf space you're gaining from light on economy or is it something else?
Rob Sands: That would be velocity. It increases in velocity on brands that are getting distribution and becoming more popular. So, you'll see both happen.
David Klein: Yes, and a lot of that when we do our regression analysis around a lot of that comes from incremental, or more effective media spend as well as some of -- some demographic and economic tailwinds.
Laurent Grandet: Okay. Well, thank you very much Rob and David, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
Bill Chappell: Thanks. I guess officially, good afternoon. Just two quick questions. One, you said on Corona that we just finished the fifth year of double-digit increases on advertising and marketing. Will we have a six-year or are we starting to get to the equilibrium or have it where you want to be in terms of behind that brand?
David Klein: We continue to get outstanding returns on investment from marketing spend on Corona and so we'll continue to drive that brand and in the context of our total SG&A remaining constant as a percent of net sales, I just want to be clear that we're going to continue to look for ways to be more efficient with our spend across that whole SG&A spectrum so that we have money to invest in brand growth.
Bill Chappell: Okay. So, it implies double-digit for the portfolio while G&A gets maybe more efficient.
David Klein: Right in aggregate and if you look at our beer business and our beer business guidance has this double digits, it implies everything else stays the same, we'll be getting that kind of growth in our marketing spend.
Bill Chappell: Okay. And then one other, I might have missed this but the outlook on great cost this year and what impact it's having on margins?
David Klein: I think that that we expect great cost to continue to be very stable and we're not anticipating any material impact on margin. That said, you just don't know right now because until you get to the point where terms can be measured and even that's fairly unreliable because there is a lot of weather that can occur between even then and harvest you don't know what the size of the harvest is going to be, which is what tends of affect great pricing. But we're not expecting anything unusual. I would doubt very seriously that we're going to see anything out of the ordinary on great pricing and therefore its impact on margins this year. So, I would say it's something to particularly focus on.
Bill Chappell: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group.
Tim Ramey: Thanks so much. Rob, I know you don't like to talk about weather but there are three influences here coming up for some of the forecast for Cinco de Mayo as 81 and Sacramento, so that looks good, but it's been really rainy for about break probably difficult to get machines into the field and that's a negative and then groundwater and reservoir levels are good and so that's a positive. Is there any takeaway there? You just had touched on that a second ago, but thoughts.
Rob Sands: Tim, you're not really supposed to use specialized wine knowledge on these conference calls.
Tim Ramey: Yes sir.
Rob Sands: But the answer really continues to be no different than what I think you're going to see different -- you're going to see different things happen in different regions and obviously, business and where we source grapes from is so diversified that we're going to see some ups and downs. It could be tight in Napa. You take a brand like just high-end peanut brand Meiomi we're sourcing, the great thing about Meiomi right, it's a three Appalachian brand meaning it comes from three different Appalachian which gives us a lot of flexibility with regard to the sourcing of those grapes and then obviously, we're continuing to source a lot of grapes from the Northern Central Valley from the central moderate. So, I think you're going to see some balancing there meaning you'll see some tightknit in some areas and you'll see some of the opposite in other areas and obviously also in the Pacific Northwest that's also important to us now as well as the brand like Charles West and Charles Smith, which is growing really high double-digits. And therefore, we're using a lot of the Washington supply right now, which was part of that deal, which we locked up, a lot of the Washington supply of premium wine grapes with the Charles Smith deal, which was one of the reasons that we thought it was a good deal and it's turning out to be a particularly good deal with Kung Fu Girl Riesling making capital 100 in the wine spectator and that kind of stuff really drives the growth of brands like that.
Tim Ramey: Okay. David, just two quick ones, any single point estimate on DNA for the total company for 2018 and then also on the new share compensation standard that increases shares outstanding slightly I believe and your share count forecast was a little higher than what I thought it would be. Can you quantify what that would be?
David Klein: Yes, so our share count estimate is really our best estimate as we sit here today right. So, it's inclusive of all of those points. And then Tim as it relates to depreciation and amortization I would say, you can think about the rest of the business as being fairly consistent, but we said that in the beer business that that number would be up about 50% year-over-year. So that's really the only change.
Tim Ramey: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of UBS.
Stephen Powers: Hey great. Just two quick one’s for you David. First just around the beer margin discussion, is there any way you can help better dimension the benefits you've seen with Glass Furnish Two coming online at Nava and what you expect for Glass Furnace Three and Four as you look forward?
David Klein: It's kind of hard to do in a real simple way right because as I said on $2 billion a COGS and mid $4 billion of sales and we can have $10 million, $15 million swing $20 million swings in both directions over a number of items. And so, there's definitely a benefit for bringing on furnace two and three and ultimately furnace four, but I think it really gets kind of absorbed into the overall margin numbers over time, because we're really talking about $15 million swings as opposed to $70 million when you bring up the furnace. You can't see those if you look at our NCI charge, on a year-over-year basis, we expect that number to double on a full-year basis to about $10 million and that just represents incremental profitability in our glass joint venture.
Stephen Powers: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then finally on CapEx with the billion you're assuming for beer this is in fiscal '18 I believe that leaves $500 million to $600 million remaining across '19 and '20 this is what you said previously. Just want to confirm that's still the three-year aggregate assumption? And then as I think about that incremental call it $500 million to $600 million, should I -- should we consider that to be more or less evenly split across '19, '20, or is it going to be frontloaded loaded or is it too early to tell.
David Klein: So, the numbers that you quoted are roughly right. What I would say is that when we talk about a billion first of all, there's a range in that billion we just repaid. We picked kind of a point in there and I would say that that isn't all -- that's our entire beer capital number right, it's not necessarily all build out. So, the number over the next couple years is probably a little bit higher than the $600 you quoted I think, but it's not going to be material in the grand scheme of things.
Stephen Powers: Okay. That's fair enough, just wanted to clarify. Thank you.
Operator: And that was our final question. I'll now turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Okay. Well thanks everyone for joining today's call. As we wrap up our discussion of the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results, I want to emphasize how pleased I am with the excellent performance across all of our businesses. Our fiscal 2018 guidance shows we're very confident in our abilities to sustain profitable growth and we are firm in our commitment to build shareholder value. We look forward to the next time we speak with you in early July when we will share the results of our first quarter for our new fiscal year. Before then we hope you'll choose some of our fine products for your Spring celebrations including Cinco and Memorial Day weekend and of course enjoy them responsibily and speaking of Cinco, look for us at the New York Stock Exchange and on May 05 as we officially kick off our summer selling season by ringing the closing bell. Thanks, everybody and have a great rest of your day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your question. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Laurie. Good morning everyone Happy New Year and welcome to Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we continue our practice of limiting each Q&A session participants to two questions which will help us to end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance. And now here is Rob.
Rob Sands: Thanks, Patty, and good morning and Happy New Year. I hope you enjoyed the holiday and had the opportunity to include some of our great Constellation products in your celebrations with family and friends. Now before we get started with our discussion of third quarter results, I would like to thank those of you who participated in our recent New York Investor Meeting. I hope one of your key takeaways from that meeting is that Constellation is better positioned today than it has ever been to generate growth and build value. Our business has never been stronger and the prospects across our beer, wine and spirits portfolio are compelling. We sell a diversified portfolio of fast growing premium brands from the U.S. as well as other parts of the world. Our business continues to produce very impressive results. We are gaining share, improving margins and making smart investments to fuel growth. Consumer demand for our iconic brands remains very strong and we have no reason to expect this to abate. We are so confident about our future business prospects that we recently repurchased more than $800 million worth of our outstanding shares because we believe our stock is undervalued at current levels. I believe it's the changing political and legislative landscape in the U.S. that has recently impacted our stock price, particularly as it relates to potential changes to tax structure, tariffs and trade policies, but I will address this topic in a few moments. With that said, let's focus our discussion on some of the industry leading results we delivered for the third quarter. Our beer business continues to be a powerhouse for growth delivering third quarter depletion trends of almost 11% while contributing 60% of total U.S. beer industry IRI dollar growth and significantly outperforming the high-end of the U.S. beer category. Constellation beers was the clear market winner for Labor Day, outperforming the category and all major competitors while gaining both IRI dollar and volume share with all core import brands driving these gains. In addition to Labor Day, which marked the official close of our 120 days of summer selling season, Constellation was the U.S. beer market growth leader during all key summer holidays including Cinco de Mayo, Memorial Day and July 4. During the quarter, Corona Extra aired TV campaigns during NFL games while continuing to invest in boxing, and the Corona Extra can format and was the number three share gainer overall among high end U.S. brands. Casa Modelo was recently established to include all Modelo brands under a master branding strategy and portfolio approach. During the quarter, this brand family launched new packaging and initiatives for more effective cross promotion and awareness building while setting the stage for enhanced product innovation and line extensions. Casa Modelo continued TV advertising via both national Spanish language TV and national general market TV for Modelo Especial with a strong presence in the high profile NFL games. These initiatives helped to solidify Modelo Especial as the number two share gainer among all beer brands as well as high-end brands in the U.S. market and drove depletion growth of almost 20% during the third quarter. Pacifico continues to be on fire with nearly 20% depletion growth during the quarter. All core packages are growing with 24-ounce single serve can driving acceleration of the growth for this brand. Ballast Point continues to be the fastest growing major craft brand in the U.S. and achieved a solid double-digit depletion growth during the quarter. Operationally, our Nava brewery currently operating at 20 million hectoliters as well as our complete supply chain continues to perform at exceptional levels to support our sales growth through the first three quarters of our fiscal year with planned future expansions at Nava, on or ahead of plan. The Obregon brewery in Mexico remains fully operational as we transition the 400 highly skilled employees who have joined Constellation. They have hit the ground running now that this transaction is closed. This acquisition allows immediate access to functioning brewery capacity to support our fast growing high-end Mexican beer portfolio and provides flexibility for future innovation opportunities. We have also become fully independent from our interim supply agreement with ABI which was terminated with the acquisition. Our Mexicali brewery project has been initially re-scoped to five million hectoliters of production capacity as a result of the Obregon brewery acquisition. The Mexicali construction is picking up momentum and we expect the first module to commission in late calendar year 2019. And now I would like to discuss the results for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter we advanced our premiumization strategy with the acquisition of Charles Smith Wines and High West Whisky and Distillery. Both of these portfolio additions are off to exceptional starts and place us in categories with excellent potential and upside. Our innovation efforts are also taking a hold with brands like Robert Mondavi Private Selection Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet which has become one of the fastest growing super premium SKUs in IRI. The recently introduced Cooper & Thief of Bourbon Barrel-Aged Red Blend at the super luxury price point has been a hit with consumers. And Ravage Cabernet continues to ravage the competition. And Casa Noble Alta Belleza, which is the first addition of a new line of a limited release luxury tequilas that retails for $1,200 began selling recently and has received rave reviews from the media. Our higher margin focus brands drove positive results for the quarter, posting depletion growth of almost 9% driven by excellent trends for most of these brands including Meiomi and The Prisoner which continued to outperform our initial expectations. Many of these focused brands continued to maintain their reputation for excellence among critics with outstanding reviews, rankings and 90-plus scores. The 2013 Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve was named among the year's best U.S. Cabernets and blends in Wines and Spirits Magazine and received 95-plus points from Robert Parker in the Wine Advocate. Following a banner year of growth and recognition including IRI's number one New Zealand wine and number one Sauvignon Blanc in the U.S., Kim Crawford has been named New World Winery of the Year by Wine Enthusiast Magazine. Our newly acquired Charles Smith Kung Fu Girl Riesling scored 90 points in both the Wine Spectator and Wine Advocate and was named to the Wine Spectator Top 100 Wines three times in the past four years. Meiomi Pinot Noir achieved the number five slot on wine.com's 2016 Top 100 list. And finally High West Distillery recently received the Distiller of the Year Award from Whiskey Advocate, America's leading whiskey publication. This award represents recognition of excellence, innovation and great tasting whiskey and it credits High West with pioneering a successful new paradigm for craft distilling. We recently sold our Canadian wine business as part of our strategy to focus on premium margin accretive growth opportunities. This strategic action was also the result of our ongoing efforts to identify value enhancing opportunities to strengthen the financial portfolio of our overall wine and spirits business. I am also pleased to report that Constellation Ventures has been busy investing in two new minority interests, the newest which is Catoctin Creek Distilling Company, a producer of premium rye whiskey and gin from organic sources. Earlier in the quarter, we also announced Bardstown Bourbon, the largest new whiskey distillery in the U.S. Both of these investments provide us with the opportunity to further explore innovation in the brown spirits category. Now before I turn the call over to David, I think it's worth taking a moment to address some of the more frequent investor inquiries we have received since Election Day, including what potential changes under our new administration could mean for Constellation going forward. One specific aspect of a proposed Republican tax reform plan called border adjustability could potentially disallow a deduction for foreign sourced COGS or cost of goods sold. As you know, our imported Mexican brands can only be authentically produced in Mexico and sold in the U.S. In order to understand how different tax reform proposals could impact our business, we have modeled several different potential scenarios that include border adjustability as well as some of the positive facets of a corporate tax reform plan based on what we know today. Overall, there are many unknowns related to future legislation and it's still too early to make a definitive call on final outcomes and timing because the legislation has not been written. As more details develop on these policies and legislation materialized, you can be assured we are prepared to respond accordingly. As you would expect, we are closely monitoring the situation and we have significant resources dedicated to this effort. We have been working directly with our legislators to safeguard our ability to continue to cost effectively produce and sell our imported beer, wine and spirits products in the U.S. Under every scenario of proposed tax reform, we remain confident in our ability to achieve the strategic goals we outlied during our recent New York Investor Meeting. To reiterate these goals, we believe we can achieve EPS growth at a rate greater than 10% over the next three years and we think Constellation is a very compelling investment which can produce significant value for our shareholders. Our team is committed to delivering industry-leading returns. We think we have the right brands, the right leadership and the right strategies to do so. The fundamentals of our business have never been stronger and we believe that Constellation provides the best-in-class combination of sustainable topline growth and profitability in the consumer space. We continue to build shareholder value, commercially, operationally and through significant share repurchases under our $1 billion stock buyback program while remaining committed to our leverage target. I am also proud of the fact that we recently achieved investment grade status for the first time of the history in the company. With all that said, I would now like to turn the call over to David who will review our third quarter financial results. David?
David Klein: Thank you Rob and good morning everyone. We are pleased with our impressive financial results for Q3 and our recent business accomplishments as we continue to grow share and outperform the competition. Our continued strong topline and operating results were accompanied by a favorable tax rate benefit related to APB 23 accounting as we determined that a portion of our foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested. This assertion allows the company to record income taxes on certain foreign earnings using the applicable foreign jurisdiction tax rates rather than the higher U.S. tax rate. The fiscal 2017 year-to-date impact of this change was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and helped drive comparable basis diluted EPS growth of 38%. As a result, we are now projecting a lower tax rate for the year and this is driving an increase in our full-year comparable basis diluted EPS target to a range of $6.55 to $6.65 versus our previous guidance of $6.30 to $6.45. Looking at our Q3 fiscal 2017 performance in more detail, we are all generally focused on a comparable basis financial results. You can see beer net sales grew 16%, organic beer, net sales increased 12% primarily due to volume growth of 10% and favorable pricing. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at 11%. Wine and spirits net sales increased 5%. This reflects the acquisition benefit from The Prisoner Wine Brands and favorable mix, partially offset by lower volume due to timing as U.S. depletion volume outpaced shipment volume during the quarter. Our U.S. depletions grew a little over 3% in Q3. Beer operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 34.8%. The impact of planned marketing investments and consolidation of the Ballast Point business were mostly offset by benefits from pricing and foreign currency. For the Q3 year-to-date period, beer operating margin was 35.8%, up almost a full percentage point versus the same period last year. Looking more closely at beer SG&A, about half of the year-over-year increase in beer SG&A for the quarter was due to an increase in marketing spend. A majority of the remaining increase was driven by the overlap of a re-class from SG&A into COGS during Q3 of FY 2016. Wine and spirits operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 27.3%. Investments in SG&A and marketing were mostly offset by favorable COGS, benefit from the addition of The Prisoner Wine Brands and favorable mix. On a year-to-date basis, wine operating margin increased 80 basis points to 25.6%. Interest expense for the quarter increased $2 million as higher average borrowings were mostly offset by lower average interest rates. Equity earnings totaled $28 million and were generated primarily by Opus One. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 16.4% versus 32.3% for Q3 last year. This reflects the benefit of APB 23 which I highlighted earlier as the fiscal 2017 year-to-date impact of this change was recorded in the third quarter. We now expect our full year fiscal 2017 comparable basis effective tax rate to approximate 27%. Let me spend a few moments discussing our debt leverage ratio in recent business and capital allocation activities. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of Q3 totaled $8.4 billion, an increase of $436 million since the end of fiscal 2016. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.5 times at the end of Q3 versus 3.8 times at the end of fiscal 2016. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q3 does not reflect the full year of EBITDA benefit from our premium wine and spirits brand acquisitions including The Prisoner acquisition, which was funded during Q1 and Charles Smith and High West acquisitions which were funded during Q3. During the quarter, our credit rating was upgraded by Fitch and Standard & Poor's to an investment grade designation. We are proud of this achievement and are committed to maintaining the status moving forward. We saw the benefit of this upgrade in early December when we completed a $600 million senior notes offering. These notes are due in 2026 and carry an attractive interest rate of 3.7%. In December, as part of our efforts to increase focus on higher margin, higher growth premium brands, we completed the sale of our Canadian wine business in a transaction valued at CAD1.04 billion. We received cash proceeds net of outstanding debt of CAD775 million or $581 million. We received the proceeds from the outstanding debt prior to the sale. In the fourth quarter, we expect to recognize a net gain on the transaction, which is preliminarily estimated to be $255 million. In addition, we expect to pay income tax of approximately $70 million in connection with the divestiture with most of that payment expected to occur in fiscal 2017. At the end of December, we acquired the Obregon brewery operation from ABI for $5 83 million, net of cash acquired. This provides us with immediate functioning brewing capacity to support our growth, supply independence from ABI and flexibility for future innovation. We are committed to delivering shareholder value using every tool at our disposal. During the quarter we carefully reviewed the growth targets which were presented at our Investor Day in November in the context of tax reform. After diligent review, we determined that all of the targets remain appropriate as stated. This work provided us with confidence that the purchase of our shares would create value for our shareholders. Therefore we purchased 2.4 million shares of common stock at a cost of $367 million during Q3 and in December purchased an additional three million shares at a cost of $450 million. All of the activity I just highlight demonstrates management's ability to respond quickly and effectively to changing business conditions, the strength of our financial profile, the capital allocation flexibility we have as we operate at our leverage target and the confidence we have in our ability to execute our premiumization strategy, drive profitable growth and build shareholder value over the long term. Now let's review free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first nine months of fiscal 2017, we generated $824 million of free cash flow compared to $578 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion, up 30% primarily driven by our earnings growth. CapEx for the first nine months of the year was $592 million compared to $514 million for the prior year period. We are lowering our full year CapEx guidance by $100 million to a range of $825 million to $925 million. This primarily reflects some shift in the timing of Mexicali brewery capital related payments to next year. We are also lowering our full year operating cash flow guidance by $100 million to a range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. This is being driven primarily by anticipated tax payments associated with the Canadian wine business divestiture and the loss of Canadian wine business operating cash flow during the fourth quarter. Given these offsetting factors, we continue to expect fiscal 2017 free cash flow to be in the range of $575 million to $675 million. Moving to our full year fiscal 2017 P&L outlook. I shared earlier that we now expect our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.65 and the increase is being driven primarily by our lower projected tax rate. Our beer business continues to target net sales growth in the range of 16% to 17% and operating income growth in the high teens. This guidance continues to target beer operating margins in the 35% to 36% range. For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales growth in the mid-single digit range and operating income growth in the mid to high single digit range. Interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $335 million to $345 million and weighted average shares are now targeted at 204.5 million. These updates reflect the share repurchase activity I noted earlier. I would also note before closing that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. In closing, our results for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 have us on track to achieve another phenomenal year of growth and financial performance. Our focus on strong marketplace execution and making smart investments to support our business continues to strengthen our business and financial model providing us confidence in our ability to drive sustainable profitable growth and build shareholder value over the long term. With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: Hi. Good morning.
Rob Sands: Hi Dara.
Dara Mohsenian: First on the SG&A side. Clearly you posted a high increase year-over-year as a percent of sales at the corporate level in the quarter that was driven by both beer and wine and the beer comments were helpful. But I was hoping in wine, you could also give us a sense of how much of the increase in SG&A was due to marketing moving up as a percent of sales versus maybe other factors? And what those other factors are and how long they might last?
David Klein: So as a dollar amount delta year-over-year the wine increase similar to the beer increase was about half marketing spend as we invest more in our brands on the wine side and the other half was just investments primarily in people to drive our execution and NPD capabilities.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay. And are those people costs and those execution capabilities, is that something you lap over in a couple more quarters in cycle or is it something that's just beginning at this point? Last quarter you had some spending in those areas too. So I am just wondering when you cycle over that?
David Klein: Yes. I would expect fundamentally that our SG&A range, really in both of our business, will remain in line with where it's been historically over time as a percentage of sales.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay. And then on border adjustability, the comments were helpful. I am curious if you did need to take a large price increase to offset any changes in taxes, could you clarify if you think distributors and retailers would more just pass on the dollar profit impact of any price increases from Constellation or do you think they might look to more to maintain margins not just offsetting the profit dollar impact? And then also you have showed a willingness to price to offset cost historically in beer. Conceptually, if the tax change was large in nature, would you be willing to consider a mid to high single digit price increase, if needed, to offset taxes? Is that kind of in the range of scenarios you run when thinking about the tax changes that you mentioned earlier?
David Klein: So Dara, when we look at the tax changes and I just really want to caution everybody because we are talking to people in Congress on this topic and the border adjustability provision haven't even been written, right. So it's hypothetical and of course, we are trying to understand the effects that could take place, but it's hard to get into a lot of specifics when answering. But I would say that we still would suspect that our pricing algorithm would remain consistent where it's been in the past in the range of 1% to 2% a year and in order to mitigate any sort of a border tax, we would be more inclined to address elements of the supply chain that we would put into the deductible category. So for example, if you look at elements of our cost inputs that currently come from the U.S. that we could make deductible, I would put, say, the energy cost of producing glass in Mexico. That's just one example of things we can do in our supply chain. So we turn that into a U.S. cost instead of a Mexican cost and we then have a deductible expense for U.S. tax purposes. We think that combined with a lower U.S. tax rate and a reasonable phase-in period for any border adjustment tax would be a more appropriate and value creating approach than to really just jump on the price lever.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: Hi. Good morning.
Rob Sands: Good morning Viv.
Vivien Azer: So just in thinking about the beer trends, I think there has been a little bit of anxiety from some of the investors that we have talked to this morning around the [3Q plan] [ph] and beer results coming in a little bit below expectations and I think that's being exacerbated by some of the press reports about the preliminary Nielsen numbers through December. So two part question for me, please. Number one, can you walk us through the phasing of your beer trends through the quarter to help kind of put the December numbers that we are seeing from Nielsen in context? And number two, can you offer any perspective on why you thought December might have been soft? And in particular, what's going on with craft beer in that context? Thank you.
Rob Sands: Yes. Vivian, number one, we don't think that the quarter was soft at all. And if you look at IRI trends, for instance consumer takeaway, this quarter our growth was up to the most recent reporting period 16% whereas last quarter, right, it was below that at approximately 14%. So we are actually seeing an acceleration at retail on consumer takeaway. And then if you look at our depletion results for the quarter, we were at 10.7% depletion growth, but this quarter we were overlapping 16.2% depletion growth for the same quarter last year. And if you look at last quarter, we had 13.8% growth, which was higher than the same quarter or second quarter last year, which was 10.2%. Now, the fundamental point is that these kind of fluctuations quarter-by-quarter in depletions are not indicative of much of anything as long as they are in a range, right, of the kind of growth we have been experiencing, which is double digit growth in the low teens. You are going to continue to see fluctuations of this nature quarter-to-quarter in depletions based on what's happening with inventories at retail, shipments into our retail customers, et cetera. So you can't go by changes of, say, 100 basis points to judge whether the business is soft or not. The simple fact is that consumer takeaway for our products is accelerating, okay, sequentially as we look at our results. So I don't think that we believe or see any softness whatsoever in the business and in fact I would say, it's the opposite, okay, at the consumer level to the extent that it can be measured. We are actually seeing acceleration and I am sure that that will shake out from a depletion point of view over the medium term meaning throughout the year and into next year. So very, very, very strong results. We are the leader in growth in beer in every possible respect and contributing most of the growth to the entire industry. So we think our results are, in actuality, outstanding. They have double-digit growth. Following a 16.2% overlap is actually almost unbelievable.
Vivien Azer: Understood. That's helpful. And could you comment at all, please, on December, if you had a chance to take a look at that data and your view on some of the softness in the scanner data for December? And then if you could comment please on the broader slowdown that we are seeing in craft beer? Thanks.
Rob Sands: I think that number one, December continues to be strong. We don't really see, I mean, we don't pay that much attention to month-over-month fluctuations, but December continues to be strong results. Yes, we were up, what, 13% in IRI in December. So actually it continues to be very strong trends. And as far as craft goes, look, I mean craft is a tale of two cities, right. You can't look at the craft number as a total number. I mean what continues to go on in craft is the major brands, Sam, Sierra Nevada, Blue Moon, which are all on the craft numbers, those continued to be down big time, right, like in the, I don't know, about 8% range. And then you have sort of everything else which continues to be up significantly and is not being dragged by those numbers. And you have also got the, what I will call, the local effect which is a lot of the smaller local craft players eating up many of those larger older brands, which are now 25 years old. So as I said, it's really a tale of two cities, but most importantly Ballast Point's IRI trends were up 54%, okay, for the quarter and it continues to be the fastest-growing major craft brand in the category and it is certainly the most premium significantly sized brand in the category. So while you are you are seeing a lot of stuff kind of going out in craft, it's really not something that you can think of, I think, in terms of like a total category because it's almost a meaningless term. It's a brand-by-brand phenomenon. And so you really have to look at the specific brands and companies that you are concerned about as to how they are performing.
Vivien Azer: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Rob Sands: Hi Judy.
Judy Hong: Hi. Good Morning. So a couple of follow-ups on the border adjustability comment. First, just in terms of and I completely understand it's not even written as part of the legislation, but what are you hearing in terms of the potential carve-out if indeed the border adjustability is included as a part of the tax reform? And then David, you have talked about some portion of your beer costs already classified as U.S. costs. So can you give us the number today and potentially what that can get to?
Rob Sands: Yes. So thank you for caveating that it hasn't been written because I think I am going to say that every time anyone asks about border adjustability, right. So we are in the field of concepts here. Our understanding is that U.S. based COGS will be deductible. And right now our U.S. based component of our beer COGS, inclusive of freight, is about 40%. I mean 60% of the COGS is from Mexico. Now we have things that we can do within our supply chain over time, but we are talking about long-term supply agreements. We would have to take into account changes in freight and of course, any changes or fluctuations in currency between the countries before you make final plans like that. So I would say, when we do our modeling, we are looking at kind of staying in the range of foreign COGS that we have today and then picking up the benefits that are included in the rest of the tax package and assuming a reasonable phase-in period which is how we come back to having a great deal of comfort in saying that we can grow EPS greater than 10% as we described in November.
Judy Hong: Okay. And then just any color just you are hearing in terms of the carve-out prospects?
Rob Sands: What do you mean by a carve-out prospects, Judy?
Judy Hong: So if border adjustability is included, could Mexican beer be exempt from that adjustability?
Rob Sands: Sure. It's possible that Mexican beer could be exempt because it's an inherently Mexican product and it's not the kind of thing that perhaps is being targeted, i.e., the movement of production from the U.S. to Mexico. In fact, in our particular case it's the complete opposite in which you have a U.S. company that bought an inherently Mexican company and actually resulted in the creation of jobs in the U.S. as opposed to the opposite. So of course we are making that point with our legislators and I would say they fully understand and comprehend that point. So yes, there could be a carve-out. But I think more importantly, I would reiterate what David said, number one, we are not necessarily relying upon a carve-out. Number two, what we have been told, if you believe that border adjustability will in fact occur, which is a big maybe in the first place, if it does, there will be a relatively lengthy phase-in period. That's what our legislators and the people on Ways and Means, et cetera are saying. And then, furthermore as David pointed, we would have significant ability to mitigate the effect of it by moving COGS, right, from Mexico to the U.S. So David gave a good example of it. Energy, which is a very large component in the manufacture of glass, glass being the largest component of COGS we buy out of Mexico right now. We could shift our purchase of natural gas from Mexico to the U.S. and increase our cost of goods sold component that's U.S. based and therefore mitigate the impact of the lack of deductibility of foreign COGS. So it's those kind of things that we are looking at, planning of, if this comes to pass so that we can maintain, as David said, our current pricing algorithm which is sort of in the 1% to 2%. And therefore we don't expect consumer demand for our product to be effected by border adjustability in any timeframe that's probably relevant to our investors.
Judy Hong: Got it. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on Ballast Point.
Rob Sands: And Judy, I would also point out that the other benefits of tax reform is being suggested in the Better Way Plan being put forth by the House, right, has very significant other benefits which will also offset any negative from border adjustability. So I think it could be a net positive when all is said and done, but it remains to be seen. As David has said, the only details we get are from talking to the legislators who are involved right now in, I will say, contemplating the details of these proposals. And that's the best anybody can know. And I would say, we probably know more about this than anybody, any corporation.
Judy Hong: Yes. That's really helpful. So thanks for that. Just if I can ask a quick question on Ballast Point. So just in terms of the contribution to your sales, it looks like it's slowed pretty meaningfully versus first half and then maybe even implying a down year-over-year. So just wondering if there's any kind of a destocking going on, just from a shipment perspective for Ballast? And then just in terms of --
Rob Sands: There is nothing going on with Ballast. The business is up double digits. The IRI is up 54%. There is nothing going on with it at all. And it's a very small contributor to the results. I mean it's a very small business, right. So it's not meaningfully contributing to any of the numbers that we are talking about, but it will and one of these days, because it is a very fast grower and it continues to grow well. So it's part of our strategy to continue to drive the portfolio towards growth brands and that strategy is working very well, by the way
Judy Hong: Got it. Thank you for that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: Good morning everyone.
Rob Sands: Hi Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. I just have a couple of quick follow-on questions. First on your total beer business. Could you drill down on how your on-premise business has been performing versus off-premise? And then curious to hear how your beer business has been performing in the untracked channels off-premise? And then could you touch on where you are at with national distribution for Ballast Point, please? Thanks.
David Klein: Yes. So in terms of on-premise and off-premise, our beer business is up high single digits in the on-premise. We think the market's down low to mid single digits in the on-premise. So we are gaining share and feeling very, very comfortable there. And on your last question, I have it here, as it relates to Ballast Point's distribution, I think Ballast Point is about 25. So ACV is about 25 and we are in about 45 states. But what I want to caution when we talk about expanding into incremental states is that if we sell a case in a state we say that we are in that state. We really need to continue to drive the sales execution and broadening of the base in each state that we go into with Ballast Point. So there is a lot of runway in front of us as it relates to Ballast Point.
Bonnie Herzog: So you expect that continued push on distribution to continue well into next year before you feel like you have gained additional --
David Klein: Well, it will continue way beyond next year.
Bonnie Herzog: Yes.
David Klein: It's hardly in distribution outside of California, right.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. And then just circling back on maybe the untracked channels off-premise, just trying to get a sense of how your business is performing there, just since we are all looking at scanner data.
David Klein: I would say that our business is performing similar to what you are seeing in the tracked off-premise channel in the untracked off-premise channels. So that's about the best we can tell you, but we have no reason to believe otherwise. So I suppose taking a look at, well, we have no reason to believe otherwise. Let me put it that way.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. All right.
David Klein: Based on our shipment to distributors and they reported depletions. Business is, as I had said, very, very strong.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you so much.
Rob Sands: Thanks Bonnie.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel.
Mark Swartzberg: Great. Thank you.
Rob Sands: Hi Mark.
Mark Swartzberg: Hi Rob. Hi Dave. Morning everyone. So a few questions. I will try to leave Mexico for the moment, but I will come back there. You are doing very well with your balance sheet. You have been very aggressive recently buying your shares. It picked up further in terms of monthly pace in December. You have got this new authorization that, in a sense you are close to being done with, if you take the pace you had already acted out in December. So, the simple question is, the two of you as people advising the Board and saying, hey, we want to do this or that, how interested are you in presenting to the Board another $1 billion dollar authorization?
David Klein: Well, first of all, Mark, we have $800 million approximately remaining on the recent authorization. And just for clarity, I think that we had $600 million or $700 million remaining on our previous authorization that we spent as part of these repurchases and then we went into the new authorization by about $200 million.
Mark Swartzberg: Right. And so my question is, the pace you are going at implies you are going to be done with that new authorization rather quickly. So what's your appetite for asking for an additional authorization?
Rob Sands: The Board would be completely amenable to giving us any authorization that we ask for because of the fact that David mentioned was, we think that our shares are, especially today, significantly undervalued. That said, we have $800 million left on our authorization. So it's really not much of an issue at the moment. We will continue to make share repurchases opportunistically as we have in the past and the only caveat on that is that we do desire to stay within our debt target of approximately 3.5, which is also important and to therefore maintain our investment grade ratings. So that's probably the only real caveat on making stock repurchases, but hey, we are gung ho on stock repurchases. So no on needs to convince us of that strategy.
Mark Swartzberg: All right. And your balance sheet is much more suited. Okay. Fair enough. And then on the beer business on the front, so to speak, you mentioned how we should think about the increase in SG&A and part of it is just an accounting change, but the portion that you referred to as half, you said half of the increases is attributable to increase in marketing spend. And I think one of the things that we are all trying to understand is, how much should we think that that's already shown up in a sense in the quarter and the way the depletion is already performed? And how much of that is kind of a yet to come benefit? And I realize, no one has a crystal ball, but can you give us a sense, like how much of that was trade related, how much of that increase was consumer related? Because we are just trying to get a sense of, do we already see the benefits or other some benefits yet to come and maybe trade versus consumer is one way to think about that?
David Klein: So, the increase in marketing spend was mostly at the consumer level. And when I talked about increase, I am really talking about the dollar increase. We haven't really changed our overall strategy in terms of marketing expense as a percent of net sales. And so we still expect that to be in the 8.5% to 9% range and we track that very diligently to make sure that we are getting a return for it and we continue to see the returns as we invest in our brands and the best example I can give is that this year we started investing from a marketing standpoint in Pacifico and we are seeing Pacifico, for example, in the last 12 weeks is up 27% in IRI. So you can expect us to continue to do that but I think as a percentage of sales, we really haven't changed our strategy.
Mark Swartzberg: That's great. Okay. And then specifically in the case of border adjustability and sort of an immediate benefit that's come with Donald Trump being elected President is the peso has depreciated. So with the peso depreciating, you have talked to us historically about the portion of your COGS that are denominated in pesos. Is there any benefit above simply that depreciation benefit we should be thinking about? Is there something that's affecting your peso denominated inputs themselves? Or the hiring dynamics? I realize we are only kind of two months since November 8, but I am just trying to get a sense of how Mexico's economy, so to speak, is affecting your cost in Mexico?
David Klein: Yes. So about 25% of our costs are peso denominated which disconnects a little bit from the percentage that I said earlier, so 60% of our COGS being Mexican. And the difference is dollar denominated contracts for goods that we purchase in Mexico, those contracts themselves really have an underlying FX component to them. They are denominated in dollars and it may take longer for any benefit from that to flow through. And as it relates to the Mexican economy, we are not seeing any issues from a hiring or a labor standpoint or costs within Mexico. So we are seeing no problem. We are also not seeing any significant benefits.
Mark Swartzberg: Great. And then final question, I don't know if you touched on this or not, but you have drawn our attention again to the fact that 60% of your COGS for the beer business are relating to the operations in Mexico and your openness to moving glass or some other element to a location north of the border. But can you tell us, if we take a long view, a three-year view, a five-year view, a 10-year view, what portion of that 60% in your mind is eligible for movement north of the border?
David Klein: Yes. That's harder to get to and I think you have to take into account any discussion of this we could really only have after we know the specifics of any sort of border tax because I think you would have to look at the actual cost of purchase of changing moving supply chain components to the U.S.. You would have to take into account freight and then of course you would have to take into account the currency delta. And maybe there is a scenario where the currency delta makes moving the supply chain irrelevant, right. So I think we would have to play that through when we actually know the conditions on the ground and we can't really know that today.
Rob Sands: But I think your question, as you are really talking about the longer-term, it could be the majority of it because although the beer has to be made in Mexico, a lot of the components could be shifted if it was really determined to be advantageous and labor which is required to make and bottle the beer is a very small percentage of the total tax. So it's only 15% of the COGS. So you get the vast majority of it in one way or another U.S. based.
Mark Swartzberg: If the currency supports that. Got it. Okay. Very helpful. Thank you guys.
David Klein: And you also --
Rob Sands: And the details of everything else and all of the puts and takes with everything else. I mean, we wouldn't just totally disrupt the supply chain over the long run if it's not necessary. But we do have quite a bit of flexibility in what we can do. So hence our optimism obviously relative to this whole matter and as also evidenced by our view on our own stock value and our buyback activity.
Mark Swartzberg: I wanted to ask one last legislative thing, this isn't so much a Constellation question, but your point, Rob, about having better insight into what's happening to Washington in the many companies is simply the Senate. So we know what Kevin Brady and the House have put out there. We know what Donald Trump thinks. We know what Paul Ryan thinks. But do you have any sense of either timing or leadership in the Senate when we are going to actually hear some of it from the Senate speaking with some clarity about how they are thinking about this matter?
Rob Sands: Well, I think that Hatch made some comments yesterday saying that he doesn't know yet what their view or opinion is on any of this. I have talked to Schumer myself personally and I would say that on the Senate side everybody is pretty reserved as to where this whole thing is going. So I would say that there is a lot less clarity on the Senate side than there is on the House side. And I would say we know a lot more about it than anybody else and that we are told that other companies that should be concerned about this are just waking up to the whole matter whereas we have been focused on it from the very beginning, having met ourselves with Ryan several months ago, really over the last summer. So we have been quite aware of this and thinking about it. Hence as David has pointed out, we have been thinking well in advance of strategically all of the things that we can do and will do if necessary to mitigate the impacts of this. So I think we are totally ahead of the game, which is good because I think as our comfort level now is indicative of that fact, which is that we have been so far ahead of the game that we sort of know what we are going to do and we are not sort of relying upon or hopefully this won't happen or what the probabilities are because that's like nobody can predict any of that stuff. So all we can do is around and determine what our action items will be if something occurs and how we are going to do it. So as I said, we are pretty far advanced in that thinking.
Mark Swartzberg: Very helpful. Thank you guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group.
Tim Ramey: Thanks very much. Hi. Good morning. Just going back to your commentary on wanting to stay within the investment grade bounds, sort of a more liberal interpretation of debt ceilings has really served Constellation well over the couple decades and certainly over the last five or six years. What is that makes you more comfortable in that 3.5 times or below range? And is this a change in the rating agencies viewing 3.5 times as investment grade which maybe wasn't done in the past? Or is this comfort on your level that you don't need to lever beyond that?
Rob Sands: I think David will answer this as well. I will just give you my quick view on this which is that, it's really a size and scale thing, right. Our EBIT and margins and the cash flow that this company is and will be generating, especially as we complete over the next couple of years, our large capital projects pretty much give us, I would say, the flexibility to do everything that we could possibly want to do without really having to deviate from sort of that mid three range. That could deviate a little bit from time-to-time but I don't really see that it's important. I mean we are going to have so much cash generation that we feel pretty comfortable that we can pretty much internally fund just about anything that you could conceivably do in the alcoholic beverage business, right.
Tim Ramey: Sure.
Rob Sands: So that's just my view on it. David?
David Klein: Yes. I would just reiterate that $2.5 billion of EBITDA that's generated every year, you can stay at the 3.5 times and you have fair amount of capital to allocate to other activities. And I would say that where we are focused on saying that we will stay at the 3.5 times. We are not looking to be leveraged below 3.5 times and if we go above 3.5 times, we would then want to get back to that number, but we are really thinking about it, Tim, as a target.
Tim Ramey: Yes. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.
Rob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on the investment grade rating and the continued tremendous business momentum. On that point, you mentioned very interestingly, that you have actually seen on a sequential basis an acceleration in the beer business. And I am wondering if you could be perhaps a little bit more specific in terms of what you think the potential triggers of that acceleration are? Is it particular new SKUs? Is it Corona cans? Your c-store initiatives? The increased marketing? Probably a little bit all of the above, but I would love to get your thoughts on that.
Rob Sands: Yes. Well, I think first of all, you gave it pretty good litany of all of the things that are driving it. Our marketing, our advertising, cans, SKUs, those are all things that continue to drive our consumer takeaway. And then there's some increased distribution is another big focus of ours and getting the right distribution in the right places. I mean it is not just the increased distribution by the numbers, it’s quality of distribution so that all relates to sales execution. So that's kind of motherhood and apple pie and we are doing a great job with it. I think also, if you sort of look at what's going on retail with even the craft segment, there is definitely now a movement to reduce the number of SKUs. That is causing some regained focus at retail which we always thought that at this ought to happen. The really fast growing high margin bread and butter items that they have, which happens to be our portfolio and therefore more attention, more space, more distribution is being given to what they know is working versus what hasn't worked. I think that takes us back to a Ballast Point point of, okay, which is as you see some slowdown in the older more established craft types brands, a brand like Ballast Point which will be supported, has strong sales execution behind it, these are the types of brands that will be the beneficiary as things shake out a little more in the craft segment as well our import portfolio because it's clear-cut that that's what's driving all the growth in the beer business at retail. So I think that we will see our sort of total portfolio be the beneficiary of sort of constant or anticipated changes that will occur over time, as has always occurred. I mean there's always been these kind of changes in the business. On the one hand, it's a slow business to change. On the other hand, there is constant change going on with all three categories.
Rob Ottenstein: And in terms of that retailer re-spacing or kind of re-looking at their SKUs and we certainly heard about that from Walmart, about when do you think that's started? Has that been going on throughout 2016, calendar 2016? Or did you see that really pick up in the second half of the year?
Rob Sands: I think that it's actually in its infancy. I think it's just starting. But you take a Walmart, for instance, I mean they love our products because they are trying to, they want higher margin fast moving growing products on their shelf, because they don't have that much space devoted to the category. So they want all the best stock.
Rob Ottenstein: Terrific.
Rob Sands: I think it's just starting and I think that you will see us, as I said, there's always changes that are going on in the industry across all three categories and the key, strategically, is to make sure that you are positioned to be the positive beneficiary of those changes. And that's why we make some of the comments that we do about being better positioned as a company than we have ever have been because it's pretty clear to us that given our whole portfolio and our strategy and our premiumization strategy and our focus towards high margin, high growth brands that that's really positions us to be the key, not one of but the key beneficiary of all of the changes that are going on. And look, you see that in our results versus every other beverage alcohol company, right. Frankly versus almost any other company in consumer goods, period. There is no companies in consumer goods in general that are performing like we are that I am aware of.
Rob Ottenstein: No. It's tremendous.
Rob Sands: Even some of the ones that are outside of our industry and category and have not consistently performed as we have. So we are a bit of an outlier in that regard. And we hope to continue to be so.
Rob Ottenstein: Absolutely. And then just on cost side, I believe in the last quarter you mentioned that you thought advertising spend as a percent of sales would be flattish in the second half of the big chunk in the third quarter as we just saw versus the fourth quarter. Do you still stand by that?
David Klein: Yes. I would say that on an absolute dollar basis, once again we will see some year-over-year growth in marketing spend. But from a model perspective, our marketing spend will end up in that 8.5% to 9% range for the full year.
Rob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
Bill Chappell: Thanks. So just quick question on the taxes. I think you talked about a lower tax rate for 2018. I assume there's no change in kind of the outlook there.
David Klein: No. So we talked about having a mid 20s sort of ETR as a target over the next three years and we are not really giving guidance for FY 2018, but there's no reason to expect that would be outside of that.
Bill Chappell: Okay. Thanks. And then also just to make sure I understood, the net leverage at the end of the quarter, that includes the cash used for share repurchase? I am just trying to understand kind of where we stand as of today.
David Klein: Yes. So that 3.5 times was at the end of the quarter. I would say, if the year were to end today we are probably more in the 3.6 to 3.7 range, given the repurchases that took place in December.
Bill Chappell: And in terms of future share repurchases, you are comfortable going above four times?
David Klein: I would say, again, we are focused on the 3.5 times range and if appropriate opportunities present themselves from a capital allocation standpoint, we will go above the 3.5 times but our objective is to always be able to quickly get back to that level. But again, we have maintain on the 3.5 times versus trying to just how high we could actually go.
Bill Chappell: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse.
Laurent Grandet: Yes. Hello. Thanks for the opportunity. So I would like to come back to this SG&A point. SG&A went up to 19.5% in the quarter from about 17%, 17.5% in the previous quarters and you mentioned at the same time that the marketing spend was of roughly 8.5% to 9% of sales, roughly similar to the previous quarters. So I really would like to understand, I mean where is the balance of the SG&A? And is it something we should see in the future quarters? And is it some kind of initiatives, I mean, to support new brand introductions or to go after the on-premise channel? So I like to really have more color about these SG&A and how we should think about it going forward?
David Klein: Yes. So again from holding aside quarter-to-quarter volatility in total SG&A spend, I would say that for, just focused only on the beer business, our marketing spend will be somewhere between 8.5% to 9% of net sales. In terms of SG&A spend in our beer business, we expect that it stays in the historical range that's really in 5.5% to 6% range, specifically in our beer business. And the incremental growth in SG&A in both businesses, really any incremental spend there is put in place to really drive innovation and better sales execution. But again, our SG&A algorithm is not changing. These are just quarter-over-quarter anomalies.
Laurent Grandet: Okay. Thank you very much. And an in terms of focus, I would like to come back on this final question on Ballast Point. I understand we do have vision on sales of 45% to ball park it, similarly to IRI. But if we dig more into the numbers and we see that the distribution now has been plateauing at about 23% for the last six quarters. And same store sales seems to be now at minus 25 and that's for the last few quarters. So was the plan here to kind of push even further Ballast Point? I understand it's still a small part of your algorithm but also it's important for the future of the gross of the beer segment of your business.
Rob Sands: No. We have got all kinds of programs to drive distribution of the product. And throughout the United States we have taken the brand national. We have very strong relationships with our distributors. We are increasing our support levels behind the brand and doing all of the standard things that one would do in this particular category and that's an important caveat to drive the business. So it's all about doing things like driving national accounts. These kind of brands require a lot of grassroots type efforts. We continue to develop new products. We continue to develop our retail model. We continue to win awards, which is important in the craft segment because it's a lot like wine and ratings and I think we are on the forefront of that in actuality. So it's all good. There is just nothing to be concerned about or to complain about.
Laurent Grandet: Thanks for adding some comfort on this.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of UBS.
Stephen Powers: Hi. Great. Thank you. Back to taxes, I guess really two questions, if I could. First, your comments on board adjustability have been very helpful. But I am wondering if you could comment also on what discussions you may have had around interest expense deductibility and how that aspect of potential tax reform has factored into the scenarios you have talked about? And then second, I just wanted to test whether your confidence in the 10% growth algorithm through 2020 under potential tax reform depends on the phase-in assumptions that you mentioned? Or if you have modeled scenarios where sort of the adverse aspects may take effect more quickly and you could still hit the 10% number?
David Klein: Yes. So in terms of interest deductibility, I think the general assumption, under the Better Way Plan, is that it wouldn't be deductible on a go-forward basis. Our assumption there is that existing interest would remain deductible. And then in terms of phase-in, the last time there was tax reform, I think the phase-in period was four years. But this sort of tax reform really isn't about just setting up back office accounting departments to manage the new tax code. This kind of tax reform would require a time horizon that would allow companies to change their entire supply chain. So our expectation is that it would at least be four years and our objective would be to advocate to make that as long as possible so that we could actually get through up in supply agreements and so forth. And so I would say that when we start looking at the three-year numbers, I think there are a couple of things that play into it. And one is the phase-in period, of course and we are not assuming that it's just an immediate phase-in. And then I think the other component that you have to keep in mind is, if you look at in particular peso rates historically, for us, versus the current peso rates, so not incremental currency movement, but the current peso rate, it actually provides benefits to us that would be somewhat offsetting as we sit here today.
Rob Sands: But I think that it's not just phase-in, right. When do you think that the actual tax reform legislation will be enacted?
Stephen Powers: Right.
Rob Sands: I mean it's probably a year off at best.
Stephen Powers: Yes.
Rob Sands: Right.
Stephen Powers: Yes. No, okay. That's all fair. Just wanted to get someone to clarify.
Rob Sands: We can only tell you what our legislators have been telling us, right. But the first thing that's going to happen in Congress, which you are seeing right now is Obamacare.
Stephen Powers: Yes.
Rob Sands: So Congress has a lot on its plate right now. And to work through all of the details and get legislation like that passed, well, Congress is telling us it's going to be a while in any event. And it is clear cut and again this is literally what we have been told by the leaders that Obamacare is the first thing on their plate.
Stephen Powers: Okay. That's helpful.
Rob Sands: And that's going to take a while.
Stephen Powers: Okay. And I don't want to get too far into the weeds here, but I just want to make sure I am thinking about this correctly from what you are currently doing. It looks to me like today what you are doing in terms of, you are essentially leveraging some pretty high transfer prices from Mexico to the U.S. to keep profits today outside the U.S. I think 60% of your pre-tax income effectively is booked outside the U.S. today. So I am assuming in the future you would theoretically be able to reduce those transfer prices, shift dollars, shift profits back to the U.S., hopefully at a lower tax rate and that's as part of the levers you can pull. Can you just talk me through the transfer pricing algorithm there?
David Klein: Yes. You shouldn't even think about that, right. So the transfer prices so still at market rates. You just have to think about the deductible component of COGS, which really doesn't change. What matters is where you incur the costs, not necessarily where you have put the revenue.
Stephen Powers: Okay. So you put the revenue wherever the tax rate was most advantaged?
David Klein: Yes. So it's a shift in mindset on border adjustability. It's really all about the COGS sourcing.
Stephen Powers: Okay. The last thing, not on tax, I just wanted to see if you could just add some comments on Corona Premier. There's been some, I guess from my perspective, some degree of apprehension from the marketplace in terms of maybe pushing that too far to the detriment of mainline Corona. So just wanted to get a sense for what your rollout plan was there and how big, how small, how fast, how slow, that kind of thing?
Rob Sands: We are going to test market it in three or four different markets of different types, meaning more mature and less mature markets to get a good handle on how it interacts with our other products and then make a decision as to whether we will continue the product and roll it out or not. I don't see any big issue with it. Our distributors, they are excited about it. The category is a good category. Mic Ultra is one of the leading growth drivers in the industry right now. That product is differentiated from our other products. I would say that we continue to believe that it's got a high probability of success. It's priced at Corona, right. So we are not worried necessarily about a cannibalization factor where we would be only worried about the product fundamentally their not being successful, well that's really it. Because otherwise, it's going to be one plus one equals three so there aren't any margin concerns relative to cannibalization.
Stephen Powers: Okay. Thank you very much.
Rob Sands: I guess it's only whether it's additive and successful and that will be determined pretty easily in the test market scenarios. So it's real straightforward low risk stuff.
Stephen Powers: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research.
Brett Cooper: Hi guys. Thanks for the question. And there's two. I just wanted to confirm on the comments, so when you are saying that you are able to grow earnings 10%, that's off of the guided basis, $6.55 to $6.65 and that you will be able to exceed $1 billion in free cash flow in 2019? That's my first one.
David Klein: Yes. We stand by the targets we put out there in November.
Brett Cooper: Okay. Perfect. And then can you guys talk about the retailer receptivity that you --
David Klein: Hang on. The only thing that, when we look at the targets for the individual businesses, you do have to remove Canada but our EPS target remains.
Brett Cooper: Okay. Perfect. And then can you talk about retailer receptivity to taking on some of your smaller brands? I mean I guess they are not all that small, but things like Pacifico and Negra, relative to their willingness to do some of the craft brands? And then talk about your expectations for incremental placements in smaller brands and/or packages into the coming year.
Rob Sands: Yes. I would say that they are dying for them, especially Pacifico.
Brett Cooper: So we should be able to see --
Rob Sands: The only thing that's held us back our Pacifico is not retailer demand. I mean retailers are dying to get the product. Up till now we have been sort of production constrained just trying to feed the growth that we have had, now that we have got Nava up to speed and we will see the addition of another five million hectoliters at Nava in the next few months and we have bought Obregon. That sort of cleared up and now we are beginning to drive those brands like Pacifico. I mean look, I don't want to necessarily predict the future, but Pacifico has got a good chance of being the next Modelo Especial while Modelo Especial still continues to have a huge runway and grow 20%. So I think the good news is, we have got Pacifico coming right behind Modelo Especial with huge retail demand and excitement about the product. I mean there's all kinds of anecdotes about Pacifico and what consumers are thinking relative to the product. I mean probably the most interesting anecdote being that it is the fashionable choice of craft drinkers.
Brett Cooper: Perfect. Thank you guys.
Rob Sands: Many craft drinkers when they get sick of drinking double IPAs, their beer of choice is Pacifico.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.
Caroline Levy: Thank you for being so generous with your time. Just wondering what your people in Mexico are saying about what the Mexican government's reaction might be to Trump-onomics, border taxes, et cetera? Whether there is any risk or opportunity there for you? And then also just given that you have invested in these glass plants, does that put at risk your investments, be it the glass plants or your big production capacity? Would any change in where you source goods lead some of that capacity to be unnecessary?
David Klein: So I will answer the second point and then Rob can maybe comment on the Mexican point. But what I would say, Caroline, is that I don't see a scenario where our glass joint venture wouldn't be by far and away the cheapest source of glass even in the new tax regime, just simply because of the freight benefit of having that plant and it's a highly efficient plant sitting next door to our brewery and so about half of our glass needs will ultimately come from that joint venture facility. And I would say that if we needed to move our other packaging sourcing elsewhere, we could do that, given enough time because we are sitting under quite long-term contracts with our packaging vendors.
Rob Sands: And I guess my comment on the Mexicans and of course we do talk to the Mexican politicians as well as Peña Nieto, et cetera, et cetera. I think they are taking a measured view of the whole thing. Not necessarily being overly aggressive in their comments about what they will do other than they are prepared to engage in reasonable negotiations. And they do not believe that the U.S., in the end, will enter into or will take actions that would violate WTO principles and other principles of that nature. So I would say, that the Mexicans are being measured in their comments, but on the other hand if pushed they are certainly prepared to say that they will act accordingly if the U.S. violates their agreements.
Caroline Levy: Got it. My last question, if you don't mind, would just be to understand the margin expansion, the gross margin expansion in beer? The key drivers, like how much of a role did the peso play? How much of a drag was Ballast?
David Klein: Yes. So I don't have the exact components of each of it. But I would say, the first thing is that when we talk about the SG&A re-class last year that gave us a year-over-year comparable benefit on COGS on GP versus the negative hit on the SG&A. And then in the current year, even though the peso has weakened substantially, in the current year we are probably 75% hedged on the peso, right. So that effect is mitigated to a certain extent. And then we just continue to see improvements in overall performance at our Nava facility. So I think it's just the biggest chunk, maybe the year-over-year re-class. And then beyond that, we are just seeing some kind of expected improvements in total GP.
Caroline Levy: And just fair to say then that the benefit of the weak peso will continue to be felt next year because of hedging?
David Klein: Yes. So we talk about, so we use a three-year hedging program for currency. As I said, we are 70% to 75% hedged on the peso for this fiscal year. Next fiscal year, we usually go into year about 50% of our exposure hedged and then as we roll forward into the 24 and 36 month time horizon, it's lower numbers. So, yes. So assuming that peso stays where it is, we will continue to see benefits coming into our P&L.
Caroline Levy: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. I will now return the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Okay. Well thank you everybody for joining our call today. As we have delivered fantastic results for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, we have never been more confident in our future prospects of our business. We look to capitalize on our business' tremendous momentum as we execute our strategy and continue to build shareholder value. Just as a reminder, during our next quarterly call, which is scheduled for April, we will be providing our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. So thanks again, everybody, for joining our call and have a great rest of your day.
Operator: Thank you for participating in the Constellation Brands third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. At the time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your question. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation’s second quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive, and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectation, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings. Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we continue our practice of limiting each Q&A session participants to two questions. That will help us end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance. And now here is Rob.
Robert Sands: Thanks, Patty. And good morning and welcome to our discussion of Constellation’s second Quarter Fiscal 2017 sales and earnings results. Before I begin a review of the quarter, I'd like to focus your attention on the press release issued earlier today, reporting that we have an agreement to purchase Utah-based High West Distillery for approximately $160 Million. Now, this acquisition includes a portfolio of award-winning, high-end American straight whiskeys and other spirit brands at the greater than $30 retail price point. With the addition of High West to our portfolio, we are entering the profitable high-end craft whiskey market segment. High West sells approximately 70,000 cases annually and has experienced double-digit volume growth for each of the last three years. The portfolio includes four core products – American Prairie Bourbon, Double Rye!, Rendezvous Rye and High West Whiskey Campfire. High West will be an excellent addition to our spirits portfolio as we expect it to bolster our position in the dynamic and growing spirits category. Now, let’s turn to our discussion of our quarterly results, which reflect excellent performance across our businesses, especially our beer business which is significantly outperforming the US beer market and our own expectations. As a matter of fact, during the quarter, Constellation’s beers contributed 60% of the total US beer industry IRI dollar growth, driven by the excellent performance of our top brands. And we remain the number one share gainer in the high-end segment of the US beer market, with double-digit depletion growth of almost 14% for the second quarter. These results were driven by excellent execution by the beer team during the peak summer selling season. Our 120 days of summer marketing campaign drove marketing share gains during the Fourth of July and continued throughout the heart of the summer and into the Labor Day holiday. This performance was led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial, both of which held category-leading positions as the number three and the number two overall brand share gainers, driven by continued distribution and velocity gains from increased marketing investments and consumer demand. Corona Extra continued to air TV campaigns in both national English and Spanish language TV, while making investments in boxing with the launch of limited edition boxing bottles at the end of August. In addition, Corona Extra recently became an official partner of the Los Angeles Rams as the exclusive import beer sponsor and official Cerveza of the team and kicked off the NFL preseason with in-stadium and retail execution end market. During the quarter, we introduced Casa Modelo, a new master brand and portfolio approach for the Modelo family of brands, including Especial, Negra and Chelada. Casa Modelo reestablishes Modelo as an iconic Mexican brewer and allows for more effective cross-promotion and awareness building for each Modelo brand, setting the stage for enhanced product innovation and product line extensions. This new strategy leverages the momentum of Modelo Especial, the fastest-growing major beer in America and the number two imported beer in the US and directly links it to the leadership of its sister Modelo brand, Negra and Chelada. Negra, which has been renamed Modelo Negra, is the number one dark Mexican beer while Modelo Chelada owns nearly 25% share of the Chelada market. With its entire portfolio under one roof, consumers will begin to see a new fall advertising campaign, unified packaging including a fully redesigned look for Modelo Negra, and a new point-of-sale at retail inspired by Modelo’s heritage, tradition and high quality standard. Now, during the second quarter, Casa Modelo continued TV advertising via both national Spanish language TV and national general market TV for Modelo Especial, including a spot supporting Modelo Chelada. I’d also like to highlight the Pacifico brand, which launched TV advertising across 11 Western states, a significant expansion of this type of marketing activity. In addition, the recently launched 24-ounce single serve can continues to gain traction as the number one new item nationally in IRI channels. Our Pacifico marketing investments are obviously paying off as this brand grew depletions more than 20% for the quarter. And let’s not forget about Ballast Point, which continues to be the fastest growing major craft brand in the US and achieved solid high-double-digit depletion growth during the quarter. We continued to expand distribution of Ballast Point brand throughout the US and recently began the build out of a Ballast Point East Cost brewery in Virginia. Operationally, during the quarter, our recently expanded Nava brewery and our supply chain performed well in delivering products supply to support our sales growth during our peak sales period. As you are aware, we've been transitioning directly from our recently completed 20 million hectoliter Nava expansion to our next critical capacity milestone of 25 million hectoliters. This project is progressing extremely well. Last quarter, I mentioned that we have fired up our second blast furnace of the Nava glass plant. I'm proud to report that in less than 90 days, we're producing and packaging quality glass from the furnace at an approved efficiency rate. And finally, construction at our new brewery at Mexicali is picking up momentum, including infrastructure investments to support future capacity expansions. Overall, the strong results of the beer business achieved in the second quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to our EPS guidance for fiscal 2017. We are now targeting EBIT growth for the beer business in the high teens range, which is expected to drive an operating margin of approximately 35% to 36% for the segment in fiscal 2017 versus our previous margin estimate of about 35%. And now I would like to discuss the results for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our wine and spirits business grew earnings and expanded margins while continuing to drive share gains. For our recently acquired premium wine brands, Meiomi and The Prisoner, which posted IRI growth of about 70% and 35% respectively. These premium margin-accretive wine acquisitions have been excellent additions to our portfolio. As a matter of fact, at current growth rates, we are on track for Meiomi to achieve the 1 million case mark this year. And the Wine Spectator recently awarded the 2014 Prisoner a 91-point score, which marks the 5th consecutive vintage that The Prisoner has scored 90 plus points. Our higher-margin-focused brands had an outstanding quarter, posting depletion growth of 9%, driven by Meiomi and Kim Crawford, Black Box, Prisoner, Clos du Bois, The Dreaming Tree, and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. Several of these brands were also recognized as blue-chip brands by Impact Databank as they met the criteria for this award in terms of profitability and by posting several consecutive years of volume growth. As you can see, we are reaping the benefits of our investments in our focus brands, which continued to have excellent growth potential and represent the majority of the revenue and profitability for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our innovation team rolled out new margin-enhancing offerings like Cooper & Thief, a Bourbon Barrel-Aged red blend at the super luxury price point, as well as the Callie collection priced in the super-premium price segment. We're also gaining traction with Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet and Ravage Cabernet, both of which are exceeding their goals so far this year. As we head into the key holiday season, selling season for our wine and spirits business, we will be executing programming designed to ensure that we continue to drive growth, especially for our focus brands. As is typical of this point of this year, I would like to provide an update relative to the California grape harvest, which is currently more than 60% complete and expected to be finished by early November. The current California industry estimate is for a total harvest yield of approximately 4 million tons versus 3.7 million tons last year. The crop is up this year versus last, which is needed to replace inventory levels. The quality looks good to be fantastic with excellent color and flavors. From a pricing perspective, we continue to expect great pricing to increase slightly versus last year, depending on the variety, location, and demand. So, in closing, we're at the halfway point of the year and I am extremely pleased with our impressive results. Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results, while our wine business is gaining share and is on track to meet its goals for the year. And I'm pleased to welcome High West to our family of brands. And we continue to progress as planned with our brewery and glass plant expansions in Mexico. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our second quarter financial results.
David Klein : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As highlighted by Rob, we’re pleased with our impressive results for Q2 and first half of fiscal 2017. Strong execution and smart investments continued to fuel our growth and solidify our leadership position in total beverage alcohol. This is demonstrated by the 17% comparable basis diluted EPS growth we generated during the first half of fiscal 2017. As a result of this performance, we are increasing our full-year comparable basis diluted EPS target to a range of $6.30 to $6.45 versus our previous guidance of $6.05 to $6.35. Looking at our Q2 fiscal 2017 performance in more detail where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results, you can see organic beer net sales increase 15%, primarily due to volume growth of 13% and favorable pricing. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at 14%. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 8%. This primarily reflects 6% volume growth and favorable mix. Our US depletions grew a little more than 3% in Q2. Our US shipment volume outpaced depletions during the first half of fiscal 2017. This is mostly timing related as we expect US shipment volume to generally align with depletion volume for the year. As a result, we expect wine and spirits net sales and EBIT growth in the second half of the year to be lower than the first half, with Q3 net sales expected to be flattish to down slightly and EBIT down further due to anticipated marketing and SG&A investment during the key holiday selling period. Beer operating margin increased 200 basis points to 36.9%. This reflects benefits from pricing, volume, freight and foreign currency. These positive factors were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense, driven by our capacity expansion activities. Wine and spirits operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.8%. The increase was primarily related to favorable volume, COGS and mix, and benefit from the addition of the Meiomi and Prisoner wine brands, partially offset by higher investment in SG&A and marketing. Interest expense for the quarter increased $17 million, primarily due to higher average borrowings. Additionally, during Q2, we recorded an adjustment on our balance sheet related to a prior period for the conversion of $132 million from equity interest into debt for the Nava glass plant JV. As a result, we recognized $7 million of interest expense associated with this debt during Q2. This was offset by an increase in the net loss attributable to non-controlling interest line of our income statement. At the end of Q2, this debt totaled $159 million with an average interest rate of 5.7%. I would also like to note that, at the end of August, we redeemed our $700 million 7.25% senior notes that were coming due in September 2016. This was primarily funded with cash. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of Q2 totaled $7.9 billion, a decrease of $146 million since the end of fiscal 2016. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.4 times at the end of Q2 versus 3.8 times at the end of fiscal 2016. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q2 does not yet reflect a full-year EBITDA benefit from the Ballast Point and Prisoner acquisitions. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.8% versus 24.6% for Q2 last year. Last year’s rate reflected the favorable outcome of various tax items that were effectively settled in connection with IRS examinations. We continue to expect our full year fiscal 2017 effective tax rate to approximate 29%. Now, let’s review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities, less CapEx. For first half of fiscal 17, we generated $676 million of free cash flow compared to $508 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow was above the $1 billion mark, up 30%, driven by our earnings growth. CapEx for the first half of the year was $369 million compared to $295 million for the prior-year period. While our CapEx is up versus last year, it's tracking below our original plan. This primarily reflects some shift in the timing of Nava brewery capital payments into next year. Primarily as a result of this activity, we've lowered full year CapEx guidance by a $125 million to a range of $1.125 to $1.225 billion. The lower CapEx is driving an increase in our fiscal 2017 free cash flow guidance to a range of $375 million to $475 million. Moving to our full year fiscal 2017 P&L outlook, I said earlier that we now expect our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.30 to $6.45. This represents mid to high teen growth versus last year. The increase is being driven by the strong performance of the beer business, which is now targeting net sales growth in the range of 16% to 17%, with organic net sales expected to be in the 12% to 13% range. These sales targets represent the high-end of our previous guidance ranges and includes 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. Operating income growth for the beer business is now expected to be in the high teens. This new guidance now targets our beer operating margins to be in the 35% to 36% range. The improvement versus our previous guidance is primarily being driven by lower depreciation than we originally anticipated and some additional foreign-currency favorability versus our original plan. We are now estimating beer segment depreciation and amortization to be closer to $125 million dollars for fiscal 2017, which is approximately $15 million lower than our original estimate. For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales growth in the mid-single digit range and operating income growth in the mid to high single digit range. In addition, we continue to project organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single digit range. Rob provided highlights of the High West acquisition and I would just add that from a financial perspective, High West generates approximately $25 million in annual sales and we expect minimal financial impact from the transaction for fiscal 2017. I would also note, before closing, that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. In closing, our results for the first half of fiscal 17 have put us on track to achieve another year of strong growth and financial performance and drive growth for the overall total beverage alcohol category. Our focus on strong execution in the marketplace and making investments to support our business positions us to continue to propel future growth. We expect the addition of the High West Distillery and its portfolio of award-winning high-end craft whiskeys will provide us excellent opportunity to strengthen our spirits platform with fast-growing, consumer favored products in an exciting category. With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.
Nik Modi: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So just two quick questions for me. On premise, Rob, maybe you can give us some context on kind of state of the union on premise generally? And then the second question is just when you think about the overall portfolio, obviously, you have a beverage alcohol play here across all the segments. And when you think about the beer industry and a lot of areas that you're actually not competing in today, some of the new areas like cider or spiked seltzer what have you, can you just give us your thought process on how you think about some of those verticals as white space over the coming years? Thanks.
Robert Sands: Sure. First of all, as relates to the on premise, right, I would say that the condition of the on premise remains fairly poor, in that to the extent that it’s measurable, the on premise I think continues to be sort of on the down-ish – slightly down-ish side. For us, our on premise business is very strong. So we’re clearly gaining share in on premise. So while the channel is not performing particularly well, we’re extremely pleased with our performance in the on premise. Then to your second question, Nik, there’s definitely whitespace that we think is very good whitespace that we don't participate in. You mentioned, for instance, the FMB category. That’s a very good category in terms of its premium positioning margins and growth, so that's clearly a subcategory that we’ll be looking at in terms of developing our portfolio for the future. And then secondly, there's other areas of white space. A good example of our filling whitespace in our portfolio is our High West acquisition, right? That has put us in the craft brown spirits, right – American straight whiskey category and that is a fantastic category in terms of growth and margins, which we see no abatement in that trend in any time in the near future. So we've got a great entrant there and we’ll be continuing to look at other areas of whitespace that would be available to us and makes sense in terms of our portfolio and from a synergy perspective, which really anything in beverage alcohol really fits that bill because, obviously, we have strong sales organizations across wine, beer, and spirits and extremely strong distribution networks in wine and spirits and beer. So we’re really in a position to attack anything that meets our criterion in the wine, spirits, and beer business, which is pretty simple, right? High growth and high margin are really the two things that are critical to us.
Nik Modi: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Sands: Hi, Judy.
Judy Hong: Thanks. Hi, good morning. So, first, I guess, on High West, I just wanted to get a sense of how we should think about your ability to really scale up the brand, kind of similar to what you've done with wine acquisitions like Meiomi and Prisoner just in terms of supply, if you can also give us some color on what the supply situation looks like on High West, that would be great. And then just more broadly, as you think about your spirits portfolio, what is sort of your latest thinking in terms of the scale that you would need to really compete effectively in kind of the high-end spirits segment?
Robert Sands: So to your first question, High West, the way to think about how we can scale that up is to look at examples like some of the ones that you pointed out, Meiomi, The Prisoner, growing – both of those growing super high single digits. I think Casa Noble is another great example, right, fastest growing luxury tequila – of any luxury tequila, growing in IRI at 45%. Basically, what we’re able to do with these brands, and we will be able to do with High West, is use our sales organization, our expertise and execution and our extremely strong distribution network to take a brand like a High West and really grow it into something material in the category that it participates in. So I think that we’ll be very successful in scaling that brand. And the brand already has fantastic momentum and it already is of significant size at 70,000 cases. So you apply these kind of high double-digit growth rates for the next several years and you can definitely see this being scaled into a material brand, especially when you think about the price point and the high margins that are associated with the brand and the category. And then – what was the second question?
Judy Hong: The supply situation, High West.
Robert Sands: The supply situation, we don't see any issue there. Obviously, part of our due diligence was making sure that we had the supply to grow the brand. So we didn’t wake up and fall off a log on that one. Obviously, we made sure that we would be able to supply the brand growth going forward.
Judy Hong: Just in terms of your view on how much scale you think would be needed to compete effectively in the high-end spirit, do you think that you’re kind of there and it's really more…?
Robert Sands: Yeah. I don’t think that that’s really a relevant sort of measure. It’s not competing in high-end spirits per se, right? It’s really a brand by brand kind of thing. We’re going to compete and out-compete the competition with the brands that we have. The whole point of sort of our selection process as we make these sort of smaller tuck-in acquisitions is to buy brands that stand on their own and have the momentum to be of a scale to contribute materially to Constellation’s growth and margins. And I am quite confident that High West will be one of those brands as are the other brands in our spirits portfolio. So just like we bought SVEDKA years ago and have grown that to be the second largest vodka in the entire United States and the number one import brand and fundamentally changed the vodka category with that brand, I think that our other spirits additions have a lot of great potential similar to that. So, I guess we don’t really think about the – how do we compete effectively in a whole category. We think about what’s the quality of the brands that we’re buying and how can they contribute to Constellation’s continued stellar growth in the top line and the bottom line.
Brett Cooper: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel.
Robert Sands: Hi, Mark.
Mark Swartzberg: Hey, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Two questions. One on wine and spirits. You had about a $28 million SG&A increase. And, David, you touched on that, but could you give us a little bit more on what was going on there beyond the effect of just factoring in these new businesses? So that's one. And then number two on Nava, what's the capacity there right now and where are we in relation to getting to the 20 million by the end of this fiscal year?
David Klein: So I'll start with the second question first, so in terms of 20 million hectoliters at Nava, we’re producing 20 million hectoliters both from a brewing perspective and a packaging perspective. And, in fact, we’re on our way to our next milestone of 25 million hectoliters. So I would say that the Nava expansion work is on track. We revised our capital spend primarily based upon outflows related to Nava for this fiscal year. That’s just simply a timing thing as we manage our way through the build-out process and manage our cash flow. So then on the wine and spirits SG&A number, it really is just incremental spend in investment areas within our wine and spirits business, like marketing, innovation and having the right talent on board for our wine business.
Mark Swartzberg: Okay. It’s a little vague to me. Could you give a little more on that?
Robert Sands: This is Rob. Look, the virtuous cycle. Our performance enables us to invest more in our businesses, in particular our wine and spirits business, which is now driving significant growth in that business and enabling us to both leverage the P&L and achieve market share growth as our focus brands are now growing at a rate that more than offsets the decline in our tail brands, which are in categories which are fundamentally not growing. So we’re over-investing. And when I say over-investing, I mean we’re investing more than we have traditionally, specifically in marketing of our wine and spirits brands. And so, what you're seeing is advertising campaigns that we've initiated to drive brands like Kim Crawford. We’ve got tests going on in various states like Taxes, for instance, to really have a consumer way type advertising program like Kim Crawford to see how that drives the brands, which by the way is driving the brand fantastically and I think that we’re proving that our investments in media advertising, on wine, on brands by Kim Crawford and – Woodbridge is another one that we really have beat up our advertising on, that these are paying back at a rapid rate, meaning a rate greater than what you traditionally see in consumer products, which is very similar to our beer brands, in particular Corona and Modelo Especial, where we see sort of the payback rates on our advertising activities at a much faster rate than what would typically be seen in consumer products. So we’re both testing what we can do through marketing and we’re increasing marketing where we know that it already works. So, hopefully, [indiscernible].
Mark Swartzberg: It’s helpful and encouraging.
Robert Sands: It is encouraging. It’s super encouraging as a matter of fact.
David Klein: I would also want to point you, Mark, to – we still believe in, and it’s implied in our guidance, that we’re going to get leverage from net sales to EBIT in our wine and spirits business, despite a spending increase.
Robert Sands: And share gains.
Mark Swartzberg: That’s great. It’s helpful. And just plain encouraging. All right. Thank you, gentlemen.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research.
Tim Ramey: Thanks so much. Good morning. David, you mentioned that the tax rate would come in at 29%, I think, you said for the full year, which implies a pretty low rate for the 3Q and 4Q. Is there anything lumpy about the split between those quarters, so that we don't get our estimates too confounded here.
David Klein: No, I think as is always with tax planning, I'm sure anything I say will be wrong, but I would suspect that the way we have our initiatives planned over the rest of the year, you can expect it will be roughly flat to bring you around to that – between the quarters to bring you to that 29% guidance.
Tim Ramey: Got it, okay. And, Rob, as you pointed out quite rightly, your wine business has been pretty dramatically outperforming, but the category has been pretty good too. How would you describe the category outlook? Are we still in kind of an acceleration mode or just sort of growth is stable, but okay?
Robert Sands: Well, I think the category is performing very well. I think that we’ll continue to see sort of mid-single digit volume type growth in the category, right? And I think that we’ll see the spread between volume and sales and, therefore, premiumization in trade, I think we’ll continue to see that grow. I think we’re a real shift, whereas five years ago we were sort of talking, what they used to call, the super-premium category, which was the $8 to $12 range, is really being the hot and premium segment of the industry. We’re seeing a definitive shift up in that regard. And, now, you’re sort of seeing this $15-$25 segment really coming on strong, as well as segments above that. So this is what is driving the wrong of brands like Meiomi, which are about $20 a bottle, or even Prisoner, closer to $40 a bottle, is this premiumization trend, which we think is going to continue unabated in certainly the mid-term. So I’d say that the outlook for the category continues to be extremely positive.
Tim Ramey: Just relative to the crop, generally, when we get a bigger crop, as it looks like we might this year, that does put some pressure on bulk line prices, which I would think might have good impacts on brands like Mark West, not right away, but perhaps for fiscal 2018, any thoughts on the state of bulk line and some of the brands that are sourced from bulk line?
Robert Sands: Yeah. Look, a bigger crop is – definitely bodes well for lower prices. Supply, especially like you mentioned Mark West for pinot can be tight, so larger crop is going to be better all the way around. Could there still be a little price – a little cost inflation associated with it? Yeah. But we’re – as typical, we just don't see cost inflation on the wine side of the business as being a big material factor in driving anything. We're expecting very normalized, pretty low cost inflation that we’ll be able to pass on one way or another. So we don't see it impacting margins. And as I said, the bigger crop is a positive thing, yes. That will even help that. So it’s a good thing.
Tim Ramey: Thanks so much. Congratulations.
Robert Sands: [indiscernible] cost.
Tim Ramey: Yep.
Robert Sands: Sure, Tim.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.
Caroline Levy: Good morning. Thank you very much. I was just wondering, David, if you could walk us through again the moving parts for margins in beers and also in wine in the back half because you did chart a lot of different things that were favorable in the first half and then some kind of spending. But it would be really helpful, the peso, the depreciation, all those things, if you could just run through that.
David Klein: Yes. So as we said, the real change in our guidance was driven by a move in the peso and slower ramp-up of the depreciation charge into the business. Right? So that explains why we slid our guidance up a little bit. So that's the first bit. I would say, in the second half, we really would expect that gross margins would be flattish to the first half. We would expect that our marketing spend, which we say is between the 8.5% to 9% of net sales, that will be flattish in the second half. However, a big chunk of that will be spent in Q3 versus in Q4. So there’ll be a little bit of volatility in that. And then when you get to the remainder of SG&A, if you think about as SG&A in a growing business, you start out and say, well, if you’re not going to grow it at all, it’s going to be straight line throughout the year. And in our business, SG&A is actually growing a little bit because the business is growing. And it's really that SG&A drag, which you’re going to see affecting the beer margins in the second half.
Caroline Levy: Is that depreciation? Is it a bit of a catchup versus the first half not being up?
David Klein: Yeah. When we get into the second half, you start to have more depreciation come on line. You get a little bit more noise on line commissioning. You have less throughput at the plant. So there are a lot of puts and takes, I would say, in the second half. But as I said, I would still expect that our gross margins in beer will remain somewhat consistent. And then, our wine – for the most part, our wine expansion in the US has been driven by mix, and mix in the form of non-organic such as Meiomi and the Prisoner, but also mix within our base portfolio has improved as well or our organic portfolio has improved as well. In addition to that, we have had some benefits from freight savings in the US on wine. But I would say that we would expect wine margin trends to remain somewhat consistent in the second half, although as I called out in my script we can expect that since over the course of the year shipments will roughly equal depletions that will have a slowdown in the shipments line in the second half, even though consumer pull continues to be very strong and depletions will continue to be healthy.
Caroline Levy: Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.
Bill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. I may have missed, but can you give us maybe some update on the Canadian wine business in terms of decisions to IPO versus for divestiture? And the reason I ask that is, I would've thought if we were in a process for sale that you would have maybe separated the revenue out as available-for-sale and not be part of the numbers. So I'm just trying to – any update and kind of thought process or where that process stands?
David Klein: So I'll start out and then Rob can add some color. So where we are from an internal standpoint is we’re still evaluating the IPO route and I would say that in the last quarter we finished our carve-out statements, which I will admit took longer than we had expected when we first started the process. And then beyond that, I would say that as we do with every decision the company has to make, we consider all of our alternatives, but as of this moment we’re still doing the work to prepare for an IPO.
Bill Chappell: Okay.
Robert Sands: Yeah. I guess I would only add that as we have sort of gone down the IPO, right, the myriad of opportunities relative to the Canadian business are numerous. So we are in the process of evaluating all of the opportunities that are available to us and I would venture to say that we’ll have something to say about all of that in the relatively near future when, I would say, our decisioning and the opportunities crystallize. So as I said, more to come on that in the relatively near future. All very positive, though.
Bill Chappell: Good to hear. Good to hear. And a follow-up on the whiskey side, just kind of future plans of – whiskey can be segmented with a lot of brands, stand for a lot of different things, including I'm sure Old West. Do you look to add a variety of brands to build up the portfolio or do you really wanted to get behind Old West for the near-term?
Robert Sands: We’ll look at other brands as they become available. We’re really kind of attacking, I'll say, whiskey from a couple of different perspectives, right? So number one, we bought High West in its entirety and, in essence, we’ll be integrating that into the Constellation wine and spirits platform, albeit we will be keeping and utilizing the resources that High West already has, which is the one of the attractive things about that particular acquisition. And then, on the Ventures side of the business, we’ve made an investment in – we’ve made an investment in another Bourbon brand, the Greenbrier company which currently has released its Belle Meade brand of American straight whiskey, right, Bourbon and will be introducing other brands as they continue to distill and age the whiskey. So that was a minority investment on the Green Brier side. We think that’s got some real attractiveness as well. So we’re able to help them out more as a minority partner and on a consultation perspective. And then on the High West side, as I side, we’ve taken full ownership of that and will be in essence integrating that into our wine and spirits platform. So we will continue to look at the category and look at it both through our Constellation Ventures lens as well as our normal sort of M&A lens.
Bill Chappell: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.
Robert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much and then congratulations on another terrific quarter.
Robert Ottenstein: Thanks.
Robert Ottenstein: So in terms of the High West, can you talk to us a little bit about the product’s brand proposition, what makes the brand attractive, why you think it has a national appeal? And then separate – or related to that, just kind of the thinking about actually buying the brand and the business in total as opposed to having a distribution agreement, in which you distribute the product for them and take a nice payment for the ability to use your system as opposed to buying it straight out?
Robert Sands: Yeah. So in terms of the brand and the proposition, we think that the brand, number one, has a great image. The proposition is all about the founders of the company going into the business before bourbon and rye had reached the level – craft bourbon and rye, in particular, reached the level of popularity that it has today. They took a view that much like the Scotch whiskey category, that sort of a combination of distilling and aging their own whiskey and then combining that with blending could create a product that was really superior, so that they did create those products. And I'll say through the expertise of master blenders that they brought in created a product that really appeals to the luxury American straight whiskey and bourbon and rye consumer and was able therefore to take advantage the whole sort of craft trend in that area. So we think it’s a relatively unique proposition and that certainly is reflecting itself in the way that the company has been able to grow the brand and we think that we’re going to be able to really take that platform and accelerate. Distribution agreements, we have no interest in whatsoever, okay? Number one, you don’t own the brand. Number two, distribution agreements are short term. Nobody is going to sign up and give you distribution rights for a life. Number three, distribution margins are small relative to the kind of margins that we at Constellation generate through our owned brand portfolio and certainly the type of margins that we’re talking about on luxury spirits. So we don't have really any interest at all in distribution, low margin, short-term distribution agreements that would utilize probably one of our most valuable assets, which is our sales and marketing organization. So we don't see distribution arrangements as an add-on for the future. As I said, way, way, way too low margin and no brand equity related there too.
Robert Ottenstein: Terrific. Very clear. And then just on the beer side, could you please give us an update in terms of where things stand on various draft initiatives. There’s a lot of talk about that a year ago and maybe where you are in terms of rolling out – I think it was mostly Corona Light in terms of how you’re doing with tap handles penetration, what sort of growth and size of that business today versus a year or two ago?
Robert Sands: Yeah. Draft is going to fantastically. The bottom line there, our total draft volume increased 30%, for example, in the second quarter. It’s a significant contributor to our growth. Most of that growth was driven by Modelo Especial draft, for instance, was up almost 50% year-on-year and we're seeing these kind of positive trends across our whole draft portfolio. So draft, which was something that we almost didn’t participate in at all, and nevertheless a significant segment of the beer industry, is another area that’s – we’re sort of infantile, but will contribute significant growth to the business going forward. So we're very excited about the draft proposition. We’ve been running tests with Corona draft. Obviously, Corona Light draft is an area that is also providing growth to the company. So nothing, but up there.
Robert Ottenstein: That’s great. And just what percentage of your business now is draft and where do you think it could go?
Robert Sands: It’s small. And I think that it could start eventually to reflect the industry on amount. So, for us, it’s less than 5% and for the industry I think it’s closer to 15% to 20%, something like that.
Robert Ottenstein: Thank you very much.
Robert Sands: 10% to 15%.
Robert Ottenstein: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: Good morning.
Robert Sands: Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog: Hi. I just wanted to follow-up a bit on wine pricing opportunities which you touched on. Clearly, you’re driving a premiumization of your portfolio with your recent acquisition. But I guess – I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about potential pricing opportunities you have with some of your larger brands such as Mondavi which has generally seen price deflation over the last several years?
David Klein: So we’re beginning – we’re maybe three years into a pricing journey in our wine business where we’re trying to apply the same sort of pricing discipline that we apply to our beer business on a year-in and year-out basis. And I would say that, so far, wins have really been at the low end of the portfolio and at the luxury end of the portfolio. But we do believe that over time that we will continue to get pricing opportunities across the portfolio, right? So this will be the third year we’ve taken price in various brands in our wine portfolio and this will be the year where we have the biggest effect of those price increases. But I would say that we’re just beginning that journey. I would also say that we’re – you’re also seeing some ability to take price in certain segments of the wine category that haven’t taken price in the past. So we remain cautiously optimistic, but we need to get some wins behind us before we want to talk about that much more.
Robert Sands: I would just point out just a couple of interesting statistics which we track which is, if you look at IRI and year-to-date pricing for the top 20, we call premium SKUs, the percent change – now this is excluding Constellation, the top – the percent change versus a year ago is about 1.3%, okay? And then if you looked at year-to-date pricing for our top ten SKUs in the premium category, meaning Woodbridge and above, we’re at plus 3.5%. So I think that the sort of journey that David was talking about is reflecting itself and working relatively well at the current time.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay, that makes sense. And then just one final question on Corona cans. Could you just update us on the progress you’ve made with your cans and then maybe touch on your penetration or ACV and consumer acceptance?
David Klein: So we continue to see can grow. So as a percentage of Corona extra sales, they’re still around 6%. But we saw – from a depletion standpoint, we saw high teens growth in cans for depletions in the quarter. So we continue to see increasing consumer uptake of the brand. And I would say that from an ACV perspective, our cans are not distributed anywhere near the level of kind of the total 80 ACV that brand Corona as distributed out. So we think there’s still a lot more runway for that.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.
Stephen Powers: Great, thanks. Maybe first, David, just any color on what drove the CapEx shift into 2018? And then back to [indiscernible] in beer, should we expect that too to kind of ramp and catch-up in fiscal 2018, commensurate with the CapEx moving?
David Klein: So as we indicated earlier, I just want to reiterate, we are on track with all of our buildout activity. I would say that it just – we have a multi-billion-dollar activity going on in Mexico and it's really difficult to forecast to get the actual dollar amounts of cash payments nailed down to a specific quarter. So I think we’re seeing a little bit of that going on. And so, anything that slips out of this year we can expect will end up coming through our cash flow statement in FY 2018. And in terms of depreciation and amortization, in my comments earlier, I said that we would be at $125 million of depreciation and amortization for the beer business. That will, just by definition, that growth from about $65 million last year to $125 million this year, that will be somewhat back-end loaded, just given the fact that we’re behind a little bit on a year-to-date basis.
Stephen Powers: Okay.
David Klein: The other thing, I think, to keep in mind now is that, as I also indicated, we would expect that our margins – our gross margins in beer will remain roughly flat first half to second half. So there are just a whole bunch of moving pieces there, depreciation just being one of them.
Stephen Powers: Okay. Okay, fair enough. And then separately, I was wondering if you could comment a bit more on the response to recent marketing, especially in Modelo. You’ve mentioned earlier, it’s a great payback on that. And, obviously, we see the business results. I just wonder if there are any other ways that you can underneath that mess [ph] of the ROI on these marketing investments, whether in terms real time or relatively real time increases in brand equity or other indicators that give you confidence about the longevity of the ROI related to this investment. Thanks.
David Klein: Yeah. So this is something that we spend a fair amount of time on and I would say that our team is outstanding at understanding the returns they’re getting from their marketing investments. And we continue to see payback from our investment in Model Especial. Let me give you an example. When we were talking about our thoughts for the second quarter at the end of the first quarter, we actually thought that we would see a spike in marketing spend in Q2. We did spend more in marketing. But as a percentage of sales, it ended up being in line with our projections simply because we got a significant short-term payback from that investment. So we continue to monitor that on an ongoing basis and that’s our work on the beer side. And as Rob talked about the marketing investment on the wine piece of our business, we’re bringing that same rigor to marketing spend in wine.
Stephen Powers: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research.
Brett Cooper: Hi, guys. Thanks. I just wanted to ask you on shelf placements, retailer acceptance as we get into fall shelf resets, what you guys have seen? I have heard kind of rumblings that craft has lost some space and you guys in F&B may have picked up. Just wondering if you could give any color.
Robert Sands: Yeah. I think that there's some truth to that. We’re certainly trying to drive that trend through our category management efforts. I would say that, as a general proposition, we probably think craft is over SKU-ed and over-spaced. And imports – given the importance in the growth, high-end imports are under-SKU-ed and under-spaced. And premium domestics are way over-SKU-ed and over-spaced. That’s something that we spend a lot of time sort of thinking about, which is assortment in the high end especially, and I think we’re in a very strong position to advise our retail customer through our category management initiatives as to ways that they can improve their velocity as well as their profit per-unit space that they’re devoting to beer. So that's a big part of what we’re doing. And I think the trend that you’re alluding to is definitely occurring. And I think that that bodes really well for us in a couple of areas. Craft, even though you are going to see some shake out there, I think that what will also occur there simultaneously is that the bigger, stronger, faster growing brands like Ballast Point will and should be given more space, more SKUs sort of for the obvious reason because it's moving and it’s highly, highly profitable. And I think that you can say the same about imports because it’s going to become obvious to the retailer that that’s the best way to maximize, as I say, their velocity and profitability for the unit space that they’re devoting to the category. The trend you mentioned is occurring and it bodes extremely well for our entire beer business because we only play in craft and the high end.
Brett Cooper: Thanks. And if I can follow-up on pricing, from the data that we see, your pricing is going up much – or going up more than we’re seeing from others. As you head into, I guess, calendar 2017, thoughts on expanding price gaps, given that you guys continue to drive some meaningful share gains.
Robert Sands: Yeah. I'm not sure that our price is really going up more than others. It’s going up to the extent that we’re taking pricing. We’re right in line with sort of the typical, I’d say, inflationary increase that occurs every year and we continue to look at it on a market by market basis. We’re probably under the 2% when we combine everything, sort of between 1% and 2%. I would say that that's normal just to keep up with the pace of – with cost of goods and inflation and so on and so forth. So nothing different, I would say, is occurring on the pricing front – period – industrywide from what we can see.
Brett Cooper: Great, thanks.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse.
Laurent Grandet: Good morning, everyone. Great quarter. Congrats, guys. I’ve got a question regarding Ballast Point. You previously stated that – a goal to have Ballast in 50 states by the calendar year-end. Where are you on this progress? And still on Ballast Point, it seems like the growth is coming from ACV – it’s coming from, sorry, distribution and ACV, what about the velocity and same-store sales. It seems to be flat to us. So what are you doing to increase the repeat purchase here, which would be critical for that brand?
David Klein: So, first of all, on distribution, the brand is in 43 states, plus D.C., and we continue to plan to expand that for the remainder of the year. And as it relates to what sort of runway we have on distribution, it’s a brand that has an ACV of, say, in the low 20s versus some other major crafts that are more in the mid – low to mid 60s, right? So we think that there's a lot of opportunity on the distribution front. And I would say, as it relates to just overall velocity, I think we have a little bit of an effect as we grow points of distribution that we’re driving down our own brand’s velocity. But we continue to be pleased with the brand, as Rob mentioned. We’ve got depletions that are up 40% on a year-to-date basis. We have – we’re very pleased with where we are from a profitability standpoint, as we continue to get leverage in the production environment at Ballast Point. So we’re just generally very happy with where we are with Ballast Point.
Laurent Grandet: Got it. Thank you. And last one, final, on Ballast, if I may. What would you say to those who said that, with Ballast Point management team leaving, you lost some kind of know-how and craft credentials?
Robert Sands: Yeah. I guess I’d say I think it’s the opposite. I think that team certainly had some knowledge and credentials, but I don't think that they have anywhere near the level of the of sophistication and knowledge, okay, that the team that we supplanted them with has. First of all, as far as that team goes, okay, we replaced the CEO with Marty Birkel, who is the guy who ran national sales for our beer business for eight years and probably the fastest growth period in our entire beer business and, therefore, is really one of the stars in the beer business – period – and also was our sales president for our wine and spirits business as well for many years. He brings a level of knowledge and expertise in growing brands and in wholesale and distributor relations and sales execution that far exceeds what the previous management team had. And then if you look at the sales side of the business, we replaced the sales guys with the number two sales guy that was heading California already at Ballast Point. And California represented a very large proportion of the business and this is the guy that was driving that portion of the business. And then the other changes aren’t going to have any real commercial effect on the business. So I would say, if anything, we’re really excited about the changes that have been made and we think that it is going to lead to even stronger results on Ballast Point as it grows into a much larger business and needs a degree of professionalism that I don’t think that the old management team could bring. And then as it relates to the products itself, we have the same production team, the same expertise in the making, what really is, the highest quality and most award-winning craft beer brand of any size in the country. And they're just – they’re going about their business and doing what they've done in the past and they are probably doing it better than they’ve ever done it before. So there's a lot of really exciting stuff. And then sort of culturally, everybody is acutely aware of the type of culture that needs to be maintained in sort of that fast-moving, craft type business where it’s important to continue to proliferate new products and new types that the consumer is really interested in, that particular craft consumer. So I don't think that we’re going to see anything lost there. We’re very optimistic and very pleased with the changes that we’ve made.
Laurent Grandet: Thank you very much for your candid response. Thank you.
Operator: That was our final question. Now, I’d like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.
Robert Sands: All right. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining our call today. And as we close out the discussion of our second quarter results, I want to reiterate that I am extremely pleased with our performance and our accomplishments for the first half of the year. [indiscernible] our new guidance reflects the confidence that we have in our ability to execute in the second half. Now, we look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming New York City Investor Meeting scheduled for November 9. At that time, we plan to outline Constellation’s strategic business initiatives and outlook for the future. So thanks again and have a great rest of your day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands’ First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Constellation’s first quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. I’m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the Company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. Although statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the Company’s estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings. Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we limit the number of questions asked during the Q&A session today to two questions per person. This has been our practice for the last several quarters and helps us end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance and now here is Rob.
Rob Sands: Thank you Patty and good morning, and welcome to our discussion of Constellation’s first quarter fiscal 2017 sales and earnings results. We are off to a great start to our new fiscal year with sales and earnings up double digits. Across the business, we’re seeing the results of our efforts to drive consumer demand for premium products through best in class marketing and sales execution while improving margins through financial discipline and a focus on core premium products. This combined with the successful integration of and growth from our recently acquired brands provides a healthy foundation for achieving our fiscal 2017 objectives. Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results while expanding their operational footprint with planned capital investments in Mexico. During the quarter, the beer business generated depletion growth of almost 10% and was the number one share gainer in the high-end segment of the US beer business. Constellation's beer portfolio lead volume gains amongst US brewers contributing almost 20% of category dollar growth during the quarter as each brand in our Mexican beer portfolio grew across most channels and packages. Corona Extra and Modelo Especial remained two of the hottest brands in the US beer industry and held category leading positions as the number three and number two players respectively among overall brand share gainers. These results are due in part to focused market execution as well as optimization of key marketing and advertising initiatives. We launched fresh new Spanish and English language national television advertising for the Corona Extra brand and can format including the brand's first ever boxing TV ad. New national TV advertising was also launched for Modelo Especial in English and Spanish, and for the Modelo Especial Chelada in Spanish, both of which continued to have double-digit growth and are among the fastest growing brands in the category. Our new Pacifico 24 ounce can format is the number one new import so far in 2016, and we are supporting the brand by expanding targeted television advertising. Pacifico grew depletions more than 15% for the quarter. And last but certainly not least, let’s not forget about Ballast Point, which continues to be the fastest growing major craft brand in the US posting depletion growth of more than 60% in the first quarter. As you know our plan for Ballast Point this year is to expand distribution and make the brand available in all 50 states. And to-date, we now have distribution in more than 40 states and expect to complete our overall goal sometime before calendar yearend. This distribution push along with successful new flavor and style launches is expected to deliver the strong double-digit growth we are targeting for Ballast Point in fiscal 2017. It was recently announced that we plan to establish a Ballast Point Brewery in Virginia. This will allow us to develop an East Coast presence to provide the best quality, freshest craft beer to all of our customers. I’d now like to take a minute to discuss recently published IRI and Nielsen consumer takeaway data for our beer business as there seems to be significant discussion and debate related to the growth trends for some of our brands. First, IRI channels represent about 50% of our overall beer business at retail and therefore provide only a partial picture of the brand and portfolio performance outside of the sales, shipment, and depletion results we report every quarter. Within IRI channels, over the last quarter, we’ve seen significant variability from week to week. Much of this relates to year over year timing and selling day comparison issues for important holidays during the quarter including Cinco and Memorial Day. We saw some impact from our fiscal 2016 fourth-quarter recall of certain Corona Extra packages which created temporary product shortages in select areas. We also experienced pockets of poor weather, especially in the Northeast, and we’re cycling very strong Corona Extra can growth following last year's first quarter intro of the can format for this brand. Despite these temporary headwinds, our recent brand health assessment for Corona Extra indicates that consistent or increased drinking on key brand health scores nationally since fiscal 2016. While consumer takeaway is a standard measurement, depletions represent our entire business are an even more comprehensive indicator of growth in health. I'm very proud of our nearly double-digit beer depletion growth trend for the first quarter given some of the factors I just mentioned. And preliminary beer depletion results for the month of June are progressing in line with our forecast. We anticipate similar timing issues around the upcoming key holidays in the second quarter related to the July 4 and Labor Day weekends. Operationally, during the quarter, we completed a significant expansion milestone at Nava by doubling the size of the brewery that we acquired and bringing annual production capacity to 20 million hectoliters. All support areas are in place for this added capacity including packaging, utilities, warehouse, and rail infrastructure. As many of you are aware, the expansion of the Nava brewery to 25 million hectoliters is our next critical capacity milestone, and I'm pleased to report that this work is proceeding as scheduled. In addition, we've officially broken ground at Mexicali and although this project is in the early phase, it is also progressing as planned. Finally, we recently fired up our second furnace at our Nava glass plant and expected it will be producing glass shortly. As a reminder, it takes several months for a new furnace to ramp up in order to produce optimal capacity. And now I would like to focus on the operational results for a wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our wine and spirits business grew earnings and expanded margins while successfully integrating and growing our newly acquired premium wine brands Meiomi and The Prisoner which posted IRI dollar growth of about 90% and 30% respectively. Since the acquisition of The Prisoner, Constellation has gained 2 share points in the IRI luxury plus segment extending the lead in our number one luxury plus position. Constellation is now ranked number three in super luxury wine at the greater than $25 retail price point. The US wine business posted strong sales growth and gained IRI dollar share driven by our core focus brands where we are building momentum across multiple price segments. Let me provide a few examples, in the IRI $20 plus luxury and super luxury price segments combined, Meiomi is not only the largest Pinot Noir but also the largest dollar share gainer for the entire quarter. Kim Crawford is the number one Sauvignon Blanc in the IRI super premium segment and posted dollar sales growth of more than 20% during the quarter. Clos du Bois is the number one chardonnay in the IRI premium segment, and Black Box is the leader in the fast growing premium box segment. In aggregate, our Focus Brands grew depletions at 12% for the quarter. Our innovation platform is also gaining traction thanks to new margin enhancing offerings like the Robert Mondavi Private Selection Bourbon Barrel Aged Cabernet, SVEDKA Cucumber Lime, Ruffino Sparkling Rosé and Ravage Cabernet Sauvignon. The Canadian business delivered a solid quarter posting mid-single digit net sales growth while continuing to gain market share across both the import and domestic line segments. Overall, our first quarter wine and spirits results are a testament to our ability to achieve our goal of growing profits ahead of sales and improving margins. So what are the key enablers? We are reaping the benefits of our targeted investments for a subset of our focused brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and greater growth potential. We remain committed to mix and margin accretive innovation and new product development have several new products in the hopper a few of which I just mentioned. We continue to optimize COGS through global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements and lower grape costs. We are capitalizing on the market leading growth of our margin enhancing wine acquisitions Meiomi and The Prisoner and we have recently made some leadership changes within wine and spirits to enable a stronger, more competitive business.  Now before I turn the call over to David, I would like to touch on two more high-level topics of interest for our business. So first is related to the exploration of a possible IPO of our Canadian business discussed last quarter. Our evaluation of this strategic option continues and we plan to provide you with an update as soon as possible. Since this evaluation is ongoing there is not much else to add at this time. The second is the recent referendum in favor of the UK exiting the European Union. As a reminder, Constellation is primarily a US business. Our sales outside the US represent about 10% of our total consolidated sales and are primarily related to our Canada business. As such, our exposure to European markets in particular is limited and a strong dollar generally benefits us financially. In closing, our first-quarter results have set the stage for fiscal 2017. We are off to a very positive start for the year gaining market share across our beer and wine businesses. We have been working diligently to build a solid and sustainable foundation of operational excellence, financial strength and innovation. And we expect to continue to execute on these areas throughout the remainder of the year. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David who will review our first-quarter financial results.
David Klein: Thank you Rob and good morning everyone. On the last call we provided guidance which represented an impressive mid teens EPS growth. I’m happy to report that we’re steadily executing against our plans. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $1.54, up 22% putting us on a path to achieve our full-year comparable basis diluted EPS goal of $6.05 to $6.35 per share. Let's look at Q1 fiscal ‘17 performance in more detail where I’ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Organic beer net sales increased 15% primarily due to organic volume growth of 12% and favorable pricing. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at almost 10%; this includes Ballast Point depletions for the quarter and in the corresponding period last year. Excluding Ballast Point, depletions for our Mexican portfolio grew 9%. Beer shipment volume for the first quarter generally runs ahead of depletion volume as distributors build inventory for the summer selling season. This year, we also benefited from a shift in shipment volume from Q4 fiscal ‘16 into Q1 fiscal ‘17 related to the beer recall we discussed last quarter. Distributor inventory days at the end of Q1 fiscal ‘17 were fairly level with the prior year quarter. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%; this primarily reflects volume growth and favorable mix for the segment driven by solid financial results for the organic US wine business in the quarter. Beer operating margin increased 80 basis points to 35.6%, this reflects benefits from pricing, foreign currency and timing of marketing spend for our Mexican portfolio. As expected these positive factors were partially offset by higher COGS, including increased depreciation as additional capacity came online, SG&A investments and the consolidation of Ballast Point. If you exclude the marketing timing benefit, beer operating margins for the quarter would have been flattish to up slightly. I’d also like to note we've reduced the level of product we received under the interim supply agreement with ADI as Nava has reached the 20 million hectoliter capacity milestone. Wine and spirits operating margin improved 160 basis points to 23.3%. the increase was primarily related to the benefit from the Meiomi acquisition. Interest expense for the quarter increased 9%, primarily due to higher average borrowings. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $8.1 billion, an increase of $143 million since the end of fiscal ‘16. This increase primarily reflects funding for The Prisoner acquisition, which closed at the end of April, partially offset by our free cash flow generation. Our net to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.7 times at the end of Q1 fiscal ‘17 versus 3.8 times at the end of fiscal ‘16. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q1 does not yet reflect a full year EBITDA benefit from the Ballast Point, Meiomi and Prisoner acquisitions. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.6%, which is essentially even with Q1 of last year. We anticipate that our Q2 fiscal ‘17 effective tax rate will be similar to the Q1 rate. However, we continue to expect our full year fiscal ‘17 effective tax rate to approximate 29%.  Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated $177 million of free cash flow compared to $76 million for Q1 last year. Operating cash flow totaled $346 million, up 68%. This increase was primarily driven by our earnings growth. CapEx for the quarter was $169 million compared to $130 million for Q1 last year. While CapEx was up for the quarter, we still have significant spending plan for the balance of the year as our full-year CapEx guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion remain unchanged. As a reminder, this guidance includes approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion related to our beer business operational expansion projects in Mexico. We continue to expect fiscal ‘17 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and the CapEx spend that I just outlined. Moving to our full year fiscal ’17 P&L outlook, we continue to project our comparable basis EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.35. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments which are detailed in the release. The beer business continues to target net sales and operating income growth in the range of 14% to 17%. We also continue to expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. This includes 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales growth in the mid-single digit range and operating income growth in the mid-to-high single digit range. In addition, we continue to project organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low-to-mid single digit range with operating income growth targeted ahead of sales growth as we are forecasting some mix benefits. In closing we are off to a great start to the year and on track to achieve our financial performance goals for fiscal ‘17. While we still have much to accomplish with our Mexican brewing operations, we are excited that we achieve the critical milestone by reaching the $20 million hectoliter capacity mark at Nava. With that Rob and I are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Market.
Nik Modi: Just a quick question on the wine business. The depletion growth looked pretty good on the organic side, and I know you talked about a lot of brands growing, but what exactly is underpinning some of the improvement there. Maybe you can share some of the early things that Bill Newlands is doing in that business. And then just a quick follow-up, just wanted to get an update on how the Kim Crawford test is doing out in Texas, I believe you guys are spending some marketing dollars behind that brand, and just wanted to get kind of an update on that? Thanks.
Rob Sands: Yes so, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, it's really a subset of our Focus Brand that are driving that depletion growth that is excluding our newly acquired brands, Meiomi and The Prisoner, but we've got a few brands right now that are really on fire like Black Box, Clos du Bois is up heavy double-digits. Kim Crawford is up very significantly and even our largest brand which is Robert Mondavi, the Woodbridge brand is up very significantly on a very large base. The Mark West brand, the Pinot Noir brand that we acquired a few years ago is also up very sharply. So, I guess that we are - it’s fortunate that we can report that our brand portfolio includes some really hot brands at the moment. What was your question about Texas, Nik?
Nik Modi: Just the Kim Crawford tests, just looking at how that's progressing.
Rob Sands: That test has gone extremely well, I think that the test has demonstrated that the brand responds and performs very well to advertising. And consequently, we will be increasing our advertising for this brand. And the test was basically - the test basically demonstrates that’s an investment that will more than pay back, so we're pretty excited about that as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group.
Tim Ramey: You mentioned the FX impact, and I think of all the things that you buy from other places in the world not just beer, but barrels and so on. We've had some pretty substantial moves particularly against the peso, I wonder if you could kind of give us any quantification about what that contribution might look like now?
David Klein: Yes, so Tim, as it relates specifically to the peso, about 20% of our COGS for beer are denominated in peso. And so, clearly as the dollar strengthens, we get a benefit, what I’ll say though is that we also as we sit here today we are about 70% to 75% hedged on our exposures against all currencies for the remainder of the fiscal year. So, the strengthening dollar clearly benefits us, but some of that benefit is muted by the hedges that we have in place.
Tim Ramey: Okay, and Rob maybe you're always good at commentating on the kind of the big picture in wine, I think the category is performing well and you’re outperforming the category. How do you see that performing for maybe the 12 to 18 months time horizon?
Rob Sands: I thing actually the category as you mentioned has accelerated about lately and therefore I would say that it's very robust. I would say that trading of at premiumization in the category is probably stronger than ever, okay and things have really kind of shifted, maybe two or three years ago we would have been talking about the $8 to $10 to $12 segment really being the hottest segment in the industry, but I would say that that shifted up to even the $15 and $20 segments hence are interested in brands like Meiomi and Prisoner and that segment because I think we really see the future continuing to favor the premiumization and trading up even into these more expensive categories. And then as it relates to our own business, we’re constantly working on positioning our portfolio, okay to take advantage of those trends. And I think that we’ve very successfully done that and have great brands in all of these hot price segments and categories, and it's not just price segments, right, it’s categories. Perfect example being Pinot Noir, okay, we are a leader in Pinot Noir today and Pinot Noir is just an extremely hot varietal, and I would say that the good news there is that I would say we expect it to continue to be a hot varietal for, you know, well into the future in that, it is not a trendy kind of a thing that will be fleeting in there of course Pinot Noir is one of the noble varieties and has always been highly sought after. And we - and as I said we get the hottest brand, red blends continue to be hot as you know we've got hot brands in the red blend category, I mean, Prisoner I mean is a perfect example of that albeit a newly acquired brand but you only have to go and sort of see what people are drinking in any major metropolitan area or talk to people and Prisoner is the hottest brand in its price point and has taken advantage of that as well. And again, I don't think that's particularly trendy and that it’s gotten fantastic scores and it’s considered to be, you know, let me put it this way, a real fine wine, so this is basically the answer to your question, Tim.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: So, first of all in terms of the beer depletion, Rob as you pointed out pretty choppy weather and some other factors in the first quarter. So when you looked at your 9% depletion for the core organic, you can kind of have a sense of how much some of these one-off factors dampened that growth. And then I think you said June depletions are progressing. Can you give us a little bit more color just in terms of what you're seeing in June, I mean some of the Nielsen data actually looked pretty strong as we’ve seen in the last few weeks? So maybe just a little bit more color just on the June trend. And then as it relates to your full year depletion growth, it seems like you’re kind of still expecting relatively healthy organic sales growth for your core business, any sort of turnaround on the competitive environment as you think about the marketplace? Thanks.
Rob Sands: So, look it's hard to get into specific numbers, okay on what the growth would have been had these factors not affected us. But as I said, there were two or three factors, I’d say, first quarter was kind of not a great quarter for the beer business, the beer category in general. I mean that said, our beer portfolio grew a little bit shy of 10%, which is an outstanding result on a relative or comparative basis. Yes, there were a few things that affected our business, which I talked about, the Recall affected it for sure, hence we would have done better in the first quarter had that not been the case. The overlap in the intro [ph] was a factor. There was definitely some promo activity in first quarter last year, which was not duplicated this year again due to some packs not being in supply during that period. And then I guess to your point, you can see all that kind of clearing itself up by simply looking at the June IRI trends, which I think are reflective of the overall health of the business. So, we have no concerns whatsoever about the brand health of the import portfolio or Corona period. So we fully expect to be on our forecast for the year for the portfolio and that's our import portfolio, right. Ballast Point, we're not even talking about that because the growth is so high that one can even say. It's the fastest growing beer in the entire craft segment in the entire US on what's getting to be a very big base, okay. I mean, we can't even talk about double-digit growth because it's so high. It's triple digit sometimes.
Judy Hong: Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then, David, just in terms of the phasing of, I guess, the beer gross margin progression for the balance of the year, as we think about certainly Nava, having now the 20 million hectoliter capacity, I think you have one more furnace in Nava up and running as well, but obviously some of the startup costs on the Nava side, so just, can you just help us understand sort of the phasing of gross margin. Is second quarter kind of more negatively impacted as it's more of a heavy volume quarter or how we should think about the phasing?
David Klein: Yes. So in the first quarter, we benefited from pricing in general, which somewhat offset COGS increases which were driven by increased depreciation. We did receive some benefits from FX, but probably the biggest driver in the quarter was the timing of marketing spend and now, I'm talking about operating margins, right, so we'll see that spend come back as we progress in the fiscal year, which will have a bit of a dampening effect on the margin. So we still expect flat margins roughly year-over-year and we're just -- we're pleased with the progress we're making in terms of margin expansion in getting the Nava facility functioning at 20 million hectoliters. The other comment I want to make Judy relates to glass. So, yes, we've fired up the second furnace at Nava. We won't be producing glass out of that facility really until the end of July and then even when that happens, the facility itself won't be producing at what we would expect our acceptable levels of utilization for many months. It takes a long time to get the furnaces functioning in a way that we'll be happy with. So, I would say that the benefit from that furnace really won't show up until the back half of this year, if it shows up this year at all.
Judy Hong: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohseniun of Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohseniun: Good morning. Rob, I was hoping you could review for us your cash flow priorities in terms of M&A versus returning cash to shareholders, given some of the rumors in the press lately and is M&A a big focus at this point, and what range or size of deal are you generally comfortable with from an M&A standpoint? Thanks.
Rob Sands: Yes. So I would say that our capital priorities haven't changed at all. They sort of remain number one at keeping our debt levels in that sort of mid-3 to 4 range, where we actually are at the current time. Returning dollars to shareholders continues to be a big and important focus for us. As you know, we did increase our annual dividend at the end of the year and we have made some stock repurchases. So, we continued to prioritize that as a key priority. And then, as we've said in the past, we’ll continue to look at and potentially make selective acquisitions of things like Meiomi, Prisoner as we go on. So I think that those kind of things are somewhat reflective of being tuck-in type acquisitions of the things that we would look at and I would say that that strategy is working very well. And then I think to your question about the magnitude, I think that goes back to my first point relative to maintaining our debt levels in that sort of 3 to 4 times, okay, we will be, I would say, guided in terms of magnitude by that priority and then, as I mentioned in my script, we continue to evaluate the Canadian IPO, right, but that's a disposition. So if we were to complete that, that will actually bring in cash, right. So we are being, I would say, pretty judicious in terms of how we’re managing the whole capital allocation process and our priorities. So I think that we've got, we’ve struck a really good balanced there, let me put it that way.
Dara Mohseniun: Okay, that's helpful. And then beer pricing was strong in the quarter at 3%, obviously part of that is balanced mix, but still strong on an underlying basis at a time when industry discounting looks like it’s picked up. So I was just hoping you could review if you are comfortable on the 2% pricing range going forward for your business and anything you’re seeing from a competitive standpoint in the industry?
Rob Sands: Yes. Our position on pricing and our plans haven't changed at all, and we don't really -- yes, there has been some competitive activity, but I would say that there is really nothing indicative that from a competitive point of view that that's really changed very significantly. I don't think anybody is like falling off a log and changed their general modus operandi in the industry general, that’s sort of our view of things.
Dara Mohseniun: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore.
Robert Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. Thank you and congratulations on a terrific quarter. So two questions. One, if you look at, and I know it's tough to get to, so just I appreciate any kind of way to think about our estimates. So if you look at roughly 9% depletion growth on the Mexican brands, can you break out roughly what percentage of that is coming from Mexican American consumers and what percent will be coming out from the general market?
David Klein: So Robert, the way we think about it when we look at our FY17 numbers, we think that's about 40% of our year-over-year growth will come from increasing distribution in the business. So this doesn't get to the demographics, but this is how we think about our numbers. So about 40% coming from growing distribution, about 10% coming from pack innovation during the fiscal year and then the remainder is really driven by demographic shifts like Hispanic and millennial consumers, but we also have included in that remaining 50%, other environmental factors. So it gets a little bit money, but when we’re putting our plans together, that's how we think about it.
Robert Ottenstein: Well, in terms of the 40%, would it be fair to say that most of that 40% would be the general market because presumably Modelo Especial is pretty well distributed in Mexican-American accounts?
David Klein: Yes. Some of the distribution growth though isn't necessarily just getting APAC into individual stores. It's getting different pack sizes into individual stores, which will take place across all of the retail establishments.
Robert Ottenstein: Got it. And then my second question, Rob, as you look out at the -- on the environment or the opportunity set for potential wine acquisitions and the possible targets, how does that look today and how does that compare with what you may have seen a few years ago? Is it more target rich environment, less, are you excited about what's out there in terms of what you can bring in to the portfolio and just kind of give us a sense of what the landscape looks like?
Rob Sands: Yes. I don't think that we see anything that’s largely different than what has been the case over the last several years, especially for perhaps the kind of things that we might be interested in. It really remains a one-off kind of opportunistic situation. There has been sort of a lot of activity in sort of the smaller end of the market, which meaning small deals that we don't really plan because they wouldn't be particularly significant or material to us. But of the kind of brands that we might be interested in, I would say that there is no fundamental change in the activity in that arena.
Robert Ottenstein: So I mean perhaps another way of asking is just kind of for modeling purposes or just thinking about it, should we think about maybe one deal a year, averaging out to that obviously it’s opportunistic?
Rob Sands: It’s totally unpredictable.
Robert Ottenstein: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good morning. So two questions on Ballast please. On the depletion growth that you guys noted, would it be possible to unpack that and give us a sense for how much distribution added to that?
David Klein: We've grown distribution about 40% since the time we took on Ballast Point, I think we’re at about 20 ACV and it's -- however, we’re still seeing growth in our existing markets in our existing stores. So I would say we’re seeing growth in big markets like California as well as growing incremental markets across the US.
Vivien Azer: That's great. And as you target the full national distribution by the end of the calendar year, how would you anticipate your ACV tracking with that?
David Klein: Yes. I think coming back to the growth that we've seen so far, I would just expect that we will continue to drive ACV, as that brand becomes one of the biggest craft brands in the marketplace. We will continue to see more retailer uptake and more consumer demand for the product. In terms of quantifying what happened with the ACV, I don't have that at hand.
Vivien Azer: Okay, that's great. And then my second question also Ballast related please, I know it's a little bit of a ways out, but as you think about the construction of the Virginia Brewery, can you just give us a sense of how you are thinking about the margin opportunity there?
Rob Sands: Yes. Well, again, one of the reasons we really like this brand and we've said this since we first announced the purchase is that this brand has very healthy operating margins as we sit here today. It's a little dilutive to our overall beer business, but we would expect over time as the brand gains a little scale and we get some benefits of East Coast production in the Virginia facility, we would expect that that margins begin to close the gap with our import portfolio margins.
Vivien Azer: Terrific. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.
Caroline Levy: Good morning and again congrats on a great quarter. My question is on, I wonder if you could get specific, David on A&M as a percent of sales for beer in the quarter, and if you still see it at sort of 8.5 to 9 for the year?
David Klein: Yes. 8.5% to 9% and that's across our entire beer business, although most of the spend at this point, as you know, is focused on the import portfolio. On that point, Caroline, I will say that, we've begun advertising on a brand like Pacifico on a broader scale than we have in the past and as a result, we saw very healthy depletion growth on Pacifico of around 17% in the quarter.
Caroline Levy: And in the quarter, what was A&M as a percentage of revenue because you said there are some timing differences, so it sounds like it will spike in the second quarter?
David Klein: Yes. So in the quarter, yeah, I don't have that number. We can get back to you with the specific number for the quarter.
Caroline Levy: Okay. And it would also be helpful and I don't want to really give this, but D&A didn’t seem to go up that much first quarter over fourth quarter, but you have called it out as a margin pressure for beer going forward, as you bring on now the capacity, so, like, would you be able to tell us what D&A was for the beer business in the quarter?
David Klein: Yes. We’re going to file the Q today and that information will be in the 10-Q when it’s filed.
Caroline Levy: Okay, thanks. Just finally on the timing of advertising, does this suggest that you have more programs coming up than usual in the second quarter, which could be helpful to sales? 
Caroline Levy: Yes. And again I think you have to think about it in the context, I know you are asking the question and I'm not answering actually, but you have to think about it in the context of a percentage, because on an absolute dollar basis, I'm not suggesting that we've spent less in the first quarter. It's just less as a percentage of the business. So, we still executed our normal marketing programs in the first quarter of the year, but yes, we do have that activity ramping up in 2Q and then going into the fall support season.
Caroline Levy: Okay. Thanks a lot, David.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
Bill Chappell: Thanks, good morning. Couple of questions, one, Rob, you had talked about only 50% of your business is tracked by IRI, which -- are you seeing any meaningful changes or growth rates or anything in the non-tracked channels or should we not be looking at IRI as closely?
Rob Sands: I think the IRI is fairly reflective of our business, but remember that the IRI was not being reflective of the on-premise, which constitutes about 15% or so of the business and it also is not reflective of what goes on in wine and spirits and control subs, so the biggest chunk there is probably on-premise, which in our business is running up about mid-single digits in the beer business and our beer business at low single-digits in our wine business and from a market perspective, is down in both categories, in all categories. Wine, spirits and beer, on premise was down as a category or as a market segment for the category for the quarter. So that's probably one of the biggest callouts is on premise not being reflective, not being reflected by IRI.
Bill Chappell: Yes. That helps. And then second, just to follow up on Ballast Point now, as the distribution has expanded, can you kind of tell us what your learnings for a product that’s at the high-end of the price range that was largely a West Coast regional brand, I mean how has it resonated versus kind of expectations as you moved it more and more to the east and with the price points kind of compared to other things on the shelf?
Rob Sands: Well, I think it's resonated really well. I mean, where we have gotten new distribution as we moved it to the east, I think that it's resonating particularly well. I'm not sure that it's perceived with any geographic specificity as we bring it into new markets and as we grow the new markets, I think that it’s really more viewed as a really high-end, high quality, award winning brand and it’s all about sort of style and flavors, and I think the thing that's kind of unique or somewhat unique about Ballast Point is that, it does have a lot of different styles like [indiscernible] or the Sculpin IPA and then it’s got flavors and has like the Grapefruit Sculpin or the new Pineapple Sculpin, which is really hot or a new product, which we just intro-ed called Varmint, which is a honey flavored pale ale, but this is very subtle stuff, right. It's not like it’s flavored like a flavored fab, okay, like [indiscernible] these are very subtle flavors that accentuate, okay, these sort of exotic hops that are used in the product and sort of bring out some of the qualities of those hops and therefore it’s, I’d say real beer and appeals to, I would say, real beer aficionados, which is one of the reasons why I think that it is able to command the premium pricing that it does command is because of the fact that it really is viewed by beer people, okay, as a super-high quality, award winning product, a lot like wine in that regard, right, high-end wine. Think of its acceptance in that vein by real craft beer drinkers who know and follow what's really being held as super high quality examples of that type of product. So it’s much more like that, much more like high end wine is the way I would think about Ballast Point.
Bill Chappell: Okay, thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg: Thanks, good morning, everyone. Two questions, one on Modelo Especial, Rob, if we could perhaps go a little bit deeper there, its growth stronger than Corona Extra, I'm sure that was true again in the quarter, I didn't catch the depletion rate, could you just give us a flavor for not only what the depletion rate for the brand was in the quarter, but what your plans are to perhaps accelerate the rate of depletion growth for that brand specifically. I'm interested in ACV intentions, spend rate, trying to get a better sense of where we are with that success story?
Rob Sands: Yes. So Modelo Especial depletion growth rate first quarter about 20% and we've got big plans to, say, accelerate that growth rate or at least maintain it, but -- and as you pointed out, it's all about distribution, I mean Modelo Especial is growing and it’s the size that it is without being in full distribution, okay, compared to other major brands of its size, it’s one of the top beer brands now in the entire country and if you look at beer brands that have full distribution, I mean, you’re talking like 80%, 90%, okay. Modelo Especial has about 70% ACV. So it's got a pretty good distribution runway and I think that the thing that you should realize is in general, okay, it’s distribution growth that drives depletion growth probably the most of anything. So pretty big runway there. It's a good news that probably the second most important thing, right, is velocity per point of distribution and if you look at our portfolio in general, whether it’s wine, beer, spirits, Modelo Especial or fast-growing brands, are achieving their growth through both velocity growth as well as distribution growth.
Mark Swartzberg: Got it. And what I’m hoping to better understand is, this summer or the next few quarters, is there the intent to pick up the pace of ACV gains for that brand versus what they’ve been, given what you just said or because the other choice of course is to say, Corona Extra is the horse here?
Rob Sands: ACV growth has been and will continue to be a number one priority for the beer business and Modelo Especial in particular, when you say pick up, it's not like we wrapped at a particular point in time on distribution growth, it’s what, that is what the sales organization basically is all about and does, okay. When companies like ourselves talk about execution or sales execution, they’re talking about growing distribution first and foremost and then probably the number to think in sales organization execution is all about merchandising and add activity at retail. So that's what sales forces do. That’s all they do, they run out and get distribution. They grow distribution and they work with the distributors and the retailers to maximize the merchandising opportunities.
Mark Swartzberg: Got it. Okay. And my second question, I’ll stay on that brand, media spend for Modelo Especial rate of growth, can you give us a sense, we heard about the portfolio rate of growth picking up here over the next few quarters, is it fair to think that that particular brand is getting an outsized rate of increase versus Corona Extra and some other brands or is that not the right way to think about it?
David Klein: We don't really break down the spend between the brands publicly, but I would say that we know that last year, we started to spend more in terms of general market advertising as it relates to Modelo Especial, you’ll continue to see that ramp up for the remainder of this year.
Rob Sands: And I’d also point out that, and I think this was mentioned previously, I mean we have put some media advertising in place for Pacifico and Pacifico is absolutely on fire with 17% depletion growth in the first quarter and I would say there is a lot of chatter beginning -- we are beginning to hear a lot of chatter about that particular brand and its general -- and its appeal in particular to craft drinkers. It seems to be a brand that when craft drinkers aren’t drinking, I would say traditional craft, okay, it’s sort of their next go to session item, seems to be Pacifico and we’re seeing a lot of interest an growth in that particular product and that 24-hours can has been on fire. So I would say that is something you should watch as the next up and comer.
Mark Swartzberg: That's, great. Okay. Excellent. Thank you, Rob. Thanks, David.
Operator: And that was our final question. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Okay. Well, thank you everybody for joining our call today. As we wrap up our discussion, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the overall excellent performance of our business this quarter. Our fiscal ‘17 is off to a fantastic start and we’re confident in our ability to achieve our full-year guidance. As we head into the 4th of July holiday weekend, I hope you remember to bring some of our fine products to your celebrations and to please enjoy them of course responsibly. Hopefully, you received the save the date notice for our planned New York City Investor Meeting on November 9. At that time, we look forward to speaking with you about the future strategy for our business. Thanks and have a great July 4th holiday.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

As usual I would like to limit everybody to two questions today so that we can end the call on time. Thank you. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Sands: Thanks, Patty. Good morning and welcome to our yearend call. Now before I begin the review of our accomplishments for fiscal 2016 and our plans for the coming year, I'd like to focus on the new initiatives disclosed within the press release issued earlier today. First, we announced that we are evaluating the merits of executing an IPO for a portion of our Canadian business. The consideration of this strategic action is the result of our ongoing efforts to identify value-enhancing opportunities for our shareholders and to strengthen the financial profile of our overall wine and spirits businesses. As we continue to transform the company, the focus and resources we put behind strategic initiatives to support sustainable value generating long-term growth are also evolving. This effort would provide better visibility to the Canadian business, which delivered excellent financial performance in 2016. Our Canadian business has a strong leadership team with extensive knowledge of the Canadian market. They market and sell a winning portfolio of brands and have a proven track record of successful innovation and new product development that resonates with Canadian consumers. Their size and scale across Canada includes eight wineries in key wine regions, approximately 1,700 acres of Canadian vineyards and a network of growers to support their Canadian produced brands. And they are the largest holder of independent retail licenses in Ontario with more than 160 wine rack stores. We are in the early process of evaluating an IPO of this business, and we plan to make a final decision later this calendar year, depending on market conditions. If an IPO is completed, the proceeds are expected to be used to manage debt and our other capital allocation priorities. This morning we also announced our plans to acquire The Prisoner Wine Company brands, a super luxury portfolio of five highly rated wines led by the largest brand, The Prisoner. Its other brands include Saldo, Cuttings, Blindfold, and Thorn, with overall volume for the portfolio reaching 175,000 cases in calendar 2015. The Prisoner is currently the number one super luxury red blend, growing in almost 30% in IRI channels at the $40 retail price point. Now similar to the Meiomi wine brand acquisition, the Prisoner acquisition aligns with our portfolio premiumization strategy and enables us to capitalize on US market trends that favor high end wine brands with accretive margin profiles. In particular, it strengthens our position in the dynamic and margin enhancing super luxury wine category and can be easily integrated into our existing portfolio of brands. So now let's turn our attention to some of our key achievements for the past year and great initiatives we have under way for fiscal 2017. Overall I am pleased with the significant accomplishments and the impressive financial results we achieved in fiscal 2016. This past summer we purchased the Meiomi wine brand, which is currently the fastest growing major brand in IRI channels in the $20 luxury price point. The brand delivered depletion growth of almost 60% in fiscal 2016, a trend which has accelerated since we first acquired the brand last summer. Its excellent margin profile is one of the contributing drivers of the margin expansion for the wine and spirits business in fiscal 2016. Meiomi Pinot Noir was one of the hottest wines of the year, listed as Number 20 in the Wine Spectator's Top 100 for 2015 and Number 1, that's good, on wine.com's Top 100 list, which is based entirely on consumer preferences. We believe the brand has plenty of room to continue driving healthy growth for our business. Last fall we entered the craft beer market with the purchase of Ballast Point, one of the most awarded major craft breweries in the industry. Ballast Point provides a high growth premium platform that is enabling Constellation to compete in the fast growing craft beer segment, further strengthening our position in the high end of the US beer market. In calendar 2015, Ballast Point posted depletion growth of more than 130% and sold nearly 4 million cases. This phenomenal level of growth is approximately three times that of any major competitor. Operationally, we selected a site and secured the land to construct a new state-of-the-art brewery in Mexicali, Mexico. Initially this brewery will we built to operate at 10 million hectoliters of production capacity with potential scalability to 20 million hectoliters and it will have similar technology and operational advancements as our Nava Brewery. And speaking of Nava, we successfully completed our first incremental 5 million hectoliter capacity expansion as planned by year end calendar 2015, and we are progressing with our plans to build out Nava to 27.5 million hectoliters by early calendar 2018. Now these investments in Mexicali and Nava will ensure that we have the capacity, quality, control and flexibility to meet expected demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future, and position us to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the high end of the US beer market. Now organizationally we made key management changes across the business, strengthening the organization by fostering the continued growth and development of our people while insuring continuity to build upon our current success and drive the company's long-term growth strategies. Collectively these accomplishments, in conjunction with our excellent business performance, have helped to drive the appreciation of our stock, which remains one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Index. Now let's move now to excellent business performance I just referenced as a critical component to our success. We'll start with the Constellation Brands beer business, which was the number one contributor to growth in the total US beer category last year for the third consecutive year, with most of our brands in the Mexican import portfolio posting record volumes in 2016. And Constellation was the leader and the number one share gainer in the high end segment of the US beer market in calendar 2015. More remarkably, our beer business growth has accelerated every year since 2010, with depletion trends exceeding 12% in fiscal 2016. I'd like to take a minute to share some of this past year's amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands and highlight the key initiatives we plan to execute during fiscal 2017 in order to maintain this excellent momentum. Let's begin with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial, these brands are two of the hottest brands in the industry, and delivered 25% of US beer category industry growth last year. Our flagship Corona Extra brand has been the number one imported beer brand for almost 20 years, and today is the number five beer brand overall in the US industry. This brand sold more than 117 million cases in fiscal 2016, growing depletions almost 10% versus the prior year. This growth occurred across the country, as Corona Extra grew share in 49 out of 50 states and was the only top five US beer brand to grow share for the year. Corona Extra growth has been accelerating over the last five years, with the can launch accounting for about 1/3rd of the growth in fiscal 2016. The remainder of the phenomenal growth came from the increased distribution and velocity of the iconic Corona Extra bottles. In fiscal 2017, we expect to increase our media investment in Corona Extra while focusing the dollars against key time periods that include the NBA Finals and our 120 days of summer in order to maintain our leadership position during our most important selling season. We also plan to increase our digital investments, as we saw great success with the brand's social media activities last year. We believe there remains tremendous growth opportunity in Corona Extra cans, as depletions for this format increased more than 100% in fiscal 2016, but currently represent less than 6% of total brand volume. As such, we are investing more behind Corona cans to generate incremental awareness and consumer demand. You'll see a heavy media presence leading into key can holidays including Memorial Day, July 4th, and Labor Day. Now moving to Modelo Especial, this brand is stronger than ever as the fastest growing major beer brand in America. Last year the brand grew depletions more than 19% to surpass 70 million cases and $1 billion in sales. As a result, Modelo Especial was the number one dollar share gainer and is now ranked as the number eight beer overall in the US market in total dollar sales, up from the number nine position last year. The size of this brand has doubled in just five short years, and our goal is to keep this momentum going. In fiscal 2017 our biggest opportunity for this brand lies in expanding distribution, because despite being the number two import, Modelo currently has less than 50% distribution on most packages. We also see tremendous opportunity for this brand in the on-premise channel, where Modelo Especial increased more than 20% last year, with the draft format increasing almost 50%. Yet only about 30% of on-premise locations across the US carry Modelo Especial today. So we are focused on closing that distribution gap and increasing the momentum. Now for the sixth consecutive year, we are increasing our Modelo Especial investment in national, Spanish language TV, and digital, and we will be running new TV advertising throughout the entire year, increasing our spend on live sports by 50% and investing in heavily visible soccer broadcast properties. In addition, we are increasing our general market media by almost 40% across national TV and digital with high profile placements during the NBA playoffs and key NFL matchups. Together we expect these initiatives to position Modelo Especial for another great year of stellar growth. I also want to call out Corona Light, which remains the number one imported light beer by a large margin. Depletion growth on this brand has accelerated every year for the last five years, with depletions growing almost 8% in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, we plan to build on the already successful Light Cerveza campaign with a new TV advertisement which will begin airing nationally this month. We have also added high profile live spots during NHL playoff broadcasts this spring and sponsorships of national major league baseball games on ESPN during the key summer holidays. This will be supplemented with an investment in social media. We are also expanding Corona Light draft by launching with several additional distributors. The Corona Light will continue to be a big point of emphasis, as depletions for this format increased more than 40% in fiscal 2016. As you are aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our biggest brands, part of what makes our collection of brands so powerful is the long-term potential of our smaller brands like Victoria and Pacifico that are currently outpacing category growth. And let's not forget about Ballast Point, a brewer known for unbridled innovation and outstanding quality, and one that gives our beer portfolio a leading position in the craft space that can be built upon in several ways. This year is to expand the Ballast Point distribution nationally, making it available in all 50 states. This along with successful new product launches is expected to drive the strong double-digit growth we are targeting in fiscal 2017. Overall, I am excited about the growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2017. As you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business organically through enhanced distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio. As a result, we are targeting both net sales growth and operating income growth in the 14% to 17% range for our beer business in fiscal 2017, including the benefits from Ballast Point. From a brewery and operational perspective, in fiscal 2016 we achieved our key Nava Brewery performance goals for capacity utilization, quality, and cost. All areas of the brewery expansion are well under way, with overall project on schedule to be completed on time and within our budget. As we begin fiscal 2017, we'll be intensely focused on the continued expansion of the Nava Brewery to 20 million hectoliters. This capacity is expected to become fully operational within the next few months. As a matter of fact, we've already begun to run test brews and have all new packaging lines up and running in test mode to support this 20 million hectoliters of capacity. Now over the next few months we will continue to fine tune all the components necessary to successfully achieve this important milestone as planned. Within our existing capacity, we recently made our first brew of Modelo Especial Chelada at Nava with excellent results. With that accomplishment complete, we have now made brews of all of our products at this brewery. And, as many of you are aware, our third phase of expansion to 25 million hectoliters is our next critical milestone, and I am pleased to report that this work is proceeding as scheduled. I am proud of the fact that Nava is the newest and most advanced state-of-the-art brewery in the world and that our brewery team's capabilities and commitment to quality are unparalleled. These best in class credentials are what we plan to bring to our new Mexicali brewery. Mexicali is the ideal site for a sister brewery to Nava. The technology and skilled expertise we plan to put in place are designed to ensure the highest quality and consistency for our consumers, and we will continue to update you on the progress there. And now I'd like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During fiscal 2016 we delivered overall earnings growth and margin expansion for our wine and spirits business. Our spirits portfolio produced solid results, and our Canadian wine business exceeded its financial goals, while outperforming the industry and growing market share for the year. Sales growth in the US benefited from organic volume growth and positive mix trends. We delivered exceptional results for our focus brands, which grew depletions 5% for the year and we are reaping the benefits of our targeted investments in these brands. As a matter of fact, many of our focus brands were included in our list of significant milestones and accomplishments for our overall wine and spirits portfolio for fiscal 2016. Seven of our brands were featured on Impact's annual Hot Brand list for wine and spirits, including Meiomi, which recently surpassed our very own Mark West as IRI's largest pinot noir for the current 12 week and 52-week periods, and Kim Crawford recently emerged as the number one sauvignon blanc in IRI channels. Our products were also called out in the Beverage Information Group's 2015 awards in which four of our brands achieved Fast Track status, recognizing their impressive growth. Three were named Rising Stars, including one of our newest brands, Tom Gore Vineyards, and six were listed as established growth brands, such as Mark West, Ruffino, SIMI, and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. The Beverage Information Group also recognized SVEDKA Vodka as a spirits growth brand, which this year achieved its place as the number one imported vodka in the entire US. We plan to continue building on the success of some of our most recent new brands and line extensions to capitalize on the hottest trends in the market. Our newest red blend, Ravage, is a dark fruit forward red blend with structure and depth that has resonated well with consumers and will go national in September. Ravage Cabernet Sauvignon performed very well during our exclusive testing period with a major retailer throughout last year, and we are pleased to expand the brand to wider distribution this spring. We will also continue to support the growth of Tom Gore Vineyards, the farmer's wine, that meets consumers desire to know the people and places behind the products they choose. Some of our existing new line extensions include our Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet, which boasts an impressively rich profile that comes from a unique aging process in bourbon barrels; and Ruffino's Sparkling Rose, which expects to capitalize on the success of our Ruffino Prosecco and the growing consumer taste for imported rose wines. For the year our spirits portfolio posted solid net sales growth of 6%, driven by the continued success of our flavor introductions for Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy, as well as SVEDKA vodka. Casa Noble almost doubled net sales this past year and tripled distribution in terms of number of accounts. We are upbeat about the future growth trajectory of this brand. In fact, we are putting resources behind Casa Noble to support what we believe is a compelling growth opportunity. Some of these investments include fresh packaging, a new marketing campaign, and continued cross promotion with Corona Extra during the Cinco de Mayo holiday season. Our marketing campaign, The Noble Pursuit, features digital spots that highlight the quality and heritage unique to this fine tequila. We also plan to continue supporting our number one imported vodka, SVEDKA with a new addition to our lineup of flavors, cucumber lime. SVEDKA has been very successful in launching highly targeted unique flavors that stand out from the vast options on the shelf today, and has proven it knows how to win in this space. We think cucumber lime will be a great addition to the track record of success, and the initial consumer response supports our optimism. From a strategic perspective in fiscal 2017, our goal for the wine and spirits business is to grow profits ahead of sales and improve margins, which is reflected in our 2017 wine and spirits guidance of mid single digit sales growth and mid to high single digits profit growth for the year. So what will be the enablers of this goal? We plan to capitalize on the market leading growth of our recent high growth margin enhancing wine acquisitions, Meiomi and The Prisoner. We will continue our targeted approach to investing in a subset of our focus brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest growth potential. We remain committed to mix and margin accretive innovation and new product development and have several new products in the hopper, a few of which I just mentioned. And for the third consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases for select products within the portfolio. And finally, we plan to continue to optimize COGS through global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements, and lower grape costs. Overall we are committing people, technology, and resources to work with our wholesalers and retailers to execute growth for our wine and spirits business. In closing, it has certainly been another exciting year at Constellation. Our achievements are many and have driven a year of strong financial performance. In fiscal 2016, we delivered industry leading market results for our beer business, while continuing to enhance our operational platform in Mexico to support the growth of our iconic Mexican beer brands. Within our wine and spirits business, we maintained our focus on premiumization, innovation, and brand building which drove enhanced margins and earnings growth. We are very proud to have delivered another rewarding year of value to our shareholders, and I am pleased that our results can support a significant dividend increase in the coming year. Overall, we remain committed to challenging ourselves in order to optimize the business opportunities that lie ahead. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein who will review our financial results for fiscal 2016 and the outlook for fiscal 2017.
David Klein: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal '16 was another very exciting year with strong financial performance in which we generated over $6.5 billion of net sales and 9% net sales growth. We expanded operating margins in both businesses and improved our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by more than 200 basis points. We increased consolidated EBIT 18% and comparable basis diluted EPS 22%, and we produced $1.4 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of 31%. The strong earnings and operating cash flow growth helped our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio finish at 3.8 times even as we made significant capital investments in our Mexican operations, acquired Meiomi and Ballast Point, and returned cash to shareholders with the initiation of a dividend and the repurchase of stock. We expect fiscal '17 to be another strong year, as we are targeting healthy net sales, EBIT, operating cash flow and EPS growth, while we continue to invest in our world class Mexican beer operating platform and increase our dividend per share by 29%. Given those highlights, let's look at fiscal 2016 performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Consolidated net sales on an organic constant currency basis grew 8% for the year. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business, with depletion growth coming in over 12%. Organic beer net sales increased 13% on organic volume growth of 11%. Ballast Point added $27 million of sales since joining our beer portfolio in mid December. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects volume growth and favorable mix. As mentioned by Rob, Meiomi continues to demonstrate excellent marketplace momentum, as the brand generated $74 million of incremental sales since joining the portfolio last August. For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $373 million, up 14% with gross margin increasing 220 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $310 million, primarily due to volume growth, favorable pricing, and lower COGS, and our beer gross profit margin increased 300 basis points to 49%. Wine and spirits gross profit was up $63 million. This primarily reflects the benefits from the Meiomi acquisition and lower COGS. Wine and spirits gross profit margin increased 90 basis points to 42.2%. Consolidated SG&A increased $90 million. This reflects marketing investments made primarily by the beer business. Corporate expense was up due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense, an increase in payroll taxes associated with employee stock option exercise activity, and investments to support the growth of our business, including the establishment of our Chief Growth Officer function. Consolidated SG&A as a percentage of net sales remain constant at 17.5%. We continue to expand margins across the business, as consolidated operating income increased $283 million and consolidated operating margin improved 220 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 300 basis points to 34.9%, and wine and spirits operating margin improved 110 basis points to 24.8%. Equity earnings increased $5 million due largely to strong results for Opus One. Interest expense for the year was $314 million, down 7%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of February, our total debt was $8.1 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $8 billion, an increase of $812 million since the end of fiscal 2015. This primarily reflects funding for the Ballast Point and Meiomi acquisitions, partially offset by our free cash flow generation. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.8 times at the end of fiscal '16 versus four times at the end of fiscal '15. Our fiscal '16 ratio does not reflect a full year EBITDA benefit for the Ballast Point and Meiomi acquisitions. Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 29.6%, which was essentially even with last year. Now let's briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $1.19, up 16%. EPS growth was impacted by our tax rate, as our Q4 rate was 29.8% versus a 23.2% rate in Q4 last year, which reflected the benefit of certain foreign tax credits. Beer business results for the quarter finished strong, with organic net sales up 18% on organic volume growth of 14%. Net sales benefited from pricing and the overlap of certain sales adjustments recorded during the fourth quarter last year. Beer depletions for the quarter grew 13%. This factors in Ballast Point depletions since the transaction close date in mid-December and the corresponding period last year. Ballast Point added a little under 1 percentage point to our Q4 depletion growth rate. Beer operating income increased 29% primarily due to organic volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS, partially offset by increased SG&A largely attributed to higher marketing spend. Wine and spirits organic net sales on a constant currency basis were up 4% for the quarter, primarily due to volume growth. Wine and spirits operating income increased 14%. This reflected the benefit of the Meiomi acquisition, organic volume growth, and lower COGS, partially offset by higher marketing spend. Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For fiscal '16, we generated $522 million of free cash flow, compared to $362 million last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion versus $1.1 billion for the prior year. This increase was primarily generated by the growth of the beer business. CapEx for fiscal '16 totaled $891 million compared to $719 million last year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 246,000 shares of common stock for $34 million. Rob provided highlights of our agreement to acquire The Prisoner Wine Company brands. The cash paid at closing is expected to approximate $285 million. The transaction is expected to close by the end of April and to be $0.03 to $0.05 accretive to EPS for fiscal '17. This provides a good spot to move to our full year fiscal '17 P&L and free cash flow outlook. We are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of 6.05 to 6.35. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. The beer business is targeting net sales and operating income growth to be in the range of 14% to 17%. This includes the anticipated incremental benefit from the Ballast Point acquisition. We expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. Our projections include 1% to 2% anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. We are pleased that our beer operating margin finished fiscal '16 just under 35%, which came in line with our most recent guidance. Our fiscal '17 beer segment guidance has us targeting a flattish beer operating margin versus fiscal '16. In fiscal '17 we expect to see positive operating margin benefits from product pricing, ongoing favorability from foreign currency and commodities, glass sourcing, and lower levels of finished goods purchased under the interim supply agreement with ABI. And while we are pleased with our progress on our expansion activities at Nava, we still have much to accomplish as we continue to bring online and optimize new capacity. Given these activities, we will continue to see a ramp-up in depreciation expense, line commissioning and optimization costs, and employee hiring. These costs along with marketing investments and the consolidation of Ballast Point are essentially offsetting the margin benefits I just outlined. Looking closer at depreciation and amortization expense for the beer segment, it totaled $62 million in fiscal '16. We expect that to increase by approximately 125% in fiscal '17. For the wine and spirits business, we expect net sales growth in the mid single digit range and operating income growth in the mid to high single digit range. This includes the anticipated incremental benefit from the Meiomi and Prisoner acquisitions. We expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid single digit range, with operating income growth targeted to be ahead of sales growth, as we are forecasting some mixed benefits. In addition, we expect our interest expense to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. Our tax rate to approximate 29%, and our weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate $206 million. This does not assume additional stock repurchases. We expect fiscal '17 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, and CapEx of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion. Based on the midpoint of our guidance, we are targeting double-digit growth in operating cash flow for fiscal '17. This benefit is being more than offset by the planned increase in capital expenditures, as our guidance includes approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion related to our beer operational expansion projects in Mexico. In the press release we issued this morning, we included an updated table summarizing the collective capital expenditure investments we are making in our Mexican operating platform and related timing. Overall there is no change to the total cost estimate related to these projects, and fiscal '17 and fiscal '18 still represent the peak spending periods for this activity. We increased our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share for Class A stock and to $0.36 per share for Class B stock. This represents a 29% increase in our dividend rate per share. As a result, we expect approximately $320 million in dividend payments for fiscal '17. In closing, we are very pleased with our fiscal '16 financial performance and excited about the strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth we are planning for fiscal '17. We continue to strengthen our financial profile, and have significant capital allocation flexibility as we remain focused on operating in our targeted three to four times leverage range. With that, we are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning.
Rob Sands: Good morning, Dara.
Dara Mohsenian: I just wanted to flush out the reasoning for the potential Canadian wine IPO. It's a small piece of corporate EBIT. So it seems like it won't have much direct valuation impact. Is the motivation there more to potentially highlight the US wine business as undervalued here, or are there other reasons behind it? And any thoughts in general around the notion of going full monty and splitting up the entire wine and spirits business from beer down the road, it would be helpful for any commentary there? Thank you.
Rob Sands: Yes, so the Canadian IPO is really, assuming that it occurs, intended to achieve a number of things. Number one, we think that’s sort of buried in the whole company in the wine and spirits division, it doesn't really get much visibility from a value perspective. And that if we treat it more as a standalone entity, the fact that it is a very high performing business in Canada will become a lot more visible, that's number one. So we think that that will be positively reflected in its valuation and our valuation overall. Number two, it's obviously also a capital allocation opportunity for us. As I said an IPO of a part of the - of the Canadian business will enable us to continue to manage our debt and keep it at the levels that we think are optimal for the company as we also embark on some of our other strategic initiatives that are driving our very positive results in the wine and spirits business. Meiomi is an example, Prisoner is an example, our investments behind driving premiumization in the portfolio with our other brands and our NPD initiatives. So we see the Canadian IPO as helping us to potentially achieve a lot of positive things. It is an interesting business, it’s got strong growth. We built an improved market share in Canada. So we think that it represents in many respects a great standalone opportunity. As far as its implications as to our strategy for the rest of the wine and spirits business, there really is no implication there. The wine and spirits business - our wine and spirits business remains very strong, as you've seen in the results, we had fantastic leverage, P&L leverage in that business this year, we had tremendous margin expansion in that business. Even inclusive of Canada, which is a bit lower in margin than the overall business, we posted operating profit margin in the mid 20%s, which is fantastic for any business in any industry. A mid 20%s operating profit margin was the kind of leverage and growth and EBIT that we're getting in that business. So really no implications relative to the rest of the business. But we think that as I said as a standalone business it's a great opportunity from an investment point of view. So that's basically the thinking there.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the beer margin side, the commentary made sense in terms of the puts and takes looking at the upcoming fiscal year. But it seems like some of those favorable items you mentioned like the glass efficiency, pricing, top line leverage, et cetera would be a lot bigger than some of the negatives that you mentioned, particularly given the strong gross margin momentum in Q4. So is the flat guidance just conservatism with greater uncertainty than you would usually have with the Nava ramp up. And can you give us a sense of some of the negatives you mentioned, like the Ballast SG&A, the higher marketing, and hiring?
David Klein: Yes, so generally, Dara, first of all there are a lot of moving parts as it relates to a buildup of our operating margin in the beer business, and in particular in the work that’s being done at Nava. So as we said for the last year really, we're going to see headwinds in margin expansion at Nava as a result of incremental depreciation expense, line commissioning costs, employee hiring, as we bring capacity on, but we don't necessarily get the throughput through the facility. I would say that while we also are benefiting from stepping away from the ISA with ABI, as you'll recall we did extend although at a lesser amount in terms of case volume, we extended the ISA with ABI which dampened some of the near term margin upside that we may have otherwise seen. And then the last point really being Ballast Point. Now in terms of craft performers, Ballast Point is probably one of the best performing crafts from a financial profile perspective, but it still is dilutive to our overall operating margin of our beer business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.
Russ Miller: Hi, good morning, this is Russ Miller on for Nik. Could you more specifically compare the top line growth profiles of the US and Canadian wine businesses?
David Klein: Russ, we're struggling to hear you actually.
Russ Miller: I apologize. I was just wondering for more color, if you could compare the top line growth between the US and Canadian wine businesses?
Rob Sands: Compared to what, Russ? Higher in Canada than in the US.
Russ Miller: Okay. And then as a follow up, what are some of the key areas of focus for Bill Newlands as he takes over leadership of the wine and spirits business?
Rob Sands: Well, it's the things that have been driving and that drove the results this year. He's got to continue to focus on those same things. So it's all about like premiumization, it's about driving mix, it's about driving our higher margin brands and our newly acquired brands like Prisoner, like Meiomi, driving the organic growth of our really high margin focus brands, good examples being Kim Crawford, that's number one. NPD continues to be really important in the beverage alcohol business. NPD is providing almost all of the growth across any category in wine, beer, and spirits. Our beer business tends to be a little bit different than that because we happen to be in sort of in the main sweet spot of growth with our Mexican portfolio and our craft portfolio. But continuing to drive that NPD pipeline is again one of his main strategic initiatives. And as I said our new acquisitions, Meiomi, Mark West is only a few years old, Prisoner, these are all key to our premiumization and strategy and driving mix. And again, this is the sweet spot of growth in the beverage alcohol business. So it's pretty straightforward, and then it's you know, sort of I'd say day to day bread and butter stuff. COGS, control over COGS, costs and growth has been an important driver of our financial results there, as well as other expense items in the P&L. So he will continue to focus on those things as well. Good news is that he's doing a really great job and we're extremely optimistic obviously given our guidance for next year that we'll continue to be very successful in those areas.
Russ Miller: That's excellent. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: Thank you, good morning.
Rob Sands: How are you, Judy?
Judy Hong: So first on beer sales guidance for fiscal '17, I guess historically, it seemed like you were a little bit more conservative at the outset of the year in terms of looking at the beer depletion. And it looks like this time the 10% to 13% organic sales guidance for beer lapping some of the tougher comps in the back half seems actually not as conservative. So just wanted to understand maybe a little bit more just in terms of is it really the momentum behind all of your brand that you're seeing that gives you confidence, how big a factor would continue distribution gains on the cans be really a factor in terms of driving that sales growth momentum in '17 for your beer business?
David Klein: Well Judy, I think that it's of the things you mentioned around beer growth, it's both of those things. We think the brands continue to have very strong momentum. We continue to see that even as we're into the New Year in terms of IRI. There is a lot of distribution gain activity or a lot of space we can gain in terms of distribution in the coming year. We do expect continued growth of cans and again, our objective remains to drive our can volume up in aggregate into that mid-teens kind of range of total volume over time. I do want to address your point around the level of conservatism in our guidance. I would say that we've taken the same approach this year to guidance as we've used in the past. We're trying to give our best estimate as to where we think the business will land on the year, and I think that's reflected in the numbers that we produced. And again I think you do need to focus on the organic depletion number, which is - or the organic net sales number, which is the 10% to 13% because I think combined with our 1% to 2% pricing guidance, you get to a fairly respectable, but achievable volume number.
Judy Hong: Got it, okay. And then I guess the second question is around your capital allocation/acquisition strategy. So it seems like maybe every quarter or maybe just more recently we're getting a bit more just in terms of some of these acquisitions. Certainly in 2017, just given where your leverage level is, you also have a lot of dry powder in terms of continuing to either return cash to shareholders versus acquisitions. So is there a big pipeline in terms of these potential acquisitions that you see across both high end and craft spirits and beer side of the business? If those don't materialize would you be willing to return even more cash to shareholders in 2017? And what's embedded in terms of your guidance?
David Klein: So I would say, Judy, we are seeking all the time to methodically and consistently drive shareholder value. And so we look at all of the tools in the tool box that we have to do that. And yes, in some instances it's in acquisition like The Prisoner or Meiomi. And I would say that early returns on Meiomi and Ballast Point are very positive, from a shareholder return standpoint we expect to see the same results, from an execution standpoint, from The Prisoner transaction you can see that we do remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders as evidenced by a 29% increase in our dividend. And we will continue to look at share repurchases when we can stay within our leverage, our targeted leverage range, and we can be opportunistic in the market. And remember that the guidance that we gave assuming 206 million shares outstanding assumes no additional share repurchases at this point.
Judy Hong: Got it, okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Rob Sands: Hi, Brian.
Bryan Spillane: So first just a housekeeping question. In terms of Prisoner, are you going to finance that with debt, with the revolver or just how are you financing that?
David Klein: Yes, that's a hard one because of the fungibility of cash. We will not be going to the market to borrow for - specifically for The Prisoner. We will take it off the revolver or cash on hand.
Bryan Spillane: Okay. And in terms of the accretion estimate that you gave, does that assume that you're just going to use cash in hand?
David Klein: The accretion estimate assumes kind of an average borrowing rate actually. So I guess you could imply the revolver from that when you're doing your math.
Bryan Spillane: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then in terms of just sort of the flow of beer shipments for fiscal '17, given how fast the business is growing and the capacity constraints that you have, are we going to see maybe a different order pattern this year, where wholesalers are just going to build more inventory early in the season, so that you take less - take some pressure off the peak?
David Klein: I don't think you'll see anything different from previous years because we've had this pressure if you'll recall for the last couple of years. And we do a lot of work with our distributor partners to plan inventory levels so that we optimize our - the freshness of our beer, while making sure that we don't stock out at retail. So I don't think you'll see a dramatic shift from where we've been in the past.
Bryan Spillane: Okay. And then just one - just sneak one more in, just in terms of the Canadian partial IPO, had you considered or would you consider either just a tax free spin to shareholders and or an outright sale, like why a partial IPO versus maybe some of the other options that might also create value? Thanks.
Rob Sands: Yes, because call it a middle of the road approach, right. It gets us some and some, right. The Canadian business is a great business. It enables us to continue to have the Canadian business that they utilize it as distribution platform for our US brands. On the other hand, it will create more transparency into the performance of this business and therefore we think that it will be positive from a valuation perspective. And then of course there's the proceeds from the sale of a portion of the business, right, which as I said in my talk will enable us to continue to manage our debt levels appropriately and fits very nicely into our overall capital allocation strategy to enable us to do the things that David was just talking about, which includes some of our strategic initiatives, as well as David pointed out, methodically returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividend increases, as well as share repurchases. We did recommence our share repurchasing activity this quarter, and although we didn't include it in our guidance because we don't know what we're going to do necessarily because we act opportunistically there. It's certainly a major element of our capital allocation strategy, as I said to continue to return money to shareholders in both those matters, dividend increases and share repurchases. So it all fits together pretty nicely without sort of disassembling the business.
Bryan Spillane: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good morning.
Rob Sands: Morning, Vivien.
David Klein: Hi, Vivien.
Vivien Azer: Just wanted to follow up on Bryan's question first, please. In terms of your inventory levels on the beer side, I was a little bit surprised actually not to see inventories build back up given what happened in the third quarter. So where are we in terms of your inventory levels right now?
David Klein: Our inventory levels from a days on hand, right, which reflect year-over-year growth, our inventory levels from a days on hand standpoint are consistent with where we've been in previous years at this point in time. And that's both within our network and at the distributors.
Vivien Azer: And is that a level that you're comfortable with or would you like to see that come up a little bit, given the momentum of the business?
David Klein: We're comfortable with that level.
Vivien Azer: Okay, perfect. Thank you. My next question has to do with Ballast Point. Can you comment at all on how much capacity there is, in particular at Miramar? And I ask it because given the fast top line growth, while the business is dilutive today, I suspect a lot of that has to do with the fact it's much more expensive to ship west to east than vice versa. So how are you thinking longer term about incremental capacity and where would you put that?
David Klein: So first of all I'll say that Miramar has capacity for about 10 million to 12 million cases. And then beyond that I think we've said in the past that, and Ballast Point has said this, Jim Buechler and his team have discussed looking for a location for an east coast brewery at some point in the future.
Vivien Azer: Is there any rationale to accelerating those plans to capture better margin given shipping rates?
Rob Sands: I would say - this is Rob. I would say that was being heavily investigated and pursued even prior to the acquisition. So the answer is that it is a strategic initiative as we speak.
Vivien Azer: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.
Caroline Levy: Thanks so much, good morning. A couple of questions. One, have you considered taking more pricing in beer given the capacity constraints and given the need to pull on the AB supply?
Rob Sands: Look, our position on pricing, our strategy remains the same. We really make our pricing decisions from a very granular perspective market by market, case by case, city by city. I think fundamentally the answer to your question is that we don't necessarily see anything on the horizon that dictates that we should be taking a different approach to pricing than we have in the past. It's going to be sort of based on what we think the market will allow and our competitive position. And we wouldn't use pricing to slow down the business and potentially damage the health of the brands. I can tell you that right now. We have, we believe the capacity necessary to meet the demand in the marketplace. But pricing is an important element of our growth strategy too. So we're going to continue to take the very balanced approach that we've been taking in the past.
Caroline Levy: Got it, okay. I know that you're looking to enforce some of your contracts a little more than you have in the past with distributors in terms of what kind of promotional spending they should do. And I'm wondering as you build up your 10% to 13% organic growth, how much is driven by expected better performance out of distributors? And sort of separate but the same, what growth rate are you looking for the Corona brand which had such an exceptional year last year, are you looking for high single digits still on Corona?
Rob Sands: So in answer to your first question, I think there is a bit of a misnomer there. We clarified some points in our distributor contracts and this and that recently. We talked about that at our GNS, our Gold Network Summit. It's really - I would say doesn't amount to much. We're not - I wouldn't call it enforcing our contracts in a particularly different manner. We continue to have the same approach with our distributors, which is very much a partnership approach, okay. Our proposition to our distributors is pretty simple, okay, which is like any smart business people, you should invest in the higher margin, higher growth parts of your business that can develop, you know, that's going to drive your margins in your business for the future, and we think that it's our portfolio that's the squeaky wheel that ought to get that grease. I mean, it's really as simple as that. And by the way, it's not a hard sell, okay? They all get it. They get it very easily and they can see it in their own financial results that the key in many respects to their future from any material perspective is in our portfolio, because the other large elements of their portfolio are flat to down, okay. So all of the action is in our brands and to some degree craft of course, which is - we're playing in that as well. So I don't think that there's anything particularly different going on with our distributor network. We're not insisting upon different terms than we have in the past in any material sense. And then your other question was product growth? We don't really break that out, but needless to say we're getting very strong growth in Corona and we continue that growth - continue to expect that growth to continue, right, driven by the can, driven by continued execution in the marketplace, even for 100% or a really well distributed brand. There remains to be distribution opportunity even for a brand like Corona when you look at the various SKUs and packs and this and that that we have. I mean, it's not 100% distributed in that regard. And then look, we're increasing our marketing activities ahead of the market very consciously because the most critical thing we have is to maintain the health of these brands. And therefore we think that continuing to increase our share of voice in building these brands is important. And then we also have great execution in that regard. I think that our advertising and our marketing in general and our strategy there is really working. So I mean I suppose you could be increasing bad advertising, which isn't going to get you anywhere. But we're increasing really, really good advertising that resonates with the consumer and we know that we get a fantastic return from this, so - because we measure it.
Caroline Levy: That's great, thank you very much. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal.
Tim Ramey: Hi. Good morning, thanks.
Rob Sands: Hi, Tim.
Tim Ramey: Your cash tax rate continues to be really low, and there's some downward movement in the book tax rate. I assume that's all timing differences on cash or tax depreciation. But if we think about the short-term two to three years out, how will those two numbers trend if you have any insight into that or does book move towards cash or does cash move towards book, I assume?
David Klein: Yes, so Tim, I think one of the issues that we wrestle with and you wrestle with and every corporation in America is wrestling with at the moment is all of the change that's happening both domestically and internationally from a tax policy perspective. And so you can see the benefits that we've had in recent years from certain foreign tax credits, as well as from the benefits of the tax treatment of stock option expense. And so that has helped push our number down in recent years, right. And then in terms of our cash versus book, I would say how that all resolves itself on an ongoing basis, I think is going to depend upon the changes in overall tax policy. I would say that we expect our cash taxes to remain in the low 20%s for the foreseeable future.
Tim Ramey: Okay. And just one other one on CapEx. I'm assuming that 2017 is the peak CapEx year, but it's not super clear what '18 should look like, and that's at least in the forecast horizon now, I assume it's lower than '17. Can you give any clarity on that?
David Klein: Yes, a little bit I would say that '17 and '18 as we said will continue to be the peak years. It's hard to really say at this point how things will flow between say '18 and '19 versus '17. So other than '17 and '18 will be our heaviest year, I'm reluctant to give any further guidance.
Tim Ramey: Terrific. Thanks for your help.
David Klein: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.
Rob Ottenstein: Thank you very much and congratulations on a great quarter and a great year. A couple of questions. One, could you review for us your overall M&A strategy as it pertains between beer, spirits, and wine, and is it primarily opportunistic? Obviously there are strategic elements in terms of mix, but also is there any sense given that you are really the only total beverage alcohol play company in the US. Longer term would you be looking for a more equal mix in terms of the businesses between beer, wine, and spirits?
Rob Sands: Well, I think that the answer to your question is again, kind of some and some. It is obviously opportunistic in that you can't necessarily predict that there's going to be a willing seller of the things that we would like to acquire at the price that we would like to acquire it. So it is opportunistic in that regard. It's also strategic in that you know, clearly premiumization is an important part of the strategy whether it's wine, beer, or spirits. Margin enhancement is important to us as we look at various opportunities across the three segments, which goes back of course to the premiumization element of the strategy. And also obviously buying things that are sort of in the right place at the right time is important to us. You know, you look at wine, and clearly all the big growth in wine right now is in these higher price points like The Prisoner. You look at beer, it's almost the same in that it's better beer and higher price points that are driving that market. I think Ballast Point is a great example of that. I mean, that's like at the highest end of the beer market and it’s got the fastest growth of any major craft brewer. It's almost a little contradictory in the sense that it would be the highest price and have the highest growth, but that's what makes it as attractive as it is. And then spirits is an interesting segment as well, and we made a couple of small acquisitions in the craft spirits space over the last 12 months. One called the Crafthouse Cocktails where we bought a minority interest in a brand that we think has the potential to be a very fast growing, high margin business. And then another bourbon brand recently again, that we think has the potential to be high margin, high growth too. But spirits I'd say is a little less developed from an opportunity point of view right now. The global spirits brand picture, I don't necessarily see us really playing in that. It's not of great interest. It's a market that's somewhat under pressure even in the segments that are growing pretty well, i.e., brown spirits and bourbon, but it's not really our sweet spot. But craft spirits much like craft beers is pretty interesting, but much more developmental in that the craft spirits business is much less developed than the craft beer, and the brands are even smaller, okay, than in craft beer. But we look at that segment too. I'd just add one other thing; our strategy is as it relates to capital allocation, acquisitions, really hasn't changed, okay. We're not on an acquisition bender or anything to that effect. We're going to continue to be highly strategic, look at opportunities as they arise as we always have. Obviously our strategy has changed a lot over the years. Now it's really about where we've taken advantage of opportunities. It's about buying sort of tuck-in, high growth, high margin, easy to assimilate type opportunities. So I guess as I said, the answer to your question is some and some. It's strategic, but it's also opportunistic. As we go forward here we intend to maintain, more importantly, our discipline on capital allocation, all of the things that we've said being a priority: reducing debt, returning dollars and value to shareholders, and making occasional strategic acquisitions as they come along, and maintaining our debt levels sort of in that three range where we said.
Rob Ottenstein: That's great. And just in terms of the targeted leverage ratio, I think you've said 3.5 to 4, given the outlook in terms of CapEx spending, as well as your very strong cash flows, how for the right acquisition would you be willing to go much over four times in the next year or so?
Rob Sands: We don't have any plans in that regard.
Rob Ottenstein: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Herzog: Good morning.
Rob Sands: Hi, Bonnie. Hi. I just have a question on or a follow on question on beer pricing. Clearly your net beer pricing was strong in Q4, and I guess I was hoping you could drill down between how much was from rate versus brand mix versus channel mix? And then assuming you saw positive channel mix, how much of that was driven by greater distribution in the high margin C-store channel?
David Klein: Yes, Bonnie, most of the pricing benefits that we've seen are really just overall price across the portfolio, across markets. And we would have expected it to be fairly heavy in the previous quarter because of the price increase that we implemented in October of this past year.
Bonnie Herzog: And then are you seeing increased penetration of the C-store channel, I know that's been a focus of yours as an opportunity.
David Klein: Yes, we continued to improve in that category.
Bonnie Herzog: Okay. And then maybe one final quick question on your Tail [ph] brands. I was just hoping you could give us a sense of how some of the Tail beer brands performed last year and then how meaningful you think these can become to your overall portfolio in the next couple of years? Thanks.
David Klein: Yes, we think that we will see growth in the mid to high single digits.
Bonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel.
Mark Swartzberg: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys.
Rob Sands: Hi, Mark.
Mark Swartzberg: I guess, two topics; one beer, one Canada partial IPO one. On beer, David, really nice progression with the gross margin over the course of fiscal '16, about 300 bps up and then - on an annual basis, and then in the fourth quarter we saw it about 380 bps up. So I'm wondering if there's anything unusual in that progression and the progression which improved as the year progressed, as we think about how to balance the gross margin in our fiscal '17 estimates and the level of SG&A increases. And then kind of hand in hand with that, we saw like a 40% increase in SG&A in the quarter, $35 million. Can you give us some sense of what was in that $35 million number?
David Klein: Yes, so from a margin standpoint, the fourth quarter was really impacted primarily by price and mix. And I guess we would have again expected that because fourth quarter being when we implement our price increases, we would have benefited from the favorable FX and commodities environment, which we benefited from throughout the course of the year, but there was strong tail wind from that in Q4 as well. And your other question, Mark?
Mark Swartzberg: Was the - that benefit you just described in the fourth quarter was in a sense eaten up by a relatively large increase in SG&A, $35 million, 40% increase. Can you just speak to what was in that $35 million number?
David Klein: So in terms of total SG&A, we would be - we saw increases in marketing. We saw increases in compensation expense. We had some increases that would have come into our number on a year-over-year basis as a result of the Ballast Point acquisition.
Mark Swartzberg: Got it. Okay, great. And then with the Canada partial IPO, I mean kind of the elephant in the room of course is partial and IPO and Canada being this continent called North America like, is this the beginning of something larger, and I realize you're not going to say oh yes, we intend to IPO our larger wine and spirits business eventually. But is it unreasonable to think that this creates optionality for you, should you decide to ever go down that road? And then hand in hand with that, because it is obviously a leading question, it seems to me that all the merits that you're offering for Canada in terms of how it's performing and so forth, are merits that you could offer for your US business even to a greater degree. So just help me with kind of what's wrong with that thinking or what's right about that thinking?
Rob Sands: Yes, I think that what's right about - we'll start with what's right about it, okay. Just to be nice. I think what's right about it is yes, this kind of thing does provide a greater degree of optionality for us of which it's precisely that, optionality. We don't - other than what we currently have planned, we don't necessarily - we're not planning anything else, but clearly it gives us more optionality. As it relates to the rest of the business, I think that you really can't draw any implications from that. We kind of look around the business and we see what we think are the opportunities, and again, this fits into our whole capital allocation strategy, right, managing debt, being able to return money to shareholders through dividends, stock repurchases, as well as being able to make some strategic acquisitions from time to time. So we're just trying to be prudent in a number of - I'd say we're trying to be transparent, we're trying to show where we think that there's value that isn't necessarily recognized, and then we're also trying to be prudent in our - I'll say, use of capital and where that capital comes from. Does that make sense?
Mark Swartzberg: Great. Yes, it makes a ton of sense and really, I don't think anyone was looking for a Canada IPO, so kind of it's impressive to see you guys kind of offering that optionality. So thank you, Rob.
Rob Sands: Well, appreciate that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Actually this is Stephanie on for Bill. I just have a quick question, and I apologize if I missed it. Did you give what's the sales base for the Prisoner acquisition was?
David Klein: No, we didn't other than to say the Prisoner brands themselves in aggregate represent about 175,000 cases.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then maybe you could kind of give a little bit of an update on the Meiomi acquisition that you did and how it’s tracking along with your plans, and any opportunities you may have with that going forward?
David Klein: I would say from my perspective Meiomi continues to track actually better than our original expectations when we did the acquisition. The most recent 12 weeks or at least the 12 weeks in IRI that coincided with the end of our fiscal year had it up, the brand up 88%. And as we said when we originally spoke about the transaction, it has one of the best gross profit margin profiles within our entire wine portfolio, and we've continued to see that and in fact improved upon that a little bit. So we're very pleased with how we've progressed with Meiomi.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And then just a follow up, so looking at Prisoner, they would have kind of like a similar margin profile, kind of higher than the corporate average, but not so high as Meiomi, is that the right way to look at it?
David Klein: That's the right way to look at it. It probably does come - actually line up fairly well with Meiomi.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it. Well, thanks so much for the color.
Rob Sands: Sure.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.
Peter Graham: Hi, this is Peter Graham on for John. Just one quick question from me. As you guys build up and acquire more wine assets are you going to need to add more capacity similar to what you guys did on the beer side? Thanks.
David Klein: We wouldn't expect to. Our intention for the business is to continue to milk the low end of the portfolio and to drive growth and increase profitability at the high end of the portfolio. So we will continue to have that consistent capital requirement in our wine business that we've seen over the past several years, but we just - our intent is to make it work harder.
Peter Graham: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I'll now return the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Okay, well thank you, everyone. As we wrap up our discussion of the fourth quarter and FY16 results, I want to reiterate how pleased I am with our year end success and how we are positioned for continued growth and financial strength in fiscal '17. As our guidance shows, we are confident in our ability to continue achieving growth and we are firm in our commitment to deliver shareholder value. We look forward to the next time we speak with you in early July when we will share the results of our first quarter of our new fiscal year. But before then we hope you'll pick up a few of our fine products for your spring celebrations, including Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day weekend. And speaking of Cinco, you can look for us at the New York Stock Exchange on May 5th as we officially kick off our Cinco Happy Hour by ringing the closing bell. Thanks and have a great day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Constellation Brands’ Third Quarter FY'16 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Constellation’s conference call. In addition to our third quarter fiscal '16 results and outlook, we will also discuss our Mexicali and Nava brewery projects and their related outlook. I’m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news releases or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company’s estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings. Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we limit the number of questions asked during the Q&A session today to two questions per person. This has been our practice for the last few quarters and helps us to end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance, and now here is Rob.
Rob Sands: Thanks Patty, and good morning and happy New Year to everybody. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had the opportunity to include some of our fine Constellation products in your celebrations with family and friends. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation’s third quarter fiscal 2016 sales and earnings results. Before we get started with the review of the quarter, I am pleased to report that we posted another year of exceptional stock price performance with Constellation's stock increasing more than 45% for calendar year 2015 versus the S&P 500, which declined 1% for the year. This is the fourth consecutive year that Constellation was one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. I believe this excellent stock price performance is being driven by our strong financial results led by our beer business, which has incredible momentum and strong prospects for future growth. It is because of this tremendous growth opportunity that we're making smart investments now to ensure that we have the capacity, quality, control, and flexibility to help us meet expected demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future. These investments include the construction of a new state-of-the-art brewery in Mexicali, Mexico. Details of our plans were announced earlier this morning. Initially, this brewery will be built to operate at 10 million hectoliters of production capacity with future scalability to 20 million hectoliters. The Mexicali location is ideal given its close proximity to the State of California, Constellation's largest beer market. The new brewery is being built with similar technology and operational advancements as our Nava brewery and is designed to ensure consistency in brewing and production processes with the highest level of product quality expected between the two facilities. Let's take a moment to discuss the progress at our Nava facility, which had production capacity of 10 million hectoliters with the ability to expand at the time we acquired it. As previously discussed, we currently have work underway to expand Nava to 25 million hectoliters by the summer of calendar 2017 via three incremental 5 million hectoliter expansions. In addition to our plans to build the Mexicali brewery, we also announced today that we have plans to further expand Nava with a 2.5 million hectoliter capacity expansion that will bring production from 25 to 27.5 million hectoliters when completed in early calendar year 2018. Now, I am pleased to report that as expected our first incremental 5 million hectoliters of Nava production capacity recently became operational and is in the process of ramping to optimal capacity utilization levels. We now have 15 million hectoliters of functioning brewing capacity at Nava. Two packaging lines have been running to support this new brewing capacity and ramp up to full utilization is expected shortly for these lines, which will provide additional capacity for premium glass products like Modelo Especial and Coronitas. The second incremental 5 million hectoliters of new brewing capacity at Nava is underway with this piece of the expansion to be expected to be completed by June of this year and work continues on the third expansion phase as we increase Nava production capacity from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters and continue to expand the rail and logistics capability around the site with completion expected by the summer of calendar 2017. As these expansion activities continue, we've worked with ABI to extend the interim supply agreement we currently have in place for finished goods in order to support our robust growth and enable a smooth transition as we increase capacity. This agreement is expected to remain in place through June 2017 for a select number of products. They’re expected to represent about 15% to 20% of the company's need for the U.S. marketplace. Overall, we remain on track with all expansion activities, and I am excited to be in a position to continue investing in Mexico and enhancing our operational platform to support the industry-leading growth levels of our incredible beer business. Our additional investments in production capacity are designed to ensure that we're well positioned to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, which has consistently grown in the mid-to-high single digit range and is expected to grow at these levels into the foreseeable future. Our third quarter beer results are a testament to this momentum. As we achieved depletion growth of more than 16% leading volume gains amongst all U.S. brewers and outperforming the U.S. beer industry, key competitors and all other imports with double digit growth achieved by nearly every brand, every brand in our Mexican beer portfolio. Corona Extra posted accelerating depletion in consumer takeaway trends during the quarter by gaining distribution for key packages, accelerating velocities behind investments in media and merchandizing and continuing to grow the can format, which represented nearly 25% of the growth of the Corona Extra brand during the quarter. Marketing initiatives for the brand included Corona Football with Jon Gruden, two major boxing matches, general market and Hispanic TV advertising throughout the fall, football, tailgating season, and the airing of the O Tannenbaum holiday spot for the 25th consecutive year. Modelo Especial also delivered accelerating depletion growth of more than 20% during the third quarter with all core Especial packages growing double digits. This brand's media investments included the continuation of Modelo Especial National English Language TV and video campaign with the addition of sports programming during the start of the NFL Season across CBS, FOX, ESPN, and ESPN 2. And National Hispanic Media continued throughout the quarter with weekly TV exposure to Spanish language consumers. Now given some of these marketing highlights, it’s important to note that the beer team was recently recognized by earning a top spot on Ad Age's 2015 Marketer's A list. Constellation is the only beer wine and spirits company to make the list and I’m very, very proud of this accomplishment. Collectively these activities resulted in Modelo Especial becoming the number one dollar share gainer amongst established U.S. beer brands in the IRI channels during the third quarter followed by Corona Extra as the number two share gainer. Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in the third quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's EPS guidance for fiscal 2016. David will have more to say about this in a few moments. When you put all of these pieces together, the exceptional growth of strong consumer demand for our Mexican beer brands, the exciting opportunity to invest in Mexico to expand our brewery operations, and the on-schedule progress we're making to meet our expansion goals, it is clearly an exciting time at Constellation where the opportunities to build upon our growth as a leader in the high end of the U.S. beer segment keeps getting better and better. As you know, we acted upon another such opportunities for the future growth and we entered the U.S. craft beer market with the acquisition of Ballast Point, one of the most awarded major craft breweries in the industry. Ballast Point provides a high growth premium platform that will enable Constellation to compete in the fast growing Craft Beer segment, further strengthening our position in the high end of the U.S. beer market. Now Ballast Point is currently growing at more than 125% in IRI channels and remains on track to sell nearly four million cases and generate approximately $115 million in net sales for calendar 2015, representing growth of more than 100% versus the prior calendar year. I’m pleased to welcome the Ballast Point Founder, Jack White and the entire Ballast Point team to Constellation and now I would like to discuss the business results for our Wine and Spirits business. In our Wine and Spirits business during the third quarter, we achieved earnings growth and strong margin expansion driven primarily by the Meiomi Wine acquisition as well as favorable mix and COGS trend. As I mentioned last quarter, we have successfully integrated into our New Meiomi Wine brand into our existing wine portfolio and our efforts to expand distribution are working to drive incremental growth for the brand. As a matter of fact, the most recent IRI trends corresponding with our quarterly results show that the Meiomi Pinot Noir is growing more than 80% in IRI channels, a trend which has accelerated since we first acquired the brand this past summer. Third quarter depletions for the brand were also strong across all channels growing more than 50%. Meiomi Pinot Noir is one of the hottest wines of the year listed as Number 20 in the Wine Spectator's Top 100 Wines for 2015 and number one on wine.com’s Top 100 list which is based entirely on consumer preferences. We believe the brand has plenty of room to continue driving healthy growth for our business. Just this quarter we began shipping the 2014 vintage -- 2014 vintage of Meiomi chardonnay following the success of the 2013 chardonnay in the marketplace. Our Mark West brand is also known as a leader in the premium Pinot Noir category and we’re pleased to announce that the new line extension Mark West Black is now shipping. This higher priced tier of the Mark West brand welcomes consumer to the dark side of Pinot Noir with a more full bodied and rich taste profile. And one of our newer brand Tom Gore Vineyards is regaining consumer acceptance for its high quality in authentic second generation grape farmer brand story. It has also been featured in publications like Wine Enthusiasts celebrating wine around the world in the Wall Street Journal's My Ride series. Our focused brands are gaining again driving positive results for the quarter in our Wine and Spirits portfolio led by brands like Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, which is America’s favorite Cabernet holding the number one Cabernet Sauvignon position with the highest dollar and volume sales. Other focus brand leaders include Kim Crawford, which was named number one or number 11, I’m sorry, on wine.com's top 100 wines of 2015 and The Dreaming Tree, which launched its Pinot Noir varietal earlier this year. Our luxury brand, Antares, continued to maintain their reputation for excellence among the critics, with outstanding reviews breaking 90-plus scores for our brands like Robert Mondavi Winery, Simi and Mt. Veeder from publications like The Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiasts and Wine and Spirits. During the quarter our spirits portfolio posted net sales growth of 2% driven by Paul Masson Grande Amber peach flavor as well as SVEDKA Vodka Mango Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade flavors. Casa Noble Tequila is exceeding our expectations so far this year with continuing share gains and was recently awarded a 94 point score in the Wine Enthusiasts and a top 10 best Tequila designation by liquor.com. In closing, it is certainly shaping to be yet another eventful year at Constellation. With the year quickly drawing to a close, I’m very pleased with our progressed to date. Our efforts have produced a year of strong financial performance, notable business and brand milestones, industry accolades and healthy growth within several areas of the business. I’m particularly pleased that we have finalized our investment plans in Mexicali, Mexico to support the future growth we’ve seen within our beer business and we're working intelligently on the Nava brewery and glass plant expansions while maintaining the strong momentum of the commercial side of the beer business. In Calendar 2015 amid all of our hardworking accomplishments achieved throughout the year we also celebrated the 70th anniversary of our Company founding. While we are proud of our most recent accomplishments taking a longer view of our 70-year heritage gives us perspective of how far we have come and even greater results to continue challenging our own expectations as we look forward to the next 70 years. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein for a financial discussion of our third quarter results.
David Klein: Thank you, Rob and good morning everyone. Let’s start with some Q3 highlights. Comparable basis diluted EPS was up 15%. Stellar execution by the beer business drove strong marketplace and financial results for the quarter. The strong beer performance along with some slight favorability in our tax rate and better than expected Meiomi results are driving our full year fiscal '16 comparable basis diluted EPS projection up to a range of $5.30 to $5.40 versus our previous guidance range of $5 to $5.20. Operational activities related to brining new capacity online at Nava continue to progress as planned. And the beer business performance timing of capital expenditures related to the Nava expansion and lower than planned income tax payments are helping to increase our fiscal '16 free cash flow projection to a range of $475 million to $525 million versus our previous range of $200 million to $300 million. In addition to our quarterly results we recently completed the Ballast Point Craft beer acquisition and this morning we outlined our plans to build a new $10 million hectoliter brewery in Mexicali, Mexico and further expand our Nava brewery. Let’s take a closure look at all of this activity starting with our Q3 results where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Consolidated net sales on an organic constant currency basis grew 6% for the quarter. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth coming in over 16%. Beer net sales increased 8% on volume growth that came in a little under 7%. Beer net sales growth for the quarter was impacted by the overlap of a shift of approximately $2 million cases and $37 million of net sales from Q2 fiscal '15 into Q3 fiscal '15 related to the beer product recall. In addition to that activity, wholesalers also increased their inventory position during the third quarter of fiscal '15 to bring inventory more in line with historical levels. Even the Q3 fiscal '15 overlap just mentioned, it is worth noting that beer net sales growth for the first nine months of fiscal '16 totaled 11% and we now expect full year fiscal '16 beer net sales growth to be in the range of 12% to 14%. Wine and Sprits' net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects favorable mix across the business. As mentioned by Rob, Meiomi continues to demonstrate excellent marketplace momentum as the brand generated approximately $35 million of incremental sales during the quarter. For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $89 million up 13% with gross margin increasing 280 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $58 million primarily due to volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS. Our beer gross profit margin increased 360 basis points to 48.9%. Wine and Spirits' gross profit was up $31 million. This primarily reflects the benefit from the Meiomi acquisition, favorable mix and lower COGS. Wine and Spirits' gross profit margin increased 190 basis points to 43.6%. Consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $29 million. This reflects marketing investments made by the Beer and Wine and Spirits businesses. Corporate expense was up due primarily through an increase in payroll related taxes associated with employee stock option exercises, higher incentive compensation expense and investments to support the growth of the business including the establishment of our Chief Growth Officer of Function. We continue to expand margins across the business as consolidated operating income increased $61 million and consolidated operating margin improved 210 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 360 basis points to 35.1% and Wine and Spirits' operating margin improved 170 basis points to 27.5%. Equity earnings increased $6 million due to strong results for Opus One. Interest expense for the quarter was $76 million down 12%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of November our debt totaled $7.4 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $6.9 billion, a decrease of $326 million since the end of fiscal 2015. This primarily reflects our free cash flow generation, partially offset by the funding for the Meiomi acquisition. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.5 times at the end of Q3. Even with the funding of the Ballast Point acquisition, we expect to end fiscal '16 below the four times level. Additionally, we continue to expect fiscal '16 interest expense to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 32.3% compared to 29.2% last year, which reflected the benefit of certain tax credits. We now expect our full year tax rate to approximate 30%. Now let’s review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first nine months of fiscal '16, we generated $578 million of free cash flow compared to $209 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.1 billion versus $750 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily generated by the Beer business. Given higher projected earnings for the Beer business and lower projected income tax payments, we now expect to generate operating cash flow in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion for fiscal '16. CapEx for the first nine months of fiscal '16 totaled $514 million and was slightly below our CapEx spending from the same timeframe last year. While our initial $10 million hectoliter expansion at Nava continues to progress as planned, payment timing for some of the capital expenditures associated with this activity has shifted into fiscal 2017. In a few moments, I will outline the CapEx requirements we're targeting for the New Mexicali brewery and the additional 2.5 million hectoliter expansion at Nava. Even with the incremental capital expenditures projected from these initiatives, we are decreasing our total capital expenditure estimate for 2016 to a range of $875 million to $925 million versus our previous guidance of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16. Due to the factors just mentioned, we now expect fiscal '16 free cash flow to be in the range of $475 million to $525 million. Now let’s move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook. As discussed earlier, we are increasing our comparable basis diluted EPS projection to $5.30 to $5.40. Our fiscal '16 comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. For the Wine and Spirits business, we continue to expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single digit range. Meiomi’s volume performance has exceeded our initial expectations and we now expect fiscal '16 diluted EPS accretion from this acquisition to be around $0.07 to $0.08 versus our previous $0.03 to $0.04 accretion projection. The beer business is the primary driver of our diluted EPS guidance increase. We now expect volume growth of 10% to 12%, a net sales growth of 12% to 14% and operating income growth in the range of 22% to 24% before any benefit from the Ballast Point acquisition. We closed the Ballast Point acquisition in December. We funded the $1 billion purchase price with a combination of net proceeds from the issuance of $400 million of 4.75% senior notes during 2025, followings under our accounts receivable securitization facilities and cash on hand. For Calendar 2015, Ballast Point is expected to sell nearly $4 million cases and generate approximately $115 million in sales. On a comparable basis the acquisition is expected to be neutral to diluted EPS for fiscal '16 and $0.05 to $0.06 accretive for fiscal '17. Our current beer segment guidance as is targeting beer operating margin of approximately 34% to 35% for fiscal '16. The improvement versus our previous 34% target primarily relates to Q3 benefiting from lower depreciation as well as lower line commissioning and optimization cost than originally anticipated. Now that this incremental capacity has become operational, we expect these costs to ramp up in the fourth quarter. We're pleased that we have already achieved our mid 30% operating margin goal for our beer business. We expect the beer operating margin to continue to run in the mid 30% range over the next one to two years as we still have much to accomplish at Nava and expect some margin volatility as we bring online and optimize new capacity. As Rob mentioned earlier, we have extended the interim supply agreement with ABI to ensure a smooth transition as we increase capacity. This could temper our operating margin expansion in fiscal '17 as utilization at Nava will likely run below the utilization targeted before the extension of the supply agreement. Speaking up capacity Rob also outlined our plans to build a new $10 million hectoliter brewery in Mexicali and further expand capacity at our Nava brewery. In the press release we issued this morning we included a table summarizing the collective investments we're marking in our Mexican operating platform. Let me provide a few highlights around the capital expenditures associated with this activity starting with Nava. The additional $2.5 million hectoliters we are adding to Nava is estimated to cross approximately $250 million. This combined with our previously announced Nava brewery and glass plant expansion projects puts our total targeted Nava capital expenditures at $2.5 billion. After fiscal '16 we expect to spend $1.1 billion over the fiscal '17 and '18 timeframe with most of that occurring in fiscal '17. The new 10 million hectoliter Mexicali brewery is expected to cost $1.5 billion and associated land, water rights and infrastructure and other site requirements to accommodate scalability to 20 million hectoliters is estimated at $500 million. For this total $2 billion investment, we expect some initial spend to occur in fiscal '16, a little over half of the spend to come in fiscal '17 and '18 and the remaining spend to happen in the fiscal '19 to fiscal '21 timeframe. Given the strong demand we see for our beer portfolio and our best-in-class margin profile, the investments I just outlined are expected to generate high returns with a fast payback. Even with the capital requirements associated with these initiatives, our strong projected earnings in operating cash flow will allow us to operate below our targeted four times leverage range and continue to provide us with significant capital allocation flexibility. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian: Hey good morning. So it's obviously been a great couple of years here on the beer business for steady acceleration. I was hoping maybe you could take a step back on the Modelo Especial brand which has driven a lot of the growth and peel back how much of that growth has been driven by distribution expansion in the last couple of years versus organic sales growth per distribution point? And then more importantly, how sustainable is that as you look going forward over the next few years in both buckets and particularly in terms of how much distribution expansion is left to the brand? Thanks.
Rob Sands: Yes clearly it’s been both. It’s been both distribution and expansion as Modelo Especial as I’ll say migrated to the general market, and as of course we have begun our general market advertising for the brand and Velocity has also increased. So, I think that there is plenty of room left for Modelo Especial distribution expansion. It does not have the ACV of, say Corona Extra. Right now the ACV on Modelo Especial is about 65%. So we see lots of room for continued expansion in both distribution, and we see opportunity for expansion of Velocity, i.e. sales per point of distribution as the brand continues to gain momentum with general market consumers. So, this is a real growth story for beer in general not only just for Constellation brands, it’s a phenomenon.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay. And then on the Corona brand that’s obviously accelerated nicely this year or last year, I should say now, cans are driving a big piece of that, but it looks like glass is also doing very well and even more so probably if you assume some cannibalization on it. So we’re just hoping for an update on what’s driving the overall brand acceleration in your mind over the last few quarters here? Is it mainly cans or do you think there are other factors behind it and the sustainability of those factors going forward, thanks?
Rob Sands: Well, cans only I think represented about 25% of the growth of Corona Extra. So, I shouldn’t say only. It did represent a significant portion of the growth, but clearly cans has been very important, but growing more importantly is our continued increased investment in the brand behind our marketing activities as well as investments in SG&A, basically our sales organization as well. So we’re investing, I would say even ahead of the growth on Corona Extra and we’re investing very effectively probably more importantly in the brand. I've talked about the consistency of our advertising. Clearly, that advertising and marketing works, and therefore when we do invest more, we see the results of those investments. So it's a very strong brand with a very strong marketing campaign behind it.
Dara Mohsenian: Okay. That’s helpful, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Rob Sands: Hi Judy.
Judy Hong: Thank you. Hi how are you? So couple of questions, first just on the brewery capacity expansions, if I think about the expansion you’re doing for the next few years, by end of Calendar '19, it looks like you will be getting to about 32.5 million hectoliters, which implies a CAGR of around mid teen level. So, I was just hoping to sort of get your color just in terms of how this jives with your volume outlook over the next few years and to the extent that if you see some changes in terms of that trajectory, how much flexibility do you have to either expand more quickly or scale back on that expansion?
Rob Sands: Yes, so the only thing I would say about that and I will let David comment in more detail on it is that that's maximum capacity. Okay, no one runs breweries flat out 24/7. So I don’t think that you can take those numbers and just assume that we’re going to utilize 100% of the capacity. In fact, our important element of brewery expansion is to make sure that we have the total capacity okay to run these breweries at, I’d say more normalized production levels as opposed to absolutely flat out which isn’t the best way to run a brewery. So David did you want to comment more on that?
David Klein: Yeah I’d say from a growth rate perspective Judy, we’re still focused on the high-single digit kind of growth rate that we're seeing in the high end beer business as being applicable to our business, right. So that’s point one. So we’re not expecting outsized growth beyond the high end of the beer business in order to support the capacity we're putting in. And I would say the second thing is that having the capacity in a redundant facility on the West Coast closest to our biggest market is actually very important to us, and in and of itself generates a return.
Judy Hong: Okay. And then the second question is just on your Ballast acquisition and just broadly your craft beer strategy. So on the craft -- on the Ballast acquisition, I think some people have looked at the billion dollar price tag in the context of the current volume size and thought it was at the high end of some of the recent deals. So if you can sort of give us your view of why that price tag was appropriate and the growth opportunities perhaps beyond may be even distribution expansion that you see with Ballast? And then more broadly if you think about your ambition to really get bigger in the craft beer industry, do you think that you would have to have more collection of some of the more regional brands and expand distribution or more of a large scale kind of brand like Ballast and just getting more scale with that brand.
Rob Sands: Yeah, so purchase price and size of the brand, first of all the purchase price is not related to the size of the brand. It's related to the growth percentage and the size of the brand, okay. So obviously the multiple that we paid for it in relationship to the growth is actually a pretty reasonable purchase price, right. As you recall from my initial comments, the brand grew over 100% this year and 125% in IRI. So, when you look at purchase price at multiple as a function of growth rate, it’s pretty reasonable, and we don’t see that growth rate changing much in the short term. So, we expect another pretty robust year with Ballast Point. Also you’ve got to realize that Ballast Point has the highest average retail selling price basically of any significantly size craft, right. If you go buy some Ballast Point, you’re going to see the Ballast Point sales for around $15, $16 a six pack okay versus competitors that you'll see at under $10 or just a bit over $10 a six pack. So it’s a very, very high growth, high margin product. Now, our strategy with Ballast Point is actually pretty simple and it's why we were so particularly interested in the brand, which is our strategy is we don’t really have to do too much other than what they’re doing right now. The key to Ballast Point is maintaining the growth, and I think the maintenance of the growth is going to be a function of maintenance of the award-winning stature and high quality of the brand. It's a very sought after product. All of the people, all of the people that have been involved in making Ballast Point what it is today continue that’s Jack White the founder, it’s Jim Buechler, the CEO, all of these people are brew masters. The incredible group of people that we have there continue to be 100% behind the brand and has continued very enthusiastically with Constellation. Part of the motivation for that wine to sell the business to Constellation was of all the buyers they saw Constellation as the best fit because of our incredibly strong position in the beer industry, and the fact that we're only a high end beer manufacturer and seller as well as being in the high end of the wine business, which makes us a completely different animal. Okay, we're not big beer okay in the sense of want to being one of the two U.S. premium domestic producers. So the strategy with Ballast Point is all about continuing to do what the company has been doing. And I would say bringing incrementally to that some of the areas where I think that Constellation can be of help and that would be with major key accounts, and I would say other places where a smaller company won’t necessarily have the ability to play right off the bat.
Judy Hong: Okay. It’s $18.99 per six pack in Manhattan, but I hear you on the pricing point and thanks for the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg: Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congratulations and also to the Crown Team, very impressive trends here. I guess two questions. Hey Rob two questions, one is just as you think about the third quarter depletion number of plus 16% and change, obviously a great number. Is there anything in that number that you think is unique to the quarter either weather or some particular practice you engaged in that, that would cause the depletion trend to take down? I really don’t mean to get at like weather it’s going to be 12% or 10% or 15% in the fourth quarter, I’m just trying to get it like what's underlying the kind of performance that might go away as we all try to update our models and think about sustainable growth and then I had Ballast Point question after that.
Rob Sands: Yes, Mark we try not to factor in weather all that much, but clearly a warmer fourth quarter was beneficial I think for our beer business. I would also say that we continued some of the activity that we had been working throughout the first two quarters related to marketing spend along with the NFL and within other venues to continue to drive the brands, but I don’t think it’s anything outside of those items.
Mark Swartzberg: That’s great. Okay. And then on Ballast Point, I want to try to the probe a little bit more on the consumer proposition and we’ve all seen the multiple and I still want to press here it’s clear on what the distribution opportunity you present for a brand that already has some pretty clear distribution opportunities because of its award winning qualities. But I’m kind of still stuck on the consumer proposition from a longer term perspective, when I hear you emphasize growth in a multiple and reminded of wine deals in the past going back far enough where growth was a rationale. And then when I look at the Craft Beer segment, I think the segment has been around for a long time and we argue over whether there is more than really one brand. Sam Adams has become a national brand and really has that sessionability associated with it. And then the price point and the IPA like these are not brands that you see people kind of having and you get a group of five people together. One is going to be having Skull and one's going to be having another craft beer. So it just doesn’t seem to have lend itself to being a big brand away your imported beer portfolio does. So could you just speak about that consumer proposition and how you’re thinking about that?
Rob Sands: Yes, I think that there is opportunity okay for Ballast Point to become a big brand and when we say big okay, I think that that maybe a relative kind of a number. We’re not talking volumetrically Bud Light big okay.
Mark Swartzberg: Got you.
Rob Sands: But versus where it is right now okay it can be a lot bigger and if you look at the competitors in the marketplace and where they are volumetrically okay that implies a huge amount of growth for Ballast Point. And obviously it’s a kind of price point and margins that we’re talking about, big is a relative term. So you look at some of the other competitors and we clearly see plenty of correct brands in the 10 to 30-plus million case ranges right and we start out at 4 million cases right now as we end the year with over 100% growth rate and incredible margins. So things are relative. I think that what we're really talking here financially is about the kind of contribution right economically and financially that Ballast Point can make to our bottom line. With all that said, maintaining the quality in the award winning position of the brand with craft consumers is going to be key to that and I’m a 100% sure that the team that's running Ballast Point will do that. We have some unbelievable great new products that are coming out like a Watermelon, Dorado, which is Double IPA. These are very breakthrough products that I think are going to potentially set the craft well vis-à-vis the consumers on fire. So that’s why it's been so successful. We’ve got in an totally award winning team producing these products and an incredible innovation behind it.
Mark Swartzberg: No, that’s helpful. Then watermelon actually sounds like it will bring in women. So, okay, so that's very helpful. Okay, great. Thank you, Rob.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.
Vivien Azer: Hi, good morning. So I wanted to follow up on Ballast Point as well and then I’ve got a follow-up question on beer. So on Ballast, the growth is clearly remarkable. But as I understand it, the company did enter some new market. So I’m curious as you guys think about fiscal '17 sustaining that growth like how much of your accretion expectation and topline expectations are dependent on new distribution opportunities?
Rob Sands: Well, you’re talking about this year?
Vivien Azer: Yes for calendar '16, yeah.
Rob Sands: Well, we obviously are giving guidance for our next fiscal year, but we don’t see anything impeding our Ballast Point performance in general. There will continue to be expanded distribution and Ballast Point continues to increase its velocity per point of distribution even in its major markets where its already a big brand like its old market in San Diego. So, we don’t see any real catalyst for change in that regard. The company will continue to expand its distribution and I think it will be very successful in doing so.
Vivien Azer: Fair enough. That’s perfect and then on beer, David I appreciate the two call outs in terms of kind of the disconnect between shipments and depletions being the bottler recall in the wholesaler inventory true up. But I’m still having a hard time kind of getting comfortable with the delta given how large it was. Is there anything else that was driving that disconnect?
David Klein: Yeah, I think we brought because depletions accelerated the way they did in Q3, our wholesaler inventory dropped a little bit kind of on a year-over-year basis and we’re comfortable in getting those back in line by year end. So, I think that may be the other component if you feel there is a disconnect there, Vivien, but everything but we that’s why we took our guidance up for the year basically across all of our P&L line items.
Vivien Azer: Understood, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.
Rob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Like to switch over a little bit to the wine business. Two questions on wine. One big picture in terms of the industry, can you talk a little bit -- there is I guess is some data that there was a slowing of the wine industry in 2015. So perhaps you can address that and trends in pricing? And then second more specifically on Meiomi, perhaps give us a little bit of color in terms of what you're doing differently with the brand and why it's beating your expectations? Thank you.
Rob Sands: Yeah, I think it's the opposite Robert. The Wine industry has actually accelerated quite considerably and as probably as we sit here right now one of the most robust points that it's ever been and you look at IRI dollars for the last 12 weeks, the wine industry has accelerated over 6% growth. And probably even more importantly if you look at the Premium Plus Segment, which is a segment of $8 plus, okay, which is what we would be primarily interested in okay, the industry has accelerated to double digit growth in dollar terms over the last 12 weeks, 11.2% at the industry, okay. And then as it relates to Meiomi, okay number one basically the brand has a tremendous amount of momentum in and of itself. Okay, we bring a lot to that party. Obviously we bring distribution strength. We bring strength where we’re major players, number one players for that matter with key customers. If you look at our position today in beverage alcohol, total beverage alcohol okay, which is really important and you look at major customers like the mass merchandisers like the big grocery chains, when you combine our beverage alcohol portfolio okay we tend to be a number one supplier certainly in terms of the kind of profit that we’re providing these key customers. So that’s been helpful in driving the Meiomi results as well and you know also I think like everything okay whether we’re talking Corona, whether we’re talking Modelo Especial, whether we’re talking Meiomi, it’s all about the consumer voting with their feet all right. Meiomi has just a tremendous amount of consumer acceptance and that’s building. So it’s a very, very strong brand and I've talked about this before somewhat of a unique taste profile for Pinot Noir and it’s fitting squarely into what the consumer is looking for that kind of product. And price point everything, it’s just a tremendous wine by the glass opportunity in higher end on premise venues. So it just meets every kind of criterion for success.
Rob Ottenstein: No but in terms of your expectations you're saying it's looking like it's going to be a good bit more accretive than you thought. Is that because the distribution's going faster? There's an acceleration in velocity or how to think about that?
Rob Sands: All the above.
Rob Ottenstein: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research.
Tim Ramey: Thanks so much. I think those were the best wine margins I've ever seen and I've been hanging around this company for a long time. Any further commentary that you would give us on that? Was there any significant contribution from spirits? Doesn't look like spirits was really the driver in the quarter.
Rob Sands: Yes it’s really premiumization of the portfolio. Tim and you know the wine industry, right now the high end of the wine industry is growing probably better than it’s ever grown before and Meiomi fits right into that. It’s part of our premiumization strategy and as we continue to drive product now in the call it $15 to $20 range, you’re going to see margin expansion because those products have higher margins okay than the lower end of the business. And there continues to be a premiumization shift in the wine industry in general, which Meiomi puts full square into and our increase in margins is directly related to that, but right now the sweet spot of the industry has basically moved up into as I said that sort of $15 to $20 or even above range and margins are significantly better in that range. So we’re operating rather some pretty good external conditions.
Tim Ramey: Sounds good. Well we have some good 2015 bulk pinot. So have your people call my people from the Meiomi…
Rob Sands: We'll give you a call, Tim.
Tim Ramey: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.
John Faucher: Yes. Thank you. Wanted to talk a little bit about, following up on Tim's question here, in terms of the mix impact as we look at the wine business going forward and the potential for, let's say, pricing on top of that. Or is it just going to continue to be the consumer trading up and how do you really track the value that they're getting as they trade up? Do you get better brand differentiation as they trade up and how are consumers really understanding that value equation as you get that mix trade up? Thanks.
Rob Sands: Yes so, yes, I would say that you do get higher quality definitely and perhaps more brand differentiation for sure as you trade up. Wine is a very unique product and there is a lot of differentiation between products and as you move up in price, you're definitely moving up in quality in terms of the type of grapes that are used to make the wine i.e. where do they come from? Did they come from the best places? It certainly comes from -- half of it comes from better places, okay as you move up the price scale and then how the wine is made in particular things that add quite a bit of cost to wine like how much oak is used, it's like, how much of the product is fermented on oak and age of barrels, quality of barrels, whether the wood came from etcetera. So those things both contribute to the quality of the product as well as contribute to the cost and the pricing of the product. What was your other question John?
John Faucher: That basically covers it. And I guess, is it a similar consumer dynamic on the beer side on the wine side -- as we see on the wine side? Obviously, consumers have traded up on wine for years but it seems as though the overall impact on the pricing and the huge price -- the pricing differential as they trade up on beer seems even greater than the pricing differential on wine. I'm wondering if we can see something that pushes that wine differential even further from a mix standpoint. Does that make sense?
Rob Sands: Well, I think so. I think you'll see trading up on wine is accelerating and I think that you’ll continue to see it be extremely robust and I think that you'll continue to see us benefit from that trading up. And oh yeah, you asked about pricing in wine. We're doing -- we both have significant trading up going on within the portfolio and then for our sales growth is running considerably ahead of our volume growth, which is representative of that positive mix shift. And we’re taking pricing where we think that its applicable and that would be in sort of the lower end of our portfolio for instance. Products like Vendange where we're not so focused on, I would say share and volume and there is opportunity to enhance profitability nominally and they're not the most strategic areas of the business. So we’re now into an environment where we are getting the best of the both worlds in that regards. Beer, okay -- yes beer is becoming like wine. The high end of the beer business is a very exciting part of the business because there is huge trading up going on in beer. Okay the consumer is definitely premiumizing, it's premiumizing into our import. They're premiumzing into our import brand. And craft you see the high end of the beer business being very robust. You can see it coming right out of the premium part of the beer. We definitely think that that’s going to continue and although the price differential seems big in beer, okay that’s really in percentage terms okay, is still talking about like a super affordable luxury, way, way even more affordable than wine right. It's a big deal for the consumer to go into a grocery store and buy $225 bottle of wine that's $50 okay, but to trade up to Corona at a dollar a bottle versus whatever else they were purchasing at $0.50 or less a can big percentage increase, but fundamentally not something that takes the product outside of the realm of an affordable luxury. So I don’t think the consumer, and the consumer is proving to be pretty insensitive to those kind of changes at those nominal prices.
John Faucher: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Megan Cody of UBS.
Megan Cody: Hi. Thanks. So obviously your guys pace of growth has been great but my question is as you try to deliver against that growth in the marketplace while also taking on two large scale manufacturing initiatives, while also trying to expand Ballast, how are you guys thinking about execution risk? For example, managing out of stock, service delivery, etcetera?
Rob Sands: We have a very -- we have a lot of confidence in our supply chain in our Mexican beer business right. We’ve been doing this a long time. So we have no concerns about our ability to continue to supply in the U.S. market over the foreseeable future. Thus far our Nava expansion has gone according to plan. We are on schedule and we continue to actually run a little bit ahead of schedule in certain areas in our production build-out. And then lastly on Ballast Point, we are keeping those businesses operating separately. We’re allowing Jim and Jack and the team at Ballast Point to continue to run Ballast Point, working with our beer teams. But we’re not integrating the sales teams in such a way that would cause us to lose focus either at point or in our import beer business.
Megan Cody: Okay. All right. Thank you. And then actually I had a follow-up, an unrelated follow-up. Just from a free cash flow perspective, on one hand you guys are clearly delivering better than expected P&L results. But on the other, you're also increasing CapEx to fund that growth. So looking from a long-term perspective, how do those dynamics impact your free cash flow outlook for the next few years net of this CapEx and then how do you see that being deployed?
David Klein: We believe that we can do -- complete the Nava expansion, complete the Mexicali expansion, stay well within our four times leverage ratio range and still have the flexibility to continue to grow our dividend and do share repurchases and we will remain opportunistic around M&A.
Megan Cody: Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic of SIG.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is actually [Sveto Stefanovich] on behalf of Pablo. We have two questions, please. First, you disclosed beer depletions of 16% but this canned data is pointing to a 20% growth. We realize this difference has been there in recent quarters also. So does this mean that given that your on-premise business is about 15% of sales that your on premise business is down by about 6%? And if this is the case, why would there be such a big gap between your on-premise performance and your off-premise performance?
David Klein: Yes so there is not that bit of a gap between our on-premise and off-premise performance. The IRI measures you’re looking at measure A portion of the off-premise channel not the entirety of it and then when you look at on-premise, we are up in mid to high single digits in the on-premise even though the on-premise channel itself is flat to slightly down. So yes, there is a disconnect between the IRI and depletions, but I would hypothesize that in particular in our beer business that depletion are the best measure of the performance of our business.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. And the second question is, we have been doing a lot of work looking at your beer market share by state and we realize that in border states like New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, you're below you're average national share. And given the demographics, we would expect you to have higher share there. So the question is, should we assume that those states represent a significant distribution expansion opportunity for you or is there something structural that explains the lower shares? Thank you.
David Klein: Yeah I think that it depends on the state, California which is obviously a border state right, we have some of our highest shares right. Southern California our shares are over 20% versus our national share and therefore, twice as much. In other places yeah there is plenty of opportunity, but traditionally our business has been focused on those places and we have tremendous share in the largest population area in the country bordering Mexico which is Southern California.
Unidentified Analyst: Right.
David Klein: Is there opportunity in Texas and Arizona as you've suggested? Yes sure, big opportunity.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you very much. We appreciate it.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Carla Casella of JPMorgan.
Carla Casella: Hi. I'm wondering on the financing side do you contemplate coming back to the market this year and next to pre-fund some of the expansions you've got planned?
Rob Sands: So Carla, we feel comfortable that we will be able to fund the expansion out of operating cash flows. What I would say is that we will likely at least consider our options in coming to the market so that we can continue to layer in a nice maturity ladder of 10 year notes as it makes sense to us. In particular we have a note coming due next September that we would -- that we'll possibly look to come to the market to refinance.
Carla Casella: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I'll now return the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Okay. Well, thanks everybody for joining our call today. Needless to say we're incredibly pleased with our fiscal 2016 year-to-date results. Our beer business has tremendous, tremendous momentum and continues to gain market share and our high return investment in beer production capacity position us to support the significant growth in this business. We're growing EBIT and have significantly improved margins in our wine and spirits business. During our next quarterly call, which is scheduled for early April, we will provide guidance for our upcoming fiscal year. In the interim, we'll be working diligently to continue to execute our strategy and deliver excellent results for the remainder of the year. Thank you again everybody for your participation.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the Constellation Brands' third quarter FY'16 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Constellation’s second quarter fiscal 2016 conference call. I’m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company’s estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings. Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we limit the number of questions asked during Q&A session today to two questions per person. We received Investor feedback in the past indicating that the call ran long because we allowed questioners to ask unlimited questions. So I would appreciate your cooperation in helping us to end our call on schedule this morning. Thanks in advance, and now here is Rob.
Rob Sands: Thank you, Patty, and good morning. And welcome to our discussion of Constellation’s second quarter 2016 sales and earnings results. I am very pleased with our excellent quarterly results. Our Beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results. Our Wine and Spirits business is on track to meet its goals for the year and we continue to progress as planned with our Nava brewery and glass plant expansions. Let’s drive right into the commercial and operational results we saw this quarter for our Beer business. During the second quarter, the Beer business generated double-digit depletion growth driven by exceptional consumer demand for our products across the Beer portfolio. In fact, the second quarter marks the 22nd consecutive quarter of volume market share growth for our Beer portfolio. Constellation beers represented 45% of total U.S. beer industry volume growth during the quarter, as all of our Beer brands grew across most channels and package sizes. Excellent execution by the beer team during the peak summer selling season with the 120 days of summer marketing campaign drove market share gains during the 4th of July, which continued throughout the heart of the summer and into the Labor Day holiday. This performance was led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. Corona Extra posted accelerating depletion and consumer takeaway trends during the summer months, driven by continuing velocity, growth and distribution gains, including the can launch and ongoing investments in media and merchandising with the new Always Summer marketing campaign. The new Corona cans continue to expand consumption occasions for the brand and are a hit with consumers. Cans represented more than 40% of the growth of the Corona Extra brand during the quarter. Throughout the summer we dedicated significant media support behind the can launch with English and Spanish language TV and digital advertising, especially during the July 4th and Labor Day holidays. We see great opportunity with this format, as it currently represents only about 5% of total Corona Extra volume. Modelo Especial delivered depletion growth of nearly 20% during the second quarter driven by continuing velocity and distribution gains. The brands increased media investments, including the continuation of Modelo Especial national English language TV and Video campaign continued throughout the summer months reaching the general market and bicultural Hispanic beer drinkers through targeted entertainment and sports programming. National Hispanic media included the Gold Cup Broadcast Sponsorship on Univision throughout the month of July, including in-game advertising and sponsorships. Corona Light continued to gain share with all core Corona Light packages posting growth during the quarter. Three new brand TV spots were showcased on national TV throughout the summer and the brands sponsored Kenny Chesney Tour continued with 29-tour dates from June through August. For the remainder of the year, we have solid marketing programs in place in order to maintain the excellent brand momentum we are experiencing across the portfolio. For Corona Extra, the football season continues to grow in importance through our returning partnership with Coach Jon Gruden and maintenance of key investments with the NFL, the number one program on TV. Boxing also remains a priority with Corona Extra through an integrated marketing plan to support highly anticipated fights. The momentum of the Corona can format will be supported through general market and Hispanic TV support into the fall football tailgating season. And you should expect to see our iconic Corona Feliz TV spot leading into Thanksgiving Holiday, which will be accompanied by robust on-and-off premise promotional programs designed to drive brand affinity for Corona during the holiday season. For Modelo Especial, we have added six weeks of live TV sports program on national English language TV during the start of the NFL season across CBS, FOX, ESPN and ESPN2. National Hispanic media will also continue for Modelo Especial with the weekly TV exposure to Spanish language consumers. Before moving now to a discussion of our Beer operations, I am pleased to announce today that we are launching our new Tocayo Hominy White Ale, a craft Belgian style wheat beer inspired by the culture and flavors of Mexico. The idea for this new beer brand was develop our beer team working in conjunction with Chef Rick Bayless. It will be available beginning next week at several of the Rick Bayless’ Chicago, Frontera restaurants and other key Chicago area on-premise accounts. Our Beer operations continued to run smoothly. The brewery and glass plant expansions are proceeding as planned. All key performance metrics related to cost, quality, capacity utilization and service are better than target this quarter. New bottling lines are currently being commissioned and will become fully operational by year end. Support for the expansion such as co-generation, waste water, engine room and fire protection are all on schedule. Work continues on the next expansion phase as we increase production capability from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters and continue to expand the rail and logistics capabilities around the site. Overall, the strong results that the Beer business achieved in the second quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation’s EPS guidance for 2016. We are now targeting EBIT growth for the Beer business in the 15% to 18%, which is expected to drive an enhanced operating margin of approximately 34% for this segment in fiscal 2016 versus our previous margin estimate of 33%. While we are currently experiencing favorable commodity and foreign currency benefits, which combined are the most significant drivers of the revised Beer margin for fiscal 2016, we have also experienced better than planned operational results driven by our glass plant performance. We are on track to bring the first 5 million hectoliters of capacity online at Nava by calendar year end. Once this capacity is operational we will be positioned to bring the next 5 million hectoliters into service by next summer. Upon completion of this 10 million hectoliters expansion, the interim supply agreement with ABI for finished goods will no longer be required as we will be fully sub-sufficient from a supply perspective to fulfill our needs for the U.S. market. We expect to receive the full benefits of our targeted mid 30% operating margin goal on a more sustainable basis once we are fully operational at 20 million hectoliters at Nava. And although we are already approaching this longer term margin target, we will still have much to accomplish. I would like to remind everybody that the 5 million hectoliters of capacity that will increase Nava capacity from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters is expected to be completed by calendar 2017. Finally, given the continued strength of our Beer business, we continue to make progress in evaluating plans for our future capacity needs beyond 25 million hectoliters and we will have more to say as we finalize our plans in coming months. And now I would like to discuss the business results for our Wine and Spirits business. In the Wine and Spirits business during the second quarter we achieved earnings growth and solid margin expansion, while delivering strong spirit performance and excellent overall results for our Canadian business. In the U.S. our net sales are benefiting from positive mix trends and we are maintaining IRI volume share in the U.S. wine market. We have successfully integrated our new Meiomi wine brand into our existing wine portfolio and are working to expand distribution to drive incremental growth for this brand. The most recent four week IRI trends show that Meiomi is growing more than 80% in multi-outlet and convenience channels, which is contributing to the fact that are premium plus dollar growth improved in recent periods. Throughout the quarter our focused investments within Wine and Spirits could be seen the marketplace. As a remainder, we are concentrating our investments and our resources on a key subset of our focus brands, because we believe they have the right combination of scale, high margins and growth potential to drive our overall business results. Let’s talk about the few examples of these programs, our TV advertising for Woodbridge aired over the summer and helped drive strong IRI growth for this brand during this timeframe. This program will rev up again in advance of our winter holiday selling season. Our Kim Crawford brand is the unrivaled leader of the New Zealand category with its distinct flavor profile and undue ordinary marketing platform. This summer it kicked off as exclusive national campaign with Cirque du Soleil and executed promotional programs with co-branded advertising, offers, sweepstakes, and sampling event. Kim Crawford posted dollar growth of more than 30%in the recent IRI period. Mark West, America’s number one Pinot Noir, five times consecutive winner of Impact's Hot Brand award is harnessing the power of its unique majority male shopper base with targeted digital Facebook ads and expanded print media in conjunction with its healthy growing campaign. And this month, we are launching Mark West’s Black to take further advantage of the Pinot Noir craze. Overall, we experienced the completion trends of more than 6% for our focus brands during the second quarter, which demonstrates that this strategy is paying off. We’ve also taken some exciting steps towards our goal of developing new brands and have potential for win big with consumers. The newest wine brand in the portfolio, Tom Gore, is named for Tom, a second generation grape farmer, who has a passion for cultivating fruit with exceptional flavor and quality from his wines. This brand resonates with consumer’s search for authenticity of the origin, ingredients and people involved and what they eat and drink. And we are very pleased with its preliminary results. During the quarter, our spirits portfolio experienced excellent net sales growth of 19% and solid depletion growth across the portfolio, driven by Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy and the success of its peach flavor offering as well as SVEDKA Vodka led by its hit flavors, mango, pineapple, strawberry, lemonade and grapefruit jalapeno. Casa Noble Tequila is exceeding our expectation so far this year with continuing share gains after particularly strong depletion growth barring Cinco de Mayo. And we continue to make focus Casa Noble marketing investments in four key local markets, L.A., New York, Chicago and Texas where activation programs include tasting, cocktail features in collaboration with our beer portfolio for local events. Print ads targeting millennial consumers are also running in regional publications. This quarter we launched the national rollout of SERPENT'S BITE, a bold whisky enthused with apple cider flavors. This product targets the intersection of three of the hardest trends in alcoholic beverages, flavored whisky, hard cider and the shot occasion. Though it is too early to comment on long-term expectations for this brand, our retailer and consumer feedback has been very positive. And we are pleased with what has been a fantastic start to the development of this brand. As we head into the key holiday seasons for our Wine and Spirits business, we will be executing programming design to ensure that we continue to drive growth especially for our focus brands. Our expectation is that you should see improving depletion trends as we progress throughout the remainder of the year. As is typical at this point in the year, I would like to provide an update relative to the California grape harvest which is currently more than 80% complete and is expected to be completely finished by mid-October. The current California industry estimate is for total harvest yield of 3.6 million to 3.8 million ton versus approximately 4 million tons last year. While the crop is down this year versus last, quality looks to be very good with excellent color and flavors and our winemakers are smiling. From a pricing perspective, we continue to expect grape pricing to be flat-to-down slightly versus last year depending on the variety, locations and demand with the exception of Cabernet, which continues to be in high demand. In closing, we are at the halfway point in the year and I’m very gratified with our impressive results so far this year. We are working diligently on the Nava brewery and glass point expansions while maintaining the strong momentum of the beer commercial business. And within our Wine and Spirits business, we are making good progress overall and I believe we are well positioned to drive our great portfolio of brand during the upcoming holiday selling season. This December marks the 70th anniversary of our company’s founding. We are proud of our heritage and look forward to positioning our company to the next 70 years of living our vision to elevate life with every glass raise. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein for financial discussion of our second quarter results.
David Klein: Thank you, Rob, and good morning everyone. Let’s start with some Q2 highlights. Comparable basis diluted EPS was up 41%. Stellar execution by the beer business drove strong marketplace and financial results during the key summer selling season. The strong beer performance along with some favorability in our interest expense are driving our full year comparable basis diluted EPS projection up $0.20 to a range of $5 to $5.20 per share for fiscal ‘16. The beer performance along with lower than previously expected payments for taxes and interest are also helping to push our fiscal ‘16 free cash flow projection, up $100 million to a range of $200 million to $300 million. And our glass plant and brewery expansion activities continue to progress as planned as we are positioned to bring the first 5 million hectoliters of additional capacity on line during the second half of fiscal ‘16. Let’s take a closer look at our Q2 results where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Consolidated net sales on an organic constant currency basis grew 9% through the quarter. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our Beer business with depletion growth of 10%. Beer net sales increased 14% on volume growth of 13%. As a reminder, during Q2 fiscal ‘15, we estimated that beer recall activities resulted in the reversal of approximately 2 million case shipments to wholesalers and the $37 million reduction in net sales. If you adjust last year second quarter for the impact of this activity, volume growth in this year second quarter would have been closer to 9% and net sales growth closer to 10%. We replenished the Q2 fiscal ‘15 recall volume with shipments to wholesalers during the third quarter of fiscal ‘15. In addition to that activity, wholesalers also increased their inventory position during the third quarter of last year to bring inventory more in line with historical levels. As a result of these activities, we will be facing a difficult beer sales and EBIT growth comparison for Q3 fiscal ‘16. Beer sales growth for the first half of fiscal 2016 totaled 13%. However, the difficult third quarter comparison is a primary driver of why we continue to expect full year fiscal ‘16 beer net sales growth to approximate 10%. We continue to expect solid third quarter depletion growth. Wine and Spirit net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects higher spirit shipment volume. For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $93 million, up 13% with gross margin increasing 220 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $89 million, primarily due to volume growth, lower COGS and favorable pricing and our beer gross profit margin increased 310 basis points to 48.4%. Wine and Spirits gross profit was up slightly as volume and COGS benefits were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin increased 60 basis points to 41.6%. Consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $5 million. Due to the factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $88 million and consolidated operating margin improved 320 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 450 basis points. This improvement reflects the gross profit benefits that I just highlighted, plus favorability and marketing spend on a per case basis for the quarter. The marketing spend benefit is timing related as we expect to see higher marketing spend during Q3 and for the full year. Wine and Spirits operating margin improved 90 basis points, primarily due to the gross profit benefits discussed earlier. Interest expense for the quarter was $77 million, down 9%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of August, our total debt was $7.4 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.1 billion, a decrease of $144 million since the end of fiscal 2015. This activity primarily reflects our free cash flow generation, partially offset by the funding for the Meiomi acquisition. We now expect interest expense for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million. The improvement in this target reflects favorability in short-term interest rates and timing of our CapEx spend versus our original plan. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 24.6% and compares to a 32.3% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the favorable outcome of various tax items that were effectively settled in connection with IRS examinations. We still expect our full year tax rate to approximate 30.5%. As a result, we expect our tax rate for the second half of the year to run above our projected full year rate. Now, let’s review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For the first half of fiscal ’16, we generated $508 million of free cash flow compared to just $360 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow totaled $803 million versus $668 million for the prior year periods. This increase was primarily due to the higher earnings generated by the Beer business. Given higher projected earnings for the Beer business and lower projected tax and interest payments, we now expect to generate operating cash flow in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion for fiscal ’16. CapEx for the first half of fiscal ’16 totaled $295 million and was slightly below our CapEx spending during the same timeframe last year. Our Brewery expansion activities continued to progress as planned, but we have seen some shifting in the timing of our CapEx, with the higher level of spending expected to come in the second half of the year. Overall, we are still targeting CapEx of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal ’16, which includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for beer. Due to the factors just mentioned, we now expect fiscal ’16 free cash flow to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million. Now let’s move to our full year fiscal ’16 P&L outlook. As discussed earlier, due to continued strong results for our Beer business and lower than expected interest expense, we are increasing our comparable basis diluted EPS projection to $5 to $5.20 per share versus our previous $4.80 to $5 range. The Beer business continues to target mid to high single-digit volume growth and net sales growth of approximately 10%. As a reminder, fiscal ’15 beer shipments went ahead of depletions as distributors brought inventories back to historical levels. As a result, we expect our fiscal ’16 depletion growth rate to be in the high single-digit range and above the shipment growth rate of mid to high single-digits. We are currently experiencing favorable commodity and foreign currency benefits along with better than expected glass plant performance that are helping to drive improved operational results. Therefore, we now expect the Beer business to generate 15% to 18% operating income growth. This guidance has us targeting a beer operating margin of approximately 34% for fiscal ’16. For the Wine and Spirits business, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid single-digit range before any benefits from the Meiomi acquisition. While we anticipate improving depletion trends in the second half of fiscal ’16, we expect to see most of the Wine and Spirits sales growth to be driven in Q4 versus Q3 due to shipment timing and comparisons versus the second half of fiscal ’15. Our fiscal ’16 comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. Overall, we are very pleased with our results for the first half of the year and our projected sales earnings and operating cash flow growth for the full year of fiscal ’16. And with that, we are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohseniun with Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohseniun: Hey. Good morning.
David Klein: Good morning.
Dara Mohseniun: The fiscal 2016 beer guidance implies near 34% margins already with the FX and cost favorability. So you are really at the mid-30s long-term target rate. So, I guess why haven’t you raised the long-term guidance and when can we expect more clarity on that guidance?
David Klein: So, we don’t typically provide the long-term guidance. We provided the medium-term guidance if you will, so we can give people a sense of our Beer business. I would say that we still intend to have beer margins that are in line with the industry leaders in North America. In fact, we would likely be the benchmark if we achieve our mid-30s guidance in the mid-term. I would also say that it’s -- we are early on in the process of bringing our capacity online with Nava and so Dara to really answer your question, specifically once we get that production capacity in place, we will be in a better position to make an adjustment if any to our medium-term guidance.
Dara Mohseniun: Okay. That makes sense. And then I was hoping you could discuss the level of cannibalization you are seeing on Corona, with the can business doing so well, doesn’t look like it’s had much impact and also maybe conceptually, can you discuss where you think can mix for Corona can move over time versus the 5% level you had highlighted earlier?
David Klein: Yeah. So, we do know there is cannibalization between the can and the bottle. When we pick a part of our business and we look at the drivers and drags of our business, we see a little cannibalization. But you have to look at our numbers year-to-date and you see that our bottle depletions are up mid single-digits while our cans have expanded from 3% of our mix last year to 6% of our mix this year. So, we are seeing some cannibalizations but we are not seeing it effect the overall brand of Corona. In terms of where we think the mix can get to, our Modelo brand is more of a can centric brand. We don’t really see Corona becoming a can centric brand. The purpose of the can is to just provide incremental consumption occasions for our consumers.
Dara Mohseniun: All right. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.
Rob Sands: Hi, Nik.
Nik Modi: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Two questions from my side. Just a quick update on the Corona Draft tests that you have been running, just any early thoughts on that. And then, I guess, the bigger picture question is on wine. Just tell me if I have this right in terms of thinking about the long-term strategy, effectively given you still have a big chunk of your portfolio in the low end of the wine category, more about harvesting those brands for profit and reinvesting in the premium end of the portfolio so you can rebalance the portfolio over time. Am I thinking about that in the right way?
Rob Sands: Yes, Nik. So I guess I will start with the wine question first. You know in volumetric terms, it’s a large chunk of our portfolio that sort of subpremium, but in actuality, in terms of what’s really generating our profits and the bulk of our sales, it’s our focused brands, and that’s all largely premium. And then to your question, the answer is, is basically yes as to what you have described. The strategy is definitely about not worrying too much about the non-strategic part of the portfolio, which is the subpremium. And we did take some pricing very successfully this year in that part of the portfolio. And we are reinvesting against, as I mentioned in my script, a smaller subset of our focused brands. And we think that sort of that mix of activity will drive stronger overall results which I believe that it is and I believe that it will. So we are pretty optimistic about the Wine and Spirits business in general. This year, it’s going to be a good year. And then what’s your question on beer?
Nik Modi: Yes. On the Corona Draft test?
Rob Sands: Yes. I think that we continue to test Corona Draft in a number of places. And I would say that the Corona Draft test is proving to be very successful. And I guess you could ask what do we mean by that, okay? And what we do mean by that is, we see it thus far as being additive as opposed to just sort of a peer swap out on-premise. And then where we do have it, we see some positive effects in the marketplace around it, meaning in the off-premise. There seems to be a positive effect when we have Corona on Draft on the on-premise on than our off-premise sales in the area. So the test is positive, but at the same time Corona is our by far most important brand. And we are going to be very thoughtful about how we proceed basically with anything new with that brand. So good news is the brand is performing better than ever right now or at least as it relates to shorter-term history. So again, Beer business is extremely strong.
Nik Modi: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: Thank you. Good morning.
Rob Sands: Hi, Judy.
Judy Hong: So first on the beer depletion, the second quarter performance, 10%, pretty healthy number, but I guess that’s a little bit softer than what the Nielsen or some of the measured channel data has shown. So first, can you talk about maybe what the disconnect is there? And then your full year guidance also implies some slowdown in the back half, which also seems to be at odds with very strong acceleration that we are seeing in the measured channel data. So just wanted to get a little bit more color just in terms of the depletion trend in the second quarter and then the growth in the back half?
Rob Sands: Yes. Well, Judy, you know, we basically -- our guidance has called out high single digit for beer depletion performance. And obviously, we are outperforming that at 10%. So I would say that our beer depletion performance exceeds our expectations. But realizing that we have some -- continued to have tough overlaps in terms of strong growth last year too, I mean we can only be relatively cautious as to the kind of growth that we are willing to predict. So I hope we far exceed those numbers, but I think that high single digit remains, depletion growth remains a good estimate. We do have some pricing that we are taking right now in the marketplace in the 1% to 2% range like we talked about historically. And while we feel that the brand is in an extremely strong position to take that pricing, it’s not as if it will have zero impact on depletion growth. And then in terms of IRI and the disconnect, I think that IRI only measures about half of the business, the half that it doesn’t measure is the half that’s not necessarily industry-wide performing very well, like the on-premise for instance, and liquor stores as an example that are the more sluggish part of the industry. That said, we are performing of course better than anybody else in those channels, but those channels are not the highest performing channels, whereas the IRI channels being grocery and convenience are some of the strongest channels at the current time. So I would say that’s where the disconnect is.
Judy Hong: Okay. And David, just in terms of the glass cost, I think in your prepared comment you had called out gross margins on beer benefiting some better glass plant performance. So number one, I just wanted to get clarifications on what that means? Secondly, just in terms of your mix of what you’re now sourcing from the OI JV as well as the Vitro, if you can just get a mix of where the sourcing of glass comes from as of the second quarter? And then the O-I’s proposed acquisition of Vitro, does that have any impacts on your glass sourcing arrangement going forward?
David Klein: Okay, Judy. Yes, so when I referenced the glass joint venture performance, I am really talking about and you will see this in our Q, which we intend to file today, which is a first for us to file our Q on the same day as earnings calls. You will see that we have a profit at the glass joint venture level, which was not in our expectations for the year, because there were a fair number of startup costs. So we’ve -- we -- the joint venture team on the ground in Nava, as well as our partners at Owens-Illinois have done an outstanding job of smoothly getting our furnished at Nava functioning well. So as a result of that we’re seeing better profit performance from the joint venture and that allows us to shift our mix just a little bit and I don’t have the exact numbers Judy, but to shift our mix a little bit toward our own glass plant as opposed to third-party providers, which gives us near-term in particular freight benefits as it relates to the glass plant. And we have a -- to get on the Vitro acquisition question, we have a very strong relationship with Owens-Illinois. We have the separation if you will that comes from owning the joint venture with O-I and so we’re not concerned at all about O-I taking or acquiring Vitro, because again, we control our own destiny along with O-I at our own joint venture.
Judy Hong: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane: Hi. Good morning.
Rob Sands: Hi, Bryan. Morning.
Bryan Spillane: Just wanted to ask one question or one topic just capital allocation. And maybe, David, if you could sort of remind us or update us on your current thinking in terms of share repurchases, kind of where you’re comfortable in terms of leverage on the balance sheet? And I guess, as you’re contemplating additional brewing capacity, just how we should think about kind of where cash is going to go, whether its dividends, repurchases or CapEx over the next couple years?
David Klein: Yeah. So as we position this business for total shareholder return for the medium-term, the most important thing that we can do is ensure that we have enough capacity to service our high margin Beer business. And so when we think about capital allocation, number one inline is that capital expenditure required to build out Nava and to build out a second site at some point in the future. So that’s really number one. I would say then beyond that we -- our capital allocation strategy hasn’t change. We remained committed to our dividend, as well as share repurchases and tuck-in acquisitions. I’d also say, we’re pretty happy coming out of the quarter with a net debt leverage ratio of about 3.7 times, which is in our range at 3 to 4 times. And I guess, where I would just caution on that leverage ratio range provide a little bit of caution in that. We have a lot of spend to complete the Nava build-out in the second half of the year and so, we’re just going to be very careful with our capital decisions as we go through the build-out.
Bryan Spillane: Just would that imply -- just two follow-ups to that, one is, in terms of potential build-out? Could you remind us just rough idea how much the cost per hectoliter is to build-out brewery expansion? And than, I guess based on that scenario or the potential to have to allocate more to CapEx, should we be thinking about share repurchases is more just covering stock options at this point and as opposed to real sort of share count reduction as a P&L lever?
David Klein: Yeah. So as it relates to a new green field facility, what we’ve stated in the past is that, we haven’t made a decision on specific location, although we are planning for Western Mexico. We haven’t made a decision on size of the build-out and then we have provided a really large range of $100 to $150 a hectoliter, recognizing that a green field will be completely starting from scratch with no basic infrastructure, which we benefited from at the Nava facility. So, we will come back to you within the next several months with definitive plans around our build-out. And I would say, based upon our volume growth numbers that that we demonstrated this quarter and for the last while, we will be spending the capital on a green field sooner than later, because its going to take four years to build out another brewery and with these kind of growth rates we will needed to keep up with capacity. I think to then answer your question on share repurchases, again, we’re going to evaluate our circumstances as we go forward and depending upon the capital requirements and our leverage ratio and understanding the requirements from our dividends, we’ll then consider share repurchases. I don’t see anything in the very near-term though, we said this publicly as well around a large accelerated kind of program. It’s likely to be methodical and it’s likely to start out with absorbing dilution.
Bryan Spillane: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.
Caroline Levy: Good morning, everyone. Thank you. I just want to check that the delay in the capital spending that you talked about is not in anywhere reflection that there is a delay in when the plant might open?
David Klein: None whatsoever. We’re actually pretty happy with the progress we made in the build out at Nava. In fact, we’ve now run beer down our premium glass line. So for the first time, we put labels and foil on bottles because our previous production have been Corona, primarily Corona Extra and Corona Light using the applied ceramic label bottles. And so now our premium glass line, which is Modelo Especial has run beer down the line, which is a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be at this moment. So we’re very pleased with our progress on the brewery build out.
Caroline Levy: That’s great. And on the wine side we never really discussed CapEx there, but do you see any significant needs in the next couple years?
David Klein: I think you’ll continue to see our wine CapEx in the range it has been for the past several years. We don’t expect the big change in that regard.
Caroline Levy: Okay. Thank you. Then the peso benefit, any way you could call that out and tell us what do you think it will do in the back half of the year?
David Klein: Yes. See that’s the problem with the FX and commodity related items. There is a fair amount of variability when you’re trying to predict it. But you know that we’ll say about our peso exposure, it’s about 15% or so of our COGS and from that you have to exclude the COGS that are attributable to ABI. And generally, we run a three year layer hedging program across our currency and commodities. And so for the remainder of this year, we are roughly 80% hedged on FX.
Caroline Levy: Okay. Thank you. One of the big drivers of your business is clearly being the big incremental advertising spend behind you brands. And I mean, you mentioned in the second quarter that as a percentage of sales, it wasn’t up a lot, but I think it was down a bit. But basically, do you see keeping that pressure on the brands, because I think that’s going to be critical to the ongoing momentum? Do you have budgets to go up significantly on ad spend going forward?
David Klein: Yes. So we expect in our Beer business for our marketing expense to be somewhere between 8.5% to 9% of net sales which implies we will continue spending at kind of the second quarter rate. As a percent of net sales, our case rate I think goes up a little bit in Q3. I will also say that that’s going to be Q3 weighted as we take advantage of the fall sports season, which we found to be a successful platform for driving our brands. But we measure and are very pleased with the returns we get from our marketing investment in our beer brands and we will continue to keep that pressure on.
Caroline Levy: Right. Yes, I mean, I think that’s going to be critical. So your returns have obviously been incredible. Would you see going to the higher end than the 9%?
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Caroline, I think it would be -- that's the longest two questions I think we’ve ever had.
Caroline Levy: Sorry.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: That’s okay. No worry. I guess we’ll take the next question Operator.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg: Good morning, everyone. A couple here mostly related. One is, this year is being called the year of the can. And I’m trying to understand, it’s clear you have a lot of opportunities for share within your portfolio. But what might be the priority from here? I heard you, David just mentioned premium glass for Modelo Especial and putting an SKU into an existing account is easier than trying to add account, which is part of the job with the Especial. But what might be your next priority if you will after the year of the cans for Corona?
Rob Sands: I would say that you’re right on in calling out distribution. So we know, for example, that Modelo Especial roughly has 65 ACV across the market, but we also know that we have packs Light, our 12 packs bottle, which is more like 45, right. So we have a lot of ground that we can cover from a distribution standpoint. I do want to come back on the year of the can, however. We’ve seen a lot of growth in Corona Extra from our year of the can program. We’ve also seen a lot of growth on the Corona Light, which was a bit of ancillary benefit that came from our focus on cans and Corona. So yes, I think there are a lot of opportunities for a future growth in our brands.
Mark Swartzberg: And I’m trying to -- we’re all looking at these 10 numbers and wondering is next year going to be an 8 or is it going to be at 12? I’m just trying to not asking for a crystal ball and I know we all are. But I’m just trying to get a sense of like, where is the real shoulder going to be from here, is it going to remain against the can, is it going to be? I think Especial has actually slowed this year in terms in rate of growth, which, of course, large numbers. But again, I’m just trying to understand where you guys are deciding to make that next priority if you’ll after the can for Corona?
Rob Sands: Yes. I think around Modelo Especial on your particular point, we have a year-to-date depletions that are in the high 20% on the bottle itself. So that’s a package that’s growing really well for us. And so the momentum behind the brand continues. I see us continuing our strategy of focusing on our -- building out our strong distribution network, gaining more distribution at retail, getting our brewery completed and continuing to execute across the entire portfolio of beers that we have.
Mark Swartzberg: Okay. And I know I’m pressing here, but I do want to understand the brand Modelo overall, the Especial that is has rate of growth has slowed overall of all packages. Is that right and you are saying the glass is a priority there?
Rob Sands: No. In the recent 12-week IRI, Modelo Especial was up 30%.
David Klein: It has not slowed. Where are you getting that idea?
Mark Swartzberg: Okay. Great. I’m just referring to some of the materials you put out back in early September, 16% at fiscal ‘15 and accelerating this year. Got it. Okay. And then the brewery expansion or the added brewery, you are saying the next several months, can you be more specific, should we think about that as third quarter?
Rob Sands: In terms of spend?
Mark Swartzberg: When you would give us detail on that plan?
Rob Sands: I would say roughly by end of the calendar year. Likely on our third quarter earnings call.
Mark Swartzberg: Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.
Rob Sands: Hi, Vivien.
Vivien Azer: Hi. So, I have one question on Wine and Spirits please. Given the diverging trends that we continue to see between those two sub-segments, can you offer a little color around the margin profile of those two independent businesses?
Rob Sands: Yeah. I think when we look at our Wine and Spirits business, I think it’s important to -- that we are focused on the U.S. business but then when you breakdown, which amounts to 80% of our net sales by the way overall. But then when you breakdown our wine versus spirits margins, they are roughly in line across the portfolio.
Vivien Azer: Okay. That’s helpful. David…
David Klein: That’s largely because our spirits business is really sort of a mid premium as opposed to higher premium. So the margins are roughly the same as the wine business.
Vivien Azer: Terrific. Thank you. And my second question has to do with the outlook for the tax rate. David, if I think back a couple of years ago, we’ve seen these tax benefits before and then over time the step-up in the tax rate doesn’t actually happen and so your overall tax rate ends up coming in lower than previously expected. So, I’m just curious, kind of what gives you kind of confidence, the step-up in the back half?
David Klein: Yeah. In the back half -- the further you get in the year, obviously you know what sorts of settlement opportunities you might be working on and I would say that we are pretty confident in our outlook for that full year rate. And I also say that our initial 30.5% guidance for the year actually included the benefits that we realized in the second quarter. What we didn’t provide and we didn’t have clear line of sight into was the timing at which we would receive these benefits.
Vivien Azer: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore.
Robert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you and congratulations on a terrific quarter. I’m wondering if you could give us a little bit of your thinking on pricing strategy for beer. I think you talked about -- you are in the market now for 1% to 2%. And I’m wondering given your tremendous success in the market, have you changed your strategy? And I’m asking that also because it appears that you led price increases in California and Texas at a minimum and that maybe a little bit of a divergence from in the past when -- and correct me if I’m wrong where you are perhaps more of a follower. So is there change in strategy? Is there the potential, given again the strong demand for your product for perhaps more aggressive pricing to really further your premium image and get back to some of the price gaps of 10 years or so ago? And how are you thinking about your overall pricing architecture between the brands? Thank you.
Rob Sands: Yeah. So, first of all, as it relates to pricing, it is pretty much what we’ve said all along throughout the year, which is that we’ve expected to take in the 1% to 2% pricing range and that’s what we are doing. So the strategy really hasn’t changed. I mean like every other business, we’ve got costs to cover and our brands are strong enough to bear that kind of pricing. If there is any change in our strategy, I would say that the marketplace is changing somewhat in terms of sort of the makeup of the types of products that are out there. The market, I mean the industry is definitively premiumizing, while volume remains sort of flat so that there is a shift internally towards more premium products. And I would say that that probably has given us the opportunity to be less focused on what’s going on with competitive products and to be more focused on what do we think is good for our brand and what do we think will work and won’t work. So we continue to be very strategic in our pricing. We are doing it on a market-by-market, brand-by-brand basis. Our guidance nevertheless hasn’t changed. We are still looking at the 1% to 2% range. And you can call it leading or not leading. We are sort of I would say marching to our own beat as opposed to too worried about what some of our competitors are doing overall. And that’s sort of up to them. And we will do what we think the market will bear for our brands and what’s good for the health of our brands. So in some cases that will mean that we will lead pricing. But as I said, the market has changed, it’s premiumizing. 10% of the industry now is craft, selling at very high prices, right. And the other 10% of the market is basically us. And those are the two segments, that 20% obviously taking share from the other 80%. So things are a little different out there than they have been in the past.
Robert Ottenstein: Right. I mean, it’s interest, if you look at the Corona brand outside of U.S. and Mexico, ABI is taking a very strong strategy of really making a super, super premium brand, generally priced significantly higher than Heineken for instance in most areas. Obviously, the reference point in Mexico is paramount. But did you think perhaps there is a way to kind of increase the gap with premium, with U.S. mainstream brands, with Corona, and just develop a little bit longer kind of pricing architecture for your brands, a little more differentiated than it is now?
Rob Sands: Yes. I would say in general, we are not overly focused on the pricing gap with the domestic premiums. I mean, the domestic premiums have sort of taken on the life of their own. I am not sure how relevant it is at this stage.
Robert Ottenstein: All right. So that definitely sounds like a departure in strategy than what you had said a few years ago.
Rob Sands: Yes. I would say that you have identified that nuisance correctly.
Robert Ottenstein: Great. Terrific. Thank you very much.
Rob Sands: We are less concerned about that gap today than we were several years ago.
Robert Ottenstein: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research Group.
Tim Ramey: Thanks. And congratulations, And Rob, your family must be incredibly proud to in 70 years to build a $26 billion company, that’s amazing.
Rob Sands: Well, thank you.
Tim Ramey: David, just a clarification on the end pointing of the TSA was. I think I heard you say, is it end of calendar 2016 that you expect that to be largely wound down?
David Klein: So we have -- in terms of supply chain procurement, not finished goods procurement we have largely separated ourselves from reliance on ABI. And then separately, we will continue to procure finished goods from ABI’s breweries until June of next year of 2016.
Tim Ramey: Great. And then Rob on the wine outlook, you said of the overall harvest but ultra-premium was a little bit short in Napa and Sonoma. I’m just wondering if you think that might provide somewhat of a pricing umbrella for mid tier premium price products and any challenges you foresee in terms of pinot noir sourcing or some of the rates that are more.
Rob Sands: So, I don’t think we see any issues with pinot noir sourcing, which is doing quite a bit of it between Mark West, Robert Mondavi, the various tiers at Meiomi. But I would say that our supply chain is very well nailed down. And then I think to your question on the pricing in the marketplace, I think that pricing -- I mean, I think the answer to your question is maybe yes, yes. I think that even in the higher end -- I certainly don’t see pricing going the other way. It hasn’t been a very robust market over a number of years in terms of pricing but if you sort of listen to the talk out there and in industry type circles, I think everybody is sort of -- meaning, the market in general is probably more favorable to stop pricing than it has done in quite a number of years so.
Tim Ramey: All right. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.
Bill Chappell: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just clarification on the 34% margins. Did you quantified as how much FX and commodity benefited that number and then, am I right in what you said with the hedges, we won’t see any incremental benefit in the back half? I mean, this is probably the watermark for the rest of the year.
Rob Sands: Yes. So, clearly implied in the guidance that brings us back into the 34% range, margins will compress a little bit in the back half of the year as a result of several headwinds if you will. Those being bringing on -- bringing assets into service, our depreciation number will go up, line commissioning costs, incremental employees where training as well as throughput lowering as we go into the back half of the year at Nava just based on the seasonality of our production. So, I would say that built into the 34% is our current estimate of FX and commodity rates for the rest of the year.
Bill Chappell: Okay. But just trying to understand it, especially on the commodity front. Would you expect as we move past the hedges that you would see an incremental benefit as we move into next year or is it less on, is it more on productivity benefits than it is freight, commodities?
Rob Sands: It’s a little bit of both. And so from a hedging perspective, we run a three-year layering program and so we are -- we kind of stabilize our returns a little bit, which means you leave some money on the table when commodity prices and FX values are falling and you gain on the other sides. So, I would say that we will get, assuming commodity rates were to stay where they are today and primarily for us, we are talking about benefiting from diesel rates as well as aluminum. But assuming those rates were to stay as they are today, there would be some benefit that we would experience next year. It’s just far too early to call what that is at this point.
Bill Chappell: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Pablo Zuanic with SIG.
Pablo Zuanic: Good morning, everyone. I have a couple of questions on Modelo Especial. The first point is that to me, the brand to bottle and the can are really totally different products. It’s a different demographic, it’s a different price point and obviously it’s a different packaging. And I’m just trying to understand how can they work in the long-term? The person buying the cheap Modelo Especial can is very different from the one that you are advertising [its active] [ph] for the bottle? And the second question, which is related to this also. Obviously, Modelo Especial is driving the growth. You provided ACVs for cans and bottles? Can you give some color in terms of what’s the growth in bottles? What the growth in cans? I understand the bottles are starting from a lower base. But the reason I ask the question is that, when you say 65% ACV for Modelo Especial, I’m not too sure there’s a big market for Modelo Especial in states like Alabama or South Carolina. So because your ACV has already capped on Modelo Especial and the cans or maybe not, I mean, obviously given the growth rate, it hasn’t. But just give some color there, I find the brand is a fascinating brand where the business will [case divvy] [ph], but it has its own challenges because of the way the cans and the bottles are marketed. Thanks.
Rob Sands: Well, first think I would say that from a consumer experience standpoint, our research and the feedback that we receive is that as more people in the U.S. become expose to Modelo Especial, they tend to continue to drink it. So it’s a very high quality well respected authentic brand from Mexico. To address you’re -- the can versus bottle component, we had depletions year-to-date on cans that are 12-ish percent on the can part of the portfolio and then bottles it’s, we were in the high 20% growth rate from a depletion standpoint. So, we’re seeing growth coming across the spectrum of offerings on Modelo Especial.
David Klein: Yeah. And I would say that as far as the consumer goes, I’m not sure that we agree with you that it’s two completely different consumer bases. I think that we’ve seen a shift somewhat at least in the growth from cans to bottles. The can is only slightly priced less than the bottle. It’s really almost irrelevant the pricing difference. Interestingly enough cans have in general taken on a very premium image since it’s becoming the package of choice in the craft segment of the market. So the whole view towards cans in general I would say is shifting quite significantly from a consumer perspective. So we don’t see any difficulties in marketing the cans and the bottles together, like everybody else does markets cans and bottles. So that’s not a particularly unique aspect of our Modelo Especial business, which, as we said earlier, is actually growing more than it ever has on an incredibly large base. So the strength of that brand is phenomenal at this stage without it really having fully transitioned to a general market product and it is transitioning to a general market product. Again, with our own help as we turned on general market TV advertising, which has been very successful and we know that there is huge room for distribution growth in that brand and you will see it. You will see it as we continue to move forward and execute with that brand. You’ll see the ACV continue to go up. That’s simply going to be the case as we believe quite strongly at the current time. So the cans are strong. The bottles are strong. It’s following the same pattern as many brands that have become a major brands and Corona is probably the best example of that.
Pablo Zuanic: That’s very helpful color. Can I just ask a follow-up? With all this talk about Anheuser-Busch InBev, SABMiller transaction if it happens. If I recall about 65% your volumes in the U.S. go through MillerCoors wholesalers, obviously they are independent, the balance mostly on Anheuser-Busch InBev? I know it’s very hypothetically and speculative, but in high again, work to be involve in anyway in the future with MillerCoors or most on -- or the Molson Coors? There could be some changes at the wholesaler level, right? I will assume that they would want the MillerCoors wholesalers to carry their portfolio of Mexican brands, of course, the wholesalers will have their own sales and your business is much larger? But is there reason there number one? And the second question would be in terms of your volume in the U.S. at the wholesaler level what percentage would overlap with the Spencer brands or pretty much wholesalers will carry your brands, don’t carry the Spencer brands? Thanks and sorry all the detail there.
Rob Sands: Yeah. So, we -- there is some overlap of wholesalers, they carry the Spencer brands or the Heineken/Spencer brands and ourselves, quite a bit of overlap in fact. I would say that that is totally irrelevant to us. The Spencer brands are small, okay, and in terms of growth they have some growth in the [indiscernible] brand, which is less than half the size for instance of Modelo Especial and growth is slowdown. And Tecate I think is a negative territory and they’ve had some growth in Tecate Light with basically -- which basically sells at the domestic premium price point. So we don’t really view that as a particularly strong competition and we don’t really care whether they are in MillerCoors or ABI or frankly, where they go, because we don’t focus on that portfolio very much and Heineken’s a whole different animal obviously.
Pablo Zuanic: Right. Yeah.
Rob Sands: I think is competing with a different consumer base in general than our Mexican portfolio. So, again, it’s not something that we really focused on. And then in general, our modus operandi is to worry more about our portfolio and the opportunities there, and execution is going to be the key on our portfolio in the future, which is going to be about taking advantage of distribution opportunities. And basically increasing the number of SKUs per account, I mean, that’s really what we where the opportunity lies for us, because we actually generate a huge amount of growth for ourselves and our retailers with a relatively small amount of shelf presence and we’re under SKU-ed given our velocity and our dollar volume at retail. So there is just a big opportunity there for us and our retailers. Our retailers are and should be interested in increasing their sales and margin per unit space -- per unit space of shelf space. That’s what they are all about and probably their biggest opportunity to do that and to get dollar sales turns and even more importantly margin is through increased SKU and shelf space for our portfolio. So -- and you know, when we talk to retailers about that, I think they realize the statistics are just overwhelming for them as a way to increase their profitability. So building our SKU count per retail account is going to be one of our primary focuses going forward.
Pablo Zuanic: Thank you. It was very helpful.
Operator: Our final question comes from line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research.
Brett Cooper: Thanks guys. Two questions on the Beer business. Can you talk about what your volume assumption is for capacity planning for the Beer business going forward? And then we have seen the cans come in and if memory serves, ACV has gotten pretty stable over the last few months. Where do you see the potential for distribution on Corona can in the medium term?
Rob Sands: Yeah. I think in terms of capacity, it’s sort of like high single digit is what we have said in the past. So you could infer that right from sort of a -- our comments about doubling the business over a long period of time, 10 years, that just sort of simple math. Our real guidance for the year continues to be high single digits for the Beer business in general. And then your second question was?
Brett Cooper: How much more room is there for distribution on Corona can?
Rob Sands: A lot. We’ve just introduced it really and made it a priority over the last relatively short period of time. So I think that there is a big opportunity for more distribution on that. Right, it’s only about 5% of our volume at the current time and we should be growing that to more like 15% or 20%. So that will be achieved through continuing to build distribution and doing what I said, focusing on SKUs per count.
Brett Cooper: Perfect. Thanks
Operator: That was our final questioner. Now, I’d like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Okay. Well, thanks everybody for joining our call today. As we close the discussion of our second quarter results for fiscal 2016, I’m very, very pleased with what our business has achieved so far. Though the year is far from complete, our new guidance reflects the confidence we have in our ability to execute in the second half and achieve our goals for the full year. We look forward to the next time we speak with you in early January when we will share the results of our third quarter. Until then we wish you a safe and happy holiday season. This time of the year is a great opportunity to share our fine beer, wine and spirits products with friends and family. And we encourage you to make Constellation Brands a part of your celebrations this holiday. So thanks again everybody and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Constellation Brands’ First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Lori. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Constellation’s first quarter fiscal 2016 conference call. I’m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our new Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company’s estimates, please refer to the news releases and Constellation’s SEC filings. Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we limit the number of questions asked during today’s Q&A session to two questions. We received Investor feedback last quarter indicating that the call ran long, because we allowed questioners to ask unlimited questions. So I would appreciate your cooperation. Thanks in advance, and now here is Rob.
Rob Sands: Thanks, Patty, and good morning. And welcome to our discussion of Constellation’s first quarter 2016 sales and earnings results. As Patty mentioned earlier, I am joined today by David Klein, Constellation’s newly appointed Chief Financial Officer, following the recent departure of Bob Ryder, who served as our CFO for the past eight years. Bob has been a significant contributor to our organization during his time here. His accomplishments at Constellation are numerous and I wish him success in his future endeavors. We have an incredibly talented finance organization, which is why we are expecting a seamless transition for David as he assumes his new role. David brings a wealth of experience to this critical leadership position, most recently serving as the CFO for Constellation’s Beer business, where he was integral in orchestrating our glass sourcing strategy, implementing commodity management processes and instilling production costs management discipline at the brewery. David has also been very involved in the oversight of our Nava brewery build-out, which includes managing capital expenditures at the facility. Now during the past year working with the beer team David has divided his time between Rochester, Chicago, San Antonio and Mexico. I believe that many of you have had the opportunity to meet David and I would like to publicly congratulate him and welcome him to our executive management team. You will be hearing more from David in just a few minutes. Before we get started with our quarterly review, I would also like to take a few moments to discuss this morning’s exciting announcement of Constellation’s planned purchase of the Meiomi wine brand. Meiomi is predominantly a California pinot noir and represents a synergistic high-growth, high-margin accretive complementary tuck-in to our existing portfolio of wine brands. Launched in 2006, Meiomi sold about 60,000 cases in the U.S. marketplace in 2010 and has grown to become a nearly 600,000 case brand since then. It is currently the fastest growing major pinot noir in IRI channels at the $20 luxury price point and has experienced dollar sales growth of more than 50% over the last 52 weeks. In calendar 2014, Meiomi generated more than $65 million in net sales with an operating profit margin profile that significantly exceeds the margin rate of our overall Wine and Spirits business. The right brands with the right financial profile like Meiomi, Meiomi can be efficiently integrated into our distribution platform to provide synergies, scale and root-to-market benefits and it is very similar to our successful Mark West acquisition. As I have previously mentioned, tuck-in acquisitions has been identified as one of our capital allocation priorities, especially those that are strategic, synergistic, good value and meet our strict financial criteria. Meiomi is one of these acquisitions. This acquisition does not signal a change in strategic goals for the business or impact our ability to achieve our targeted leverage range. Our top priorities remained unchanged and they include reducing our debt to less than four times leverage. This creates significant capital allocation flexibility and opportunity to increase returns to our shareholder through dividend, growth and share buybacks. Capturing the organic growth opportunities we see across all of our product categories, completing the brewery and glass plant expansions as planned, while ensuring that we do not impact the tremendous commercial momentum we have within the U.S. beer markets and complementing our organic growth efforts and shareholder cash return focus with complementary brand acquisitions that enhance our portfolio. These priorities are intact and will remain our core focus for delivering shareholder value over the long-term. And now I would like to shift the focus of our discussion to our quarterly results, which reflect a great start to our new fiscal year. Overall, our Beer business had -- has been unstoppable, our Wine and Spirits business is on track to meet its goals for the year and we continue to progress as planned with our Mexican brewery and glass plant expansions. During the first quarter the Beer business generated results that exceeded our expectations, posting double-digit sales and depletion growth. These results are some of the best in the industry. In fact, during the first quarter, Constellation Beers delivered about two-thirds. That’s two-thirds of the total U.S. beer industry volume growth. Leading volume gains among U.S. brewers for the eight consecutive quarter in IRI channel. So what’s driving this phenomenal level of growth and momentum? We continue to experienced robust consumer demand for our iconic portfolio of Mexican beers, with our top five brands experienced -- experiencing solid growth across almost all channels and packaging sizes during the quarter. In addition, we are benefiting from strong sales execution and excellent ongoing support from our wholesalers. The introduction of creative new marketing program that resonate with consumers, increase investment and enhanced media plan, continued distribution gains across the portfolio for our core brands and package types, and the expansion of product offerings like Corona Extra cans, Modelo Especial Chelada and Corona Light draft. The Beer business kicked up the 120 days of summer-selling season by posting market share gains during the Cinco de Mayo holiday led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial as the number one and number two share gainers respectively across all U.S. beer brands. The new Corona cans have been a hit with consumers. We dedicated significant media support behind the launch with English and Spanish language TV across the NBA playoff, Univision and Comedy Central. We see great opportunity with the can launch as this format currently represents only a small portion of total Corona Extra volume. Modelo Especial continues to maintain strong momentum as the number two imported beer in the U.S. and delivered depletion growth of nearly 20% during the first quarter. Modelo Especial launched its first ever national English language campaign with targeted programming including first round NBA playoffs on ESPN and TNT. This effort will continue into the summer. Corona Light draft expanded its launch with 28 new wholesalers in existing markets. We also activated the Kenny Chesney sponsorship during the quarter which will continue through September. And I’m sure that many of you viewed our new jewel branded Corona Extra Casa Noble to kill a TV spot leading up to the Cinco holiday, which was aired on a variety of high profile TV programs. This advertisement drove new distribution of Casa Noble in select on and off premise accounts. Overall, the strong results of the Beer business achieved in the first quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation’s EPS guidance for fiscal 2016. As such, we now expect beer volumes to increase mid-to-high single digits which should drive net sales growth of approximately 10% and underlying operating income growth of 13% to 15%. Beer operations continue to run smoothly the brewery and glass plant expansions that are proceeding as planned. Our key performance metrics and initiatives for the brewery are on or better than target. The first incremental 5 million hectoliters of capacity is expected to become operational by the end of calendar 2015. During the first quarter, we achieved high levels of productivity and record capacity utilization at the Nava brewery and construction of the second furnace at the glass plant is underway. And we have begun site excavation and instillation of utilities for the previously announced incremental brewery capacity expansion from 20 to 25 million hectoliters. Overall, I’m very pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the Beer business. Given the continued strength of this business, we are currently evaluating plans for our next increment of capacity beyond 25 million hectoliters. And now I would like to discuss the operational results for our Wine and Spirits business. During the first quarter, we experienced improving depletion in consumer takeaway transfer U.S. wine business, posted better than expected results in Canada and delivered excellent to our sales in depletion growth trends for our portfolio of spirit brands. We are benefiting from positive mix trends across the business. We gained share of feature and display activity at retail. And we are maintaining IRI volume share in the U.S. wine market. We successfully maintained margins for the Wine and Spirits business in the first quarter after delivering operating margin expansion of our 130 basis points in fiscal 2015. And we remain on track this year to maintain the expanded margin achieved last year. As outlined last quarter, one of our key strategic objectives for this year is the focus on our marketing efforts on a subset of our focus brands in order to drive key brands that have scaled higher margins and the greatest growth potential. Now, let me give you a few examples of what we currently have underway. Black Box will be running two commercials chanting the exceptional value of this premium Box wine has to offer. The commercials air this summer and for the first time will run in the fall season as well. Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi kicked off its Moments TV campaign in June and is expected to garner more than 1 billion LDA media impressions through year end. You can see the spot on channels like HDTV, Lifetime, Travel Channel, Food Network, TLC, Bravo, TBS and E! We’ve created a new fully integrated digital advertising campaign for Clos du Bois, which is running now through the end of summer to engage consumers with this French inspired California wine. The quality of our wine brands has also attracted some terrific media attention this spring, with mentions of brands such as Black Box, Kim Crawford, Mark West, Robert Mondavi, Winery, Ruffino, the Dreaming Tree and our newest brand, Tom Gore Vineyards in such recognizable publications as Fortune.com, Wine Enthusiast, Bloomberg.com and E! Online. Recent ratings further attest to our portfolio strength, with 90 plus scores coming from the Wine Enthusiast and Wine Spectator for luxury tiers of our Ruffino, Kim Crawford and Ravenswood brands. You may have noticed that beginning with the first quarter we’ve changed the composition of our reported Focus Brands in order to better align this disclosure with our current brand priorities on the sales and resource focus for the Wine and Spirits business. We now have 15 brands that comprise our Focus Brands versus 20 brands previously. Notable additions include two of our innovation brands, The Dreaming Tree and Ultra Premium multi varietal wine, which was introduced about three years ago in collaborations with singer, songwriter, Dave Matthews and SAVED, a luxury brand inspired by contemporary artist, Scott Campbell who was perhaps known best as the tattoo artist to the Hollywood stars. And we experienced overall depletion growth of 3.5% for the first quarter, with our Focus Brands growing nearly twice of that rate. These results were driven by a number of our fastest-growing brands including Kim Crawford, Ruffino, Simi, Black Box, Estancia, Clos du Bois, The Dreaming Tree and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. For our spirits portfolio, we experienced excellent net sales growth of 8% and solid depletion trends in the first quarter, driven by Casa Noble Tequila, Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy and SVEDKA, VACA. Within IRI channels, our dollar sales growth in spirits continued to outperform the market during the quarter. Now before I turn the call over to David, I’d like to provide some context for the cost effectiveness plans we have initiated as many of you -- as you may have seen mentioned in this morning’s press release. As we transform our business, it’s becoming increasingly important to evolve our organizational structure for sustainable long-term growth in a way that can bring out the best in the business today and at the same time position us to adapt quickly and effectively in responding the future business needs. As such, we have shifted resources and investments to long-term growth opportunities across the business as well as improved efficiency by consolidating and streamlining resources in areas where it makes the most sense. The position changes associated with this initiative will be minimal but the majority will occur within our Wine and Spirits business. The objective of this effort is to build the best organization that will enable us to be more agile and effective while unlocking growth potential. David will provide a financial overview of the program in a few minutes. In closing, I would like to reiterate that everything we do at Constellation Brands is guided by one of our most important strategic imperatives to apply rigorous financial discipline. And our financial discipline involves maintaining our commitment to our capital allocation priorities, which include ongoing debt reduction to less than four times leverage, potential share repurchases and dividend increases, and tuck-in acquisitions like Meiomi, Mark West, and Casa Noble. I would also like to remind everyone that during my tenure as CEO for the last eight years, our team has created significant value by transforming and simplifying our product portfolio through the rationalization and divestiture of business assets in an effort to premiumize and grow the business. And my plan for the future is to continue to deliver value and generate growth. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein for financial discussion of our first quarter results.
David Klein: Thank you, Rob. And good morning, everyone. I first want to say I am excited about my new role at Constellation. This is a stellar company with tremendous prospects in a dynamic industry. I believe Constellation offers one of the best combinations of topline growth and profitability in the beverage alcohol space. I look forward to partnering with Rob in the rest of the executive management team, as we remain focused on executing Constellation’s strategic goals and our capital allocation priorities, as outlined by Rob earlier. I have had the pleasure of meeting members of the investment community at investor events in my previous roles as Treasurer or as CFO of our Beer business. I look forward to spending more time and building relationships with you going forward in my new role. With that, let me provide some Q1 highlights. Comparable basis diluted EPS was up 18%. We paid out a quarterly common stock dividend for the first time in our history. And the continued robust marketplace momentum for our Beer business, along with our agreement to acquire the Meiomi wine brand, are driving our full year comparable basis diluted EPS projection up $0.10 to a range of $4.80 to $5 for fiscal '16. Let’s take a closer look at our Q1 results where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Consolidated net sales on a constant currency basis grew 8% for the quarter. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our Beer business with depletion growth of 10%. Beer net sales increased 11% on volume growth of 10%. Wine and Spirits net sales on a constant currency basis increased 4%. This primarily reflects higher shipment volume and favorable mix. Net sales benefited from the overlap of U.S. distributor inventory destocking net of a related distributor destocking payment, which occurred during first quarter fiscal 2015. For the quarter consolidated gross profit increased $68 million, up 10% with gross margin increasing 130 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $65 million primarily due to volume growth and favorable pricing. Beer gross profit margin increased nearly 2 percentage points to 49.2%. This was driven primarily by pricing and COGS favorability. Wine and Spirits gross profit was up slightly as volume and mix benefits were affectively offset by the overlap of the distributor destocking payment. Gross margin held steady at 40.7% as the benefit from mix and favorable COGS were offset by the overlap of the distributor destocking payments. Consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $18 million. Beer SG&A was up $16 million primarily due to the higher marketing spend. Due to the factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $50 million and consolidated operating margin improved 130 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 170 basis points, while Wine and Spirits operating margin held fairly steady. Interest expense for the quarter was $78 million, down 10%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of March, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.2 billion, a decrease of $51 million since the end of fiscal 2015. I would like to take a moment here to note that we are currently in the process of revising our credit agreement to take advantage of the favorable market conditions to extend tenor and ensure our facility is appropriately sized and flexible given the recent growth of our business. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.8% and compares to a 32.5% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by various favorable tax items. We still anticipate our full year tax rate to approximate 30.5%. Now let’s review free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For the first quarter, we generated $76 million of free cash flow, compared to $101 million for Q1 of last year. Operating cash flow totaled $206 million versus $232 million for the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of interest payments and overlap of the tax refund in Q1 FY15, partially offset by our earnings growth. CapEx for the quarter totaled $130 million, which was essentially even with Q1 last year. For fiscal ‘16, we still expect free cash flow to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million. Our projection reflects operating cash flow of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion and CapEx of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal ’16, which includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for beer. Before reviewing our fiscal ’16 P&L outlook, let me provide a few financial comments related to the Meiomi transaction. We expect to finance the $315 million purchase price with borrowings under our credit agreement. We expect the transaction to close around the beginning of August and to be $0.03 to $0.04 accretive to EPS for fiscal ’16. We are only buying the brand, inventory and some great supply contracts, so we expect integration of the brand into our Wine and Spirits business to be seamless. Now let’s move to our full year fiscal ’16 P&L outlook. As mentioned earlier, as a result of the continued strong marketplace performance for our Beer business and the expected accretion benefit from Meiomi, we are increasing our comparable basis diluted EPS projection to $4.80 to $5 versus our previous $4.70 to $4.90 range. The Beer business is now targeting mid to high single-digit volume growth, net sales growth of approximately 10% and 13% to 15% operating income growth. As a reminder, fiscal ’15 beer shipments ran ahead of depletions as distributors brought inventories back to more historical levels. As a result, we expect our fiscal ’16 depletion growth rate to be above the shipment growth rate and therefore in the high single-digit range. We continue to project beer operating margin to expand and be in the 33% range for fiscal '16. This is expected to be driven primarily by gross margin improvement, as we plan to continue to make investments in marketing and our SG&A structure. We expect out beer operating margin to fluctuate throughout the remainder of the year, as we start to bring additional brewery capacity online. During Q2, there will be an annual inflation increase under our Interim Supply Agreement with ABI for the finished beer that they are currently supplying us. For the Wine and Spirits business, we continue to expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid single-digit range before any benefit from the Meiomi acquisition. Our fiscal ’16 comparable basis guidance, excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. These adjustments include approximately $20 million of anticipated costs associated with the cost effectiveness plan outlined by Rob earlier. Cost savings from this initiative are expected to be reinvested in areas of the company that drive growth. We ended Q1 fiscal '16 with a net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.9 times. Even with our projected higher level of CapEx spend, dividend payments and the funding of the Meiomi acquisition, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth have positioned us to be below the four times leverage range at the end of fiscal '16. Operating below the four times range combined with our strong free cash flow generation capabilities, provides us significant financial flexibility, especially as beer CapEx spend normalizes. This flexibility combined with our continued focus on our significant organic growth opportunities. And strong free cash flow generation capabilities should provide us ample opportunity to increase future returns to shareholders through dividend growth and share buybacks. With that, we are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.
Nik Modi: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So Rob just…
David Klein: Good morning Nik.
Nik Modi: Good morning and congratulations David.
David Klein: Thank you.
Nik Modi: Real question strategically on the wine portfolio, Constellation still have a lot of exposure to the low end of the wine segment despite focusing internal and M&A resources on becoming bigger at the higher end. So I’m just curious, have you guys ever thought about becoming a lot more aggressive on shedding the low end of the portfolio and then taking those proceeds to innovate more at the high end and compliment it with more bolt-ons like the one we saw today?
Rob Sands: Yeah, Nik, that’s something that we have done over the years. We’ve really shed the bulk of the low-end portfolio. I think around, I don’t know 2008 when I became CEO and we disposed off the Almaden and Inglenook brands, which were primarily by that time 5-liter bag in the box which really represents the vast majority of the sub-premium market. Now that said, we do desire to continue to offer a full portfolio of wine to both our wholesale and retail customers, because even elements of the sub-premium part of the business remain important. And for us to remain a relevant supplier, we feel that it’s strategically important to remain in that business. Now that said, we really do not focus any of our advertising or marketing dollars against those brands and have really shifted almost virtually a 100% of those resources against our higher margin or I should say high margin focus brands and to drive a positive mix in the business. So that’s currently where we stand. We don’t have any plans to divest anymore of the tail part of the portfolio.
Nik Modi: Great. And then just one real quick one on capital allocations, I know you guys referenced dividend and buybacks. And if you can just provide a little bit more context on buybacks, I mean, can we expect something once the beer CapEx is kind of passed its peak or is that something that could happen sooner?
Rob Sands: Go ahead, David.
David Klein: Yes. So, as you probably know we still have about $700 million remaining under previously authorize share repurchase program. I would say as Rob outlined our capital allocation priorities, we do have the brewery build out underway. We have just recently instituted the dividend. And so I think we need to work our way through those but we are open to share repurchases once again when the time is right.
Nik Modi: Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane: Hey good morning Rob and welcome David. Just the question about the Beer business. You increased your outlook or ratio outlook for the year and just simplistically is that because you track better in the first quarter than what you were expecting in the balance to the year, your plans haven’t really changed much or is it a function of your -- even your outlook for the balance of the year has improved?
Rob Sands: I think it’s both Bryan. I mean the Beer business volume and dollar growth is tracking well ahead of our expectations. We don’t really see a chink in that armor in the rest of the year. So we really don’t have any reason to believe at this stage that there will be a significant slowdown. So, yes, that has caused us to realistically raise our guidance on beer growth for the year to 10% net sales.
Bryan Spillane: Okay. And just as a follow-up the -- in terms of the production turning on in Nava, the additional production turning on by the end of the calendar year, just in terms of milestones, have we started like test batch brewing yet? Is just -- if you just kind of update us where we stand now in terms of the milestones on hitting that target?
David Klein: Yeah. Bryan, so there is a lot of activity going on in Nava as you would expect, right. And so, the first thing is that, we are going to see that really begin to come online our packaging lines. We don’t expect actual brew house to be in a functioning state until closer to the end of the calendar year. But I can say that, at this point everything is going according to plan in the build-out at Nava.
Bryan Spillane: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Rob Sands: Hi, Judy.
Judy Hong: Hi.
David Klein: Good morning, Judy.
Judy Hong: So, first, just, Rob, regarding the CFO transition announcement and understand that Bob is obviously not on the call to answer this question? But, I guess, the timing was somewhat unexpected for many people? So anything you can share with us in terms of what led to that decision, particularly on the timing issue?
Rob Sands: No. I mean, there is really nothing to share. I mean, obviously, the timing was related to when we had these discussions internally and when, therefore, it was appropriate to make the announcement relative to Bob’s departure. So there is really nothing more or less to it than that. Obviously, when the decision was made that that Bob was leaving, we had to make an announcement and I don’t really care when that announcement would have been made it would have seen as it did at whatever time it was, so that’s pretty much it, Judy.
Judy Hong: Okay. Sorry, David.
David Klein: Hi.
Judy Hong: Okay. So, second question, David, just in terms of the gross margin on the beer side, I mean, certainly, Q1, I think, came in a little higher than what we would have anticipated and I think, you commented on some of the fluctuations that you expect throughout the year? But can you give us a little bit more color, just in terms of the bridge for Q1 and how that sort of evolves as we get into the balance of the year?
David Klein: Yeah. So what you would see year-over-year, Q1 to Q1 is, margin expansion driven by pricing, as well as COGS improvement as our procurement team has taken over the procurement activities at the brewery. For the rest of the year and by the way the brewery also was operating effectively at capacity in the first quarter which gives us the better number as well. For the rest of the year, we are going to bring on several packaging lines, we are going to bring on part of a new warehouse and we are going to bring on the first 5 million hectoliters of brewing capacity. And once we put them in service, meaning, we have run beer down the line or beer through the brew house for commercial sale, we then put those assets into service, which means we begin depreciation. However, at that point, there is still a lot of work as you might imagine that goes into optimizing the lines in the brew house and the warehouse, and any of that expense that happen after we put the assets into service falls right to the bottomline as an expense, right. So we expect that that’s going to create some of the choppiness for the rest of the year. And then, additionally, as I mentioned, in my initial comments, we have an inflation adjustment on the finished goods that we are buying from ABI that actually took effect the first week of June. So I think that really kind of bridges this out from the 34.8% really to the 33% range, which we called out.
Judy Hong: Okay. And just on clarification, that also include some of the packaging procurement savings that you would have seen already or expected to see as you get into the balance of the year?
David Klein: Yeah. We built in -- again our procurement guys have done an outstanding job of really getting us some great benefits. We’ve built that into the guidance that we’ve provided for the year.
Judy Hong: Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial.
Mark Swartzberg: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning everyone and congratulations David. Two questions, one on the beer side, we saw price mix just shy of 1%, which was a similar number to the last quarter. Could you just speak to not only your view of that number going forward for you but also to what -- which I presume is largely a mix issue but why isn’t that number stronger? And then how are you -- how does that relate to what you are seeing up there in the market place from competition? So just some comments on the pricing environment, how you see it playing out for you? And then totally unrelated question is on this cost cutting you’ve announced which is good to see. Could you give us a little bit of detail on where you expect those savings to come from and to what extent this is sort of a moment in time thing you’re doing and to what extent you think you’ll be engaging in this sort of thing going forward?
Rob Sands: Yeah, Mark. First of on your question on price mix. Basically, our plan has, I should say, our plan or our view has not changed at all from the year -- for the year. We really haven’t moved into the season where beer pricing is usually taken which is in the fall. We will of course be looking at the market as we normally do on a market-by-market, case-by-case basis. But we still fully expect that we’ll be within our guidance range of 1% to 2% on price mix. So we don’t see anything at the moment that would cause us to believe any differently than that. And then, your second question?
Mark Swartzberg: Well, second question was…
Rob Sands: Yeah. Cost savings from restructuring…
Mark Swartzberg: The cost savings and to what extent…
Rob Sands: Yeah. We don’t expect…
Mark Swartzberg: [Indiscernible] you need to do it?
Rob Sands: Yeah. We don’t expect any material cost savings from the restructuring really because that was more of a streamlining in some areas and a reallocation in other areas. So really what we’ve done here is we’ve taken a look at the business. We’ve said okay what areas could use greater efficiencies, streamlining, areas that aren’t -- I'll say commercially oriented, aren’t directly related to revenue and that we thought could function better and if they were streamlined and made more efficient. At the same time, we are reallocating resources to what we think are critical revenue and growth driving areas for the future of Bill Newlands’ innovation and growth organization. We’re building a big organization, a reasonably large organization under Bill to continue to drive effective growth and innovation. We’re also redirecting dollars to the commercial side of the business in the form of brand building activities again that we think will continue to drive organic growth. So again, we’re just being prudent around making sure that we are investing in the right areas of the business for the future.
Mark Swartzberg: And innovation in Chicago specifically are getting a lot of those -- redirection so to speak with dollars?
Rob Sands: For innovation, yeah, and it’s not Chicago per se, I mean, it’s really San Francisco and Chicago where -- it's both places where beer, Wine and Spirits innovation people are located and then the commercial side of the businesses as I said we’re -- we continue to increase our spends in advertising and marketing because we think that it’s critical to continue to drive the kind of success that we’ve had. So in particular, the commercial side of beer is a very important part of the business for us to continue to invest in because we can’t just take our current growth and be penny wise and dollar foolish for the future. We have to make sure that we are taking all of the right steps to ensure that we are able to maintain this kind of hit it out of the ballpark growth that we’ve been enjoying.
Mark Swartzberg: Great. Great. Okay. Great. That’s very helpful. Thank you, Rob.
Rob Sands: Sure.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group.
Rob Sands: Hi, Tim.
Tim Ramey: Hey. Good morning. Thanks. It looked to me and you sort of alluded to this that the Meiomi acquisition is a lot like the Mark West deal asset like no assets book one sourced. Am I correct in that, or is that a fair characterization of the business?
Rob Sands: Totally fair characterization of the business.
Tim Ramey: Okay.
Rob Sands: It also enables us to reallocate internally some of our resources against higher end Pinot Noir.
Tim Ramey: Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, this means higher capacity utilization for Pinot Noir.
Rob Sands: Yeah. A lot of synergies is at the bottomline because as you said, there are no assets other than some existing inventory in the intellectual property. So we are fully capable of continuing to produce the wine in the style that -- and this is important. The style -- have you had the wine?
Tim Ramey: I have not. I’m yet to try.
Rob Sands: It’s an interesting Pinot Noir. I mean it did become successful as it is, because it’s sort of a run of the mill product. It’s a somewhat unique product for a Pinot Noir and that it’s a little heavier and fuller body than I would say your typical California Pinot Noir in that price point.
Tim Ramey: Got it.
Rob Sands: And you tell something about that, Tim?
Tim Ramey: Okay. I will do more research. And I’m guessing the relevant EBITDA for the $65 million in sales, may not be that big. Do you feel like you can disclose that? Are you basically valuing this off the performing EBITDA?
Rob Sands: Yeah. No, we really haven’t disclosed it. But the purchase price pre-synergies was about 10 times the transferred margins. So post-synergies, it’s going to be significantly better than that. So it’s real good deal especially given the growth rate, which was I think 50% in IRI on over a half a million cases in the last 12 months. So, I mean tremendous deal.
Tim Ramey: If it’s anything like Mark West, you will have a great success. Thanks a lot.
Rob Sands: Better than Mark West, Tim.
Tim Ramey: Okay.
Rob Sands: Not that that wasn’t a great one too.
Tim Ramey: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.
Rob Sands: Hey Vivien.
Vivien Azer: Hi, guys. Good morning. How are you?
David Klein: Good morning.
Vivien Azer: Congratulations, David. My first question has to do with your outlook, clearly quite good. I was hoping you could offer a little bit of incremental color in terms of the positive guidance revision, Corona relative to Modelo please?
David Klein: Yeah. I would say in the, kind of breakout between Corona and Model is 50. I think the interesting thing that we’ve seen in our portfolio over the recent history has been the growth and acceleration of growth for Corona Extra. About 40% of that growth has been driven by the can introduction, which we are very pleased. But again, it’s such a large brand that the Corona brand growing is very good for Constellation. And I would say that we still -- we expect to continue to see the growth rates that we’ve been experiencing recently for Modelo Especial and others. There is no indication that that brand is slowing down at this time.
Vivien Azer: Terrific. That’s helpful. Thank you. My second question switching to the wine side of the business. Rob, you outlined a number of commercial initiatives and marketing that’s launching around the number of wine brands. So as we think about total company [A&P] [ph] as a percentage of sales, certainly that’s stepped up in '15. How should we think about that for fiscal '16 please?
Rob Sands: For this year?
Vivien Azer: Yes please.
Rob Sands: Yes. I think that we will continue to see two things, okay, increased marketing and the concentration of that marketing against the smaller subset of brands. As I mentioned, we have initiated TV marketing at fairly significant rates against Black Box, Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, for example. And with the way that we can measure very directly now through household type surveys and pantry studies the impact of our advertising, we believe quite strongly that some of these campaigns, in particular the Black Box and the Mondavi Woodbridge that we have previously tested is actually not only good for longer-term brand building, but we think that it pays back in the short run with the incremental increase in purchases and consumption that we’ve seen in the test markets where we run these ads. So we are expanding that. And I think that what you’re seeing basically is our depletion growth, which was in the 3.5% range, which is an acceleration, is indicative that what we’re doing is working. And then also from a depletion point of view, which is a little hard to see through our financial results, which are shipment based, we are seeing a pretty significant increase in mix as well against the business. So pretty much I would say that what we are doing here is working pretty well, in fact I think very well. So we are pretty optimistic about the Wine and Spirits business for the remainder of the year.
Vivien Azer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.
Caroline Levy: Thank you so much.
Rob Sands: Thank you.
Caroline Levy: Hi. And congratulations, David. We look to forward to spending more time with you. My question is about the regional performance of the Beer business, because it seems like Sydney Big Bear had a very difficult May from what I understand. And there was quite a bit of out-of-date inventory on the shelves towards the end of May, early June. And maybe that is simply in certain regions. But any detail you could give us on what you saw in your brands and whether you think big brands will hold pricing as you move through the summer?
Rob Sands: Yes. So May was tough for some of our competitors. It was not particularly tough for ourselves. We saw a slight deceleration, but it was probably a result of their being one less selling day in the month, which has about a 1/20th or a 5% anticipated impact, June, very strong. IRI dollars for our Beer business in the four week period ending 06/21, up 14% for Constellation’s Beer business in dollars, so we see no negative impact or unusual occurrence relative to May on our business. But as I said, yeah, some of our competitors have found that period to be difficult. And regionally the answer continues to be no as well. There is nothing going on regionally for us in terms of a shift of geographic mix, or we’re not seeing an acceleration in some parts of the country and a slowdown and other. Everything is pretty much steady as it goes, so nothing for us. Hence, we increased our guidance now for the year to the 10% sales growth range on the Beer business because as I said in my -- in the answer to some of the earlier questions, it’s just evident to us that our previous guidance was understated relative to current and expected trends for the remainder of the year.
Caroline Levy: That’s excellent. Just a quick follow-on on the cans, there are markets where you’ve tasted them where cans are 6% of mix. Overall, can you give us an idea of where they are now and where you think they could go?
Rob Sands: Yes. So just kind of to look at quarter-over-quarter and I will focus on Corona because remember, Modelo Especial is a big can brand, right. But the new launch is really focused on Corona Extra. And for Corona Extra, say first quarter last year, about 3% of our depletions were in cans and this year was about 5%. We clearly believe that we’ll continue to see the can momentum build. And we also know, however, that we won’t end up with a can mix like the domestic players. But we think we can someday line up maybe more in line with some of the other import players in terms of their can mix.
Caroline Levy: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.
Rob Ottenstein: Great. Good. Terrific quarter, guys. Just back on the cans where we’re on that, can you give us any sort of sense of -- and I know it’s a guess, what sort of cannibalization rate you’re getting with can?
David Klein: We think the cannibalization rate is fairly low, actually probably below everybody’s expectation. So, I don’t think we can really know what the cannibalization rate is by the way, right, because you’d have to say well, okay, glass would have grown at X percent but for the cans, we can’t answer that question necessarily. And so we think the cans are representing -- let's put it this way, primarily incremental business. So probably at this like 3% to 5% that we’re talking about right now, cans are being used on occasions where glass could not here 2%, 4%, have been used. And therefore, we think pretty low cannibalization and pretty much incremental growth.
Rob Ottenstein: Okay. Thank you. And as my follow-up, it’s my understanding that at California and particularly, Southern California represents something like 25% of the business and Texas 10%. And I was just very surprised that you didn’t apparently see any impact from kind of historically bad weather and rainfalls in those areas and it’s obviously a tribute to the strength and momentum of the business. But I’m just wondering would results have been even better with kind of normal weather in Southern California and Texas?
Rob Sands: Yes. Maybe. I would say, yes. I’d say, we did see a little bit of impact of weather towards the end of May but everything just kind of bounced right back in June. So it’s kind of hard to say whether there was really any impact from that. Probably as I said, the sell day was the greatest impact that we had in May, even though the weather had do have had some kind of effect on a temporary basis on the sales. But we don’t think that it was anything material and it certainly hasn’t driven any trend change into the extent that I don’t know, in Texas people couldn’t get out and buy beer, they restocked.
Rob Ottenstein: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
Bill Chappell: Good morning. Thanks for the question. And welcome, David. Two quick ones. One, just on back on Meiomi, should we still kind of expect the kind of one deal a year tuck-in whereas the market changed where you’re seeing more opportunities out there in the wine space?
Rob Sands: I think that the one deal a year is an overstatement. Let’s see, since I have been CEO for the last eight years, I think we’ve done three deals of that nature, Mark West, Casa Noble, and now Meiomi. Our strategy hasn’t changed. No, we don’t -- I don’t think that there is any more significant deal flow. I wouldn’t suggest anything different will occur from a number or timing perspective. We keep our eye open for these kinds of things that come around every once in a while. They are very advantageous if it’s the right thing at the right time. We tried to stay away from some of the -- I’m going to say trendier stuff that has the tendency to kind of go up and down. You take Meiomi, you take Mark West. These were classic brands in a category. In this case, pinot noir, which is not trendy, but fast growing and will continue we believe to be a fast growing varietal as people continue to discover pinot noir. And we think taste preferences are on a long-term basis changing towards pinot noir. So Mark West covers sort of the $10 to $12 pinot noir range and Meiomi covers sort of the $20-plus pinot noir range. So that puts us in a really strong position in one of the fastest growing and most stable segments of wine, which is the pinot noir varietal in particular. So now no change in sort of the frequency or of those kind of deals.
Bill Chappell: Okay. Thanks. And that helps. And then David just actually housekeeping on tax rate, tax rate is higher this quarter. Should it just be close to the 30.3 for the rest of the year or is there any given quarter where there is kind of catch-up to get you that 30.5?
David Klein: Yes. I think as you know our tax rate, our ATR in a given quarter is really driven by the geography of the earnings and our resolution of our various tax issues. So I would say that for us we are confident in the 30.5 rate and we don’t really have a view on the quarters where the delta will land.
Bill Chappell: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. I’ll now turn the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Okay. Well, thank you everyone for joining our call today. We covered a lot of ground. But before we go, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the excellent performance of our business this quarter. Our team plans to continue to capitalize on the tremendous momentum we have underway in the Beer business to drive growth and enhance financial performance. From a Wine and Spirits perspective, we are gaining traction and we are on track to achieve our goals for the year. I’m also excited about the acquisition of Meiomi wine business, which is an excellent addition to our portfolio. Our fiscal '16 is off to a great start and we are eager to continue this momentum into our summer selling season. As we head into the 4th of July holiday weekend, I hope you remember to bring some of our fine wine products to your celebration and to please enjoy them responsibly. We will be on the road next week as we begin to introduce David Klein to those of you he has not already met. So I look forward to seeing you.
Operator: Thank you for participating in the Constellation Brands first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Constellation Brands’ Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Paula. Good morning everyone and welcome to Constellation’s fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2015 conference call. I’m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news releases which have also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company’s Web site at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company’s estimates, please refer to the news releases and Constellation’s SEC filings. And now I’d like to turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Sands: Thanks, Patty and good morning everyone. Before I begin the review of our accomplishments for the year and our plans for fiscal 2016, I would like to focus your attention on the press release issued earlier today reporting that our board of directors has approved the initiation of a quarterly common stock cash dividend for the first time in the history of our company. This milestone is of particular significance because it reflects the confidence that we and our board of directors have in our ability to execute against growth opportunities, invest in our businesses and generate free cash flow that could be returned to you, our shareholders. It is the collective strength of our businesses that has abled this action and demonstrated by the impressive results achieved by the company in fiscal 2015. Since the acquisition of our beer business almost two years ago, we have had no shortage of milestones. We emerged as the number one multi-category player in alcoholic beverages and we are committing significant investment to our world class brewery in Mexico and our key [ph] beer brands continue to achieve outstanding growth and garner accolades for their quality. For example, six of our wine and spirits brands and three of our beer brands won Impact's Hot Brands award for 2014 as announced in early March. Collectively, these accomplishments have driven the appreciation of our stock which remains one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. So now let's talk about some of our key achievements for fiscal 2015 and the great initiatives we have underway as we charge ahead to an exciting fiscal 2016. This past summer, we purchased Casa Noble Tequila, an award winning handcrafted super-premium tequila, which has been a great addition to our portfolio. This fast growing tequila brand naturally complements our Mexican beer brands and fits well into our existing wine and spirits distribution infrastructure. More recently, we hired our new Chief Growth Officer, Bill Newlands, who is responsible for providing greater focus and coordination on the long-term growth opportunities across our beer and wine and spirits businesses. In addition, Bill is accountable for accelerating innovation and new product development initiatives and leveraging strategic insights and customer analytics while identifying synergies across total beverage alcohol within our national accounts organizations. Bill reports directly to me and I am happy that he has joined our executive management team. One of our major accomplishments for the year was the implementation of a multifaceted long-term, glass strategy for our beer business under favorable terms with key industry players, which included the formation of a 50:50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world's leading glass container producer to own, operate, and expand the Nava glass plant. The acquisition by the joint venture of ABI's state-of-the-art glass plant located adjacent to our brewery in Mexico and the execution of a glass supply agreement with Mexican glass manufacturer, Vitro, the benefits of which we will begin to fully realize once their Monterrey glass plant has been completed. We believe this comprehensive sourcing strategy provides an optimal solution for this essential component of our beer production process, while securing future supply of materials and approved margins on finished products. Now the commercial side of our business continued to achieve stellar growth in fiscal 2015, outperforming the U.S. beer industry key competitors and all other imports for the fifth consecutive year with growth achieved by every brand in our Mexican beer portfolio. As a result, Constellation Brands’ beer business was the number one contributor to growth in the U.S. beer category in fiscal 2015, while delivering market share growth across all channels in 48 out of 50 states. More importantly, our beer business growth has accelerated every year since 2010 and depletion trends accelerating to greater than 8% in fiscal 2015. I would like to take a minute to share some of this past year's amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands and highlight the key initiatives we plan to execute during fiscal 2016 in order to maintain this excellent momentum for the business. Let's begin with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. These brands are not only the biggest but have contributed the greatest incremental volume growth. Our flagship Corona Extra brand is the best selling imported beer in the United States. This brand sold more than 105 million cases in fiscal 2015 and posted depletion growth of more than 3% for the year. Corona Extra was the only top five beer brands in the U.S. to achieve growth last year with volume trends for this brand continuing to maintain their solid momentum. In fiscal 2016, we expect to capitalize on the growth of Corona Extra through increased national TV advertising, sports media, boxing sponsorships, and by leveraging our acquisition of Casa Noble. According to GuestMetrics, during calendar 2014, Corona Extra continues to be the number one selling imported beer in the off-premise channel. To further support Corona Extra, we plan to increase our investment to expand activations in on premise accounts throughout the year. Most importantly, fiscal 2016 will represent the year of the can for Corona Extra. We see great opportunity for growth with cans, as this format currently represents less than 3% of total sales for Corona Extra. Last year, we represented another record setting year for Modelo Especial with depletion growth of more than 16%. The Modelo Especial brand family contributed more dollar growth to the total beverage alcohol category than any other brand family in beer, wine, or spirits in fiscal 2015. Modelo Especial has become the number two imported beer in the U.S. with more than 15% share of the imported beer category, which has nearly doubled the share for this brand just five years ago. Our strategic initiatives in fiscal 2016 for Modelo Especial include increased media and general market advertising, continued execution with Modelo Especial Chelada, on-premise activation, retail sponsorships and promotion, and Hispanic marketing and advertising and media investments. As you are aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our two biggest brands. Part of what makes our collection of brands so powerful is the long-term potential of our smaller brands. So let me provide some examples. Corona Light. Corona Light posted record sales in fiscal 2015 hitting the 14.5 million case mark and growing depletions almost 4% versus the prior year. We have had good success expanding the distribution of Corona Light Draft and we plan to continue building on this success in fiscal 2016 by expanding our national Draft footprint with recent launches in eight additional markets. We are also re-launching Corona Light cans supported with redesigned secondary packaging which will be featured in our new advertising campaign highlighting Corona Light as the light Cerveza. Finally, we plan on continuing our partnership with Kenny Chesney which has been a great asset for this brand. Victoria has become third best selling beer in Mexico with a 15% market share of that market. In fiscal 2015, U.S. depletions for Victoria increased 60% driven primarily by the Mexican Hispanic consumer and expanded distribution for this brand into 19 new states. In fiscal 2016, we are excited to introduce Victoria cans into the U.S. market for the first time. Our support strategy for Victoria will focus on continuing to drive distribution and generate awareness for the new can format during key promotional periods. Overall, I am excited about the organic growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2016. As you can see we have tremendous opportunity to growth the business organically through enhanced distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio. As a result for our beer business in fiscal 2016 we are targeting high single digit sales growth which exceeds U.S. beer industry and import trend estimates and is expected to drive operating income growth in the 10% to 12% range. From a brewery and operational perspective in fiscal 2015, we achieved our key brewery performance goals relating to utilization, quality and cost. All areas of the brewery expansion are well underway with the project expansion on schedule from both a budget and timing of completion perspective. The packaging area and high density warehouses are progressing on schedule as well as utilities and waste water projects. Fabrication of beer tanks has been completed and we recently added capacity to our can line in order to reduce our dependence on ABI for cans. The new joint venture management team has been established at the glass plant and has begun work on the next glass furnace to be built on site at this newly acquired facility. The team has done an amazing job during brewery construction to minimize the impact on commercial business execution in the marketplace. As we begin fiscal 2016, we will be intensely focused on the continued expansion of the brewery with the first incremental 10 million hectoliters of capacity expected to become fully operational just more than a year from now in the summer of calendar 2016. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the beer business. This has been driven by a combination of robust consumer demand, strong sales execution, excellence support from our wholesalers, creative new marketing and advertising programs, as well as the outstanding efforts of our commercial team and our brewery team in Mexico. And now I would like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During fiscal 2015 we achieved EBIT growth of 6% for our wine and spirits business and increase operating profit margin by 130 basis points. Our spirits portfolio achieved better than expected results as well as our Canadian business which exceeded its financial goals for the year while growing share across all strategic product categories. Sales growth in the U.S. benefited from positive mixed trend and some favorable pricing as we executed price increases in fiscal 2015 for select wine products in the value and luxury segments of the U.S. market while also growing distribution at key U.S. retailers. Wine and spirits EBIT growth was primarily driven by positive mix and COGS benefits including reduced grape costs as well as positive impacts from ongoing blend optimization initiatives and productivity improvements. In addition, EBIT benefited from distributor performance payments as our exclusive distributor contracts included in the selling structure that is just based on achievement of specific executional performance metrics for the year. In terms of our overall U.S. depletion performance for fiscal 2015, our distributor sales to retail for Constellation's total U.S. wine and spirits business across all channels remained relatively flat. Now this compares to U.S. wines and spirits industry depletion growth of approximately 1% across all channels as reported by the Beverage Information Group for calendar 2014. As expected, our overall U.S. wine dollar market share eroded slightly in fiscal 2015 driven by the super premium priced segment which remains highly competitive and currently generates a good deal of the U.S. wine category growth. However, we have gained share in the important premium and ultra-premium price segments of the market and are working diligently to ensure our portfolio remains relevant and at the top of mind for our consumers in all key price segments. And we continue to experience solid depletion growth for a number of our fast growing wine brands including, Kim Crawford, Mark West, Ruffino, SIMI, Black Box, Nobilo and The Dreaming Tree. The strength of our portfolio begins with quality products and I am very proud to say that we received over 300 wine competition medals last year and 52 of our wines received 90 plus point ratings. This includes a 93 point score for Robert Mondavi Winery 2011 To-Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve in the Wine Enthusiast and a 90 plus rating for our Ruffino Riserva Ducale Oro. And our list of achievements continues. Five of our brands made IRI's top 21 brands in 2014 including Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. 15 of our brands were winners of the Beverage Information Group 2015 Growth Brand Award including two spirits and 13 wine brands. And many of our other wine brands continue to generate great media attention from a variety of news and lifestyle publications including The Wall Street Journal, Food and Wine Magazine and Forbes.com, to name a few. Earlier I mentioned that six of our wine and spirits brands made to Impact Hot Brands list. It's important to note that this list includes well established brands such as Kim Crawford which has won eight years in a row and Black Box, which is celebrating its tenth consecutive win. It also includes The Dreaming Tree for the second year in a row which is a testament to the level of success of our innovative efforts -- that our innovative efforts can achieve. We experienced excellent sales growth of 8% for our spirits portfolio in fiscal 2015 driven by Paul Masson Brandy and SVEDKA Vodka. The recent data received from the Beverage Information Group for calendar 2014, SVEDKA is the only vodka amongst the top five largest volume vodka brands that achieved growth for the year. In a category that is evolving as consumer preferences change, SVEDKA continues to win in the marketplace. SVEDKA's innovative flavors like strawberry lemonade and mango pineapple are driving current success and we look forward in seeing the results from our recent launch of our grapefruit jalapeño flavor. In addition, the success of Paul Masson peach brandy has exceeded our own expectations and we are currently expanding the product into additional formats and developing other new and exciting flavors for our brandy as we have done with our vodka and our whiskey brands. Overall, we gained IRI dollars share in imported vodka and Canadian whiskey categories for fiscal 2015. Our Casa Noble Tequila brand has been fully integrated into our portfolio and we see significant opportunities to increase awareness and trial of this brand in the coming months. As we approach the Cinco de Mayo holiday, you will begin to see cross-promotional activities between Casa Noble and Corona Extra which will help capture more merchandizing and floor space at retail and in the on-premise channels. From a strategic perspective, in 2016 our goal is to grow profit for the wine and spirits business while also growing revenue which is reflected in our fiscal 2016 wine and spirits guidance to achieve low to mid single digit sales growth and EBIT growth for the year. We also expect to maintain the margin improvement we achieved in 2015. And we are committed to executing the following strategies in an effort to make this goal a reality. We will continue to focus our marketing efforts on a subset of focus brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest potential. These brands include, Woodbridge, Kim Crawford and Black Box, just to name a few. We remain committed to margin accretive innovation and new product development and have launched an enterprise-wide product development process review to improve our results in this area and increase the success rate of our new product pipeline. We have a team dedicated to this process to make sure our innovation is thoughtful and measured and positions us to ultimately win in this area. We believe we have a winner with our new Tom Gore wine brand in the coming year. We plan to improve sales execution and increase points of distribution by delivering more effective feature and display activity at retail with added accountability and visibility for both Constellation and our distributors. Speaking of our distributors, our renegotiated and exclusive U.S. distributor arrangements are in place and will provide increased resources and improved performance metrics while enhancing wholesaler and retailer execution. For the second consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases for selected products in the value and luxury segments of the U.S. wine market. And finally, we plan to optimize our COGS through continued global bland management initiative, productivity improvements and lower grape cost. Overall, we are committing people, technology and resources to our work with our wholesalers and retailers to execute growth for our wine and spirits business. In closing, in fiscal 2015 we delivered industry leading market results for our beer business while exceeding our goals across the board for volumes, depletions, sales and net income. Our wine and spirits business delivered improved margins and earnings growth with the Canadian business and our spirits portfolio achieving better than expected results. Overall, we remain committed to challenging ourselves in fiscal 2016 in order to optimize the business opportunities that lie ahead. Calendar 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of our business which has become Constellation Brands. We are excited to build on the success achieved in fiscal 2015 as we head into the New Year with high expectations to create the next wave of growth for our company. With that I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our fourth quarter and year-end results.
Bob Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal '15 was a very exciting and strong year where we continued to strengthen our financial profile as we generated $6 billion of sales and 5% of organic sales growth. Expanded our operating margins in both segments for consolidated comparable basis operating margin increase of more than 200 basis points and established some all time highs with consolidated EBIT reaching $1.6 billion, up nearly 30%. Comparable basis diluted EPS up more than 35% to $4.44, and operating cash flow up more than 30% while crossing the $1 billion mark. We also reduced our overall average interest rate by securing attractive long-term financing and we advanced our long-term strategy related to beer glass sourcing and made significant progress on our brewery expansion activities. We anticipate fiscal '16 to be another productive year as we expect to generate healthy net sales, EBIT and EPS growth while continuing to invest in our world class brewery as part of our efforts to become fully independent from a beer production standpoint. In addition, given the financial strength of each of our business segments and the resultant capital allocation flexibility, we are very pleased to be returning cash to shareholders through the initiation of a quarterly dividend. Given those highlights, let's look at fiscal '15 performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our earnings news release, consolidated net sales for the year were up 24% which included $941 million of incremental net sales due to the timing of the beer business acquisition. Consolidated organic net sales on a constant currency basis grew 5%. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 8%. Beer shipment volume growth of 10% came in ahead of depletion growth as distributors increased their inventory position during the second half of the year in an effort to be more aligned with historical levels and to be better positioned to meet consumer demand heading into the key summer selling season. Pricing benefits helped beer net sales growth reach 12%. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant currency basis increased 1%. This reflects positive mix combined with a distributor make whole payment associated with the planned distributor destocking during the first quarter and distributor performance payments recognized during the fourth quarter, partially offset by lower volume, lower non-branded net sales and higher promotional spend. For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $630 million. The increase primarily reflects $443 million of incremental benefit from the consolidating of beer business for an additional 14 weeks in fiscal '15 as a result of the beer business acquisition, as well as volume growth and favorable pricing for the base beer business and favorable mix and COGS for wine and spirits. Our consolidated gross margin increased 260 basis points to 43.8% for the year primarily due to the benefits of consolidating the higher margin beer business and beer pricing, favorable mix and COGS for the wine and spirits business as well as the distributor performance and destocking payments also contributed to the consolidated gross margin improvement. I would like to note that we have included gross profit and gross margin data in our segment disclosures in our press release and in our segment history file posted on our Web site. SG&A for the year increased $216 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $134 million. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher marketing and SG&A for the base beer business. Due to the factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $415 million and consolidated operating margin improved 230 basis points. Equity earnings decreased $66 million, primarily due to the timing of the beer business acquisition. Interest expense for the year was $338 million, up 4% versus last year. The increase was primarily due to higher average borrowings partially offset by lower average interest rates. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of February, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.2 billion, an increase of $281 million since the end of fiscal 2014. As a reminder, during Q3 we issued $800 million of senior notes consisting of $400 million of 3.875 notes due in 2019 and $400 million of 4.75% notes due 2024. Part of the proceeds from the notes issuance was used to redeem $500 million of 8.375% senior notes. The remaining proceeds helped fund the acquisition of the glass plant and related infrastructure. Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 29.5% and compares to a 31.2% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the benefit of foreign tax credits during the fourth quarter. Now let’s briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in a $1.03, up 27%. The tax benefit I just mentioned was a big driver of our EPS growth as our Q4 tax rate came in at 23.2% versus a 34.8% rate in Q4 last year. Beer business results for the quarter finished strong. Depletions for the quarter were up 9%. Volume and net sales were both up 11%. While we continued to see a pricing benefit during the quarter, it was essentially offset by certain adjustments to net sales related to the beer recall and other items recorded during the fourth quarter. Operating income was up 9%. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant currency basis were up 2% for the quarter. This reflects the benefit of favorable mix and distributor performance payments partially offset by lower volume. Wine and spirits operating income decreased 2% as higher marketing and SG&A costs unfavorably impacted quarterly results. Now let's discuss free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spend. For fiscal '15, we generated $362 million of free cash flow compared to $603 million last year. Operating cash flow for fiscal '15 totaled $1.1 billion versus $826 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the net benefits generated by the beer business. CapEx for fiscal '15 totaled $719 million compared to $224 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled about $600 million and is primarily related to the brewery expansion. For fiscal '16, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million. Our free cash flow projection reflects operating cash flow of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion and capital spending of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16. Our CapEx projection includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for the beer segment. Based on the midpoint of our guidance, we are targeting a 15% increase in operating cash for fiscal '16. This benefit is being more than offset by the increase in our CapEx spending related to the brewery and glass plant expansions. This activity is timing related as these projects are progressing as planned from an overall cost and timing of completion perspective. As you will see in our press release, we have provided an updated table summarizing the spending incurred and estimated future spending for these beer business projects. Now let's move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook. We are forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.90 a share. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items which are detailed in the release. The beer business is targeting mid-single digit volume growth, high-single digit net sales growth and 10% to 12% operating income growth. Given that fiscal '15 beer shipments ran ahead of depletions as distributors brought inventories back to more historical levels, we expect our fiscal '16 depletion growth to be above shipment growth and to be in the high single digit range. A result that would continue to be far outpace the import category and the total beer industry. Our guidance implies operating margin expansion for our beer business as we are projecting operating margins to be in the 33% range for fiscal '16. This is expected to be driven primarily by gross margin improvement as we plan to continue to make investments in marketing and our SG&A infrastructure at a higher rate than our level of net sales growth. For the wine and spirits business, we expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single digit range. Volume growth is expected to be in the low single digit range and we expect to generate positive mix, again take some pricing and generate additional COGS benefits. Interest expense is expected to be in the $325 million to $335 million range. The tax rate is expected to approximate 30.5%. Our guidance also factors in the initiation of a quarterly dividend. As Rob noted this represents a significant milestone in our history. Returning cash to shareholders demonstrates the confidence we have in the overall growth prospects and the strong free cash flow generation capabilities for both our beer and wine and spirits business. We are initially targeting a dividend payout ratio of 25% to 30% of our comparable basis net income. And for fiscal 2016, we are anticipating approximately $240 million in dividend payments. We ended fiscal '15 with a net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio of 4.1 times. Even with our projected higher level of CapEx spend and the initiation of a dividend, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth has us positioned to meet our targeted three to four times leverage range during fiscal '16. Operating within our targeted leverage range combined with our strong free cash flow generation capabilities, provides us significant financial flexibility. Going forward, as our beer CapEx spend normalizes, this provides us the ability to evaluate opportunities to increase our dividend and resume our share buyback program. In closing, I would say that as we exit an eventful and successful 2015, the future looks equally bright. We are a leader in growing in profitable consumer categories that are critically important to our distributors and our retailers. At a consolidated level, a strong U.S. dollar and an improving U.S. economy are positive consolation. And we have minimal exposure to emerging markets. In wine and spirits we continue to expect mid single sales growth for the industry. In fiscal '15, we increased our operating profit margin 130 basis points and finished the year with a margin of nearly 24%. We expect to maintain that margin in fiscal 2016. We have some work to do in order to reinvigorate our top line but we have put in a lot of effort against this area as reflected in our guidance. Longer-term, we anticipate continued strong category growth and we expect to at least maintain market share. In the beer segment, we continue to deliver industry leading sales growth and we continue to make progress towards our mid-30% operating profit margin goal. We are on schedule with our aggressive brewery and glass plant build out which requires us to reinvest most of our consolidated operating cash flow in 2016. Our beer business generates very strong margins and the very high operating returns on invested capital, so the payback on this investment should be quite fast. In beer, we feel our strong brand equity, marketplace and distributor network momentum, opportunities to increase portfolio distribution and grow sales in the can and draft formats and favorable consumer demographics provide us with a very positive growth outlook. In addition to these positive business factors, we believe our strong cash generation capabilities and our ability to quickly delever should provide us ample future opportunity to increase returns to shareholders through dividend growth and share buybacks. With that, we are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.
Nik Modi: A couple of quick questions from me. Bob, can you just clarify, you talked about other issues that affected the price fix number in beer. I just was hoping you could provide a little bit more clarity on exactly what that was? And then the second question on the capital allocation. When you talk about taking up the dividend, is this more about growing in line with earnings or do you ultimately see a payout ratio getting towards the higher end of your peer group, which is, I think, around 45% or so? And then the third question -- sorry for the multiple questions -- is on wine. What specific initiatives should we be looking at or for to really see the wine volume momentum turn from what we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters?
Bob Ryder: Sure, Nik. So on the first question, it was a little bit garbled but I think you are asking about Q4 pricing and Q4 beer margins. Essentially what happened it was really just a timing thing because of -- the big piece was -- because of the Corona recall and we got fully reimbursed from InBev for that activity. That just caused some anomalies as to how we account for that and the difference between what happens in sales and what happens in volumes. And then there was another reclass that happened in the fourth quarter. So what I would do is, I would just look at the full year numbers which would be more reflective of the real price volume relationship. For the second question on the dividend. We are just starting out. I think we are very happy, for the first time in the company's history to be instituting a dividend. And I think we wanted to start out probably on the lower level of where peers are and part of that is the fact that we are still right around the four times EBITDA leverage ratio. We expect that to come down very fast, but we thought we would start out a little slow. I would say that we are focused on 25% to 30% payout ratio, and we feel the combination of pretty strong medium to longer-term EPS growth would allow us to grow the dividend in line with EPS and in future years we may actually assess where we want to be in that 25% to 30% payout range. Right now we are at the lower end, but certainly we have room to go to the higher end of that range. The third question which is more around wine volumes, I will let Rob answer.
Rob Sands: Yes. Hi, Nik. Wine volumes, you know basically, Nik, we have got a lot of programs that we have put in place for our fiscal 2016 to drive, I will say better wine volume growth. And in particular, we have got some increased marketing against key brands. We have been increasing marketing. We have been doing a lot of research on exactly what kind of marketing will get us the best results, and we are implementing some new programs that we are very optimistic will in fact drive more sales growth in fiscal 2016 against key brands, and that’s the whole portfolio versus 2015. We have got lot of new programs around activation in the marketplace and sales execution to drive points of distribution as well as increased merchandizing display and other activity at retail around our brand, so a lot of programs that we have put in place as we moved into this year and I would say we are pretty optimistic that we will meet our top line goals.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane: So, just two related questions just to clarify on the guidance for fiscal '16. One is, if you look at the margin guidance in beer, Bob, you've got -- you're beginning to incur some of the operating expenses and expensing the expenses related to the brewery expansion. So you've got the can line in, you'll have more of the capacity, I guess, beginning to be tested and such. So could you just dimensionalize for us a little bit how much expense there is? How it's affecting the margins, and maybe how long we'll have that dynamic where there's some expenses related to the start up that really don't have revenues attached to them?
Bob Ryder: Yes, sure. So a good question Bryan. So, we experienced a little bit of this in the fourth quarter. As you bring these big lines on, a bunch of things happen. First, they start to depreciate. These are brand new lines, so the depreciation expense is not insignificant. Secondly, as you bring them on and you are testing them, right of the bat and this lasts for quite a while, you are not getting very good yields nor are you getting very good asset utilization. So that kind of increases your expenses. Right. So it takes a while when these big lines are coming on to get them operating at full optimization. And as we look at beer margins in '16, there is actually – there are some big movers. Right. I mean we expect to save a reasonable amount of money because of glass, okay, because we will be sourcing more glass from our joint venture location, which has no freight and has the lowest cost of produced glass of all our suppliers. That’s a positive. Another reasonably big positive is foreign exchange. But offsetting that is an increase in depreciation, not insignificant, and some increased labor costs as you have these startup expenses and you are bringing on labor ahead of the time that you are actually getting a lot of usable product from those new production lines. So they are kind of the big offsetting things. That being said, we are pretty happy that we finished this year's operating profit margin pretty much exactly where we said we would, right around 32% in beer. And we are anticipating 100 basis point improvement even though we have got a lot of these new big production lines coming on stream. So we are pretty happy with that guidance.
Bryan Spillane: Okay, that's helpful. And if I could just sneak in, the guidance range at $4.70-$4.90, as I was just kind of quickly plugging numbers in I was trying to figure out how you get to the high end of the range? Because it seems like you can get to the middle pretty easily given sort of the revenue and the margin guide you've given. So is the high end of the range basically really going to be more predicated on how well sales do relative to your guidance, meaning be at the high end or above? Or is the high end of that guidance range more tied to some of the margin expansion?
Bob Ryder: Yes, I think it's probably -- look we are a consumer product company so the way we would like to get it is through sales that are higher than we anticipate. And generally that’s what drive the bus on a consumer product P&L. So I would probably say the higher end of the guidance would be coming through the higher end of the guidance on our sales guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Bob Doctor: Hi, this is Bob Doctor standing in for Dara. I just have two questions. First, on the long-term volume expectations for the beer business. You recently communicated a goal to distributors of roughly doubling the business by 2024 which implies a healthy 6% 10-year CAGR. I was just curious, is this a real target investors should be focused on or more of a pie in the sky number you threw out to distributors? And then second, if you could just provide some updated color on the U.S. beer pricing environment which has decelerated a bit? And then specific to your pricing strategy, is the plan really more geared towards relative pricing gaps or has strong volume growth really emboldened you guys to take more of an absolute approach? Thanks.
Bob Ryder: Yes, Bob. On the first question, I will answer a bit of it and then I will let Rob answer as he know more about the industry than I do. When we provided our updated capital spending guidance earlier this year, we did provide some medium term volume guidance which actually was driving the need to expand the brewery right from a 20 million or 25 million hectoliters. I think at that time we said the medium term volume guidance was mid-single digits, right. So I think your number was probably consistent. And that being said, next year's depletion guidance is more like 8% so it's higher than that. So that was kind of medium term. I think that brought us through fiscal '17, fiscal '18. For longer-term industry discussion, I will hand it over to Rob.
Rob Sands: Yes. I think the answer to your question is it's definitely not pie in the sky. I would say that doubling the business over the next ten years is based on what we think is going to happen in the beer market and in particular how imports are going to continue to grow and then how our portfolio is going to continue to grow based on what we see or know is going to happen with the Hispanic demographic group and the growth of LDAs in that group. We think that doubling the business over the next ten years is certainly a doable number. I won't say that we got so detailed in our distributor meetings as to exactly how that’s going to occur, i.e. organically or otherwise. But of course over the next ten years we are going to have to have new products, new packaging, new SKUs etcetera, to keep the growth of the portfolio as it is. Plus obviously, as Bob pointed out, we are starting out ahead of where we need to be CAGR wise to achieve that. So I think we feel pretty optimistic that that is a very achievable goal and number.
Bob Ryder: And the Bob as far as the pricing comment, look beer is a local business. So we look at pricing differently by geographic regions because we have different competitive dynamics in the different regions and different competitors take different pricing actions in the different regions. So we do pay attention to the momentum we have in those individual regions. What is our key price gaps to our key competitors in those regions and we kind of make decisions in those individual geographic regions and that kind of roles up to the more macro number which you would see reflected in IRI or Nielson.
Operator: Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong: My first question is just a little bit more clarification on what happened in the fourth quarter on the wine business, because you had a pretty big gap in terms of shipments underperforming depletion? And then you also called out the performance payments from the distributors, which I think helped your revenues or margins. So can you just talk about some of the underlying trends, if you strip out, number one, just the gap between shipments and depletions and then the distributor performance payments?
Bob Ryder: Yes. In the fourth quarter is where we make certain adjustments basically in our shipments to distributors to make sure that shipments do in fact equal depletions. So there can't be imbalances in the fourth quarter that are not necessarily reflective of the whole year. So I think you really have to look at the whole year as opposed to quarter-to-quarter because there can't be anomalies in the timing of shipments versus depletions. We also have some interruption in the international businesses as a result of the Russian and this and that, but I think that basically when you look at the whole year this was pretty immaterial. What was your second question, Judy?
Judy Hong: The performance payments, sorry, to quantify the performance as you had called out?
Bob Ryder: Yes. So also in connection with our distributor agreements and specifically in the fourth quarter of every year this is where we sort of look at, where our distributors have come in versus the goals that were agreed upon and set. And then there are payments that are made in the fourth quarter that can actually go either way based on our distributors achievements of KPIs. And key performance indicators in those KPIs are things like sales mix, distribution, for example. So in the fourth quarter they went our way last year and thus, again, that causes some, I will say sort of quarter-to-quarter anomalies. I think fundamentally you have to look at the whole year.
Judy Hong: Okay. And then, Bob, I just wanted to follow-up on the capital allocation question and this is really more 2017 type of questions. But as you think about CapEx, obviously stepping down, your free cash flow stepping up pretty meaningfully and the natural deleveraging effect that it has in your business given the EBITDA growth and your leverage targets. So how do you think about really levering up the balance sheet to either buy back stock at a more aggressive manner versus your free cash flow generation or even paying the dividend?
Bob Ryder: Yes. I mean that’s a good problem to have as you know. And we are looking forward to fiscal '17 and depending on what's going on in the marketplace, my guess is we will probably increase the dividend at least with how comparable net income increases. And as I said earlier, we have the opportunity to go higher in that 25% to 30% payout ratio range. And I would probably anticipate that we reinvigorate our stock buyback program. We still have about $700 million authorized by the board and as you know right before the beer deal, in the previous like 12 to 18 months, we had bought back about 20% of our outstanding shares just under $20 a share. So that’s worked out pretty well for us. But I think it will be a combination of those two. And I would presume that various tuck-in acquisitions in the beverage alcohol category might also come up. But as you said, as you look at the numbers, the free cash flow generation when we get past this real high tranche of capital spending, is really significant for our business. So we have a lot of flexibility on how to reinvest that cash. And I would presume that a reasonable amount of it would go back to shareholders.
Judy Hong: Okay, thanks. And then, if I just can squeeze in one last question. Bob, the glass sourcing in 2016, can you give us a little bit of clarification in terms of what portion of your volume will come from various arrangements? So the JV, the Vitro, the O-I arrangement you have in Waco. So just kind of rough breakdown of those relationships?
Bob Ryder: Yes. I would rather not get real specific on that but what I would reiterate is, our least expensive source of glass is the facility that’s right next to our brewery. Right now it has one furnace that’s operating. We have begun building furnace number two and its planned to go up to four furnaces. And they kind of come in over the next four years. So almost like one a year comes in, right. So that volume will shift from other third party suppliers to that local supplier. And when it gets up to a total of four furnaces, it would be capable of providing roughly half of our needs in glass. So that’s kind of how it's going to play out. The good news is that we are happy that we have landed that joint venture and we are thrilled with our JV partner. Owens-Illinois has already exhibited quite a bit of expertise in operating these glass facilities and then tend to think very much like us, so there is no disagreements unlike some other joint ventures that we might recall. And the other providers are also quite professional and quite good at what they do and the good news is that in the total glass industry glasses is not a growing industry, we are growing our glass business. So we are favored partner. So I think it's a very good partnership between us and all our glass suppliers.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group.
Tim Ramey: Rob, as you think about your outlook on wine, how would that reconcile with your outlook on the overall wine industry and where do you see the best growth, the pockets of growth, within the overall wine segments and price points in 2016?
Rob Sands: Yes. Tim, we think that the wine industry in general in 2016 is going to grow sort of low single-digits in volume, couple of hundred basis points above that in dollars. So volume 1% to 2%, dollars maybe 3% to 4%. Sort of consistently with what happened in 2015 depending on exactly what reports you are looking at. You are sort of looking at 1% volume growth in 2015 and again a couple of hundred basis points above that in dollars growth. In terms of where we are going to see the growth, it's pretty much the same story as historically has been the case which, there is I think pretty strong, continues to be a very strong premiumization trend. All the growth and more in actuality is occurring in the premium plus category. And probably the thing that it's changing is that it continues to move, I would say, upstream. It sort of started with the bottom of the premium segment, $5 and above. It moved up into what we call the super premium segment which is sort of that $8 to $10, meaning the growth. That’s been very strong. And now we are seeing very strong growth in segments above that. So ultra premium and luxury, really, I would say a lot, you are going to see very strong growth in sort of that, almost $13 to $20 range you are probably going to see double digit growth. In terms of varietals, I think that you will see decent lower levels of growth in the most key varietals, i.e. chardonnay, cabernet, sauvignon. I think that Pinot Noir is going to continue to be a very stable and hot category in wine. I think in white wine you are going to continue to see very strong growth in Pinot Grigio and of course New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc I think are going to continue to be a very hot category. And then, I think another phenomena, or I won't quite call it a phenomena but a bit of a change in trend, is sparkling wines. I think that sparkling wines have become very hot once again, or I shouldn't say once again but again. They haven't been that hot over the last, I don't know, five, six, seven, ten years. And you are seeing some of the more affordable categories in the sparkling wine like Prosecco and some of the domestic California sparklers become hot and I will say more every day. I mean people are turning to sparkling wines as an everyday product. What you don't see as particularly hot is champagne. i.e. French champagne. But I think that it's priced itself out of the market largely and the consumer has turned to I'll say more reasonably priced and easier to drink alternatives then champagne. So sweet reds will continue to be, I think a trend in the marketplace. So sort of big, robust, slightly, when we talk about sweet reds, big, robust slightly sweeter, generic red wines. That's been a pretty significant trend and we don't see that diminishing in the near future. At the low end, Moscato has been kind of up and down a little bit. So it's probably going to continue favorably but not as robust as it was a couple of years ago. So those are the trends, Tim.
Tim Ramey: Good stuff. Bob, with regard to the construction costs and timing, I understand a lot of things like steel are dollar based, but are there peso based costs associated with the Nava facility and is that having a benefit to the overall estimate of costs there?
Bob Ryder: Most of it, as you said, Tim, most of the machinery equipment are dollar based. Actually most of the commodities and production are dollar based. But the big local cost of course is Mexican labor. So Mexican labor being used on the construction will end up on the balance sheet, right. And that will come down and price of that will be good but it's not a huge percentage of the cost and same thing on operations. Mexican labor in the plant and in the glass plant, right. Because we employ a lot of people down there and it's growing kind of geometrically. And as long as the dollar stays stronger than the peso, that will be a bit of a benefit as well. But the good news is because our end selling price in beer is based in U.S. dollars, we are not very foreign exchange exposed which is a great place to be, right. Because you remember Australian wine for those years when the Aussie dollar got so strong, it's very hard to maintain a good gross profit margin. So we are balanced in the currency of our input cost and the currency of our selling price which is just a really good long place business model. It's a good place to be.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is actually Stephanie on for Bill. I have two questions. Just the first in terms of what you're seeing in grape cost inflation or deflation this year and then what you expect the overall impact would be on your segments margins? And then my second question, looking at your smaller brands in your beer segment, you mentioned some new initiatives for your Victoria brand, but can you provide a little bit more color on what you're doing for your Pacifico brand? Thanks.
Bob Ryder: Sure. I can take the first one on grape. So we are actually doing very well on our grape cost. We had a very good year in fiscal '15 and I take my hat off to our operations guys in the wine business. The wine makers blending the wine and the guys in charge of sourcing the grapes and farming the grapes. Because we did a very good job buying wine and the landed cost per ton is kind of flat to even down a little bit. And we have done a very good job on refining our wine blends to make the cost to the consumer a little bit less. So we're looking good on the wine side which is why, one of the big reasons why we said we expect to maintain the improved gross profit margins that we experience in the wine segment in 2015. The question around Victoria Pacifico, I will let Rob answer.
Rob Sands: Yes. So Victoria is one of the -- Pacifico, I will start with that, is one of the smaller brands in our portfolio. I actually thing that it's a real sleeper and it's a brand that has a lot of opportunity for the future, much like we saw Modelo Especial explode as a brand. Pacifico, primarily West Coast, primarily Southern California, is it's really big base of business. We are focusing our marketing around things like the World Surfing Championship. We have got advertising campaigns in place around basically discovered by surfers in Mexico, in Baja. And we have got a draft program for Pacifico which has been, I would say very well received. So a smaller brand in the portfolio but something with a lot of potential. Victoria, again a small brand but the interesting thing about Victoria is that they are the largest brand in Mexico with a 15% market share and is very well known by the Hispanic, Mexican Hispanic consumer, which really gives it a huge leg up versus any other new product that could be introduced in Mexico, from Mexico to the U.S. A lot of these products or one or two that have been recently introduced are fundamentally made up products that Hispanic consumers never heard of. I mean that's a tough sell in that demographic. With Victoria we have also introduced cans. We are expanding the distribution nationally and we are seeing some pretty strong growth as I commented on initially, 60% growth on that brand in last year. And we see that momentum remaining strong into this year. I mentioned just in general cans. Cans is a huge opportunity for us across all of our brands. Corona, Modelo Especial as well as the other brands. We are really stepping up can introduction. And an interesting trend in the beer business in general, is that cans have gone from being perceived as so premium to being perceived as very premium form of packaging. And that's probably have been driven by the fact that the craft portion of the business which is the other very first growing portion of the business other than our portfolio, okay, has really adopted at a very high end cans as their primary packaging. And the consumer has really accepted that. So that's really kind of opened the window to make cans a great premium package for our business. And when you look at our business for cans, we have not been in cans at all. Cans represent approximately 3% of our total business but if you look at the industry as a whole, it's like half of the beer business is in cans. So the growth potential for cans is just absolutely phenomenal in our business and in our own particular case, as we have introduced cans we have really seen it expand consumption as opposed to just simply cannibalize other forms of packaging. Because we haven't had packaging that, I will say, is appropriate for the kind of venues where cans are particularly strong in the past. So this has been a big, big advantage for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA.
Caroline Levy: I'd just like to dig into the D&A situation because it's going to be such a big factor as you bring on capacity. It would be incredibly helpful, Bob if you could, number one, tell us what the impact of expensing D&A was in the fourth quarter, for example, and in some way frame whether you can give us the actual number that you're expecting for FY '16? Or maybe say that it's certainly not going to be as big as the benefit from your glass savings? But what I'm worried about is at some point we hear that the D&A alone is offsetting all the benefits of the volume growth and so on. But if you could help us get comfortable with that, that would be really helpful.
Bob Ryder: So, good question Caroline. So, look, our D&A is going up right, because we are spending all this capital, obviously. So in fiscal '16, our D&A is probably going to go up 20% to 25% over fiscal '15 and that’s because we are bringing on these new production lines and actually towards the end of the year we actually bring on some hectoliters of beers. So as that stuff goes into servers, you start appreciating it. So that does create P&L headwinds, right, as you go forward. But even with all that, as we discussed, we are estimating that our operating profit margin of beer segment is up about 100 bps next year and we are still reiterating the fact that we expect to get to the mid 30% range by the time the 20 million hectoliters is built out.
Caroline Levy: Thanks. And just to clarify, you've also very carefully figured out what the inefficiencies of testing the lines and so on does to you because, again, this is very new for you guys but we do sometimes hear our margins are going to be hit by the inefficiencies of opening a new brewery and you obviously wouldn't be at full capacity for a little bit?
Bob Ryder: Yes. I mean the good news, and again we are quite anomalous in this regard, because it's not like we are building the brewery capacity utilization from organic growth. We are moving the production from InBev to us. So although we won't be bringing the line up to the maximum capacity utilization that it is now, it will be still be better than what you might see in other industries as they build, say a Greenfield facility and it takes them, say, ten years to get up to full capacity utilization. We won't be as slow as that. And then as far as when these production lines come up, these are big complicated things and as you know, our brewery is highly automated. So there is a lot of software IT stuff going on. And every line you can't necessarily anticipate the gremlins that will come up. So we are doing everything we can to offset that. But stuff happens but we don’t think that that will in any way material and it would be relatively short lives. And we are not expecting that to happen but it can. But that’s all reflected in the guidance that provided for fiscal '16.
Caroline Levy: That's great. And then if I could just understand in terms of the last two quarters in beer, your margins were actually down a little bit in the last two quarters. What was driving that? Was it the D&A? And then in the first half of the year, do you expect more of that or can we look for margins to be up consistently in fiscal '16?
Bob Ryder: Yes. Again, to Rob's comment earlier, I am not going to go crazy on quarters because it's kind of timing and stuff happens. But Caroline the margins to which you are referring, are they gross profit margins or operating profit margins?
Caroline Levy: I was looking at EBIT margins, looked like they were down a little bit in each of the last two quarters in beer.
Bob Ryder: Yes. So the big reason for that is kind of ramped up marketing spend, will be the big reason for that. You know in our beer business, we have increased our marketing spend in fiscal '14, it was about 8% of sales. And we went up to about 8.5% of sales in fiscal '15, right, as we got into general market advertising for Modelo Especial. Got a little more aggressive against Corona in the face of the glass recall because we wanted to completely negate any potential brand equity loss that we had there and I think we were successful on that. And as Rob said earlier, we are ramping up some marketing around Pacifico. And we think that that’s being a very effective spend and the beer marketing guys actually do a very good job of tracking volume lift and the effectiveness of the various marketing expenditures. So that’s the big reason why the operating profit might have come down a little bit. And then also the question Nik asked earlier, this anomaly in the fourth quarter because of the Corona glass recall and some other re-classes that also hurt the fourth quarter. And as long as we are on marketing spend, as Rob said earlier, we are also increasing our marketing spend in wine, right. Because we are a branded consumer product business and we think that’s important to keep the consumer brand equity going across all our categories.
Caroline Levy: Thank you. I have one last question. Can you quantify the payment on wine in the fourth quarter? The distributor payment?
Bob Ryder: No, we are not going to get into that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial.
Mark Swartzberg: Couple of questions. First, also on the margin trends here in beer, Bob. Oil prices eventually should be a benefit to your shipping costs from Mexico here to the U.S. Can you just give us a flavor for how beneficial that's been and how beneficial that might be?
Rob Sands: Yes. Good question. This is a kind of macro trend that you guys are probably seeing in a lot of companies. So net-net, even at this day, this is net good news for us because obviously we will benefit from the reduced oil prices on our, the unhedged portion of our oil exposure. And most of our oil exposure is around freight and there is more in beer than wine because they just ship more cases. So I would say oil prices is a net positive for us but when you guys get into the numbers you will see that we still had around $30 million loss on I will say, unrealized commodity hedges and most of those were around diesel hedges. Those losses will flow through the P&L over the next two years. A reasonable amount will flow through the P&L in fiscal '16. That would have been included in our guidance. But net net, the reduction to oil prices, I will say from a fiscal '16, is a positive. And of course if they stayed low, it will be even more of a positive as these out of the money get behind us.
Mark Swartzberg: Got it. And is it fair to think at the moment when you're bringing beer into the U.S. you're bringing some, so to speak, of your own beer from Nava and then some being purchased from ABI still. So the actual shipping cost for those two classes of beer, is there any difference? I mean we know that, obviously, as it gets into Nava it cuts closer to the U.S. but the actual kind of per-mile charge of getting it to a given location in the U.S. from a brewery that's owned by ABI versus a brewery that's owned by you, are they one and the same or is there some difference in that regard too?
Bob Ryder: There is actually a reasonable amount of difference. Let's see, quantitative difference. There is a lot more miles that we travel in the U.S. than we do in Mexico, of course. But I will also say that they are very different freight negotiations south of the border and north of the border. So south of the border there is not as much competition around freight. And south of the border it's almost exclusively rail freight that we do and actually even north of the border most of our cost is rail freight as well. But I would say that they are very different competitive environments in Mexico versus the U.S.
Mark Swartzberg: What I'm -- and maybe I'm not -- what I'm trying to get at is, once a product crosses the U.S. border, if it's coming out of Nava versus coming out of a brewery that's owned by ABI from a kind of landed in the U.S. perspective. Is the per-mile charge any different versus in those two classes, those two different barrels, so to speak?
Bob Ryder: Not in the U.S.
Mark Swartzberg: Not in the U.S. got it. Great. And then on the balance sheet, rates being where they are, one could make that argument that you should stay kind of in and around the upper end of that three to four range you have. You're at 4.1 now. Is it fair to think you want to stay close to four or how do you think about that?
Bob Ryder: Yes. I mean our desired range would be in between three and four. We are trying to balance a lot of constituencies. Obviously the rating agencies would like us to be very low in that range and probably shareholders would like us to be high in that range because they presume that what we do is borrow money and give cash back to shareholders. So we are taking both into account. So the ideal is in between three and four.
Mark Swartzberg: Got it. Okay, last one on that. If we just think about M&A, you've commented on this a few times over the last few quarters. And, Rob, you made a comment that you are open to M&A in the beer business and certainly there could be some tuck-ins. But when we think about M&A in terms of sheer scale, whether it's beer or wine and spirits, how are you thinking about this scale of any acquisition you might do in terms of like the upper limit on such a transaction?
Rob Sands: Yes, when we think about scale, we are really talking, I think, primarily about tuck-in brand type acquisitions in the couple of hundred million, probably range, or less. There just isn't, there isn't anything really big in any of the three categories that I will say ostensibly makes a lot of sense to us. So it's really just, I would say, opportunistic tuck-in brand type opportunities across the three categories.
Operator: Your final question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.
Robert Ottenstein: In terms of the draft business, we haven't talked about that too much today. Is the percent of your business in draft is about 2% to 3%, is that right? How much was it up last year and can you talk a little bit about what percentage of the potential accounts you have draft available now for Corona Extra and Corona Light, please?
Bob Ryder: We continue to -- I will start off and then Rob can follow up -- we continue to be very bullish on draft. We feel that we can sell quite well into retailers because our brands can distinguish themselves from amongst the thousands of IPAs out there that are on draft handles that need not turn as fast as us. We think right now Corona Light is our biggest opportunity for draft and Corona pretty much is from a very small base, but doubled its draft volume in fiscal '15. As far as Corona extra draft, that’s still in very small test right now. So the big push in on Corona Light. And I think Pacific is still probably our largest draft brands. But our brands really position themselves very well in draft accounts.
Rob Sands: Yes. I mean I think the only thing that I would add is much like cans it represents it represents a relatively small percentage of our business and a relatively large percentage of the overall beer business. So it remains a big opportunity for us. We are being prudent in how we introduce draft for our biggest brand Corona extra to see how it impacts the brand where it's traditionally been only a glass on premise. So we are interested to see exactly what happens in those accounts where we put draft in. I think the results of our testing thus far has been that way we put draft even in high market share on premise, establishments, that it tends to be a market expanding as opposed to purely cannibalistic. So we think that that’s a very positive trend. Of course everything that we do, we do it keeping in mind that we are not going to cannibalize higher margins with a lower margin business can. Draft is essentially the same kind of margin structure as our other package formats in general. So we are not overly concerned with it but on the other hand we certainly would -- we like the fact that it appears to be significantly market expanding when we put it in. We actually tend to see increased sales of glass in a surrounding area when we put draft, Corona extra draft into an establishment. And that’s sort of been I think the traditional thinking on draft, is that it not only has just benefit from a pure substantive point of view, i.e. another format to consume the product, but it also has a marketing or advertising component that helps to sell your other packages off premise. And we are definitely seeing that.
Robert Ottenstein: That's terrific. And then just on cans, can you give us a sense of where you are in terms of rolling out your can capacity. How much is in-house right now and how much do you -- what percentage do you rely on ABI and at what point will you be 100% in-house on cans?
Rob Sands: Yes. So we are pretty much self sufficient on cans right now having put in our can capacity all ready. And we can produce pretty much as much in cans as we could possibly need. As I said, we are just rolling out a new can for Corona Extra. Corona Extra has been about, I think, 3% cans. So very huge opportunity. Our business overall, meaning everything to buying, is about 20% cans in a market that’s I think closer to about 50% cans. So huge opportunity there and no capacity constraints whatsoever. And we can supply a hundred percent of our cans at this stage. So it's the year of the can.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's conference. I would now like to turn the floor back to Mr. Rob Sands for any closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Well, thanks everybody for joining our call today. I would like to conclude by saying that we are extremely pleased with our performance in fiscal '15. And we are already hard at work to deliver the exciting opportunities we have before us in fiscal '16. I am particularly proud of the fact that we are initiating a dividend for the first time in the 70-year history of our company. This complements our efforts to continue to deliver shareholder value. As we have discussed in detail today, we remain committed to driving the growth of our business while continuing to invest in our brands and operations. Our next quarterly call will be scheduled for the beginning of July. In the meantime, we look forward to a very busy spring selling season. You can look for us as we kick up our Cinco de Mayo celebration by ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange. And as always, we hope you will enjoy our fine products for your own celebrations both big and small in the coming months. So, again, thank you for your participation.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes your conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Constellation Brands’ Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Lorie. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Constellation’s third quarter fiscal 2015 conference call. I’m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company’s estimates, please refer to the news releases and Constellation’s SEC filings. And now I’d like to turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Sands: Thanks, Patty. And good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. Hope everybody got a chance to enjoy some of our great products over the holiday with their family and friends.  Welcome to our discussion of Constellation’s third quarter fiscal 2015 sales and earnings results. Before we get started with the review of the quarter, I believe it's worth noting that we posted another year of exceptional stock price performance with Constellation stock increasing almost 40% for calendar year 2014.  Now this is the third consecutive year that Constellation was one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. Our stock price has been on fire, increasing almost 400% during the three-year time horizon beginning in calendar 2012. This tremendous stock price appreciation is being driven primarily by our beer business which has incredible momentum and we believe strong potential for future growth. And we’re making smart investments now to ensure that we have the quality, capacity, control and flexibility to help us meet demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future.  In addition to our on-going brewery expansion in Nava, Mexico, we recently began implementing our multifaceted glass sourcing strategy which includes the acquisition of ABI’s state-of-the-art glass plant which is located adjacent to our Nava brewery. The formation of a 50:50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world's leading glass container producer to own, operate and expand the Nava glass plant, and the execution of a glass supply agreement with Mexican glass manufacturer Vitro, which will begin to ramp up glass supply in fiscal 2016. Overall we believe this comprehensive sourcing strategy provides an optimal solution for this essential component of our beer production process.  Our third quarter beer results are evidence of the great momentum we are currently experiencing for the business, as we achieved depletion growth of 8% with strong underlying sales growth. These results are some of the best in the industry. In fact, Constellation’s beer business generated the vast majority of total U.S. industry volume growth in IRI channels during the third quarter.  We’re growing both volume and dollar share of the industry at a time when overall beer growth is lackluster for the U.S. beer market. Our entire Mexican portfolio, including Corona Light, Pacifico, Negra Modelo and Victoria are all delivering strong growth, which is leading to record sales results brand by brand across the entire business.  Corona Extra continues to dominate as the number one imported beer in the U.S., selling greater than 50 million more cases than the next closest import competitor and growing at the highest trend rate in years. These results are being driven by distribution growth, velocity gains and incremental marketing support, including the general market and Hispanic Find Your Beach and Epic Moments advertising campaigns as well as the return of the O' Tannenbaum spot on English and Spanish language TV during the holiday season.  Modelo Especial continues to perform beyond expectations and is expected to soon surpass Heineken across all channels as the number two imported beer in the U.S. Continued investment in national Hispanic TV helped propel the continued growth of this brand, which posted consumer retail take away volume trends of more than 20% in IRI channels during the quarter.  Corona Light posted solid growth during the quarter driven by the continued success of Corona Light draft which entered three new markets as well as increased distribution for bottles and cans. Ongoing marketing support featured national football retail promotions which helped merchandise the draft format in the on-premise channel during football season. Overall the strong shipment volumes that the beer business generated in the third quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation’s overall EPS guidance for fiscal 2015.  Keep in mind the distributors also increased their inventory levels during the quarter in order to return them to more historical levels as well as to support the ongoing growth opportunities for our product portfolio going forward. As a result, the second time this year we are increasing our fiscal 2015 forecast for the beer business and now expect beer sales to grow in the low teen range with operating profit growth of mid to high teens.  From a brewery and operational perspective, all areas of brewery expansion are well underway with the project expansion on schedule from both a timing and budget perspective. Our second can line which was installed in late summer has become operational and is expected to significantly supplement our can product availability as we continue to pursue this market opportunity.  Major structural steel erection for the packaging building was completed on schedule in mid-December and the remaining beer tanks were installed in the brewhouse in late November. We initiated investment activity for the recently announced 5 million hectoliter capacity expansion and we have progressed with rail logistics and site infrastructure additions resulting from this incremental capacity expansion.  Finally, the glass joint venture has ordered materials for the construction of the next glass furnace to be built on-site at the newly acquired factory.  Overall I am very pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the beer business. This has been driven by the dedicated efforts of our sales marketing and operations teams as well as our distributors who are collectively working together to deliver winning results.  And now I would like to focus on operational results for our wine and spirits business. During the third quarter, we achieved EBIT growth for the wine and spirits segment that is expected to drive results for the year at the upper end of the low to mid single digit guidance range that we previously provided.  Our spirits business performed exceptionally well, posting sales growth of more than 25%. We began integrating the Casa Noble tequila brand into our portfolio and the brand is quickly gaining traction and beginning to contribute to our spirits business. The super premium tequila is a fantastic fit with our business and helps us to attract new consumers as tequila and Mexican beer share similar drinking occasions both on and off premise.  We experienced excellent sales growth for our existing spirits brands during the third quarter driven by new flavor line extensions across our portfolio, including SVEDKA Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade as well as the recent introduction of Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy Peach flavor.  In addition, we gained IRI volume and dollar share of the three spirits categories that represent our market participation, including imported vodka, Canadian whiskey and brandy. From a wine perspective, outside the U.S., our Canadian business posted solid third-quarter results although our international business was negatively impacted by a decline in bulk wine sales and economic disruption in Eastern Europe.  In the U.S., although the U.S. wine industry remains healthy overall, we have seen a bit of a slowdown in the market growth rates we anticipated when we set our original estimates earlier this year. Thus our third-quarter U.S. wine results did not meet our growth expectations.  In addition, the positive mix trends that we anticipated earlier this year have not reached targeted levels as our premium priced products are growing faster than our super premium and above products. This has resulted in U.S. market share dollar erosion especially in the super premium price segment which remains highly competitive and currently generates much of the U.S. wine category growth.  However we have gained share in the important premium and ultra-premium price segments of the market and we are working diligently to ensure our portfolio remains relevant and top of mind to consumers in all key price segments. For example, the wine consumers’ willingness to experiment with new brands and flavors over the last several years has opened a key opportunity for innovation and new product development.  And although our recent new product development initiatives have seen mixed results, we remain committed to innovation and have launched an enterprise-wide product development process review to improve our results in this area and increase the success rate of our new product pipeline.  In addition, we are currently initiating or expanding product releases in the U.S. for new wine such as PopCrush, Tom Gore Vineyards, Jail Break, Watchdog Rock and early lunch results for these brands are quite positive. We know however that the success of innovation cannot come at the expense of the health of our established brands. As such we have plans in place to concentrate our efforts on an important subset of our focus brands in order to drive key brands that are mix and margin accretive, have scale and growth momentum.  Although our U.S. wine business is not expected to achieve its expected market dollar share goals for the year as we are falling short of our initial expectations for volumes and depletions, we believe the hard work and significant accomplishments we have made throughout the last few years have favorably positioned the business going forward. We have negotiated the majority of our exclusive U.S. distributor arrangements which include improved performance metrics and incremental incentives that are expected to benefit Constellation and enhance wholesaler and retail execution.  We continue to experience solid depletion growth for a number of our fast-growing wine brands, including Kim Crawford, Ruffino, Black Box and The Dreaming Tree. And I would be remiss if I did not highlight recent awards and accolades for some of our key wine brands.  Market Watch magazine recently awarded the Best New Wine Product of 2014 honor to Thorny Rose. Constellation Brands received 24 medals across the portfolio at the 2014 Sommelier Challenge International Wine competition. Inniskillin Vidal 2012 reached the 99 point score, and Wine of The Year while Ruffino received seven medals, including best in class distinction and 96 points for the 2011 Ruffino Modus.  Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi was featured in the Best Buy section of the November issue of Wine Enthusiast Buying Guide, while Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet and Robert Mondavi 2012 Pinot Noir Reserve both received 90 point scores. These awards and accolades are a great reminder of the exceptional quality and strength in our portfolio of lines.  In closing, the strong commercial and operational performance of our beer business is driving significant contributions to our overall sales, profit and cash flow results. We are working diligently on the Nava brewery expansion in Mexico and we’ve begun to execute our new glass sourcing arrangements while maintaining the strong momentum of the beer commercial business.  We have a great premium wine business and plans are in place to work through the current set of challenges we are facing. And I'm especially gratified by the fact that Constellation was one of the best performing S&P 500 Consumer Staples stocks for the third consecutive year.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our third quarter results. 
Bob Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q3 came in at $1.23. That’s a 12% increase versus Q3 last year. We continued to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 8%. This result was in line with our 8% depletion growth performance year-to-date and our high single-digit depletion growth target for full year fiscal ’15.  As expected, we saw a shift of approximately 2 million cases to wholesalers from the second quarter into the third quarter as a result of the previously discussed Corona Extra recall activities. This translated into a benefit of about 37 million of net sales and $0.06 of diluted EPS for the quarter.  Even after excluding this benefit, beer shipment volume growth came in ahead of depletion growth during Q3 as distributors increased their inventory position during the quarter to be more in line with historical levels and to be better positioned to capture growth opportunities going forward. As a result of this activity, for fiscal ‘15 we now expect beer segment net sales growth to be in the low teens range versus our previous estimate of about 10%.  Operating income growth for the beer segment is now expected to approximate 30% for fiscal ’15. When factoring in an estimated full-year of brewery profit for fiscal 2014, underlying operating income growth for the beer segment is expected to be in the mid to high teens range. We still anticipate the full-year operating income margin for beer to approximate 32%.  While net sales performance for wine and spirits was somewhat muted during Q3 for the reasons Rob mentioned earlier, EBIT primarily benefited from lower COGS. For fiscal ‘15 we see net sales for wine and spirits tracking towards the low end of our low to mid single digit range and EBIT at the high end of our low to mid single digit range.  Due to the factors just mentioned, we’re increasing our fiscal ‘15 comparable basis EPS outlook to $4.25 to $4.35 a share versus our previous range of $4.10 to $4.25 a share. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items which are detailed in the release.  Given those highlights, let’s look at Q3 performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results.  As you can see from our earnings release, consolidated net sales for Q3 grew 7%. Beer net sales increased 16% primarily due to volume growth. Excluding the impact of the recall activity that I outlined earlier, net sales increased 11%.  Wine and spirits net sales on a constant currency basis were even with the prior year quarter. This primarily reflected higher spirits volume, offset by lower wine volume, higher promotional spend and lower bulk wine net sales.  For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $59 million, primarily due to the higher volume for the beer business and the favorable cost of goods sold for wine and spirits. Our consolidated gross margin increased just over one percentage point to 43.5% for the quarter, primarily due to the favorable COGS and reduced bulk wine sales for the wine and spirits business.  SG&A for the quarter increased $18 million. The increase was primarily due to higher SG&A for the beer business. Due to factors just mentioned, Q3 consolidated operating income increased $40 million and consolidated operating margin improved 90 basis points.  Equity earnings increased $3 million due to the strong results for our Opus One joint venture. Interest expense for the quarter was $86 million, down 4% versus Q3 last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates.  That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of November, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.25 billion, an increase of $295 million since the end of fiscal ’14.  During Q3, we issued $800 million of senior notes consisting of $400 million of 3.875 notes due 2019 and $400 million of 4.75% notes due 2024. Our strong credit and financial profile combined with the favorable interest rate environment helped us execute this attractive financing activity. Part of the proceeds from the note issuance was used to redeem $500 million of 8.375 notes during the quarter. We still expect interest expense to be in the range of $345 million to $355 million for fiscal ’15.  Our effective tax rate for Q3 came in at 29% and compares to a 28% rate for Q3 last year. We continue to expect that our full-year fiscal ’15 comparable basis tax rate will approximate 30%.  Now let's discuss free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first nine months of fiscal ‘15 we generated $209 million of free cash flow compared to $543 million for the same period last year.  Operating cash flow for the first nine months of the year totaled $750 million versus $629 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the benefits generated by the beer business.  CapEx for the first nine months of fiscal ‘15 totaled $541 million compared to just $86 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled $435 million and is primarily related to the brewery capacity expansion. For fiscal ‘15 we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $275 million to $350 million and CapEx to be in the range of 725 million to 775 million. Our CapEx projection includes $600 million to $650 million of CapEx for the beer segment.  As a reminder, we hedge certain commodities in the energy and agricultural categories. These commodity derivatives generally do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, mark-to-market gains and losses on hedged contracts flow through our GAAP income statement. We exclude these mark-to-market gains and losses from our comparable earnings. At the time that a commodity contract is settled, the gain or loss is allocated to the appropriate business segment for reporting and will be included in our comparable earnings. This approach is in line with others in the consumer space. For Q3 there was a $20 million loss from this activity which was primarily driven by the mark-to-market on diesel fuel contracts.  Before we start taking your questions, I’d like to note we're very pleased with how fiscal ‘15 has progressed so far and we believe we are well-positioned as we head toward the completion of another phenomenal year for Constellation. Our wine and spirits business is on track to generate solid EBIT growth for the year while our beer business has tremendous momentum in the marketplace, growing well ahead of the total U.S. beer category.  We’re also pleased to have begun advancing efforts around our beer glass sourcing strategy with the recent formation of the 50-50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois and the JV’s acquisition of the Nava glass plant. In addition, our beer production capacity expansion efforts continue to progress as planned. The glass sourcing and capacity expansion initiatives will position us to support the momentum and significant growth opportunity we see for our beer segment.  With that, we’re happy to take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.
Nik Modi : So two questions from me. Just on the wine side, you had really good margin expansion. Obviously volumes were a bit light, and I am just curious did you make a concerted decision to really prioritize margin of a volume, is that what we should expect kind of over the next 12 to 24 months? And then the last question is just, if you can give us some updated thoughts on debt to EBITDA continues to migrate towards your target, how we should be thinking about cash flow distribution to shareholders? 
Bob Ryder: Sure. As you saw we did have good beer margin – I am sorry, wine margin performance in the quarter and we expect that to continue for the full year. As you know, we just changed our guidance to be at the low end of sales growth and high end of EBIT growth which means that we will see margin expansion this year. On a long-term basis, we still expect the line segment to maintain margins. I think there were some positive outcomes this year mostly around cost of goods sold which are really helping recover margins from the last few years’ erosion. But I wouldn’t expect big margin expansion in the wine segment going forward. But we do expect to at least maintain margins.  And I think around EBITDA and free cash flow, we continue to -- as you know, we’re spending a ton of money in the beer segment which we're quite happy to do because return on capital in that segment is north of 40%. So it’s a very quick payback and the EBITDA growth of the total company will be growing well in excess of the capital spending growth, even though capital spending is going up so much and again a lot of that's driven by the beer segment the phenomenal EBITDA growth there. So I think in line with what we've been saying over the last two years, as we have pretty good visibility to getting our EBITDA leverage below four times, I would say that the number one agenda item for use of free cash flow is returning it to shareholders and probably at the top of that list would be an initiation of a dividend. We’re one of the few people certainly with our financial profile and in beverage alcohol and consumers in general -- consumer products in general they don't have a dividend and we’re quite confident that this really good free cash flow generation will continue. So wee will probably be looking for dividend in the very near future. 
Nik Modi : And just real quick follow-up on that dividend point. When you think about the initiation, are you thinking about something nominal to begin with or do you think you can go closer to the payout ratio of your peers from the get-go just given the free cash flow generation of the company?
Bob Ryder: Yes, we’re still studying it. We are taking some good outside advice. But I would probably expect us to start on the lower side in order to give us a lot of room for increases. But we will look at the normal things like payout ratios, and because we expect our EBITDA to grow mostly behind beer to grow so robustly over the next few years, right, if you kind of set a payout ratio and your net income keeps going up we should have room to increase it. But we probably start out at the lower end. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane : I’ve got two questions. One, just, I think in your prepared remarks when you walked through the commentary on the mark-to-market activity you referenced there was $20 million loss relative to that activity in the quarter. Was that $20 million included in the results or was it excluded from the result?
Bob Ryder: The $20 million was included in the GAAP results but we excluded from comparable earnings. And the reason we do this, when we – none of our commodity hedges qualify for hedge accounting and we are hedging three years out. So you would see a lot of volatility in a quarter because you’d be marking to market almost 3 years of hedges every quarter, right? So we’re kind of putting that stuff in non-comparable earnings. It’s still in the press release, so you can see it. But we think it would kind of confuse the financial statement reader if we saw that in comparable results every quarter. And this quarter not surprisingly because of the rapid fall in fuel prices when we marked to market our diesel hedges there were losses and was about $20 million for the quarter. 
Bryan Spillane : But by the time those hedges get settled at some point in the future if things don't change that settled hedge, will that somehow – could that potentially drag margins at some point in the future because it’s so far out of the money or – 
Bob Ryder: Yes, absolutely. So sorry, I might have missed out last point. We will bring the gains or losses on these hedge contracts into comparable earnings when the contracts are settled. So to your point if diesel fuel prices don't change, this $20 million loss will come into the comparable results and we will allocate it to the individual segments based on their usage of fuel and because there's a lot more cases the majority of our fuel hedges are for the beer segment, although there are some for the wine segment as well. 
Bryan Spillane : And then just a second question related to foreign exchange. The dollar has strengthened relative to the peso pretty recently, and I guess I am curious to know, you have some peso denominated costs both in your capital spending, I am assuming some of the labor associated with the construction on the Nava brewery and also in your cost of goods sold in the beer business, I'm assuming there’s some peso related costs, or denominated costs in your cost of goods sold. So can you talk about if the dollar would continue to remain strong relative to the peso or continue to strengthen relative to the peso, will it have a positive effect both on what your dollar cash cost outlays are for Nava, and also will it have any impact at all on the gross profits of the beer business? 
Bob Ryder: So good question. So in the beer segment and look, in the grand scheme of things we're very much a North American business and actually very much a US business and in the grand scheme of things we are a net importer. So a strong dollar will help us in the grand scheme of things. Now as you can see this quarter from a translation perspective there's some hurt because the Canadian dollar is devaluing versus the US dollar. So we translate Canadian earnings, that was about a 1% hurt to our sales.  On the peso specifically, our peso exposed costs are as you said Mexican labor, which is an enormous piece of our total cost of goods sold. But it's a relatively large piece and also as we spend capital, those capital costs by and large get capitalized in pesos. So the depreciation on those will also be exposed to foreign exchange, although that’s not necessarily cash because it's depreciation. So net, net the strong dollar will help us versus a Mexican import cost. That also being said we do hedge our transaction currencies. So we aren't 100% exposed to those peso costs because we will have some hedges going out. But net, net a strong dollar versus the peso helps us. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian : So I wanted to get an update on growth for the draft and can portions of your business in the quarter, and also what you think the cannibalization levels are in the remainder of your business from expansion in those two areas, or if draft is even additive to your business? And also, can you give us an update on the future plans in draft and extending additional brands into that segment, whether it's Corona Light or other brands, in terms of moving into more markets with Corona Light? 
Rob Sands: Yes, Dara, number one, we have seen very strong growth in our draft business, about 40% growth and we’ve actually seen very little cannibalization with the draft business. We’ve introduced it with brands like Corona Light and in actuality not only is there not cannibalization but when we put Corona Light draft in a on-premise establishment we tend to see a pickup in the bottle or can product in the area around it, because it's really marketing. So we've expanded our Corona Light draft into, for instance, three new markets and we've also been testing Corona in draft as well and are again having extremely positive results seeing you almost no cannibalization of our glass product when we put draft in, although we’re being very careful about that because we want to fully understand what the impact is.  Cans, same thing, great can growth, great can opportunity, represents obviously a very large portion of the market that we haven't participated in. Cans are purchased for consumption in cases where glass can't necessarily be used, boats, beach, stadiums etc. and so that also represents a purchase opportunity that largely does not result in cannibalization for us. So these package additions are definitely driving growth in the overall beer business. 
Dara Mohsenian : And then also can you discuss distribution expansion potential for the Modelo Especial brand, including where you currently stand from a distribution standpoint, your expectations for calendar 2015 versus the level of expansion you saw in calendar 2014, so is it continuing with the same pace or accelerating, decelerating? And then also just longer-term where you think the brand’s distribution level can get to versus Corona or other brands in the industry?
Rob Sands: So first of all, Modelo Especial has a huge runway for growth. Right now we’re at about – on IRI terms 60% ACV and that certainly does not represent full distribution in any regard. The products still skews from a demographic point of view, extremely heavily Hispanic, even though its penetration in the Hispanic population isn’t even where we would like it to be and where it could potentially be. So there's a huge runway in the Hispanic market and in the general market is very wide open for Modelo Especial and driving distribution and pods are one of our key initiatives on that brand. So and it’s going extremely successfully. We’ve introduced this year -- because the brand is expanding into the general market now so well we’ve introduced general market television advertising which we think is going to even further accelerate the growth of this product. So the growth runway on this brand is tremendous and we don't really see any diminishment in growth rates or increases in penetration -- exactly where it's going to get to, I mean fully distributed product is usually around, I don’t know, 90% ACV. So exactly when we get there, I don't know but we’re going to work to get there and we have everything going in our favor. So the ability to increased distribution and as well as the ability to see velocity per point of distribution increase. So all these things are going to contribute to Modelo Especial, continuing to be really the hottest major beer brand in the market of any significance. There's really nothing of that size that’s growing like Modelo Especial and just even anecdotally as you start, go around see what people are drinking, I mean you're seeing all of a sudden Modelo Especial becoming a popular product in the general market as well as in the Hispanic market. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong : A few questions. First, Bob, on the new sales guidance for beer, I just wanted to clarify that, that change is really all related to the shipment outperforming versus depletion in the third quarter and you're not expecting any sort of acceleration in terms of depletion growth going forward. And on that note, would you expect to see some improvement with gas prices down and you’ve got a lot of growth initiatives behind your broader portfolio on beer?
Bob Ryder: So the increase in beer is –because depletions are pretty much within our guidance, right, of like high single digits and actually depletion growth has been very consistent. The impressive thing is there is sequential improvement because Q3 and Q4 is overlapping higher growth last year. So we’re very happy with the top line. The reason for the increase in guidance is more so around the net sales increase and a lot of that is driven by the distributors bringing inventories back in line with historical levels.  Regarding the economy, hey, look, any time the consumer has more money in their pocket, it's better for consumer product companies. Now whether we benefit more than other companies, I am not sure but it's certainly better to have more money in consumers’ pockets than less. 
Judy Hong : And just on that note, just the divergence in terms of maybe the category performance where wine perhaps was sequentially a little bit weaker from a category level even with the consumer getting better, do you have any sense of what's driving some of the category softness in wine?
Rob Sands: The category is off a little bit. It still remains quite healthy. There could be a number of factors that are contributing to that. Last year Moscato and red blends were growing at extremely rapid rates as consumers experimented, I’ll say, with the new products. This year those products are still growing very well but not at the rate that they were and not that this affects us particularly but there has been a lot of pricing being taken in the below five dollar commodity segment of the wine business, the popular price and that's turned into pretty heavy negative territories. So I think that that's driving the overall market down, maybe 100 basis points or something to that effect. It’s still trending pretty much sort of consistently plus or minus 100 basis points with where it’s trended historically over the long-term. So but it is a little slower than we anticipated. 
Judy Hong : And then my last question, Bob, I have to ask a beer margin question. So 31.5%, very good margin but it was down a little bit versus last year. So was it all just related to the SG&A step-up and was gross margin actually relatively stable? And just the phasing of the new glass contract flowing through your cost, there is a timing of it because you have now the Vitro arrangement that started in October but it sounds like that’s not going to really flow through until fiscal ’16. So any color just in terms of the phasing of how each of those contracts will start to really flow through your P&L would be very helpful?
Bob Ryder: So Judy, we would all be disappointed if you didn't ask a beer margin question. So thank you for restoring our faith. So I would say gross margin for the wine business was pretty consistent year-over-year. So yes, the majority of the reduction in operating margin was due to our SG&A ramp up -- beer was due to our SG&A ramp up. As we get off our transition services agreement we start stepping up in beer segment. We are maintaining the 32% operating profit margin for the beer segment for the year. So this is in line with what we expected.  Regarding the glass contracts, they really won’t start to impact us until next fiscal year and even then the big impact is when we get our own furnaces up and when we get our own production up. So I wouldn't expect glass to have an enormous impact on margins in fiscal ‘16 either. It's more a longer dated than that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group.
Tim Ramey : Did you say how long the diesel hedges were? When should we be thinking about seeing an EBIT positive impact coming through for lower fuel?
Bob Ryder: Well, it’s a combination of things. And we don't hedge a 100%, so and we hedge, I will say, a smaller percent of our exposure in outer years. So we would hedge the most in the next 12 months and then month 12 to 24 will be lower percentage. So we will benefit for the unhedged piece, so we will benefit from that, right, because we’re pretty much paying the spot rate. The negative is the mark to market on the hedges and when those hedges get closed out, we will see that loss in our comparable earnings. 
Tim Ramey : And then on the net debt to EBITDA, the way I do the math it looks like – yes, it might reach 4.0 times in the 4Q. I know your previous guidance has been below that by ‘16 and so maybe we’re splitting hairs here. Are we a little ahead of the curve?
Bob Ryder: I think we’re pretty much where we expected. We’d expect to be right around that 4.0 range at the end of the year. And you’d have to see how our free cash flow comes in which we of course haven’t even finished our plan next year but a lot of that will be dependent upon what quarter we spend a lot of the beer capital. But probably my guess is a lot of our deleveraging will occur in the back half of next year but we would expect to be below four times in fiscal ’16, by the end of fiscal ’16. And as our planning process comes through, we will get better visibility to it by quarter.
Tim Ramey : And is that number kind of magical relative to the dividend discussion, maybe not for a covenant reason but just from management's mindset reason?
Bob Ryder: We’ve kind of made it magic I guess. Look, in all these discussions there's a lot of variables but we have to pick kind of one coefficient in the equation of fixed and what we’ve said is it’s the EBITDA leverage. And we’ve said we will begin reassessing returning cash to shareholders, because as you know we’ve been one of the more aggressive people in our space but we’ve done it exclusively through stock buybacks, when we bought back about 20% of our shares, under 20 bucks a share. We still have 750 million available under our board authorization. But I think what we have said now, since a lot has happened since we stopped our – since we put the stock buyback program on hiatus, that dividend will now trump stock buyback. And what we’ve said is when we have really good visibility to getting below four times and staying there, that's when we start assessing the dividend and as we’ve all said that looks like it will be in fiscal ’16. So we’ll probably be talking about it for our fiscal ‘16 guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial.
Mark Swartzberg : I guess two wine questions. One is the COGS benefit you got in the quarter, do you think that that kind of trend is something we should be looking for going forward? I think in the Q&A here you’ve said that on an operating margin basis, you expect wine margins to remain relatively stable beyond the next few months. And then secondly, as you look at your wine share outlook which is a little below where it had been, how are you thinking about addressing those share trends? Are you okay with underperforming the category? Do you intend to spend more to try to pick up those trends? Just help us with your thinking there.
Bob Ryder: So I will take the first half of that, Mark, and I will let Rob handle the second half. So on COGS I would say that there's probably some anomalous activities in fiscal ’15, I wouldn’t expect that to continue. Now what I would expect -- as I said earlier I would expect margins in wine to be higher at the end of fiscal ‘15 than they were at the end of fiscal ’14. We’re not giving guidance for fiscal ‘16 but I wouldn’t anticipate a lot of margin expansion going forward. The wine market share question?
Rob Sands: Yeah, I think consistent with what Bob just said, no, we don't like losing a small amount -- even a small amount of market share and we have a lot of plans in place around innovation, around NPV, around concentrating our spend against higher growth elements of our portfolio which we think will address that. Largely however without spending a lot more money and I think consistent with what Bob said, also important is that we maintain wine margins, we don’t want to see deterioration in that segment of the business either. So we will implement basically plans and programs that will drive the top line but not necessarily increase spending and therefore hurt margins. So we intend to take a balanced approach in that regard but we definitely don't like and don't want to lose share.  Now if you look at our wine, spirits segment, okay, first of all, spirits is performing extremely well, above our expectations and that's a real positive in the business and we’re looking at that segment of the business for further investment obviously because it’s performing so well for us at the current time. And on the wine side, we had a couple of, I’d say, somewhat anomalous things that had impacted us. For instance, Eastern Europe impacted us to some degree this year. Even though it’s not a very significant piece of our business, it was just soft. That geography was so devastated by everything that happened, we lost some sales in Eastern Europe. We also exited some bulk wine related to the international market which did affect the top line but really didn’t have any effect on the bottom line because it’s just commodity bulk wine business and it was business that frankly just don't even want to continue doing and that affected the top line a bit.  And then in the US, we did take some pricing on some of our low-end products that impacted things on the top line but obviously contributed to our bottom line growth. And then as far as our promotional activity goes, we expect that we will be holding that flat pretty much this year. We didn't expect that to have much of an impact. It probably had a little bit of an impact but again on trying to keep a balanced approach to both the top line and the bottom line, I think that it's worked out pretty well. So all that said, we would like to hold market share, if not grow it but we’re going to keep a balanced approach to growing both the top line and the bottom line. 
Mark Swartzberg : And if I could ask one quick follow-up on the cash return thinking, Bob –
Bob Ryder: And by the way, just on that note, I am reminded that we did have a pretty significant negative translation impact in Canada due to currency but as you are well aware that is largely accounting as a consequence of the strong dollar and the weak Canadian dollar, and that business being a largely domestic business. 
Mark Swartzberg : And maybe this is a follow up for Patty or Bob, and on that, Rob, if we take Canada and we take Eastern Europe, we take the bulk wine, can you put those together and tell us some sort of overall, if you will, temporary revenue adverse impact?
Bob Ryder: You know, forex was worth about a percent, international was worth about a percent. So that would turn wine I guess from a negative 4 to a negative 2. 
Mark Swartzberg : And what about the bulk wine impact?
Bob Ryder: That was probably less than a percent.
Mark Swartzberg : And then on cash return, you’ve said just now to Tim, outlook for – the guide for fiscal ‘16 for clarity on your dividend intentions, could we think about the fiscal ’16 view as a more total view on cash return, including any potential for repo?
Bob Ryder: We’re still assessing that, Mark. So we will talk about -- more about that in April.
Operator: Your next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA.
Caroline Levy : Two questions. One is pricing in beer; were you able to get pricing to cover the increased costs that you get with that inflation pricing from ABI when they sell you product? That’s the first question. How does pricing look right now for you and for the rest of the industry as best you can tell? And secondly, what happened to advertising and marketing spend in the quarter? Was it up or down for both segment if you could just highlight that? I am wondering as you go to fourth quarter for marketing, what activity you’d have around NFL because I guess the big brands do a lot around SuperBowl. So would that affect the trend of this 8% depletions, the fact that you are heading into a time of heavy big brand marketing?
Bob Ryder: So on beer pricing as we talked most of the category pricing happens happens in the fall and I think that, that pretty much progressed on plan. We aren't necessarily correlating pricing to our ABI inflation. We’re at a higher level there. And you can see what's happening in the category in pricing if you look at IRI, if you look at Nielsen, regarding marketing, there’s some timing. So beer marketing is up every quarter, it's up year-over-year. For this quarter, marketing as a percentage of sales in beer probably came down. That being said, to your point, we are – NFL is one of our heaviest properties for advertising. So we would expect that to ramp up in the fourth quarter and we expect marketing as a percentage of sales in beer for the full year to be up but we feel that that more than pays for itself as you can see with the results on the top line.  For wine and spirits, we’re also increasing marketing. In the third quarter we increased it and we expect to increase it again in the fourth quarter, as Rob said mostly around our already successful focus brands, really slimmed-down version of focus brands like Kim Crawford, Mark West, brands like that, that have been very successful and we’ve seen positive response and we feel that there's a pretty good payoff for increasing marketing against those brands. So we are continuing to invest in our brands, we’re just working right. I mean certainly in beer we’re growing well ahead of the category and wine didn’t have the greatest quarter. But we're still investing in the brands and those brands have had very good results and have responded pretty well to the marketing investments. 
Caroline Levy : Do you have a number on the beer side for what base Corona grew, your main brand and what on-premise looked like?
Bob Ryder: So Corona has been pretty consistent. Corona Extra has been growing nicely in the low single digits and I'd say as far as channels, the total on premise for beer has -- is negative, it's been shrinking. But we're gaining share in that channel. I'd say total on-premise we’re growing low single digits as well. All our brands are but a lot of that is Corona.
Caroline Levy : Thank you. My final question is on margins. The decline we saw in Crown in the third quarter was high SG&A. That doesn’t seem like that would get smaller, that’s going to ramp up as you get more independent. And until your glass costs begin to offset that, which is maybe a year out, should we then expect to the flattish margins in beer for a period of time?
Bob Ryder: I mean what we've said, this year we’ve given a 32% operating profit guidance which is up about a 100 basis points off last year's, I’ll call it kind of comparable, right, because we had a lot of activity last year, I would – we’re not -- we haven't finished our own internal fiscal ‘16 look but we’ve given guidance for the total beer segment, that will get up in the mid 30%, I would probably expect that to be more backend loaded as the total brewery and the additional furnaces come online more so like fiscal ’17, fiscal ’18 kind of timeframe. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
Bill Chappell : Just a couple of quick questions. First on the wine side, as you look out to calendar ’15, do you think that you can catch up with the category with kind of the new products, marketing, what have you and do you think the category will rebound? I mean are you seeing other things where we’re kind of maybe at a new normal level for growth?
Rob Sands: The change in growth rate in the category is pretty minor and sort of this is within the range that it can fluctuate up, it could fluctuate down. It’s actually kind of difficult to even know exactly where the category is growing because such a large percentage of it is really not even tracked and is therefore estimated. So when we talk about category growth it's an estimate. And I think that certainly we could see the category rebound to the previous levels of growth because we’re really talking about 100 basis points one way or the other.  And then as it relates to us, yes, I think we can catch up. We’ve got a lot of plans in place and it's really new products and new SKUs, new packaging that's one avenue that I think that will be more successful and as we move into next year because a lot of things that we put in place take some time to work albeit this year they were somewhat below our expectations. I think that nevertheless we've done some very positive things that position ourselves well for next year. And then we’ve got a lot of plans relative to our existing big brands and I think will drive growth as we go into next year as well. So yes, I think we can catch up. 
Bill Chappell : And then to the beer, just back to the currency question, is there a way just to quantify in the most recent quarter what the peso I guess or what kind of impact it had on beer margin profits?
Bob Ryder: Not really. That's getting down in the weeds. 
Bill Chappell : But was it meaningful or just not something we can disclose?
Bob Ryder: Not tremendously because remember we have a lot of this hedge out. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore.
Robert Ottenstein : First question, could you give us a little color on how Pacifico and Victoria are doing, how much were depletions up for those two brands and how the distribution on those look at this point?
Bob Ryder: I mean they are growing, they are gaining share. Specifically Pacifico is our largest draft account and we’re being aggressive on the draft expansion and the marketing and sales guys in beer are very confident around Pacifico, it has enormous distribution opportunity and has a unique brand personality which we’re just beginning to advertise. So both of those brands we’re growing low to mid single digits and we would expect that to continue into the future. 
Robert Ottenstein : And roughly what percentage of -- if Corona is a 100%, what percentage of the accounts at this point have Pacifico and Victoria?
Bob Ryder: Pacifico, maybe if Corona is a 100%, maybe 20%, Victoria half of that.
Robert Ottenstein : Half that?
Bob Ryder: Yes, Victoria, for the full year, Victoria we might sell like 2 million case or something but it’s growing very very fast. But we also think that look, right now consumers are very focused on authenticity and Victoria is probably the most -- it's probably the oldest most authentic Mexican brand out there. So we think that will really resonate with consumers as we really start to grow that brand and focus on it.
Robert Ottenstein : And then second question, you may have referenced in the SG&A line to incremental costs as you have to put them on, as you win yourself away from ABI, can you give us a sense of how much those costs were in the quarter? And is that kind of the right run rate going forward or is that going to continue to step up and any sense about how much upside there may be to those numbers if they do have to go up?
Bob Ryder: I would say that -- I would expect that to continue to ramp up because we have to build our own purchasing department, our own engineering department. Even from a commercial perspective you’re going depletions 8%, right, you’re going to have to invest more in your sales infrastructure, your marketing infrastructure. So I would expect those to continue to increase. Now on top of that we also have inflation which was contractual from InBev around our finished goods supply and our raw material supply. So we can’t really give numbers on that but there is a lot of moving pieces but I’d say if we move up in altitude, we still expect our beer segment to get to industry-leading operating profit margins when a lot of these moving pieces sell down. 
Robert Ottenstein : And then just final question, I think there was some reference to increased investment in spirits. Is that referring to possible additional acquisitions in the spirits area and perhaps could you give us a sense of what kind of areas that if that's the case would make sense?
Rob Sands: No, we don't have any acquisition plans in the spirits category at the moment. And when I talked about more investments, it was really against our brands that we already have. We do have plans for new line extensions, new flavors etc. and because the spirits business is growing so well that gives us the opportunity to invest more behind the growth in the existing brands. So that's basically what I was referring to, Robert.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.
Vivien Azer : My first question has to do with the Modelo brand. You mentioned that it currently has about a 60% ACV in IRI channels. Can you offer a point of comparison and where that was a year ago, or two years ago?
Bob Ryder: Probably it’s been growing mid single digits. So now what I will say on Modelo Especial, it’s expanding distribution, yes but it's also growing what I’ll call per capita consumption. So in cities, take Los Angeles where it’s very well established with the Hispanic consumer, it continues to grow even where it is. So it's got both, I’ll say per cap consumption opportunity and expansion opportunity. 
Vivien Azer : Understood. On the wine side of the business, are there any other opportunities to exit lower margin businesses like you did with the bulk wine? 
Rob Sands: There is always opportunities to exit lower profit businesses but I would say that other than our normal SKU rationalization process, we don’t have any big plans for that. 
Bob Ryder: We don't have an enormous exposure to the, I’ll say, under $5 at retail, we have maybe two or three significant brands down there and I will say they are a strong part of the portfolio and by and large they have pretty good margin profiles. But if opportunities cropped up, or if we feel that’s the right thing to do we pursue it. But I wouldn’t say we have any huge plans right now to do that.
Rob Sands: And also interestingly enough a lot of our sort of what constitutes that low end portfolio is a lot of our legacy stuff and actually as a consequence has pretty high ROIC as we look at the portfolio. So we factor all that into our decision-making as to whether we’re going to keep going with various things or not even though they may be not a 100% on strategy because there's a premium. So we’ve got some dessert wines, we’ve got some products that toss your wines that aren’t 100% within our portfolio strategy today but actually represent or generate very high ROIC because of the legacy nature of the products. 
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson of Citi Research. 
Wendy Nicholson : Hi, thanks for taking the questions, and two really quick ones. The first is, with the integration of the tequila business now behind you, can you remind us what the growth and EBIT margin gap is between spirits versus wine? I'm just wondering if the outsized growth in the spirits business impacts your ability to reinvest in the wine business or works against you? So that's question number one. And then question number two. You've only got, I guess, six weeks, seven weeks left in the quarter. And so as you go into 2016, I'm wondering -- I know you haven't given us any guidance on the beer business but do you think inventory levels will kind of have trued up and be where they ought to be as you go into 2016 so we ought to have a closer match for depletions versus shipments? That would be helpful. Thanks so much. 
Bob Ryder: Sure. So I will handle those, they’re kind of financial – so spirits in total has very similar economics to wine as far as margins. Tequila specifically for us, now it's very small number of cases, we expect it to grow but it's very small. But it is at the higher price points – it will be by far the highest price point within our spirits portfolio. So it will have a better margin profile but I wouldn’t expect it to move the needle because it is so small in the near-term. And we don't -- we will look at wine and spirits similarly and they both have very healthy margins that can afford reasonable amount of marketing and sales investments against them.  If I turn to beer inventories, I’d say we saw a pretty big increase in our distributors’ inventories in the third quarter as they get closer to replenish to historic levels. We will most likely see that continue into the fourth quarter but we expect them to be at a pretty good back to normal trends by the end of the fourth quarter. So then we would expect as we go forward for more like shipments and depletions to be more in line with each other as we enter fiscal ‘16 and beyond.  End of Q&A
Operator: Thank you. I’ll now turn the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Okay. Well, thanks everybody for joining our call today. Needless to say we are very pleased with our fiscal 2015 year-to-date results. Our beer business has tremendous momentum in the marketplace and continues to gain market share. Our high return investments in beer production capacity position us to support the significant growth of this business. We’re growing EBIT in our wine business and our spirits business gained share across the product portfolio. And during our next quarterly call which is scheduled in early April, we will provide guidance for our upcoming fiscal year. 
Operator: Thank you for participating the Constellation Brands conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Constellation Brands’ Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. I would now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation’s conference call. In addition to our second quarter fiscal 2015 results and outlook, we will also discuss our glass sourcing strategy and incremental brewery expansion. I’m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our two news releases, which have also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company’s estimates, please refer to the news releases and Constellation’s SEC filings. Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert Sands: Thanks, Patty and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our discussion of our second quarter financial results, as well as other important events that will shape the strategic direction of our company going forward. It has certainly been an exciting few months at Constellation. Since last quarter, we announced the acquisition of the Casa Noble tequila brand, an award-winning handcrafted super premium tequila which will be a great addition to our portfolio. Adding Casa Noble to our portfolio is important because tequila and Mexican beer share similar target consumers and drinking occasions both on and off premise. This fast growing tequila brand naturally complements our Mexican beer brands and fits well into our existing wine and spirits distribution infrastructure. Now during the quarter, we were challenged by a Corona Extra product recall, which was caused by defects in glass models caused by a production error at a glass plant run by one of our glass suppliers. I’m very proud of the dedication and hard work of our employees, distributors and retailers who have worked tirelessly and diligently to remove potentially affected product from our retail and distribution system. While the recall impacted our financial results slightly for the quarter, we expect to replenish second quarter loss sales in the third quarter and we are currently working with our glass supplier to recover the costs of the recall. We announced this morning that we have begun a new 5 million hectoliter expansion at our Nava brewery in Mexico that will expand production capacity of that facility to 25 million hectoliters by the end of calendar year 2017. This project is being driven by the exceptional portfolio momentum of our beer business, which has significantly outperformed the U.S. beer market and our own expectations. Lastly, we are pleased to announce that we are in the process of finalizing the long-term glass strategy for our beer business under favorable terms with key industry players. The multi-faceted approach of this strategy includes the following components. We have agreed to purchase from ABI their state-of-the-art glass plant in Nava, Mexico, which is located adjacent to our brewery in that location. While this facility currently has one operational furnace, we plan to initially scale it to four furnaces, which will ultimately be able to supply us with more than 50% of our glass requirements. This transaction also includes the purchase of a high-density warehouse, land and well infrastructure and is subject to U.S. Department of Justice and Mexican regulatory approvals both of which we expect to receive by the end of this calendar year. We have also agreed to enter into a 50/50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois to own and operate the glass plant that we are purchasing from ABI. As the world’s leading glass producer, O-I has more than a 100 years of experience in producing glass containers. They have built and expanded dozens of plants and participate in joint ventures in several different countries throughout the world. We also currently use O-I as a glass supplier for our wine business. O-I will primarily have responsibilities for plant operations including purchasing, technical services and the plant expansion. O-I is also expected to become a secondary glass supplier outside of the joint venture arrangement. The final piece of the strategy, we have entered into a long-term seven-year supply agreement with Vitro who is a (inaudible) leader in glass manufacturing in Mexico and we will expect – we’ll ultimately supply 25% to 30% of the glass needs for our beer business. Overall, this sourcing strategy provides the best outcome in terms of quality, flexibility, cost effectiveness and control for this critical area of our beer production. Now because it will take some time for the glass plant to become fully operational at optimal capacity, we will continue to work with ABI to purchase glass supply needed for production at the Nava brewery under our existing Transition Services Agreement through mid calendar year 2015. In addition, we plan to continue to procure finished product from ABI under our Interim Supply Agreement until the initial Nava expansion to 20 million hectoliters is complete in calendar 2016. Overall, our additional investments in production capacity and glass sourcing are designed to ensure that we are well positioned to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the marketplace for our beer portfolio well into the future. Our second quarter beer results are a testament to this portfolio momentum, as we achieved depletion growth of 8% and posted the 18th consecutive quarter of market share gains for our U.S. beer business. This level of growth for Constellation’s beer business represents the most significant contribution to total U.S. beer dollar growth in IRI channels across all suppliers during our second quarter. These results were driven by Corona Extra’s momentum of increased media support during the summer as well as the success of our Fill your Summer advertising campaign that was our first-ever multicultural, bilingual summer program. In IRI metric channels, Corona Extra continues to gain share and is currently the number five beer brand in the U.S. market. In addition, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial teamed up this year a broadcast sponsorship of World Cup games on Spanish language TV. Modelo Especial Hispanic Real World campaign helped to propel the continued growth of this brand, which posted consumer retail dollar takeaway trends in IRI channels of more than 30% during the quarter. In addition, Modelo Especial’s summer soccer sweepstakes promotion surpassed all sales and consumer engagement targets set for this initiative. Modelo Especial Chelada has already become the number seven Mexican import brand in less than a year since launch. The growth of this product is being driven by Spanish language TV ads on national Spanish networks, consumer sampling at retail, PR events in key markets, social media engagements and C-store print trade ads. Lastly, the draft beer format continues to have significant momentum achieving sales growth of more than 40% during the quarter driven by the continued market expansion of Corona Light. The five core brands within the Constellation beer portfolio all experienced growth in the quarter and are ranked in the top 15 U.S. imported beer brands. From a brewery and operational perspective, all areas of brewery expansion are well underway and preceding on schedule from both a timing and budget perspective. Key performance metrics are being achieved with no disruption to existing brewery operations. In many areas, crews are working around the clock. In fact, the brewery recently achieved record capacity utilization with a record number of cases produced and shift in August. Brewery tank fabrication and installation are being completed on schedule and the packaging building is tracking the plan with steel erection in process. A new line was recently installed which is one of the largest in the world and the first beer run from this line is expected to come in coming weeks. From a wine and spirits perspective, the business performed well during the second quarter with depletions improving sequentially as expected. The depletion growth in the quarter was driven by excellent performance by a number of our fast-growing brands including Mark West, Kim Crawford, SVEDKA Vodka, Ruffino, Black Box and The Dreaming Tree. Our expectation is that you should continue to see improving depletion trends as we progress throughout the year similar to last year. As we head into our key holiday selling season in the second half of the year, we will be executing programming to ensure that we drive growth for our key brands that are mix and margin accretive, have scale and the greatest growth potential. We are well positioned to achieve this goal with initiatives that include the launch of our first-ever holiday TV advertising for Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. After the success of last year’s combined Corona, Woodbridge, Butterball turkey promotion, we will once again repeat this program in advance of the Thanksgiving holiday. We have committed to incremental feature and display activity on several margin accretive brands including Clos du Bois, Robert Mondavi Private Selection and Rosatello and we have dedicated more sales focus on the roots to market for our spirits business now that we have Casa Noble tequila as part of the portfolio. During the second quarter, we received several awards for some of our key brands. Some of the most noteworthy accolades include the Leaders’ Choice Award which recently saluted the industry’s hottest new product in wine and spirits by awarding the best new wine product to honor our Thorny Rose brand. Wines across the Constellation portfolio earned a total of 47 medals at the 2014 San Francisco International Wine Competition including double gold and 98 point score for the 2011 Clos du Bois milestone. In addition, gold medals were awarded for the 2013 Woodbridge Chardonnay, 2012 Ruffino Chianti, 2012 Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Cabernet Sauvignon and the 2012 Robert Mondavi Coastal Crush. We are also proud to receive a 90 point score from both the Wine Spectator and wine and spirits for some of our well known wines including Robert Mondavi 2012 Oakville Fume Blanc and the 2010 Mount Veeder Reserve and the Franciscan Estate Magnificat. Now from a spirits perspective, we experienced strong sales growth in our spirits business during the second quarter driven by the recent launch of new flavor line extensions across our portfolio including SVEDKA Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade as well as the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy peach flavor. As is typical at this point in the year, I would like to provide an update relating to the California grape harvest, which is currently underway running nearly a month ahead of last year with more than 70% complete at this time. The current California industry estimate is for a total harvest yield of 3.8 million to 4 million tons versus approximately 4.4 million tons last year. The quality of this year’s harvest looks to be very good if not excellent. From a pricing perspective, we continue to expect great pricing to be flat to down slightly compared to last year depending on the variety, location and demand. Before I close, I would like to take a minute to discuss our assessment of the impact of the recent California earthquake that occurred near Napa. We have assessed the extent of the earthquake’s impact on our operations and we are very fortunate that the impact is minor. Most importantly, we are relieved that our employees and their families are safe as the earthquake occurred overnight when our facilities were closed. While there was minor damage inside some of our northern California wineries, none of them have sustained structural damage and our vineyards have not been impacted. In closing, we are excited about the favorable outcome of our glass sourcing strategy as we look forward to working with our excellent supply partners as they support our efforts to build upon our leading, important beer position in the U.S. We are working diligently on the Nava brewery expansion in Mexico while maintaining the strong momentum of the beer commercial business. And within our wine and spirits business, we are well positioned to drive our grape portfolio brands during the upcoming holiday season. I now would like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our second quarter business results.
Robert Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. We have a lot of significant good news to talk about today both for the quarter and the longer term. First off, we continue to deliver beer sales that greatly outpace the industry. And despite the glass recall, we are affirming full year beer guidance. In addition, we are providing medium-term volume guidance that also outpaces our estimate of the total beer industry growth. We believe we have good portfolio and demographic evidence to support our projections. We’ve also completed a comprehensive year long glass sourcing strategy project. The outcome of these efforts are expected to provide Constellation a continual and diversified source of beer, glass supply from leading industry providers at a cost lower than that we currently pay today. We’re also increasing our medium-term operating target for beer which indicates considerable margin upside from our fiscal '15 year-to-date run rate of 32%. As a result of these factors, we foresee a continuation of a fast-growing top line and an increase to our already healthy beer profit margin. Finally, we will discuss increased capital spending in brewery and glass capacity to support the robust growth we are targeting. This represents investments with very high returns as the beer segment enjoys strong and growing margins and quite a high operating ROIC. I’ll provide more details on the longer term items just highlighted, but now let’s start looking at our second quarter results where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q2 came in at $1.11, a 16% increase versus Q2 last year. We continued to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 8%. Depletions were essentially not impacted by the recall, as wholesalers worked to replenish supply at retailers before the end of Q2 from their existing inventory levels. However, the recall impacted our sales as we reversed shipments to wholesalers for approximately 2 million cases of Corona Extra. This translated into a reduction of approximately 37 million of net sales and $0.06 of diluted EPS for the quarter. This reduction is reflected in the $1.11 Q2 EPS. We expect to replenish this volume with shipments to wholesalers primarily during the third quarter, as we work to bring wholesaler inventories back to more normal levels. Wine and spirits results for Q2 benefitted from higher volume and lower promotional expense during the quarter. Both businesses remain on track to reach their full year profit goals and we are affirming our fiscal '15 comparable basis EPS outlook of $4.10 to $4.25 a share. Given those brief highlights, let’s look at Q2 performance in more detail. As you can see from our earnings news release, consolidated net sales grew 10%. This result included 73 million of incremental beer net sales as we consolidated an additional week of sales in Q2 fiscal '15 versus Q2 fiscal '14 as a result of the timing of the beer business acquisition. Excluding the benefit of these acquired sales, consolidated organic net sales growth for the quarter was 5%. For the full quarter of Q2 fiscal '15 versus the full quarter of Q2 fiscal '14, beer segment organic net sales increased 9%. This was primarily from volume growth driven by strong consumer demand. This result includes the impact of the recall that I just outlined. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant-currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflected volume growth of 1% and lower promotional expense. For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $109 million and our consolidated gross margin was 43% versus 40% from the prior year second quarter. The increase in gross profit primarily reflects 33 million of incremental benefit from consolidating the beer business for one additional week in Q2 of fiscal '15 as well as growth of the base beer business and lower promotional expense and favorable mix for wine and spirits. The increase in consolidated gross margin primarily reflects higher brewery profits, beer volume and pricing benefits in the wine and spirits gross profit factors that I just mentioned. SG&A for the quarter increased $48 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was 12 million. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher marketing and SG&A for the beer business. Due to the factors just mentioned, Q2 consolidated operating income increased 62 million and consolidated operating margin improved 160 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter was 85 million, down 6% versus Q2 last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. That provides a good spot to discuss our deposition. At the end of August, our total debt was 7.2 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled 7.1 billion, an increase of 131 million since the end of fiscal 2014. The increase primarily reflects the funding of the 558 million post-closing purchase price adjustment payment made during the quarter for the beer transaction offset by our free cash flow generation. We have 500 million of 8 3/8 senior notes coming due in December. We’re evaluating funding alternatives for the repayment of this debt including utilizing existing credit facilities and tapping into the senior note market. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 32% and compares to a 29% rate for Q2 fiscal '14. The Q2 fiscal '14 rate included the favorable outcome of various tax items. We continue to expect our full year fiscal '15 comparable basis tax rate to approximate 30%. Now let’s discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx spend. For the first half of fiscal '15, we generated 360 million of free cash flow compared to 440 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow for the first half of the year totaled 668 million versus 489 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the incremental cash generated by the consolidated beer business. CapEx for the first half of fiscal '15 totaled 308 million compared to 49 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled 229 million as activities for the initial 10 million hectoliter brewery expansion continue to progress. For fiscal 2015, we are updating our free cash flow projection and now expect free cash flow to be in the range of 275 million to 350 million versus the previous range of 425 million to 500 million. The change was primarily driven by additional CapEx requirements for the incremental 5 million hectoliter brewery expansion and glass sourcing initiatives that Rob mentioned earlier. Total CapEx is now projected to be in the range of 725 million to 775 million versus a previous 575 million to 625 million. Our new CapEx projection includes 600 million to 650 million for the beer segment. We view this as very positive news as we have the opportunity to invest in a growing, high margin, high ROIC business. We are still targeting operating cash flow to reach at least $1 billion for fiscal '15 and we expect to continue deleveraging. Now let’s move to our full year fiscal 2015 P&L outlook. We continue to forecast comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.25 a share. For fiscal '15 we continue to target net sales growth for the beer segment to approximate 10% with high single digit shipment and depletion volume growth and operating income growth in the range of 25% to 30%. When factoring an estimated full year of brewery for fiscal 2014, underline operating income growth for the beer segment is still expected to be in the mid teens. For wine and spirits, we continue to target net sales and EBIT growth for fiscal '15 to be in the low to mid single-digit range. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the press release. Now I’d like to provide some financial highlights related to our strategies around glass sourcing and beer production capacity that Rob outlined. Our beer business has great momentum in the marketplace growing ahead of our expectations since the acquisition and well ahead of the total beer category. We believe we are positioned to continue outpacing the beer category behind positive demographic and portfolio factors, some of which include consumers trading up to high-end beer, growth and increasing influence of the Hispanic consumer who have a high propensity for our brands, great alignment with our goal to distributor network, distribution gains for all brands, draft and can format expansion and packaging and product innovation. As a result of these factors, we are targeting annual volume growth to be in the mid-single-digit range over fiscal '16 to fiscal '18 timeframe, a sales trend that we believe would outpace growth projections of the total U.S. beer industry. To ensure we are best positioned to capture this growth opportunity, we have begun a new 5 million hectoliter expansion at our Nava brewery, which will take it to 25 million hectoliters of production capacity. The estimated cost for this investment is 450 million to 550 million and is expected to be completed by the end of calendar 2017. When you combine this with our initial 10 million hectoliter expansion, our total brewery capacity investment is estimated to be $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion. As part of our beer, glass sourcing strategy, we have reached an agreement with ABI to acquire their glass plant, warehouse and rail infrastructure and land that is adjacent to our Nava brewery for an acquisition purchase price of about $300 million. We’ve also agreed to form a 50/50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois to own and operate this glass plant. O-I will contribute approximately 100 million for its 50% share of the joint venture. The joint venture will not include the acquired warehouse, rail infrastructure or land. The JV will provide bottles exclusively for the Nava brewery. The glass JV partners plan to expand the capacity of the plant from one furnace to four furnaces over the next four years at a cost of approximately $300 million to $400 million. The expansion costs will be shared equally between Constellation and Owens-Illinois. Since we expect to consolidate the JV results, the full expansion costs would be included in our CapEx line in our statement of cash flows with O-I’s contribution being displayed as a separate benefit in the financing section of our cash flow statement. Constellation also expects to spend approximately 175 million to 225 million outside of the JV to enhance the site infrastructure for the rail and warehouse at the newly acquired site. For the beer business projects just highlighted, we have summarized the associated tax assessments and timeframes in a table that was included in our glass sourcing and capacity expansion press release issued earlier today. Given the collective activities just outlined, we are targeting our beer segment operating margin to be in the mid 30% range in fiscal '18, which we believe is best-in-class among the North American competitors. With the incremental CapEx investment, our goal of exceeding free cash flow generation of $1 billion is now targeted to move out in fiscal '18. Even with the higher CapEx requirements, we still expect to delever at a good pace and reach our goal of debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio below four times in fiscal '16, as operating cash flow and EBITDA growth of the business allows to delever despite the increased capital spend. Operating within our three to four times target leverage range provides us the financial flexibility to access the initiation of a dividend and/or additional stock buybacks. Once we move past the heavy fiscal '16 and '17 peak CapEx spend years, free cash flow should growth dramatically, which will provide us even more financial flexibility while we stay within our targeted leverage ratio range. In summary, we’re very pleased with how fiscal '15 is progressing. The wine segment is expected to grow EBIT in line with sales and see strong execution in the marketplace during the key holiday season. Our beer business has tremendous momentum in the marketplace and continues to gain market share. It has a very strong financial profile and is among the industry leaders from a sales growth and profit margin perspective. Our high return investments in beer production capacity position us to support the momentum and significant growth opportunity we see for the beer business. With that, we’ll open up the line for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning.
Robert Ryder: Hi, Bryan.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: I guess we fielded a few questions this morning just trying to reconcile the margin expectations in beer relative to some of the new news we had today, and I guess maybe if you can just walkthrough some of the puts and takes because right now it looks like if you look back at the last four quarters or so, the operating profit margin in beer are in the low 30s. And I guess what we’re expecting to see over the next three years is more capacity, more production in in-house which should be accretive to margins. It sounds like glass cost would be lower which should be accretive to margins. There’s been some pricing in this model over the last year or so and I would assume that there should be some pricing as we look forward. So I’m just trying to understand why it wouldn’t be better if there is some other cost that you’re expecting to incur whether it’s increased marketing or something else that might sort of dampen the margin expectations?
Robert Ryder: Yes. So year-to-date we’re at a 32% operating profit margin which has increased from last year. And what we’re seeing is we’re going to go to the mid-single digits as we build out the brewery and glass plant, right. So depending where you pick in the mid-single digits, that’s pretty good margin expansion. The other thing to factor in is we think mid-single digits is pretty much the highest operating profit margin of beer companies in North America, right, the mid-30%. So in our models, we have factored in all that’s going on with glass, we put assumption there what we think is going to go on with pricing based on history and we have in there what we think is going to go on with commodity inflation in the beer segment. So for me personally, right, I’m thrilled with the mid-30% profit margin. I’m not sure why people are disappointed. There is nobody with a higher margin than that in North America.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: I guess and I hear you, I think it’s just kind of knowing what we know now and there seemingly to be more of a list of tailwinds versus headwinds, I think that’s the component that people are kind of stuck on today. There’s two things you can clarify. When we’re talking about mid-30s, is that 34 to 36? And then I guess the second piece, I guess if there is going to be some JV income associated with glass, should that be – is that incorporated in that mid-30 margin target or would that be on top of?
Robert Ryder: Yes. So mid-30%, yes, I guess most math people would say that’s 34, 36. I think that’s a reasonable comment. The other thing just to factor this in, Bryan, and you guys would have done that, right, this increased capital spend does increase depreciation expense, right. Now, our brewery assets are long-lived assets, right, the majority is probably 15 to 20 years, but there’s a lot of capital going in which is going to start depreciating which does cause some reported headwinds on margins. And what was the last piece of…?
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: The JV income?
Robert Ryder: Yes, good question. And again, you guys understand this, so we will be consolidating the JV because under GAAP based on the contract with us and Owens-Illinois, we are considered to control the JV, right. So what will happen there is as consolidation, we will just – our cost of goods sold will be lower. We’ll essentially be recording the cost of the bottles, right, which helps margins, okay. We will also consolidate the balance sheet, right, so you’ll see all that capital spending coming on our balance sheet and the Owens-Illinois contribution will come in down – I think it’s going to be a separate line of net income, okay, and the cash contribution will be begin the financing section of the cash flow statement.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: So that makes it outside of the operating profit and the margins?
Robert Ryder: That’s correct. Well, JV, yes, because we’ll be consolidating. So the JV will not exist in our financial statements, right. The JV is going to be a private company is how that will work.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good morning.
Robert Ryder: Hi, Judy.
Robert Sands: Good morning.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: I guess I wanted to just follow up on the EBIT margin on beer and I agree that the mid-30% is obviously a very good margin for this business. I guess I would just challenge you though in just terms of thinking about compared to the other beer companies, you do have higher price points which obviously raises your gross margin versus some of the peers. So I’m just trying to really understand kind of how this margin outlook is being impacted by the cost savings that you’re generating really on the packaging costs, in particular as you think about what you’re paying for glass today and then with all these different relationships that you’re building. And then the JV that you’re owning in-house, it seems like your packaging cost could be a lot higher, so maybe just starting off just a little bit more color on that particular topic?
Robert Ryder: Yes, and it’s a little bit difficult, right, because a lot of data is not out there but we have a very different business model from the North American – most of the North American competitors, right. We’re making all our products in one site which is quite a distance from a lot of our consumers, right, take the New York city consumers. So we have a reasonable amount more freight, okay, versus – and freight is – as you know, Judy, freight is a very big component of cost in beer. So we have a lot more freight costs. We probably also have higher cost of goods sold, right; thicker bottles, higher quality ingredients, all that kind of stuff. So it’s difficult to compare them apples-to-apples. But as I look at our beer model, we’ve kind of got the growth that the craft brewers have coupled with the margins that the large domestic guys have. So we’re almost the best of both worlds from a beer perspective. And if you look at some of the data that’s out there, right, generally speaking you could say we’re probably paying around, I don’t know, $0.16 a bottle right now. That data is out there from InBev. We’ve said that that will come down. We’re not really saying how much that will come down because we think that’s competitive data, but we went through a full year of negotiations with all the big glass players in the world and we’re pretty happy where we end up there both from a cost and a quality perspective.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And just to clarify, the $0.16 includes the freight cost that you’re paying to get the bottle delivered to your production facility?
Robert Ryder: That’s correct, but the glass we’ll be getting going forward is going to be coming from a number of different sources which will all have different, I’ll say, manufacturing costs and different freight costs depending where it’s coming from.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Right, okay. And then maybe just in terms of the Corona Extra trend and I think that accretion certainly in the quarter doesn’t appear to have been impacted by the recall. The more recent Nielsen or IRI data has shown a bit of softer trend for Corona Extra and some of this may just be a comparison issue, but just really wanted to kind of understand from your perspective how do you access the recall impact, if any, is having on sort of the underlying trend of Corona Extra as you see it today?
Robert Ryder: Yes. Judy, so right now as you said we look at IRI, it’s still pretty early in the game to say what’s happened to Corona Extra and I don’t get overly alarmed over weekly IRI data because there’s a lot of anomalies in just a week. You can see that Corona Extra has slowed down a little bit, but remember there were actually some retailers – not a ton but we were physically out of stock during the recall process, we were off the shelf for a period of time. So we would expect that to kind of come across in IRI. Luckily, we’re very happy with our overall depletion trends, right, and hopefully if Corona – the consumer wasn’t grabbing the Corona, he would grab a Modelo Especial or Pacifico and I guess in future months, we’ll see how the Corona Extra brand bounces back after this recall. But we couldn’t ask for better cooperation from both our internal employees and from the distributors and from retailers. It was just a really well done and an unfortunate circumstance, but we think we minimized the damage.
Robert Sands: Judy, I might add that we’ve been tracking the weekly IRIs pretty carefully. We saw a little blip two weeks ago but we also noticed a number of other products that were affected, so it looks like it might have been a peculiarity with the week and then the latest data was very robust and appears that the brand was completely unaffected. So as Bob said, we’re pretty hopeful that in general the recall is not going to have any impact on the momentum on the brand. And clearly the momentum on our other brands has been totally unaffected by the Corona recall. So the business in general remains very strong from a consumer takeaway point of view.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Robert Ryder: Thanks, Judy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks. A couple of questions. Just getting back to the beer margin because I know obviously that’s the most frequently asked question coming in from investors. So is it fair to assume that the target you have laid out, the kind of mid-30s; 34 to 36, is pegged to your mid-single-digit volume assumption? I guess the reason why I’m asking the question is let’s just say that things are even better than you thought which clearly has been the case the last couple of years, things have been coming in better than you expected and volumes are actually higher. I’m just wondering how you think that will impact the margin given now you are manufacturing, you should get some operating leverage, so if you can address that question would be really helpful. And the second question just kind of more of a tactical thing, just curious how the repositioning of Victoria is doing? If you can give us any more clarity around Modelo Chelada, it looks like the SKU and the brand is really starting to gain some momentum, so just trying to get an understanding of how big of a contributor that can be going forward?
Robert Ryder: Okay, Nik, so I’ll take the first one and Rob will take the commercial question. So, yes, I mean when we give these guidance out, we try to tie-in the whole P&L. So in your case if we exceed the volumes that we put out there, obviously we would get good fixed cost leverage, okay, especially on that big depreciation number. So, yes, that would certainly help margins. I’ll let Rob answer the Victoria…?
Robert Sands: Yes, so Victoria; we did reposition Victoria originally when we introduced it – we introduced it above Corona Extra in pricing and we brought the pricing on that down to the Corona level and we expanded distribution nationally and I would say that there’s a lot of momentum behind the brand right now. Actually I’d say that we’re pretty excited about the prospects for Victoria for the feature and with the repositioning we’re seeing a lot of very, very positive momentum in that. Chelada; great product, taste great. We really think that from a competitive point of view it’s the best product out there. Again, a lot of momentum. We’re a bit constrained on the package at the moment until we get our can line up and running shortly and that’s really been the only limiting factor on the brand. Otherwise, we could actually sell a lot more of it than in fact we have been selling and we will as soon as that can line is up and running which is it’s actually up and running right this second, but in terms of being fully operational it’s a few weeks away. So we’re extremely optimistic on Chelada and think that that’s going to be a very successful new product introduction for us.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets: Great. And just one last question, thanks for that Rob. So Bob, on the Nava brewery, if we look at it year-over-year, is the brewery running more efficiently, same as last year, less efficient – I mean can you just give us some perspective on how things have progressed over the last year within the brewery?
Robert Ryder: Yes, it’s operating more efficiently, right. So we’re getting – and we’re defining that. We’re actually getting more hectoliters of beer out of it at a lower cost per hectoliter and actually it’s almost like every quarter it gets a little bit better.
Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets: Great, that’s it from me. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much. Just a question on your assumptions on price and mix. You gave us a good idea on volumes for beer going forward. Just how you’re thinking about the mix component and also whether you think there is room to get some pricing?
Robert Sands: You’re talking beer I take it.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: In this case, yes.
Robert Ryder: Yes, I don’t think we assumed any dramatic increase in mix but as you said, the thing supporting the volume growth calls for a lot of growth in cans and kegs. So they would have a mix impact. On pricing, we would have assumed probably historical pricing going forward, but as you know pricing gets determined based on the local geographies and all the competitive dynamics, but for an Excel model you have to assume something. So we would have just assumed probably close to continuation of historical trends.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Right. So you’re saying mix will go slightly negative as you rollout cans and kegs?
Robert Sands: No. Cans would be a positive mix; kegs kind of neutral that’s because aluminum is cheaper than glass and cans cube out better with freight. You can fit more on a freight car than bottles because you don’t have to insulate them and they’re just better…
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Right. So a bit of margin mix but on revenue, on price mix…?
Robert Sands: Cans, we are line priced on cans except for Modelo Especial cans which are at a slightly lower price. For Modelo Especial specifically right now bottles are growing faster than cans. Probably the big can upside is on Corona Extra where we expect to have the same price as bottles.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Got it. And how is your can capacity doing for the Corona Extra product?
Robert Sands: It will be doing well very shortly as soon as that new can line is fully operational which as I said is shortly. It’s actually up and running right now but in test mode.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: But you’ll run all cans on that line then and you’ll be able to therefore drive this much faster on Corona Extra as well as on Chelada.
Robert Ryder: Yes, so what you’ll be seeing and we’re actually coming out with a really gorgeous Victoria can as well, but our can capacity will be going up and will be able to support all this can growth. And also on Corona Extra specifically we’ve actually already have a media campaign specifically I’ll say describing the activities you would do with a can that you wouldn’t do with the bottle. Same great Corona liquid, right, but you can do certain things with cans that you can’t with bottles and shots of the beach, the boats, sporting events, things like that just to get peoples’ heads around, hey, Corona is great. Let me try a can. Right now, Corona Extra probably less than 2% of the mix is cans. So we think that’s a pretty big opportunity to drive growth.
Robert Sands: If you look at the industry in general, what you’ll see is cans is really where the vast majority of the growth is in the industry. You may be looked at the domestics which as you know are biometrically in general down but cans are actually growing and are being more than offset by glass and craft, cans are the latest craze. And as Bob said in our case, we see huge opportunity in cans because it’s such a low percentage of our business and there is so much momentum from an industry perspective against cans period. So we’re pretty excited about the can potential of our business.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: That’s great. And then if I might ask, it’s back to margins, the components of what you think will drive the margins to the mid-30s and how much of that is the glass transaction?
Robert Ryder: Yes, glass is certainly factored in there and essentially what will happen as the additional glass JV furnaces come up, right, we will be able to reduce the glass that we’re buying from other furnaces. The guaranteed upside will be there is freight, right, because the glass JV is attached to the brewery. So there is no freight cost. So as those furnaces come up, our landed glass cost comes down. And so glass is a pretty good component of our margin expansion from the 32% that we have year-to-date to the mid-30% we said we’ll have in the very near future.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Hi. Good morning. I have a couple of questions; one is a follow up to that. I think that you gave us originally a target of getting to the mid-30% margin without glass. So I’d like to – what other things are going right between now and then besides glass to get the margin number?
Robert Ryder: Yes, the guidance we gave without glass was low to mid 30%.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Okay.
Robert Ryder: So you can go back to the investor meeting, so that was the guidance that we provided. Now with glass and with new news, right, whatever positives and negatives, we’re increasing that to mid-30%. What you get is depending where you pick in the 34% to 36% is a pretty big increase in margins and the highest anybody has in North America.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Maybe I shouldn’t be belaboring this, but you had said low to mid 30s without glass, so there was something that made you think you could get to the mid-30s without glass and it looks like maybe that contribution has gone away, and could you comment on that?
Robert Ryder: Yes, I could but I do think we’re past the belabored part here with this question, right. We give ranges because this is a business with many moving parts, okay, and especially this business as you know, Alice, has many moving parts because we’re growing so fast. Most of the moving parts are really good as are our margin assumptions I think to have the volume growth amongst the top of the industry and to be saying we’re getting to the margins in the top of the industry I think is – I’m looking at this as very good news. And then the ability, right, to reinvest the enormous free cash flow that this business spins off into a very high return on invested capital business, right, it really helps the shareholder value creation that I think Constellation is driving out of this beer segment.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Okay. My question is on your cash flow for next year, for fiscal '16. You’ve said that with all the incremental CapEx and your acquisition costs, you still think you’ll be generating cash to reduce debt. You must have a pretty good sense of what CapEx will be in fiscal '16 in order to say that. I mean with all the bits and pieces you’ve given us, it looks like CapEx might be around $1 billion in fiscal '16 and then you got 300 million for the acquisition and I’m having trouble getting cash leftover after that. Are those assumptions for CapEx too high?
Robert Ryder: So I think what I would do is we’ve given you the bigger pieces of capital spending albeit we haven’t said what specifically in fiscal '16 because that will be part of the guidance we provide in April. But we have said it’s kind of frontend loaded right. What we provided in that table in the glass press release is not holistically comprehensive. It excludes wine, it excludes maintenance CapEx, it excludes buying kegs. It’s specifically for these projects. Now my comment on deleveraging, right, because of all the capital spend, free cash flow probably won’t be an enormous number next year. Now operating cash flow could be a very good number. But the leverage rate of course is happening is the EBITDA portion, the numerator of that calculation, right, based on the volume growth in the margin expansion is probably going up quite a bit which helps the EBITDA leverage ratio come down. So it’s not necessarily free cash flow, right, it’s more the EBITDA generation.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Well, that’s helpful. Will there be cash leftover after the acquisition cost to reduce debt?
Robert Ryder: We’re not providing that kind of specific guidance yet for next year because we haven’t finished this year yet. So that would be like an April discussion most likely.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Okay. But a lot of the improvement in the ratio is the EBITDA going up, I hear that. And I have one final question. If I adjust your margins in the quarter you just reported for the recall, it looks like they were 31%. They were a lot higher in the first quarter. Could you comment on why they came down and should we be using the 31% for the second half? Is there some reason to expect an improvement in the second half versus that 31%?
Robert Ryder: I think we’ve given our guidance for the full year that expect beer operating profit margins to be around 32%. This quarter there was a pretty big increase in marketing spend in beer specifically as we really tried to hit home in the peak summer season with a lot of media flights. So that would have been a timing component. But I think year-to-date we’re at about 32% and we said full year we’ll be at about 32%.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Thank you very much. It’s marketing. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Also on this topic of margin, Bob, a question about the glass component of it. Is it reasonable to think that the fact that this O-I arrangement is with a facility that’s state-of-the-art and right next door to where you’re brewing is better economically than the Vitro arrangement?
Robert Ryder: I think that probably would make sense given the fact as you said it’s a brand new facility, right, and of course freight will be less.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Right, okay. And then on the Vitro component because there wasn’t quite the level of detail back in August that we get into today, did that – the new Vitro agreement you have, is that going to – the cost that you’re paying there for those bottles, does that include transportation costs?
Robert Ryder: We haven’t commented on that. That’s kind of competitive information.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, all right.
Robert Ryder: That was Vitro’s release, that wasn’t our release.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Right, okay, fair enough. And then just more on the accounting for this JV. Clear that it’s going to be consolidated. Can you just help us? It sounds like it affects only your COGS line. Does it have any effect on other consolidated lines and then there’s just a minority interest coming out below the EBIT line, is that how the economy will be?
Robert Ryder: I think that’s right. It’s just the COGS line.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Got it.
Robert Ryder: And then the minority interest, that’s correct, it will come out as a component of net income and other cash. And then of course the balance sheet is consolidated, right, so all the capital spending will end up there and the cash coming in from Owens-Illinois and they will be funding 50% of all capital investments at the glass JV but that’s going to come through the financing line.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Got it. Okay, great. Thanks, Bob.
Robert Ryder: Thanks, Mark.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Good morning. Thanks. A few quick ones. On the new expansion at Nava, does that I guess come in place of a potential West Coast facility down the road? You went through the math and it made more sense from a freight efficiency standpoint to do it all at Nava?
Robert Ryder: Yes, I think a couple of things. I think it was probably the fastest thing to do, right, because the facility is up and growing and we want to make sure that we can support a high growing, high margin beer business. So I think as we weigh the alternatives, we felt that both cost and speed, right, and confidence around execution was highest for Nava to bring that up to 25 million hectoliters.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: And believe it or not, I have a wine question. In terms of the lower promotions this quarter, is that just more timing? You’re kind of waiting it more, is that kind of what you had planned all along, maybe some color there?
Robert Sands: Yes, the timing of our promotional activities is more geared towards the second half of the year obviously to coincide with the OND period, the holiday period.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Okay, so it’s just on a year-over-year basis it’s been shifted a little bit?
Robert Sands: Yes.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Okay. And then last one on taxes just to get to your full year rate of 30% kind of – it equates to 28% for the back half. Is that equal in both quarters or would there be one kind of catch-up one quarter?
Robert Ryder: Yes, the timing of taxes is hard to predict. So we’re just saying for the full year, it will be 30%. So we’re not saying which quarter it will hit, what quarter will be what. But the balance of the year will have to be a lower rate than the year-to-date.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with ISI Group.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group: Thank you very much for taking the call. Guys, given the increased amount of CapEx and in a sense business outside of the U.S., how should we think about any impact on the cash tax rate going forward, the long-term numbers and the effect of tax rate, maybe you can give us an update in terms of the long-term guidance on those two items?
Robert Ryder: Yes, as we generate a lot of income from this as you said outside the U.S., that will carry a lower cash tax rate. As far as effective tax rate, it should also have a lower effective tax rate when everybody gets aligned that we stop accruing U.S. taxes on foreign earnings. We are still accruing U.S. taxes on the foreign earnings and there’s just a lot of discussions going on as to when or if we will stop accruing those taxes. That’s from an ETR not a cash tax rate.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group: Right. So just in terms of your guidance that you gave us for cash for fiscal '18, what cash tax rate would you be using for that?
Robert Ryder: I think we’re assuming like mid-20s.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group: Mid-20s. And there will be potential for that to go down in the following years?
Robert Ryder: No, cash is cash, right. The thing that could go down if we stop accruing the APB 23 U.S. accruals, the ETR could go down. Of course, if we grow the beer business faster than we say, right, that will have a lower cash tax rate. It’s kind of a mix of tax rates depending where your EBIT growth is coming from.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group: Great. And I know you’ve got a significant initiative on the can side. Can you give us just any kind of rough idea as you think about it between the relative margins for glass and cans for your business?
Robert Ryder: Yes, I mean cans are higher margin than bottles. It’s not tremendously material nor is it immaterial. So it’s the difference that we like if you align price with bottles.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group: So like 100 basis points on the margin type difference?
Robert Sands: Yes, we’re not going to give you that kind of specifics.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group: Understood. Congratulations on all the glass contracts. I’m sure that was a tremendous amount of work and it sounds like you’ve come to a great solution.
Robert Sands: Excellent. Thanks, Robert.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan.
Unidentified Analyst: Hello. This is Paul (indiscernible). Can you hear me?
Robert Ryder: Sure.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. I just have a couple of questions. First, what’s your view of tapping the bank loan respond market for your 2014 debt maturity and do you guys have limitations on how much bank debt you can add?
Robert Sands: Yes, we don’t feel there is any limitations that would hold us back. I mean we’re looking at the markets as we speak and I think we’re in a great position. We can utilize our revolver which is at a very good rate or we can go to the senior market if we want to kind of increase the duration of our debt. And it’s going to be based on what we think the market’s rates are. So it will be a decision that we can make without any pressure from the outside world or covenants or anything like that. There is a lot of flexibility that we have.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And have you guys spoken with the rating agencies at all regarding your expectation that leverage will remain over four times through 2016?
Robert Sands: We have, yes. So the rating agencies are insiders, so they have a look at how we think the financials will pan out and I think they’d be pretty happy with how quickly we are delevering and again mostly it’s because we’re growing EBITDA so quickly which just shows the fundamental positive economics of the business.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research.
Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research: Good morning. Thanks. Just one final point on the overly [belabored] beer margin question. You don’t give EBITDA margin targets on that, but it sounds to me like it would be fair to say, well, while margins are going up modestly, EBITDA margins are going to go up more meaningfully. Is that a fair statement?
Robert Ryder: I’m not sure if I understand the question. We’re not commenting all around O-I margins but EBITDA is certainly growing which is helping bring down the EBITDA leverage…
Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research: But what people seem to be missing is that the depreciation is impacting the O-I margin and so the EBITDA will be a better number based on the cash…?
Robert Ryder: Sure. As we said earlier, right, there is a lot of [DA] (ph) coming into the P&L as spend all this capital. I don’t know why you keep saying O-I. This has nothing to do with O-I. They’re not on our books. But yes, the EBITDA to your point will be much higher than the EBIT because DA is going up so much, right, is your point which is a good point. Thank you.
Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research: Okay. And then just finally on wine, it is a beautiful crop out there and I’m almost done harvest. It looks to me like margins have the ability to expand a bit going into fiscal '16. Would you agree with that statement just directionally?
Robert Sands: Yes. We think that margins can expand a little bit going into fiscal '16.
Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research: Okay.
Robert Sands: We’re seeing growth, we’re seeing positive mix and we’re seeing a little pricing. That’s a good combination.
Robert Ryder: As you said, Tim, the crop is coming in very high quality and we think overall the cost per ton will be similar to last year, so not a lot of grape cost inflation which is good news for margins.
Robert Sands: I think generally a balanced supply and demand situation.
Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research: Because we’re a month ahead if there are any meaningful impact on cash flow this year from just the timing of harvest or is that not material?
Robert Ryder: No, there won’t be anything meaningful.
Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research: Okay. Thanks so much, guys.
Robert Sands: Thanks a lot, Tim.
Operator: That was our final question. I would like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional remarks.
Robert Sands: Thanks everyone for joining our call today. Needless to say, it’s an exciting time to be in Constellation. We believe we have very significant growth opportunity within our beer business and glass of course is a critical component of our beer production. As such, I’m very pleased with the final outcome of our long-term glass strategy with key industry players in order to ensure that we have the quality, capability and flexibility to meet the growing demand for our iconic beer portfolio. We also have solid momentum for our wine and spirits business as we head into the second half of the year, and we are well positioned for a great holiday selling season. Our next quarterly call is scheduled after the New Year, so please be sure to enjoy some of our excellent products during the holidays. So thanks again everybody for your participation.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Constellation Brands’ First Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thanks, Jackie. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Constellation’s first quarter fiscal 2015 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com under the Investors section in Financial History. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company’s estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Sands: Thanks, Patty and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation’s first quarter fiscal 2015 sales and earnings results, which reflect a great start to our new fiscal year. Our beer business is on fire. Our wine and spirits business is on track to meet its goals for the year. And we continued to progress as planned with our Mexican brewery expansion. We have recently celebrated the one year anniversary of our game changing beer acquisition and I believe that our strong financial and operational performance during this time is a living testament to the significant contributions that our beer business is making to our overall sales profit and cash flow results. In the first quarter, the beer segment generated results that were better than our expectations for both the commercial business and our brewery in Mexico. Beer net sales increased double-digits to 14%, which represents a significant outperformance of the import category and the overall U.S. beer market. We continue to experience robust consumer demand for our iconic portfolio of Mexican beers, which is being driven by a combination of strong sales execution and excellent support from our wholesalers. The introduction of creative new marketing and advertising programs, which are resonating with consumers, continued distribution gains across the portfolio and the further expansion of new product offerings like Modelo Especial Chelada and Corona Light draft, which continued to exceed our initial growth forecast. Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in the first quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation’s overall EPS guidance for fiscal 2015. As such, we now expect beer depletions in fiscal 2015 to increase high single-digits, which should drive sales growth in the 10% range with underlying operating profits for the beer segment expected to increase in the mid-teen range. At this time, we believe we will have adequate supply to meet these sales goals for the year. I would like to remind everyone that the five core brands within the Constellation beer portfolio are ranked in the top 15 U.S. imported beer brands. Now, Corona Extra is the only top five U.S. beer brands in IRI channels that posted dollar share growth during the first quarter. In addition, the brand grew depletions of more than 3% and accounted for 10% of U.S. beer category dollar growth. As you know, Corona Light is the number one imported light brand in the U.S. with a 55% IRI dollar share of the import light category and increased dollar share by almost 2 share points during the quarter. Modelo Especial recently achieved yet another milestone as it moved up into the number two slot as the second largest imported U.S. beer brand on a volume basis in IRI channels, while also gaining distribution and 40 basis points of dollar share during the first quarter. And Pacifico and Negra Modelo each grew IRI dollar sales in the high single-digit range during the first quarter. While draft currently represents a small part of our overall volume, depletions grew more than 35% for this format driven by the market expansion of Corona Light in the first quarter. As we approach the Cinco de Mayo holiday, we continued to build our Corona de Mayo equity to assert Corona’s ownership over summer’s first fiesta in an effort to maintain momentum and keep Corona top of mind with consumers and our wholesalers as we kicked off a 120 Days of Summer. During the first quarter, initiatives included the national TV debut of the new Corona Extra 2014 television spots for general market and Hispanic consumers, the introduction of the Fill your Summer program, which is our first ever multicultural, bilingual summer program consisting of 18 weekly themes with activities, new contents and prize drawings. Promotional, digital and radio advertising and digital video sponsorships launched leading into key occasions, including the World Cup and ESPN coverage of the NFL draft. The national TV advertising for Corona Light designed for sports and cable entertainment TV debuted in the first quarter for the key summer selling season. New ads for Modelo Especial’s Hispanic Real World campaign were introduced using general market media and strong support in targeted Spanish language TV and digital video programming. The Modelo Especial summer soccer promotion kicked off in May featuring a summer promotion that includes a sweepstakes and a campaign designed to engage consumers at all touch points. A national launch of Modelo Especial Chelada began in April, expanding outside of initial introductory states. This initiative is supported by Spanish language TV ads on national Spanish networks, consumer sampling at retail, PR in key markets, social media engagements and C-store print trade ads. Now, from a brewery and operational perspective, all areas of brewery expansion including a new brewhouse, packaging area and warehouse are well underway. In many areas, crews are working around the clock. And as of last week over 1,200 craftsmen and construction workers were onsite. The first six fermentation tanks were recently hoisted into place and the massive concrete pour for the high density warehouse is progressing quickly. Great care is being taken so that construction work does not disrupt existing brewery operations. In fact their brewery produced a record number of cases in May. We continue to work diligently to finalize our future plans for commodity sourcing on items such as glass as well as assessing options for longer term capacity expansion beyond the 20 million hectoliter expansion that is already underway at the Nava brewery. We will certainly inform you as soon as these plans have been finalized. From a wine and spirits perspective during the first quarter the business performed generally as expected with sales results impacted by the planned distributor inventory destocking. The agreed upon make whole payment associated with this activity benefited gross profit margins for the quarter. First quarter wine and spirits depletions were a bit muted following a strong finish to our fiscal year in February when we posted depletion trends of more than 5%. In addition, quarterly depletions were impacted by some retail inventory destocking. Our expectation is that you should see improving depletion trends as we progress through the year similar to last year. Overall, we remained committed to growing in line with the U.S. wine and spirits industry growth for fiscal 2015 and beyond. As such during the first quarter we gained market share in IRI channels and experienced excellent performance for a number of our Focus Brands including Mark West, Kim Crawford, Ruffino, Black Box, Rex Goliath and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. As outlined earlier this year one of key strategic objectives for the year is to focus our marketing efforts on a subset of our Focus Brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest growth potential. Some of the initiatives recently executed that support this goal include the following. Increased TV advertising for specific Focus Brands including Woodbridge, Black Box and Robert Mondavi private selection, enhanced digital and print advertising as well as in-store programming for key brands like Clos du Bois Rouge and Estancia. And finally Dreaming Tree 360 degree activation programs that have begun in conjunction with Dave Matthews’ summer concert tour. We are reaping the benefits of some of these key marketing and promotional initiatives as we continued to be recognized by industry leading publications for our new products and our Focus Brands. The most recent noteworthy accolades include the following. Earlier this week the drinks business and intangible business published their 2014 power brands lists Robert Mondavi was named the number three most powerful brand in the world, moving up from the number four spot last year. The Beverage Information Group recently announced their 2014 growth brand award winners with 13 Constellation brands receiving awards, including Kim Crawford, The Dreaming Tree, Mark West, Black Box, Estancia, Ruffino, Woodbridge, SVEDKA and Rex Goliath. In the April issue of Wines and Spirits magazine the 2011 Robert Mondavi, Napa Valley, Pinot Noir received 92 point score and the Best Buy designation, it was also included in the year’s best Pinot Noir feature. Constellation Wines claimed four spots in this year’s wine and spirits restaurant top 50 list, which is the survey of top-selling wines at America’s favorite restaurants and included Franciscan, Simi, Robert Mondavi and Ruffino. And one of our other key strategic initiatives for the year relates to our drive to deliver margin accretive innovation and new products. Some of the recent activities that we have underway include the national expansion of wine on tap which includes varietals from brands like Simi, Franciscan, Mark West and Clos du Bois. The line extension introductions of the (indiscernible) Red Blend, Rex Goliath Sangria and Black Box Pinot Noir, the launch of Arbor Mist Sangria Rita, which capitalizes on the growing popularity of spirit style sangria and margarita cocktails and after a successful trial period at a major retail chain, PopCrush is expanding into national distribution. As we have previously discussed, we also continue to look for opportunities to leverage our sales and marketing efforts across our beer and wine and spirits businesses. One of our new initiatives includes the Corona and Rosatello brands, which have teamed up to develop a joint bilingual point-of-sale creative platform and consumer offer to drive display during the key summer selling season targeting California general market and Hispanic chains and independent retailers. Now, from a spirits perspective, while spirits net sales declined in the first quarter due to the timing of shipments, depletions grew in the low single-digit range. During the quarter, we launched SVEDKA Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade as additions to SVEDKA’s flavor lineup as we continued to capitalize on the growth of flavored vodka. This activity is being supported by digital and billboard advertising and is being well received in the marketplace. We also reintroduced the new SVEDKA Stars & Stripes in advance of the Memorial Day holiday, which has become a very popular consumer item. In closing, solid execution of first quarter results demonstrates that we continue to deliver on our key strategic imperatives across our beer and wine and spirits businesses. And I am excited about our prospects for the business for the remainder of the year. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our first quarter business results.
Bob Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS in Q1 came in at $1.07, which represents a sizable increase versus last year. Q1 included some expected material activities in both of our businesses. In beer, we continue to realize the tremendous accretion attributable to the Q2 fiscal ‘14 beer business acquisition, which has significantly enhanced our financial and strategic profile. Sticking to beer, our Q1 financial performance and continued robust marketplace momentum drove the upward revision to our fiscal 2015 EPS guidance. Turning to wine and spirits, sales were impacted by our previously announced distributor inventory reduction. Also as announced, this reduction did not impact EBIT as demonstrated by the strong Q1 segment EBIT growth. Some of this growth is timing related and we expect a good portion of this favorability to reverse in Q2. Our full year financial sales and EBIT goals for wine and spirits remain on track. Given those brief highlights, let’s look at Q1 performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated net sales for Q1 included $868 million of incremental net sales related to the beer business acquisition as we consolidated 100% of beer sales as of the June 7, 2013 acquisition date. For Q1, beer segment net sales increased 14% on volume growth of 11%. Depletions were also very strong growing 8%. It’s typical to see distributor inventory build during our first quarter as we head into our strongest selling period for the year in beer. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant currency basis decreased 1%. This reflected a shipment volume decrease of 4% primarily resulting from a planned distributor inventory destocking partially offset by a make whole payment from the distributor associated with the destocking as well as favorable product mix. For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $420 million and our consolidated gross margin was 44% versus 38% for the prior year first quarter. Incremental gross profit from the consolidation of beer was $410 million. This produced a beer segment gross margin of 47%. The increase in our consolidated gross margin primarily reflects the benefit from the consolidation of the higher margin beer business, the distributor payment associated with the inventory reduction and favorable wine and spirit product mix. SG&A for the quarter increased $119 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $123 million, the majority of which is marketing. This was offset by lower wine and spirits SG&A which was primarily driven by timing of compensation related expense. Q1 consolidated operating income increased $301 million. $288 million of the increase was related to the consolidation of the beer results with the beer segment generating an operating margin of 33% for the quarter. The inclusion of the beer business results was the primary driver behind the 11 percentage point improvement in our consolidated operating margin for the quarter. Wine and spirits also contributed to the margin favorability as this segment reported a three percentage point improvement in operating margin due to the factors mentioned earlier. Roughly speaking the distributor make whole payment, positive operating – positive product mix and the timing of SG&A contributed equal thirds to the operating margin upside. Due to the timing of the beer business acquisition we did not record – recognize any equity earnings from Crown during the first quarter. For the prior year first quarter equity earnings for Crown totaled $66 million. Interest expense for the quarter was $86 million, up 58% versus Q1 last year. The increase represents an increase in average borrowings as a result of the acquisition funding partially offset by lower average interest rates. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of May, our total debt was $7.2 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $6.8 billion, a decrease of $140 million since the end of fiscal 2014. The decrease primarily reflects our free cash flow generation. In early June we made $558 million post closing purchase price adjustment payment for the beer transaction. This was funded through a combination of cash on hand and revolving credit facilities. I would also like to remind you that we have $500 million 8.38 senior note coming due in December. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 32.5%, which reflects the benefits from integrating the beer business and compares to a 36.2% rate for Q1 last year. We still anticipate our full year tax rate to approximate 30%. Now, let’s discuss free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending. For the first quarter we generated $101 million of free cash flow compared to a use of cash of $19 million for Q1 last year. Operating cash flow for the quarter totaled $232 million versus $3 million last year. The increase was primarily due to the incremental benefits from the beer business acquisition. CapEx for the quarter totaled $131 million compared to $22 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled $85 million as brewery expansion activities continued to progress. For fiscal ‘15, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $425 million to $500 million. This reflects operating cash flow that is targeted to reach at least $1 billion as we continue to realize earnings benefits from the beer business transaction. And CapEx, that’s projected in the range of $575 million to $625 million. As a reminder, our CapEx projection includes $450 million to $500 million for the beer business primarily related to expanding the brewery to 20 million hectoliters of capacity. Now, let’s move to our full year fiscal 2015 outlook. As a result of the strong beer business performance, we are now forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.25 per share versus our previous guidance of $3.95 to $4.15. For fiscal 2015, we are now targeting net sales growth for the beer segment to approximate 10%. Shipment and depletion volumes are now targeted to grow high single-digits and significantly outpaced the import category and the total beer industry. For fiscal 2015, we expect beer segment operating income to grow in the range of 25% to 30%. As a reminder, our fiscal 2014 beer segment operating income totaled $773 million and included 100% of the U.S. beer commercial business operating income for the entire year and brewery profits from the date of the beer business acquisition. When factoring an estimated full year of brewery profit for fiscal 2014, underlying operating income growth for the beer segment is expected to be in the mid-teens range. From a beer gating perspective, I would like to note that in Q2, we faced an easier comparison as shipment volume growth in Q2 last year was only 1%. Beer will be facing some more difficult comparisons in the second half of this year as shipment volume growth in the second half of last year was over 13%. For wine and spirits, we continue to target net sales and EBIT growth for fiscal ‘15 to be in the low to mid single-digit range. As mentioned earlier, we expect some of the EBIT favorability in Q1 for wine to reverse in Q2 due to the timing of shipment activity. Our comparable basis guidance, excludes unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the release. Before we take your questions, I would like to note that we are off to a great start in fiscal 2015 as the beer business continues to generate strong marketplace and financial performance, the brewery expansion continues to progress and the wine and spirit business is on track to meet its goals for the year. With that, we are happy to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC.
Nik Modi - RBC: Yes, good morning everyone.
Bob Ryder: Hey, Nik.
Rob Sands: Hi, Nik.
Nik Modi - RBC: Hey, so just two quick questions. On the wine price mix, can you just kind of explain was that all mix or is there any bit of pricing in there? And then just generally what’s going on within the pricing environment within wine? And then the last question I guess this one is for you, Rob, given beer margins have been kind of in the 33% range the last couple of quarters, this is a seasonally high quarter in terms of expenses, just curious on kind of state of the union on the 30% to 35% target and kind of what you think about perhaps being at the upper end of that or even above that range over the next couple of years? Thanks.
Bob Ryder: Sure. Let me just comment on price mix smaller and then I will let Rob do the industry, what’s going on in the industry. So, for us for the quarter, I’d say that the upside to margin was primarily mix. Pricing didn’t have a big impact. I will let Rob talk about what’s going on in pricing in general in the wine and spirits category.
Rob Sands: Yes, I think we see – Nik, we see some pricing now occurring in wine and spirits. Still I would say in line primarily we see pricing in the lower end of the wine business and we see some pricing in the higher end. The middle remains I would say pretty competitive, so sort of that $8 to $15 range is where we still don’t see a lot of pricing. But I would say as a general proposition the pricing environment in wine and spirits is a bit more favorable than it has been in the past. We have taken some pricing on select brands as Bob said the margin accretion in the first quarter is probably more due to mix than it is to pricing, but we do have some pricing on some of our larger brands especially in the premium category and in sub-premium and sparkling. So as I said generally a more favorable environment.
Bob Ryder: Sure. Nik on the second, the beer margin question, so as you know, we just updated our guidance. We are expecting this year to have margin expansion in beer as the guidance reflects about 10% sales growth and mid-teens EBIT growth, right. So we expect the beer business to continue gaining margin. Last year for the three quarters that we owned the business, our operating profit margin was around 31%. This year we expect that to be around 32% right now. So we do see some expanding margins. Now your question was more along longer-term because we gave some guidance that when the brewery is completed that we should have margins in kind of a low to mid 30% range. And we have stuck with that guidance and there is still obviously a lot going on in the beer business that the breweries being build out as Rob said there is about 1,200 people on the ground down there going up to about 3,000 building out to 20 million hectoliters and we still are buying 40% of our finished goods from Anheuser-Busch and all of our raw materials from Anheuser-Busch. And as we said we are currently thinking about transitioning from Anheuser-Busch for the raw material perspective and we have some bids coming in from the global providers of glass, hops, barley, things like that. And most likely we will be discussing the transition from the Anheuser-Busch and how those bids came out in a general frame probably in this calendar year. So I think when that flushes out we might be able to give some more specific guidance about where we see longer term margins in beer. But we still don't have all those bids in, and we are not ready to talk about it to the outside world. Obviously, the big component of that is glass which we also aren’t ready to talk about it to the outside world. There is a lot of discussions going in that arena. So long answer to right now we are still sticking to the low to mid single-digit operating profit margin for beer.
Nik Modi - RBC: Alright. Thanks Bob.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?
Rob Sands: Yes. Hi Alice.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Hi. Okay. So my question is a little bit more on the second quarter beer shipments and depletions, should I assume that shipments are up a little less or little weaker than depletions in the second quarter because you over shipped a little in the first quarter. And then the second part of that is what should we be looking for depletions in the second quarter, you talked about the easy comp and also we have got the World Cup and we have got weather that really just turned favorable over the Memorial Day weekend, so can you kind of go through that and breakout depletions in the second quarter and then shipments versus those? Thank you.
Rob Sands: Yes. We try not to get too specific on quarterly guidance and my gosh, you are asking very specific question, but that’s okay. We do expect a very strong second quarter in beer for two reasons. We do have a lot of momentum in the marketplace as you see. And from a billings perspective, we have an easier overlap, I think it might be our easiest overlap of the year as I recall from last year, depletions were stronger than shipments last year. So, I think the depletion overlap is a little more difficult than the shipment overlap. But for the full year, we still expect shipments and depletions to be aligned for the beer business and there is a lot of this quarterly activity going on, but I would probably try to focus more on what’s going on in the longer term and over the full year.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: I mean, is it likely that the second quarter depletions in volume terms will be similar to the first quarter?
Bob Ryder: That’s about all I am going to say about the quarterly guidance.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Okay. Then just I guess I will add one more question, if you look at your beer shipments in the first quarter, price looks like it was about 3%, it was 3.5% and yet I think we have been working with 2% for pricing for beer and I think your guidance for the year sort of assumes 2% pricing. So, can you comment on that 3%?
Bob Ryder: Sure. In that number, Alice, is also some distributor – beer distributor contribution to some of our marketing campaigns, because we will sit down every year with the distributors. And if we have some ideas that we think are really going to drive volume and then the distributors agree that they will sometimes, they will contribute and that contribution comes across in the net sales what looks like pricing, but it’s really not because that it’s a zero some gain that comes into an expense that’s further down on the P&L. So, I think from a pricing perspective, IRI just from price probably closer to like 2% versus 3%.
Alice Longley - Buckingham Research: Excellent, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning. I have got two questions relative to wine. I guess the first one maybe following up on Nik Modi’s question about the price mix on wine, I think Bob, if you could just walk us through net sales on a constant currency basis for the wine and spirits segment was down 1% and our wine shipment volumes were down 3.8%. So, explaining that, I think that gap makes it look like there is more price mix maybe in wine, but I am assuming that the make whole payment is contributing to that. So, could you just sort of try to give us some sense for how much the make whole payment contributed? I think in total, it looks like it could be somewhere in the $15 million range, I am just trying to get a sense for the size of that? And then I have a second question.
Bob Ryder: Yes. The make whole payment and you guys understand the math of it, right, so we are getting a payment against which there were no sales, right. So that really helps your margin. And for the quarter, the impact on math was probably between 75 and 100 bps for the quarter would be the impact on gross profit margin for that.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: But on the revenue growth, what would it be – so it would have been the same dollar amount on the revenues, seems like it’s a credit that comes to the net sales line right?
Bob Ryder: Yes, that is correct. It is a credit that comes through the net sales line, but it really – it’s not based on revenue, it’s based on EBIT, right.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Right.
Bob Ryder: So it kind of brings down your net selling price per case, but it increases your gross profit margin, right. So, it’s really – it’s quasi-confusing, but what I will tell you is for the quarter, mix had a bigger impact than the make whole payment.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Got it.
Bob Ryder: It is a very positive mix quarter versus prior year and I will tell you prior year was a very poor mix quarter.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: That’s helpful. And then the second question just related to wine, Rob, there has been some speculation in the press about Treasury Wine Estates and the potential that it might be for sale and Constellation has been mentioned in that. And I obviously don’t expect you to comment directly on that, but just conceptually kind of where you’ve got, where you are thinking at this point in terms of M&A in wine and is it tuck-in, would you be open to doing something sort of more transformational, any comments around that would be helpful? Thanks.
Rob Sands: Yes. I mean, I think that as it relates to M&A, whether in wine or any other categories, our position remains the same, which is as to use of capital, our primary focus remains on debt pay down at the current time. As you mentioned, tuck-in deals meaning if a brand came around that, that was something that was really hot met our financial objectives, filled the niche that we didn’t have. Of course, we would take a look at an opportunity like that, but generally, our strategy at the current time is all about driving organic growth and obviously we have got really good organic growth across all of the categories in the business. And there is a lot of upside and benefit to be gained through simple debt reduction following the beer acquisition. So, strategically, that’s what really makes the most sense in terms of how we are operating the business at the current time.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Alright, thank you. Have a great holiday.
Rob Sands: Thanks. You too.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.
Rob Sands: Hi, Bill.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Good morning. Just one last one on the wine side, any kind of update on grape or input costs, maybe was there incremental inflation this quarter and are you still expecting kind of some relief as we move to the fall?
Bob Ryder: Yes. The grape input costs for this fiscal year we are not going to see much inflation from that at all, because the higher cost grapes have pretty much flushed through the P&L. So, that’s helping our wine EBIT growth for the year and helping us maintain the guidance of kind of flattish margins for the year.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: So, as we look out I mean could the tailwind get bigger as we move to the back half of the year?
Bob Ryder: No, I don’t think it’s going to change that much. I don’t think we will see a lot of noise in grape costs for the year. It’s relatively flat.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Okay. And then just on the tax, just to make sure, are you expecting it to be below 30% for one or all the quarters from here that you have to get back to that 30% for the full year?
Bob Ryder: Yes, it will have to be below for some of them, just the math of it, right, because we are at like 32.5% this year. So, we are still sticking with the 30% for the full year, which would mean one or several quarters we will have to be below the 30%.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Okay. So, but not just like a single quarter catch up, it will just be kind of even over the next three?
Bob Ryder: It’s – you can’t really forecast it, because it’s based on a lot of it’s based on actions of third parties and we are not sure when the timing of it will happen.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Okay. And then last can you just kind of walk us through if we look at the Nava plant, I mean, things that are being done to – as the margins are ramping up kind of in front of the expansion, what’s helping to drive it beyond mix? I mean, what’s – what can you do, what have you done with the plant since you have taken ownership that’s kind of gives us excitement for the margins to expand between now and the finalization of the expansion?
Bob Ryder: The expansion is going to be kind of a date specific thing, right and the thing that will drive the margin increase on the expansion, when the expansion is done, it’s primarily freight. Okay, because right now, we are buying 40% of our goods from InBev and they are being sourced from hundreds of miles south of brewery, right. So we make them at the brewery, we’ll have much lower freight, but then there is a lot of other moving parts like I mentioned earlier to Nik’s question what’s going to happen when we move to our own purchasing contracts versus buying from InBev, is that positive, negative or neutral? What’s going to happen around glass, which of course is the big input cost in beer, packaging is roughly 50% at cost of sales. In beer, what we had experienced so far is an incredibly well run brewery. The people and the process that we inherited when we bought the Nava brewery we couldn’t be happier with. I was just down there a week ago and the throughput on the brewery has surprised us on a positive perspective especially when you consider all of the stuff that’s going on to double the size of the brewery, right. So that helped us, it was good because first quarter is one of the peak production quarters like you are trying to make as much as you can to fuel the peak summer selling season.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Got it. Okay. Well, thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Hi. Good morning guys.
Rob Sands: Hi Mark.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: I guess two questions also beer related. Rob can you give us a little more perspective on specifically what’s driving the incremental growth you are seeing with Especial and to what extent you are seeing ACV gains and to what extent it’s coming from improvements in shelf space or velocity at existing accounts? And then I had a related beer question.
Rob Sands: Yes, Mark. I mean it’s a whole bunch of things. I mean it starts with the consumer and the consumer is voting with their feet. So, we had very strong consumer takeaway on the product and everything we are doing from a marketing perspective as it relates to the consumer is obviously really resonating with the consumer. And we go back to retail and wholesale and you get sort of a compounding infectiousness when you have a brand that’s on fire with the consumer which really means that it’s a mushrooming effect, right. And it’s a cart and a horse question, in that the consumer is that the – the product resonates with the consumer, the consumer is demanding the product, the retailers sees that it’s hot with the consumer. The retailer and the wholesaler then invests more resources whether it’s manpower or dollars against the product which then circles back around and has the effect of even driving the products harder at retail. So fundamentally you sort of got the whole cycle working to the advantage of the brand. So it’s really a whole combination effects that people got very strong marketing behind the brand as well as our other beer brands. And again that continues to resonate with the consumer. We are sending a very consistent message whether it’s on Corona or Modelo Especial. Modelo Especial is a very, very well known brand in Mexico, therefore it is a brand that is well known and trusted by the Hispanic consumer in the United States that population demographic group is very strong in terms of purchasing power and growth at the current time. So, we are seeing all the benefits of that.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: That’s for the ACV and same-store, is there – can you give us any perspective geographically on Especial at (indiscernible) with Hispanics and it’s growing I think kind of across the country but can you give us some perspective on comparative rates of growth geographically?
Rob Sands: Yes. We are actually seeing very strong growth in some of the most mature markets for Modelo Especial like Southern California where Modelo Especial has a share and its equal to or greater than Corona and we are continuing to see double-digit growth in some of these large markets. And then in some of the more developmental markets like in the East and so on and so forth, we are continuing to see the brand really starting to catch on and we are seeing strong growth in those markets too. So it’s really across the board phenomenon and even in the mature markets we are seeing double-digit growth.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: That’s great. And then I was hoping you could unpack this comment about having adequate supply for your demand this summer? And there is a lot out there in terms of how much there is a glass shortage and who it affects and how, but can you just kind of set the record straight, is there some depletion number in terms of rate of growth? Will you start having problems with glass supply or are you sitting here looking at the next three months and saying it’s kind of a non-issue?
Rob Sands: Yes, it’s the latter. We are looking at the next three months and it’s a non-issue. First of all on supply, what has occurred, there’s been some very isolated circumstances on SKUs, not on brands, but on some particular SKUs in some markets we have seen some supply tightness in the marketplace. What’s really driven that has nothing to do with anything related to the brewery or ABI or supply in general, it’s merely a consequence of the fact that the brands are growing at a rate, which intrinsically it can be hard to keep up with. Therefore, in a particular market like there was some reports on Florida, there was some supply shortages there on a particular SKU, well, Publix is a gigantic chain down there, ran a great big promotion and ran itself and everybody else out of inventory, that would happen or can happen under any circumstances when you are talking about the kind of growth that we are experiencing at the current moment in time. It’s frankly just difficult to supply and can be at the levels that we are talking about. Now, all that said, we think we have got the inventories within our own business at wholesale and at retail generally speaking that there should not be supply issues even with the growth that we are experiencing throughout the rest of the summer and of course we are planning for this growth. Now, as I said, on an individual SKU basis in an individual market depending on what promotions are being run by the retailers, which we don’t necessarily have control over can something like that occur, yes, but we are not expecting anything of out of the ordinary in that respect. So, the supply situation is well in hand. We do not have a glass shortage. I don’t know where that comes from either. We have got as a general proposition plenty of glass to supply the brand. And as I mentioned in my script, we are working on the glass strategy and we should be able to talk about that in the next few months. And I am sure we will see a favorable outcome there as well, so.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Great, great. Thanks very much, Rob.
Rob Sands: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.
Rob Sands: Hi, Caroline.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Everyone, good morning. Congrats on the great results.
Rob Sands: Thanks.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: I was looking for some help with modeling the third quarter, because you had – I guess, Bob you had mentioned that shipments were up 13%, I don’t know I have a little more than that in my model in the third quarter a year ago, but it’s looking like that could be a down shipment year on quarter, a down shipment quarter. And I am just wondering if that’s how you are modeling it, you are looking at that comp and saying yes, we should expect very little shipment growth and then what the implications are for margins in that quarter, if that happens?
Bob Ryder: Yes. The statement I made was last year we experienced 13% growth in the back half. So that would have been Q3 and Q4 which were both strong quarters in beer last year, because they were subsequent to us becoming an independent beer company to the U.S. distributors. So, we have been saying that along we have much more difficult overlaps in beer in the back half and easier in the front half. And our easiest overlap in beer from a shipment perspective is the second quarter. Then when you look next year, Q3, Q4 were very strong for beer.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: But again, the implications on margins could also come through in the back half because of that, I mean, shipments and margins would be strongly correlated, I take it?
Bob Ryder: Yes, probably, but again from a full year perspective, right, what we are seeing is some pretty impressive numbers. We are saying we expect sales to be up about 10%. We are saying profits to be up almost 1.5 times that, right. So there will be margin expansion in any individual quarter. There can be anomalous activity and it’s not as you know in every quarter you have anomalous activity in the previous year and the anomalous activity in the current year, so you can have some odd outcomes that’s why I look – like to look at full year or even year-to-date as you get more data in your margin analysis. So that’s how we see things playing out.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Thank you. And then I just wanted to ask about A&M spending, I guess last year your ad spending was about $280 million, could you help us just quantify how much your spending is going up and if that’s timed particularly on beer around summer, so most of it’s going to happen before the back half?
Rob Sands: Yes. So marketing spend will go up this year versus last year. And in fact we expect it to be a higher percentage of sales as well. And we expect to spend most of it in the peak summer season. We are just spending a decent amount of marketing in the first quarter. And because as we have made a conscious efforts to kind of do our media flights around when the consumer is drinking a lot of beer, right in the summer. And as Rob discussed, we have put some money behind World Cup, put some money behind boxing and we put a decent amount of money to work against major league baseball. So, we do expect marketing to go up this year both in absolute dollars. And as a percentage of sales, I would say roughly speaking, we would expect to spend between 8% to 9% of sales on marketing for the full year.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Thank you. One more question if I may on Corona Light, do you have any anecdotal actual numbers to share with us on how that push is going on premise and how the brand is doing in markets where you really to get that brewer activity?
Rob Sands: Yes. So we – as you said we have made a concerted effort to push Corona Light through the draft – through draft which through the on-premise and that’s going very well. The consumer is really resonate with the product because it has much higher taste than other light beers, but still has the low alcohol, obviously they have recognized the brand and the retailers will ask pub owners really like it because it’s a higher ring for them right, it’s more expensive core than say a premium light. So that actually – that strategy is going as good or better than we anticipated. And it’s probably not statistically valid yet, but we also feel that in the markets where we are driving Corona Light we also sell more cases of Corona Light. So we believe that that will go very well.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with ISI.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI: Great. Thank you very much. As you look at your beer sales can you kind of breakout to the best you can where you see the surprise coming from, is it particular brands, SKUs, areas. And also do you have any data or any information from your guys suggesting where your share gains are coming from is it coming from mainstream light beers, premium beers, any particular brands or is it from some of the Heineken’s Mexican beers, just kind of a sense of where the share gains are coming from please? And then as a follow-up perhaps you could address any plans you may be making now to address the planned launch of Montego yet later in the year?
Rob Sands: Yes. I would say Robert that we are really happy with our growth throughout the country. Now, what I will tell you is that we are doing better in the West Coast as Rob said Modelo Especial is doing a great job growing in markets where it’s highly penetrated already. So our best geographies on a growth wise are the West and the South. But we are really happy with our growth around the country and we are pretty much gaining share in every space. I’d say that every one of our brands is growing versus prior year. I’d say that Corona, which is very well distributed, continues to grow quite nicely. In the first quarter, it put up some good numbers. Depletion growth was in the low single-digits. Shipment growth was higher than that, because we had that inventory replenishment. And Modelo Especial continues to grow in the mid single-digits. So, it’s really all going quite well.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI: But is the growth coming from other imports like Heineken, is it coming from Coors, Miller, Bud, or is it kind of all of the above?
Rob Sands: Yes, Robert, this is Rob. I would say that it’s really kind of across the board. It’s kind of hard to say exactly where the share gains are being sourced from, but you can look at our growth and our brands versus pretty much any of the other categories within beer probably with the exception of craft. So, it’s across the board sort of phenomena. And I’d say that if you look at the industry overall, you’ve got Constellation beer, right, which is about the same size as craft and you have got a craft of the whole category, which is about the same size as our beer business. And those two segments are I would say taking share just generally across the board.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI: That’s very clear. And as you think about the expected launch of Montego this fall, anything that you are hearing about that and how are you thinking about preparing your brand strategy and marketing to combat that?
Rob Sands: So, I would say, a couple of things in that regard. First of all, there has been a lot of launches by a lot of companies over the years. And in the recent past and in the distant past of brands that were designed to compete with our portfolio, right.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI: Yes.
Rob Sands: You can think of brands like – you can remember all kinds of attempts. And again, our brands are extremely well established with the consumer. So, I would say we don’t fear competition particularly. And we have seen examples of it many times and we just kind of stick to our knitting and drive our business the way we have been driving in the past which has been a particularly good strategy. Now as it relates to Montego, first of all, it’s not an established brand in Mexico, it’s not known to the Mexican or the Hispanic consumer, it’s just another brand basically. So, it doesn’t pose any particular threat to us that it’s different than anything else that has been done by any of our competitors in the past. On another note much sort of like the clustered theory of fast food restaurants, why do they all build on the same corner, hopefully, if it experiences some success, it will expand the category for everybody. So, I think it could actually have a positive impact on driving sort of the whole Mexican import category should it be, should it gain any success at all. So, again, we are just not – we are not particularly fussed by one company introducing one brand that might theoretically compete with some of our brands. So, that’s sort of the bottom line.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI: Great. And then just in terms of the upside to your expectations and original budgeting, is that more in Corona Extra and Modelo Especial and any particular SKUs just trying to get a sense where you are doing better than you had expected?
Rob Sands: Yes. Our business is a general proposition, which means all of our beer brands are growing at a faster rate than we would have predicted prior to the beginning of the year. And as I have said in the past this is with the kind of growth that we are experiencing it is difficult to predict if it’s hard to make forecast and to give guidance and to remain reasonable given the market at the same time. So you got to balance all those things. We can’t just make up crazy numbers, so we try to come up with what we think are reasonable numbers. And then in our own internal planning we also made sure that we plan for the contingency that the business will grow faster than we expect because it’s really little downside in doing that. So don’t confuse, our guidance and our forecasting and our attempt to be reasonable given sort of where the market is with what we are doing from a capacity perspective to ensure that we have sufficient supplies to meet market demand, so two different things.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI: Okay great. Thank you very much.
Rob Sands: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.
Rob Sands: Hi John.
John Faucher - JPMorgan: Good morning. Thank you. Just wanted to ask one quick question, well I guess two quick questions about the guidance. The first is if we look at the order of magnitude of the upside for this quarter not a whole lot extra flowing through, just any comments on that in terms of why the rest of the year maybe isn’t going up a little bit more. And then a clarification on the free cash flow guidance which stated the same, is it simply that with the sales coming in better, higher receivables, higher inventories what have you – is it working capital that’s offsetting the higher net income on the free cash flow guidance? Thanks.
Rob Sands: Yes. So I will let Bob answer the free cash flow. On the guidance for the year as Bob said a number of times second half of the year we are overlapping 13% growth I mean it’s sort of simple as that. Again we are back to the point I was just previously making which is we can only sort of forecast reasonable numbers and our guidance is based on that and we have a pretty significant overlap in the second half of the year. And we had some pretty easy comps in the first half of the year. So yes, we grew 14% in sales in the first quarter and that was a good result and we are very pleased with that. And as Bob said we expect probably from a sales perspective a pretty strong second quarter because we had a very low sales month – quarter in the second quarter last year with 1% growth and then we overlapped the 13% growth in the second half of the year. So that’s what it translates for the whole year into the low-single digit growth of sales that we have been – that is included in our guidance. So I would sort of like the fact that we can do at the current moment relative to our guidance for the year. But your crystal ball is as good as ours in many respects.
Bob Ryder: John on the free cash flow it’s the first quarter alright and even if you flow through the after tax impacts of our increased if you call EBIT guidance, we are still within the range that we provided for the full year. So we feel it was worth readdressing it. And we will be readdressing it as the year goes on. But we thought it’s only the first quarter, so let’s see how the year comes out and we are still within the free cash flow range.
John Faucher - JPMorgan: Okay, thanks. And then one clarification that the wine benefit having you guys said that was 75 to 100 basis points and that’s a total company gross margin is that right, that’s how we should back into that number?
Rob Sands: It’s just still wine gross margin.
John Faucher - JPMorgan: It’s wine gross margin. Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Gallant with Goldman Sachs.
Ryan Gallant - Goldman Sachs: Thanks for taking the question. Just had a quick one, how are you planning to address your debt that’s coming due this year? Do you think you will have to approach the market for that?
Bob Ryder: Yes, we can’t wait to payoff that 8 3/8% note. So, we currently have the flexibility, we are in good position to do what we want to, right. We can use our revolver, which would give us very positive arbitrage, because our securitization facilities are LIBOR plus 90 and the revolver is LIBOR plus 175, which is quite a bit less than the 8 3/8% notes, right or I think we can do this at any point in the year, right, if we would like to secure some longer term financing albeit at a higher rate than the securitization or the revolver. We could also do that. So, we are kind of keeping our powder dry around that to see how the markets behave, how rates are, and how we feel our future free cash flow needs will be.
Ryan Gallant - Goldman Sachs: Got it. That’s all I have. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Torres with HSBC.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on beer and specifically the Corona brand, I think in one of your responses to a question you said that depletions of the Corona brand were up low single-digits in the quarter, just curious to get your perspective on the pricing or the ability to price on this brand, it seems like there hasn’t been aggressive pricing or at least there has been some pullback in pricing. So, I was just trying to get the correlation here, if you feel there is more room on pricing on the Corona brand, do you think that low single-digit growth rate is still achievable or you feel is pricing on that brand, you can’t press it that hard that you will see some pushback on the volume side?
Rob Sands: Yes, I mean, first of all, where we priced for this year is sort of fairly well-known in that low single-digit range of around 2%. And then as far as our pricing trends go for the future, it’s really a function of what occurs in the marketplace, which obviously we watch very carefully and what occurs on a market-by-market basis. So, right now, I would say it’s difficult for us to comment on what will happen relative to our pricing in the future, because we simply don’t know what is going to occur in the rest of the markets. So, we will have to wait and see. We take a very strategic position relative to pricing. We do it market-by-market, brand-by-brand. And we do it largely on a reactive basis. So, we will see what happens. We can’t really tell you right now.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: But Rob, what are you seeing now though, I mean from a competitive standpoint, is there within the import category and who you consider your peers, has there been very little or no pricing in the category?
Rob Sands: No. I would say that you can look in the category, you can look in IRI, and there has been about low single-digit pricing. That’s been the case. There has no suggestion of anything other than that.
Bob Ryder: It’s been the case for two or three years.
Rob Sands: Right.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: Okay.
Rob Sands: So, we don’t see anything different right now.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: Okay. So, that’s more or less sustainable rate of pricing you see going forward?
Rob Sands: Well, we are not commenting on the sustainability of anything going forward. As I said, we judge that more on a real-time basis. So, don’t know.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: Okay, alright. Understood. Thanks.
Rob Sands: Thanks.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research.
Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research: Good morning guys. Two questions. The first getting back to the planning question, I mean, given the fact that you guys are guiding to high single-digits depletions growth, I mean it would appear that if you kind of trace this forward, you guys – when you guys open the additional capacity on a brewery that you are going to be close to that capacity given the trends we are seeing in the market. So, what I guess other things are you thinking about in order to make sure that you have the capacity to fulfill the market as we get three years out or so?
Rob Sands: Yes. Like any business that’s growing at the rate that we are growing, well, we will have to be capacity planning well in advance of the growth to ensure that we have the capacity that’s necessary to meet the market demand. So that’s what we are going to do.
Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research: Okay, alright. And then a modeling question on the wine business, I mean did you guys expect depletions to be down 2%. And I guess what I am trying to drive out is if I back out shipments relative to depletions, it would seem that shipments trail depletions by 300,000 cases or so. I mean is that the level of inventory you were expecting or the inventory reduction that you were expecting?
Bob Ryder: Shipments and depletions were about the same number for the quarter, but when you look at growth, it gets odd, because then your year-over-year, but it was very – it was somewhat of a confusing quarter for wine because of the prior year shipment depletion, prior year mix compared to this year’s mix and the reduction in distributor inventory. So, I don’t blame you for scratching your head a little bit on that, but for the full year shipments will equal depletions for the wine category and there might be some quarterly ups and downs as the distributors do what they have to do to move the product.
Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research: So, depletions and shipments will match despite the fact that there was a wholesaler or whatever, wholesaler that reduced inventory, is that right?
Bob Ryder: No, it’s just for the full year it won’t be all that material to the shipments depletions, right. For the quarter, it was, but for the full year, it won’t be.
Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research: And then so it’s fair to assume that for the next three quarters or the last three quarters of the year, the numbers for shipments and depletions should be roughly in line, is that fair?
Bob Ryder: No. What I will say is I can’t tell you what’s going to happen for quarter, but I can tell you for the full year, shipments will pretty much equal depletions. Now, to your point, the distributor inventory reduction obviously, they continued to deplete, but we didn’t shift right, which was material for the quarter, but it won’t be that noticeable for the full year. And the quarter numbers can get a little anomalous, because you just have third-parties doing what they have to do to fill consumer demand.
Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research: Okay, perfect. Thanks guys.
Operator: And that was our final question. I’d now like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Yes, thanks everyone for joining our call today. We are really pleased with our quarterly results and we have had a great start to the year. The team plans to continue to capitalize on the tremendous momentum that we have underway in the beer business to drive growth and enhanced financial performance. From a wine and spirits perspective, we are gaining traction and are on track to achieve our goals for the year. And I hope you have the opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products, especially the SVEDKA Stars & Stripes during the 4th of July holiday later this week. So again, thank you everybody for participating in our call today.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Constellation Brands’ Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Constellation’s fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2014 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company’s estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Sands: Thanks, Patty and good morning and welcome to our year end call. Well, it has certainly been another productive and very exciting year at Constellation. It was just about one year ago at this time when we received regulatory approval to proceed with the completion of our most transformational acquisition in the history of our company. As you know, the beer deal has positioned Constellation as the largest multi-category supplier for beer, wine, and spirits. We are not only the third largest total beverage alcohol company in the United States, but the number three brewer and seller of beer for the U.S. market as well as the largest marketer of imported beer. And to reinforce our position as a top-tiered player in this space, we posted the highest dollar sales growth in IRI channels for fiscal 2014 amongst our key competitors in the total beverage alcohol category. Our fiscal 2014 results are a testament to the significant contribution that our beer business is making as we had an exceptional year posting sales, profits and cash flow that were better than our expectations for both the Crown commercial business and our new brewery in Nava, Mexico. The beer segment generated sales growth of 10% with corresponding depletion growth of nearly 8%, which represents a significant outperformance of the import category and the overall U.S. beer market. As a matter of fact, in fiscal 2014, our beer business accounted for 85% of total import category dollar sales growth and gained more than 50 basis points of market share of the U.S. beer industry in IRI channels. So what’s driving this phenomenal level of growth, it’s a combination of robust consumer demand, strong sales execution, excellent support from our wholesalers, creative new marketing and advertising programs as well as the outstanding efforts of our commercial team and our brewery team in Mexico. I would like to take a minute to share some of this past year’s amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands. As you know Corona Extra is the best selling imported beer at more than 100 million cases and is now outselling the nearest import competitor by almost 50 million cases. By executing well designed marketing campaigns and leveraging its brand equity, Corona Extra posted depletion growth of almost 4% in group volumes by nearly 2.5 million cases in fiscal 2014, jumping to the fifth best selling beer overall, while posting positive volume trends for the third consecutive year. As for Corona Light it is the best selling imported light beer at more than 13.5 million cases and continues to strengthen its own identity with its creative advertising that is driving consumers to trade up from domestic lights. Overall Corona Light is outpacing the import light category and currently represents more than 50% of segment dollar share in IRI channels. Modelo Especial is the fastest growing Constellation beer brand, with depletion growth of almost 20% in fiscal 2014. It exceeded the 50 million case milestones during the year with the most volume gains and largest volume trend of any top 15 beer brand. Pacifico increased volumes 5%, which marks three consecutive years of volume growth and Negra Modelo posted its fourth consecutive year of annual volume growth at 4%. While draft currently represents a small part of our overall volume, depletions grew more than 35% for this format, increasing brand recognition for Corona Light, Negra Modelo, and Pacifico brand throughout fiscal 2014. The five core brands within the Constellation beer portfolio are ranked in the top 15 imports and collectively account for more than 175 million cases representing greater than 50% of the volume of this category in 2013. Overall, as we begin fiscal 2015, we will be focused on the following strategies from our beer business perspective. The continued expansion of our new brewery in Nava, Mexico, which I will discuss in more detail in a few moments, maintaining the marketplace momentum for the commercial side of the beer business with incremental investments in marketing and SG&A and finally driving the great organic growth opportunities within this product portfolio. I am excited about the organic growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2015, as we are once again targeting sales and depletion trends to exceed U.S. beer industry and import trends. Some of the initiatives we have underway to drive these results include the following. As we head into the Cinco de Mayo holiday, we will continue to build our Corona de Mayo equity to reinforce our positioning around Summer’s First Fiesta to create momentum to keep Corona top of mind with consumers and our wholesalers as we kick off our 120 Days of Summer. Our 120 Days of Summer campaign will highlight 18 different weekly themes with special activities, content and prize drawings. The goal is to own the summer by driving repeat consumer engagement and purchase throughout the key summer selling season. New Corona national TV and digital video that launched recently to support these efforts will ramp up leading into Cinco de Mayo with high profile media properties that includes the NBA Playoffs on national TV. In addition, promotional, digital and radio advertising and digital video sponsorships will launch leading into key occasions, including the World Cup and the ESPN NFL Draft. To continue to reach new consumers and increase awareness of the brand, Corona Light recently expanded its draft offering to over 100 distributors and 35 markets. This launch will be supported by 15-second advertising spots airing with high profile sports programs that position the brand as a light beer with taste. Two new ads from Modelo Especial’s Hispanic Real World campaign will launch in the first quarter with strong support and targeted Spanish language TV and digital video programming. In addition, Modelo Especial will feature a 2014 summer promotion that includes a sweepstake with three prize tiers, including a custom soccer tour to three global soccer destinations. A natural launch of Modelo Especial Chelada began April 1. This initiative is supported by Spanish-language TV ads on national Spanish networks, consumers sampling at retail, PR in key markets, social media engagements and C-store print trade ads. In its first six months since launch, Modelo Especial Chelada has significantly outpaced our distribution and volume forecast. From a brewery and operational perspective, we began fiscal 2014 by successfully completing the initial transition of our new brewery in Nava, Mexico. As you know, we are currently concentrating our effort on doubling the size of this brewery from 10 million to 20 million hectoliters, including the build of a new brew house, packaging area and warehouse as well as completion of site infrastructure. Overall, beer operations continue to run smoothly. The beer expansion project remains on time and all major brewery key performance metrics and initiatives are on or better than target. Establishing foundations for the brewing area are well underway. Mass excavation for the packaging area is in progress and the first shipment of brewery tanks is expected to arrive shortly. There are more than 500 construction people on site each day with that number growing significantly over the next few months. As we have progressed with this major undertaking, we have determined that we need to increase the capital required to complete the brewery expansion from our original estimate of $500 million to $600 million. The primary drivers of the increased investment to a range of $900 million to $1.1 billion include the following. This most significant incremental cost related to outsourcing and utilizing third-party external engineering resources and consultants versus the initial brewery build by Modelo, which has the benefit of utilizing in-house resources. In addition, the timeline for the current expansion is much shorter than that of Modelo’s original build resulting in additional costs for expediting much of this project. Other incremental expenses include inflation on materials since the original brewery build and investments to improve brewery efficiency and flexibility to enhance overall capacity utilization in order to support the growth of the business. In a few moments, Bob will provide additional details about how this incremental spend will impact free cash flow and our de-leveraging efforts going forward. Now, turning to the wine and spirits business, before we begin our year end review and discussion of our wine and spirits plans for fiscal 2015, I’d like to mention that I am very pleased we have reached a long-term strategic agreement with VATS Liquor, a Chinese producer and distributor of spirits and wine. We plan to jointly develop and exclusively market and promote the iconic Robert Mondavi brand, which is world’s number one selling table wine. And China, China is currently the fifth largest wine consumption market globally selling more than 200 million cases annually. It’s a market that has doubled in size in five years. Category growth in China continues to be driven by imports which are projected to comprise about one-third of total wine consumption within the next five years. We are looking forward to working with VATS who has a vast distribution network, professional brand building capabilities and an established retail presence for consumers to buy fine wine and spirits. And now I would like to focus our discussion on Constellation’s year end results for our wine and spirits business as well as our strategic plans for the year ahead. As we discussed, fiscal 2014 represented the year of focus on brand building activity for our U.S. wine and spirits business in order to ensure that our business remained healthy and was positioned to generate profit growth going forward. These activities included incremental promotion and marketing investments that enabled us to maintain our marketplace momentum by achieving market share volume gains and above market depletion trends of 3.5% across our entire U.S. wine and spirits portfolio, while our collection of Focus Brands grew at almost 6% for the year. In addition, we were able to maintain dollar share in measured channels. As a result of these efforts, we continue to garner awards and recognition for prominent industry publications, particularly for our new products and our Focus Brands. They include the following. We won 11 2013 Hot Brand awards from Impact Magazine and several of our new brands landed on Beverage Information Group’s list of 2014 Growth Brand Awards. Our Focus Brands that received these awards included Kim Crawford, Mark West, Black Box, SVEDKA Vodka, Ruffino, Rex Goliath and Woodbridge, just to name a few. And our new product offers – offerings included on the awards list were The Dreaming Tree and Thorny Rose. The Dreaming Tree also received the distinction of Best New Wine Product from MarketWatch. From a spirits perspective, for fiscal 2014 SVEDKA posted double digit consumers takeaway trends in IRI channels in addition to gaining volume and dollar share of the vodka category. SVEDKA is currently the number two imported vodka brand and a top 10 spirit brand in the U.S. In fiscal 2015, we plan to capitalize on the continued growth of flavored vodkas by launching Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade as additions to SVEDKA’s flavor lineup. For the year, Black Velvet grew volumes 11% in IRI channels driven by the core Black Velvet brand as well as new flavor introductions Toasted Caramel and Cinnamon Rush. From a wine and spirits strategic perspective in fiscal 2015, we plan to leverage the hard work and significant accomplishments we have made throughout the last several years to grow profits for this business, while also growing revenue. And we are committed to executing the following strategies in an effort to make this goal a reality. Number one, our marketing efforts will be focused on a subset of Focus Brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest growth potential. Number two, we will continue to drive margin accretive innovation and new product development. Number three, we plan to increase points of distribution and deliver more effective feature and display activity at retail with added accountability and visibility for both Constellation and our distributors. Number four, for the first time in several years we plan to execute price increases for select products in the value and luxury segments of the market where pricing is currently occurring. And number five we will minimize COGS increase through continued global blend management initiatives and lower grape cost. Overall, we plan to limit our marketing expense to grow in line with our net revenue with the concentration of spend focused on key margin accretive Focus Brands. One of the things that will impact fiscal 2015 financial results for our wine and spirits business, particularly in the first quarter is that we are working with one of our exclusive distributors to reduce their inventory levels. Because this action is outside the scope of their contractual arrangement with us, they have agreed to a make whole payment as they begin to reduce their purchases of our products. As I mentioned, this is primarily a first quarter event and will have a minor impact on sales for the year. In a few minutes, Bob will discuss the financial implications of this action from a P&L perspective. Before I close, I would like to address the potential drought issue in California as we have received several inquiries related to this topic. Fortunately, grape wines are highly drought resistant and can actually produce better fruit in dry conditions. At this stage, our California wines have begun to bud and the state in general is running approximately two weeks ahead of schedule. While recent heavy rains have improved our overall position, California is still officially in drought status and at this time we do not yet know the potential overall impact from this situation, because it is too early to call. If drought conditions persist, we have the ability to source bulk wine from around the world in order to supplement which could potentially be a short harvest. Keep in mind that an above average harvest last year created a situation, where we currently have adequate supply. In closing, we had a great year driven by our beer business. We also achieved above market depletion growth and market share gains across our beer and wine businesses. The strong operating cash flow that we are generating will allow us to capitalize on value creating opportunities going forward and the new Constellation is well-positioned to drive value for the future. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our year end business results and our outlook for fiscal 2015.
Bob Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning everyone. As we close out fiscal ‘14 and move forward into fiscal ‘15 which is very exciting time at Constellation for employees, investors, lenders, vendors and consumers. As Rob said, fiscal ‘14 was a very strong year, where we closed our beer transaction, maintained or grew market share and are growing beverage alcohol categories, established some all-time highs with EBIT up nearly 60% and comparable basis EPS almost 50% while generating sales approaching $5 billion and free cash flow which surpassed the $600 million mark. And we exceeded all consolidated guidance metrics provided at the beginning of the year. We expect fiscal ‘15 to be another exciting year. We expect to maintain or grow market share and grow EBIT at or above our sales growth on an organic basis. On an absolute comparable basis, performance will be much better as we enjoy our full year of consolidated beer economics and we expect operating cash flow to cross the $1 billion mark. Let’s begin to look at fiscal ‘14 results. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for fiscal ‘14 came in at $3.25. This represents a sizable increase versus last year as we continue to realize the tremendous accretion attributable to the beer business acquisition, which is significantly enhancing our sales, operating profit, operating margin and free cash flow. The strong marketplace momentum and financial performance for the beer business continued in Q4. This drove year-to-date financial results ahead of our expectations and capped off a phenomenal year for Constellation. Given those brief highlights, let’s look at full year fiscal 2014 performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated net sales for the year included $2 billion of incremental net sales related to the beer business acquisition as we consolidated 100% of beer sales as of the June 7, 2013 acquisition date. For fiscal 2014, beer segment net sales increased nearly 10% on volume growth of 7%. Depletions were equally strong growing close to 8%. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 2%. This reflects an organic branded wine and spirits shipment volume increase of almost 4%, partially offset by higher promotion expense, unfavorable mix, and lower bulk spirit sales. For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $892 million. As you know, under the Crown joint venture structure, we recognized our share of Crown’s earnings on the equity earnings line. Since the close of the beer transaction, 100% of Crown’s results along with the Mexican beer production profit stream are consolidated by Constellation. Incremental gross profit from the consolidation of beer was $891 million. This produced a beer segment gross margin of 44% based on the incremental beer sales discussed earlier. For the year, our consolidated gross margin was 41.2% versus 39.9% for the prior year. This increase primarily reflects the benefit from the consolidation of the beer business, partially offset by lower gross margin in wine and spirits, driven by the higher promotion expense. SG&A for the year increased $280 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $260 million. Essentially all of the SG&A for the beer business is related to Crown as the brewery has very little costs classified as SG&A. The remainder of the SG&A increase was primarily driven by higher selling and marketing investments in the wine and spirits business. Based on what I just outlined, incremental operating income generated by the beer business was $630 million for the year. This produced a beer segment operating margin of approximately 31% since the close of the acquisition. The inclusion of the beer business results was the primary driver between the – behind the 410 basis point improvement in our consolidated operating margin for the year. Equity earnings from the Crown joint venture totaled $70 million compared to $220 million in the prior year. The decrease was due to the timing of the beer business acquisition. Interest expense for the year was $323 million, up 42% versus last year. The increase reflects higher average borrowings as a result of the acquisition funding, partially offset by a lower average interest rate. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of February, our total debt was $7 billion. This represents a $3.7 billion increase from our debt levels at the end of fiscal ‘13. The increase primarily reflects the financing for the beer business acquisition, partially offset by some of our cash build in advance of the transaction and our free cash flow generation. I would also like to remind you that in June, we expect to make a $558 million post closing purchase price adjustment payment for the beer transaction. We also have $500 million of 8 3/8% senior notes that are coming due in December. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 31%, which reflected benefits from integrating the beer business and the benefit of foreign tax credits. Now, let’s briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.81. The quarter reflected significant acquisition benefits. And as mentioned earlier, beer performance exceeded expectations. For Q4, beer segment net sales increased 13% on volume growth of 10%. This was somewhat offset – this was somewhat of an easier comparison versus Q4 last year when sales increased 1%. Consumer demand remained strong as depletions for the quarter were up nearly 12%. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 1% as volume growth was mostly offset by unfavorable mix and higher promotional spend. Now, let’s discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For fiscal ‘14, we generated $603 million of free cash flow versus $494 million in the previous year. This result exceeded our expectation primarily as a result of the strong beer business performance in Q4. Operating cash flow for the year totaled $826 million, an increase of $270 million over last year. The increase was primarily due to the profit growth for the beer business acquisition partially offset by higher interest payments and lower contribution from wine and spirits primarily due to some working capital timing. CapEx for the year totaled $224 million, an increase of $161 million. CapEx for the beer segment totaled $137 million. Most of the beer spending occurred in the fourth quarter as brewery expansion activities began to ramp up. Now, let’s move to our full year fiscal 2015 P&L outlook. We are forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.15 a share. For fiscal 2015, we are targeting mid-to-high single-digit net sales growth for the beer segment. Shipment and depletion volumes are targeted to grow mid single-digits and continue to outpace the import category and the total beer industry. For fiscal 2014, beer segment operating income totaled $773 million. This amount is presented in our summarized segment information in our press release financial statements and includes 100% of Crown’s operating income for all of fiscal 2014 and brewery profits since the June 7 acquisition date. For fiscal 2015, we expect beer segment operating income to grow in the low to mid 20% range. Excluding the estimated brewery acquisition benefit, underlying operating income growth for the beer segment is expected to be in the 10% to 12% range. For wine and spirits, we are targeting net sales growth to be in the low to mid single-digit range. Volume growth is expected to be in the low single-digit range and we expect to generate positive mix. While we expect depletions to track in line or better than the U.S. wine and spirits category for the year, shipment volumes are projected to be lower than depletions as we expect some distributor inventory reduction to occur during the first quarter as Rob highlighted earlier. Operating income growth for wine and spirits is expected to align with net sales growth in the low to mid single-digit range. Headwinds from grape costs are expect to abate as we continue to realize benefits from blend management initiatives and we begin to move into lower priced grape inventories. We expect promotional and marketing spending to stabilize and we are increasing prices on some products in the value and luxury categories as Rob outlined earlier. We also expect mix to be favorable in the fiscal ‘15 as we focus more of our investment on higher margin products. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $345 million to $355 million. The increase versus fiscal ‘14 is primarily being driven by the beer acquisition funding impact that carries into Q1 of fiscal ‘15. The tax rate is expected to approximate 30%. This represents a slight decrease versus the fiscal ‘14 comparable basis tax rate as we expect to realize some favorable outcomes on various tax items. Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $425 million to $500 million. Operating cash flow is targeted to reach at least $1 billion as we continue to realize earnings benefits from the beer business transaction. CapEx is projected in the range of $575 million to $625 million, including $450 million to $500 million for the beer business driven by the brewery expansion activities outlined by Rob. We are still on track to complete the brewery in calendar 2016. Although the brewery expansion CapEx is higher than our original estimate, beer volumes and profits are also higher. Even with the higher CapEx spend, our goals of reaching $1 billion of free cash flow in fiscal ‘17 and moving our debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio below four times in fiscal ‘16 remain intact. I would now like to mention a couple of items from a fiscal ‘15 quarterly gating perspective. As discussed earlier for wine and spirits, we expect some distributor inventory destocking to mostly occur during Q1, which will impact our shipment volume. As a result, we expect net sales to be down in the low to mid-single digit range for Q1. However, we don’t expect this to negatively impact profits as we will receive a make-whole payment from the distributor related to this activity in the same timeframe. I would also like to note that our targeted wine and spirits EBIT growth for fiscal ‘15 is weighted toward the second half of the year. From a beer gating perspective, I would like to note that we will be facing some difficult comparisons in the second half of the year. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the release. We currently estimate one-time cost at $60 million in fiscal ‘15. This includes about $25 million in professional services and transition costs associated with the beer business acquisition. These costs were originally expected to occur in fiscal ‘14, but shifted to fiscal ‘15. The remaining $35 million represents amortization expense related to the acquisition accounting asset established for the interim supply agreement for beer finished goods. I would like to make a few brief comments on commodity risk management. We have begun to hedge certain commodities in the energy and agricultural categories. These commodity derivatives generally do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. As a result mark to market unrealized gains and losses on open hedge contracts will flow through our GAAP income statement. We will exclude these unrealized gains and losses from our comparable earnings. At the time that a gain or loss is realized on a commodity hedged, it will be allocated to the appropriate business segment for reporting and will be included in our comparable earnings. This approach is in line with other companies in the consumer space. We began this reporting in the fourth quarter. At the end of fiscal ‘14, it was an immaterial unrealized gain related to this activity. Before we take your questions, I would like to highlight that the beer acquisition has been a game changer. In addition to the positive financial impact of the acquisition, our commercial performance has accelerated dramatically. Despite the increased cost to build out the brewery, our improved commercial results keep our free cash flow and deleveraging goals intact. The improved commercial performance of the beer business improves our financial profile and we currently anticipate exceeding our original IRR and shareholder value assumptions for the beer transaction despite higher capital costs for the 20 million hectoliter build out. With that, we are happy to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC.
Nik Modi - RBC: Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Just two questions on my end. If you can just kind of reiterate, I am sorry if I missed it, how much CapEx has already been spent on the brewery expansion. And then the second question is really trying to frame the opportunity that you might have in China, certainly long-term it makes sense and probably a big opportunity, just trying to get some texture on how much of a P&L implication it could have in the next 18 months or so?
Bob Ryder: Sure, Nik. I will handle the first one and Rob can handle the China question. As far as how much capital was spent on the brewery in fiscal ‘14 that was just shy of $140 million and that pretty much all occurred in the fourth quarter.
Nik Modi - RBC: On to China?
Rob Sands: Sure. Hi, Nik. China, I think you really have to look at that as the long-term investment or I would say a long-term project. We are just really kind of getting up and running and developing our plans. It hasn’t been a material business there historically. So, the idea is developing it into a material business in that market, but it’s going to take a number of years. So, I wouldn’t expect it to have any real impact from a financial perspective in the short-term.
Nik Modi - RBC: Great. And just one quick follow-up, I know it’s still early in the transaction, but the margins have been tracking ahead of I think what most people have been expecting and I know there is still a lot of spending to come in the beer business, but have you thought about the 30% to 35% since you kind of initially gave that guidance, and if you think there is kind of where you might be in that range at the higher end maybe even able to exceed that at some point in the next couple of years?
Bob Ryder: Yes Nik. We are not updating our guidance in that area. We would be happy if it exceeds it, but we have still got quite a few of steps involved in negotiating our commodity contracts as a standalone company. Going forward, as you know, we have talked about – we haven’t settled anything on glass, which is a big piece of the cost, cost inputs for our business. So, we are very happy with the progress of the project, certainly the progress of the beer business, but we are not changing our margin guidance. What might be throwing people off a little bit is maybe in the fourth quarter, the beer business had increased margins and really what that is, is in the fourth quarter again I think volumes exceeded our expectations, but we spent accounting wise very little marketing in the fourth quarter. So, you had a pretty high level of sale certainly growth to the prior year with very little marketing expense against it. For the full year, the margin from the date of acquisition through the end of year was about 31%, which was a little bit higher than what we guided when the transaction just started, but very much in the ballpark. So, we are sticking to that mid 30% operating profit margin guidance.
Nik Modi - RBC: Fair enough. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: Hey, good morning.
Rob Sands: Hey, Bryan.
Bob Ryder: Hey, Bryan.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: Just two questions, the first one just related to the capital spending in, I think this is the crux of why the stock has responded the way it has this morning. Bob, could you walk through first now that you have got a better sort of perspective or a deeper perspective on the project and the cost increase. Is the brewery going to be more efficient and is there an enhancement in efficiencies both in the existing capacity and maybe what you are going to be building versus what you originally thought? And then the second question related to that is just I think there is some concern and you have got the run rate right now on volume growth and beer is very strong and how do we think about the potential to have to add more capacity going forward? Does the increase in spending at all make it less expensive to add capacity going forward?
Rob Sands: So, yes, Bryan, I will answer that for you. Number one, the fundamental answer to your question is yes, we are designing the brewery in a manner to get more volume out of the capacity that we originally planned. So, we are expanding the brewery from 10 million to 20 million hectoliters in theoretical capacity that still remains the case, but in terms of the efficiency, i.e., how many cases will actually get out of that? We are expanding the brewery in a manner to get more cases out of that than we originally planned. That’s point number one. So, we are taking steps in that regard to plan for higher volumes than we originally anticipated. And then with respect to your second question, the capacity that we are currently building we do expect to be sufficient on four, I would say the mid-term meaning the next few years. But if the business continues to grow at the rate that it’s currently growing, we will have to be thinking about additional capacity increases sometime in the near future in the next couple of years and to begin that process so a good problem to have in essence.
Bob Ryder: Yes. And Bryan just to follow-up on Rob, we are currently assessing because volumes are doing so well. When do you expand capacity and where do you expand capacity, so related to that question if we were to put the next tranche of capacity expansion at the existing brewery, I think we would get some efficiencies from the $1 billion we are spending on the first 20 million hectoliters. If we decided to put the capacity somewhere else meaning you build another brewery or buy a brewery somewhere, then that wouldn’t help us so much. So we are currently in the thought process around that.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: And then fair to characterize the higher price tag especially for the outsourcing in part helps to ensure that you meet the calendar ’16 deadline, meaning you are sort of paying to get the front of the line?
Rob Sands: Yes, there is definitely a premium that we are paying to complete the project within the three year timeframe. There is no question about that. It’s pretty much half the timeframe in which the original brewery is built and it’s a pretty compressed timetable. And we have got to do everything in our power to ensure that the brewery is built in that timeframe, so.
Bob Ryder: Yes, we are happy to see that even with that increased capital costs as I mentioned earlier because I know a lot of investors are keeping an eye on our de-leveraging and keeping an eye on when we potentially reallocate capital. So all those de-leveraging targets and free cash flow targets even though we have increased these capital spend they all remain intact. So frankly after you get past the brewery, right what that means and you guys know your math guys right is the EBIT higher, right. So that’s going to drive much better returns after you get past this stage where kind of the snake is eating a camel.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: Got it. Okay, I am going to get back in the queue. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Good morning. Just want to follow-up one more time on Bryan’s questions, excuse me. So I was just to trying to understand over the past maybe six to nine months at what point did it seems like the timeline for the new plant is still the same and the size is still the same, where did all of a sudden it changed in terms of your budgeted costs, I mean what came about really changed that versus what we saw kind of six to nine months ago when you are first talking about this?
Rob Sands: Yes, well six to nine months ago we had obviously just closed the deal. We have very short timeframe to actually decide and agree to purchase the brewery and purchase it, we put together at that time a very rough estimate of what we thought the cost would be and we spent the last basically nine months bidding out the project and translating it into definitive cost which have resulted in the number that we disclosed. So there was definitely changes in the scope of the project from what we also originally – what we originally thought. And it was along the lines that Bryan suggested in that, although we are building the same 20 million theoretical capacity, okay and we expect to get more out of it and scope the project to get more out of it than originally planned. So whereas you might only get 80% or 85% efficiency out of your theoretical capacity, we are building the brewery now to get more out of it than that. Really as the result of the increased growth in the products that we are experiencing and that we expect to continue into the next fiscal years. So that’s basically why or how the brewery project cost increased from our original estimates which were really in many respects just a swag, in that we – it had not been able at that stage and obviously so to bid the project and to scope it fully.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Got it. And then just a couple of things also on the beer, wasn’t there at some point a change in the price you are paying for the 40% outsourced and will that change, any update on that? And then on the beer pricing in general is your guide to assuming a price increase for kind of the fiscal 2015?
Bob Ryder: Yes, there was a price reset for what we pay InBev for the finished goods that they are making for us based on the audited EBITDA of the acquired business, but building the brewery out does not change any of that. Those numbers are still intact.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Sure. And then in terms of overall pricing for this year to the consumer for the next year?
Bob Ryder: Yes, I mean, on pricing, we will – as we said before, beer is a very regional business. So, we look at what’s going on with volumes and what’s going on with competitors in our various different regions and we talk to distributors, we talk to retailers to try to assume what will happen to volumes, what will consumers’ reactions be to the price increase, and then we determine what that price increase will be on a regional basis, then it kind of rolls up. So, the only way you will know kind of what happens is to watch IRI, generally beer pricing occurs right after the peak summer season. So, September, October, you will be able to see what the big boys have done and what we have done and we take a guess generally what pricing would be when we give guidance. So that’s included in the volume and net sales guidance you would have seen in our beer segment.
Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Okay. I will get back in the queue. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much. One of my questions is can you tell us what the difference was between beer volumes in California and in the rest of the country? I am trying to drive at mainly what the drought impact was on demand, but also my understanding is that in areas where Corona is strongest, it’s actually growing faster. So, if you can just sort of disaggregate a little bit of what you understand about your beer business?
Bob Ryder: Yes, there is a couple of things going on there, Caroline. We actually did have a very strong year in California. It’s our highest share state. It’s kind of where Corona began. I think we are around 20% share. But as Rob mentioned in his statements, right, they are experiencing a drought in California, so actually we experienced very good beer weather in California. And we also have like elsewhere in the country, very good consumer momentum from our great marketing and our great sales initiatives, but we did have pretty favorable weather for beer in California and we are very happy with our results out there in fiscal ‘14.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: But I am just trying to understand what happened in the rest of the country, was the rest of the country up sort of mid single-digit?
Bob Ryder: Yes, we had our strongest performance in fiscal ‘14 in the west and the south. We had strong performance, but not as strong in the Midwest and the East. Okay, it’s kind of how we broke out regionally, but we grew in every geography, we gained share in every geography, we grew in every channel, we gained share in every channel, but we did better in the west and the south.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Right, okay, thank you. Now, just moving to wine, the issue with the distributor inventories is this one distributor, is this something that’s a one quarter phenomenon, if you could just help us understand a little more about what’s going on there and how long it will take to work through the system?
Bob Ryder: Sure. It’s – yes, the answer is it’s one distributor and yes, we are anticipating that it will be a one quarter or first quarter phenomenon and as we mentioned it will have no impact on our bottom line, no impact on earnings whatsoever.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Okay. And as we think through one, I mean it’s always got challenges, but always for different reasons, but as a long-term top line growth rate is 3% to 4% reasonable sort of assumption given a blend of volume and – I mean volume and pricing do you think that still holds?
Bob Ryder: Yes, Caroline definitely sort of the 3%, 4% range is sort of a good number that’s sort of what the industry has been growing at. We are pretty optimistic about our wine business going into this year, our 2015 fiscal year as I have mentioned we got a lot of I am going to say tailwind this year. We have been focusing for the last few years on developing strong momentum behind our brands making sure our brands are healthy. And as we move into 2015, I think that our brands are healthier than they have ever been and that positions our self well to capitalize on that and take some actions to drive profit growth as I said. So I think that that business is going to be – it’s going to make a very good contribution to our bottom line growth this year.
Caroline Levy - CLSA: Got it. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of ISI.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI: Thank you, guys. Can you give us your latest assessment in terms of when you may start paying a dividend, has that changed and also your thinking on M&A, is there any change there?
Bob Ryder: Sure, I will handle the first. I will let Rob handle the second. The dividend we haven’t changed the way we are thinking about it is we would start assessing redeploying capital to shareholders when we get close to being below four times EBITDA leverage and that goal has not changed. It looks like that will happen if everything happens the way we think towards the end of fiscal ‘16 is when we will get below that leverage ratio. So we would start to talk to investors and our Board in inverse order of course around that time. I will let Rob handle the M&A question.
Rob Sands: Yes. So on M&A the answer is our position or our strategy has not changed relative to M&A. Our principle goal at the moment is debt pay down that’s really what we are focused on, but obviously M&A is opportunistic, so we keep our ear to the ground for investments that we think will generate superior returns to our shareholders. But generally the focus is debt pay down versus M&A.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI: And Bob, given the tremendous success of the beer business that you are achieving and the transformation of the company as you look to do incremental investment, do you see yourself gearing more towards beer or more towards wine, has that changed at all in terms of where you are looking to take the company long-term?
Rob Sands: Well, as I have said, we are certainly focused on debt pay down at the current time, but as it relates to investments there is potentially good investments in all three categories. We look at it very fundamentally. I mean, we don’t have a favorite child necessarily. And so as opportunities arise we are going to look at investment opportunities in all three categories. And they will be evaluated on what generates the highest return in the shortest amount of time. That’s basically the bottom line right, IRR and payback. So we will see.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI: Are you taking a look at PBR?
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Okay, Robert, I think we are going to move to the next question.
Rob Sands: Well, we can’t comment on that obviously Robert.
Rob Ottenstein - ISI: Alright, thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research.
Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research: Good morning, guys. Two questions, one on the beer side, one on the wine side, on the beer side, I am not sure if I missed it in your commentary, but what was marketing or what are you planning marketing to be up in ‘14?
Bob Ryder: In ‘15 or in ‘14?
Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research: I am sorry in fiscal ‘15?
Bob Ryder: Yes. So in the beer business, we are investing commercially both sales and marketing, investing ahead of sales, because we want to keep our momentum up and because the sales and marketing guys have some good ideas that we think are worthy of investing in. So marketing and sales will be going up faster than sales. Marketing in the beer business is about 8%, 8.5% of sales which has gone up over the last three to five years.
Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research: Perfect. And then on the wine side, back to the distributor inventory reduction, how did that come about, who drove it, and as some of your other distributor contracts come to an end if memory serves, would you expect to see more of these types of deals? And then as a side to that, when these things have happened in the past, sometimes you hedge your distributors than more against the brands in the market, this time you are getting a payment, can you just explain your thoughts on receiving a payment versus a greater investment in the marketplace from your distributor?
Rob Sands: Sure. Number one, this is the particular circumstances of one distributor who desired to do something really outside of the parameters of our normal business relationship. That’s the answer number one. Answer number two is no, we don’t have any expectation that it will occur in any other context or in any other cases. And number three since it’s outside of our normal contractual relationship we felt that a make whole kind of arrangement was most appropriate in this particular case. And more importantly, as far as what we invest in the marketplace behind our business, we determine that completely on a commercial basis meaning it’s not based on any payments that we might receive or might not receive. We will spend what we think is appropriate to drive the business in any event. So it just still happens that with the way this particular transaction is structured, we don’t expect it to have any impact on the bottom line. And it is a – it is an isolated matter with one wholesale customer. So we bring it really to your attention and only in that it will affect the top line. In the first quarter, we really expect the top line materially even for the whole year. And as you said, it will have no impact on the bottom line. So that’s really, that’s it.
Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research: Perfect, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Hunt of Wells Fargo Securities.
Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities: Thank you. Two questions. One, Rob, when you start to talk about pricing and the value in the luxury segment of the wine business, it sounded as though you were a follower and not a leader, can you discuss maybe the level of pricing and clarify whether Constellation is leading or following price increases in the wine segment?
Rob Sands: Yes, I would say, we have about a 15% total market share in the wine segment. As you know, it’s a pretty fragmented category compared to the other two categories in the beverage, alcohol business. Therefore, I am not even sure to talk of being a leader in this and that is even particularly relevant. We take a look at our products. We take a look at the competition. We take a look at the categories. We see what’s happening. And we decide what we are going to do. Over the last few years, there hasn’t been much pricing in the wine business period. We are seeing some opportunities for pricing as we move into our fiscal ‘15 and we are going to take those opportunities that we think that they are in the high end and the lower end. So that’s where we are going to focus in terms of that element of our strategy. So it’s really as simple as that. I don’t think leader or follower makes a lot of sense in terms of even the discussion in this particular context. But yes, we look around, we see what’s going in the marketplace and we make our judgments in that regard.
Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities: And with regards to magnitude, is there any comments around that you feel to make?
Rob Sands: No. I mean, we are really developing our plans and our strategies for taking the pricing in the areas that we are going to take it and they are not fully baked at this time. So it’s really kind of hard to discuss the absolute magnitude of it at this moment.
Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. And then my other question is when you look at the supply contracts across your businesses with the new beer business and the scale it brings to the company, you mentioned you haven’t worked on glass contracts yet and that’s an opportunity going forward, have you looked at any other supply contracts and has progress been made in kind of garnering savings given the new scale of the business?
Bob Ryder: Yes, number one, we didn’t say we haven’t or if we did say, we said it incorrectly. We have been working on glass and we have been working on other commodities. We are not at a stage yet where we are prepared to say exactly what our strategy is on glass. But it is something that we are working on. And yes we are working on the other commodities as well. And I would say the most we are prepared to say at the current time is I think that where we end up on commodities is going to be favorable.
Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities: And should we expect to see those (resources) this year?
Bob Ryder: That’s what we think.
Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay, right and should we expect to see those from a timeline perspective this year or is that…?
Bob Ryder: Sure. We will have something to say. I am sure we will have something to say on commodities as we go out, go through the year. Yes.
Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities: Alright, I appreciate your time. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Bob Ryder: Hi, Bryan.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. So I am just going to give you a couple of quick kind of questions, some housekeeping items and then just one related to wine pricing. First just Bob if you could talk about just what the cash tax rate was for the year and what you expect it to be next year?
Bob Ryder: Yes, so the cash tax rate for the year is kind of anomalous, so let me kind of walk you through. What we have said, we haven’t updated this guidance in a while, but we would expect a cash tax rate like the mid 20% on an ongoing basis. I would say that the beer structure will probably improve on that over the medium to long-term, and we will update you on that when things settle down. I would say that fiscal ‘14 and actually fiscal ‘15 as well are going to be pretty anomalous because of the big increase in the stock price and some option exercises from options that were expiring, etcetera or people that are just exercising some in the money, we get a tax deduction for that and that’s actually a reasonably big number, right. If you look at the cash flow statement, you can see the cash we brought in from option exercises. So that will bring the cash tax rate down, relatively dramatically while this situation goes on. We don’t expect it to last big time past fiscal ‘15. So I would call that not really an operating cash tax environment. It’s just that – the anomalous equity activity.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: But it will be a little better. It will be favorable in ‘15 relative to sort of what your normal run rate ought to be going forward?
Bob Ryder: Yes, I would agree with that.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: Okay, foreign exchange, just the peso-dollar exchange rate, and what – how should we think about that from a transaction translation impact for next year, or this year I should say?
Rob Sands: Sorry, go ahead and finish your question.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: I was going to say for ‘15.
Bob Ryder: Yes. So the way we handle this and actually – and we told you this on previous calls, the peso-dollar rate was more favorable than we thought because actually the rate physically has gotten favorable from when we closed the deal. We do hedge transaction exposure to the peso. There isn’t actually as much peso exposure as you would think, because most of the commodities in the beer industry are dollar-based. So, really the core peso exposure is our onsite labor at the facility which still is a sizable number, but nowhere near what you would think. And we do have hedge contracts, we go out two or three years on those and we are actually relatively hedged for fiscal ‘15, right. So – and as I recall that I haven’t looked at it in a while, but I think the peso dollar is around 13, right. So, we monitor closely and lay on hedges when they get more favorable, but we are not expecting a ton of volatility there in fiscal ‘15.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: Okay. And then gross margins for the beer business in the fourth quarter and the full year, I know I think you disclosed that in the last couple of calls, are you going to – do you have that figure?
Bob Ryder: Yes, I think I had it in my script. I think it said it was 44%.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: Okay, alright. I must have missed it, sorry about that. And then just the last one…
Bob Ryder: Please Bryan, I am exhausted man, come on.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: It’s the lightning round.
Bob Ryder: Exactly.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: The last one is just the wine pricing, Rob, if could you just characterize the decision to raise prices in wine both low end and in your premium wines, is it a function of your sort of assessment of the market, especially at the low end, where there has been quite a bit of pricing the last couple of years and so you feel comfortable with the pricing dynamic or the competitive activity sort of make you feel comfortable about taking prices up, is it a – or is it a question or a function of kind of now that you have made some marketing investments, new products investments you feel more comfortable raising prices behind that or is it have some effect on what you think sort of commodity cost or raw material cost might be in the future? Just trying to understand the motivation to take prices?
Rob Sands: So yes, yes and no.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: Okay.
Rob Sands: So, yes, our assessment of the marketplace and so on and so forth is the fact that we do feel pretty well positioned given our previous investments and where we are relative to momentum in brand health that the timing is right and it’s no, it’s really not related to commodity, not related to commodity cost, although from a commodity cost perspective just kind of the opposite we have. We are not facing any particular headwinds this year in wine. So we are not expecting much inflation in cost of goods sold.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: Okay.
Rob Sands: So that will be helpful to us from a bottom line perspective.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: Alright, thank you very much and thanks for being so generous with your time.
Rob Sands: Our pleasure.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A portion of today’s call. I will now return the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Okay. Well, thanks for joining our call today. As Bob mentioned, the beer deal has been a real game-changer for us and the team plans to capitalize on the tremendous momentum that we have underway to continue to drive the growth, enhance financial performance of the business. As Bob said, we now expect the beer business to exceed our original expectations from a return on invested capital point of view. And I believe that our plans for fiscal 2015 prove that we have not wavered from our overarching strategic goal of generating profitable organic growth across all of our businesses, including our wine and spirits businesses. We have recently posted two videos on our website that provides nice views of the Nava brewery. I encourage you to take a look when you have a few moments. Thank you everybody for your participation today.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the Constellation Brands’ fourth quarter and fiscal year earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Constellation Brands Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone. Happy New Year. Welcome to Constellation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert S. Sands: Thanks, Patty, and good morning and happy New Year to everyone. I hope everybody enjoyed the holidays and had an opportunity to drink some of our Constellation products this holiday season. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2014 sales and earnings results. Before we get started with the review of the quarter, I believe it's worth noting that for a second consecutive year, Constellation stock was the best performer in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples universe, as well as one of the top performing stocks within the overall S&P 500 index, increasing almost 100% for calendar year 2013. We believe that the realization of significant benefits from the beer business acquisition, along with excellent execution within Crown's U.S. commercial business, are the key driver of this stock price appreciation. In addition, we have successfully completed the transition of our new brewery in Nava, Mexico. Beer operations are running smoothly, the supply chain is operating efficiently, and all key performance metrics are being achieved at the brewery. As you know, we are in the initial phase of the brewery expansion project which will include the buildout of the brewhouse, packaging, warehousing and site infrastructure. Although we are in the early stages of this process, I am pleased to report that all design work for the brewery and the packaging area has been completed, and we are currently finalizing warehouse expansion details. In addition, stainless steel is being fabricated for the beer tanks, and we have begun grading of the site in preparation for the building construction. From a commercial beer business perspective in the U.S., Crown had a phenomenal quarter, generating sales growth of 21% while continuing to gain market share. All 4 Mexican brands posted notable depletion growth during the quarter, with their 2 most significant brands, Modelo Especial increasing 18% and Corona Extra growing almost 6%. Depletions for the draft beer business increased more than 30%, and after repositioning Victoria in key markets and expanding into select new markets, this brand has regained momentum, posting depletion growth of greater than 20%. Overall, excellent sales and depletion results for Crown were driven by a number of factors, including continuing strong consumer demand for our outstanding portfolio of brands; an increase in third quarter shipments to replenish distributor inventory levels which were running below normal after this year's robust summer selling season; an easier comparison versus last year's third quarter due to the timing of shipments in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 in advance of price increases in select markets; and excellent execution by Crown wholesalers who now have the assurance that Constellation will be their long-term business partner since the closing of the beer deal. The renewed momentum we experienced during the summer selling season, particularly for the Corona brand, continued throughout the fall and into the holiday selling season. We believe this strong consumer demand was driven by the combined success of a number of marketing initiatives, including execution of the new TV advertising, including the Some Beaches campaign, Jon Gruden TV ads featured during Monday Night Football games, and new Spanish-language creative which was aired on TV during Mexican national team soccer matches and other key programs on Spanish-language networks. Corona also sponsored the Mayweather versus Canelo boxing fight, supported by TV advertising and limited edition 18-pack wrapped bottles which resulted in strong execution in Hispanic accounts. Corona Extra has now become the fifth-largest dollar-share brand in IRI channels, and continues to grow and gain share. The strong momentum of Modelo Especial also continued throughout the quarter. New SKU and innovation including Modelo Especial Chelada are driving consumer trade-up within the overall portfolio and bringing new customers into the franchise. New Spanish-language TV advertising was recently introduced to support the newly released Modelo Especial Chelada, which has significantly exceeded volume and distribution targets in its launch markets. Modelo Especial draft, Crown's second-largest draft brand after Pacifico, grew 30% -- 35% during the quarter. Overall, the strong results that Crown has achieved this year are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's overall EPS guidance for fiscal 2014. As such, we are also revising our fiscal 2014 forecast for the Crown business and now expect beer depletions to increase mid single-digits, which will drive sales growth in the high single-digit range with operating profits expected to increase in the low- to mid-teen range. And now, I'd like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. As we noted earlier this year, the performance of our wine and spirits business would be skewed towards the second half of the year to align with peak -- the peak seasonality of the business as well as new product introductions. I'm very encouraged by the acceleration of depletion trends during the third quarter and the fact that on a year-to-date basis, we are outperforming the U.S. wine market on a volume basis across all channels. These results were driven by some of our key Focus Brands that continue to achieve noteworthy accomplishments, a few of which I will highlight. The 2011 Robert Mondavi Oakville Fumé Blanc was recently awarded a 95-point score in the Top 100 Wine for 2013 from Wine Enthusiast. The 2010 Robert Mondavi Cabernet Reserve received 95 points from Robert Parker of the Wine Advocate, who also liked the Franciscan 2010 Magnificat, which was awarded a 91-point score. Wine.com, the nation's #1 among retail, recently released its top 100 list based entirely on consumer preferences. Some of the great Constellation Brands that made the list include Robert Mondavi Napa Cabernet, Ruffino Modus, Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc and Franciscan Cabernet Sauvignon. Impact recently presented Blue Chip Awards for Estancia, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, SVEDKA, Ruffino and Kim Crawford. And Constellation received 37 medals across all brands submitted to the 2013 World Value Wine Challenge, the nation's most comprehensive competition of wines priced at less than $20. Gold medals, 90-plus point scores and best buy distinctions were awarded to Robert Mondavi Private Selection, as well as Rex Goliath. Overall, third quarter segment net sales for wine increased 3% driven by the U.S. wine portfolio, with depletion trends for the entire portfolio growing more than 4%. Third quarter spirits sales declined 5% and can be primarily attributed to an unfavorable comparison versus last year when we had the benefit of the bulk bourbon sales. However, we experienced improving spirits depletion trends in the third quarter, as some of our investments took hold for this business. As a matter of fact, from a consumer takeaway perspective across all channels during the third quarter, Constellation's overall spirit growth of more than 5% exceeded the category growth of about 1.5%. SVEDKA depletions grew in the high single-digit range during the third quarter, while gaining almost 2 points of volume share of the imported vodka category in IRI channels. We are currently preparing to introduce the next 2 new SVEDKA flavors, strawberry lemonade and mango pineapple, which are expected to launch during the first quarter. The new Black Velvet Cinnamon Rush, which launched early in the third quarter, is performing well and is one of our top-performing new SKUs from a distribution perspective. Since the closing of the beer deal, we have also begun to leverage our sales and marketing efforts across our beer, wine and spirits business. For instance, SVEDKA and Corona joined forces for a national, on-premise program showcasing the SVEDKA Coronation Cocktail. This delicious proprietary beer cocktail harnesses the popularity of these 2 key brands and leverages the joint on-premise efforts of our organization. Corona Extra and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, recently partnered with Butterball, in a major cross-portfolio program that leveraged the power of the 2 strongest brands in our portfolio. This fully integrated holiday promotion began in advance of Thanksgiving, reaching consumers through displays, point-of-sale materials and a unique Turkey Talk-Line, where consumers received recipes and pairing tests. Now despite this quarter's improving depletion results for wine and spirits, we will be unable to attain our original fiscal 2014 operating profit goal for this business due to the following factors: the positive mix trends that we anticipated earlier this year have not reached targeted levels as our premium-priced products are growing faster than our super and ultra premium-priced products; and we have invested more than originally anticipated in promotional activity as the key to $5 to $15 price point at retail remains competitive. While we are disappointed that the wine and spirits business will not achieve its expected profitability goals, the hard work and significant accomplishments we have made throughout the last few years have favorably positioned this business heading into next year. Overall, our wine and spirits strategy has been to focus on brand-building and maintaining market share to ensure that our business remains strong and healthy. Strong competition for some of our key brands has necessitated higher promotional spend to meet this objective. We expect this strategy to reap rewards in the future when market dynamics begin to enable lower levels of promotional activity or more favorable pricing environment, as our brands will be in a great position to capitalize on these trends. Meanwhile, our focus on new product development and innovation, as well as channel development and execution to continue to contribute to our future growth while we remain committed to brand-building in our core business, we believe these initiatives will drive enhanced mixed results while we also expect to begin to realize benefits from abating grape costs. Collectively, these actions are expected to drive EBIT growth of the wine and spirits business in the future. In closing, as a true triple threat in beer, wine and spirits, we have ushered in an exciting new era of growth and opportunity. We are progressing with the brewery expansion in Mexico while maintaining the strong momentum of Crown's U.S. commercial business. We have a great premium wine business and plans in place to work through the current set of challenges we are facing. I am especially gratified by the fact that Constellation was the best performing S&P 500 Consumer Staples stock in calendar 2013 for the consecutive year in a row. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our third quarter results.
Robert P. Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q3 came in at $1.10. This represents a sizable increase versus Q3 last year as we continue to realize the tremendous accretion attributable to the beer business acquisition, which is significantly enhancing our sales, operating profit, operating margin and free cash flow. Our Q3 results also benefited from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate, driven by higher-than-expected foreign tax credits. The strong marketplace momentum we experienced over the summer for our beer business continued into the fall timeframe. Business helped to drive year-to-date financial performance ahead of our expectations and is the primary driver for the upward revision to our fiscal 2014 EPS guidance. Favorability in our tax rate and interest expense expectations are also contributing to our improved EPS guidance. The positive guidance factors that I just noted are being somewhat offset by our wine and spirits business. Our fiscal 2014 financial performance is expected to come in below our original expectations, as Rob just noted. We'll look closer at the guidance highlights just mentioned as we review Q3 performance in more detail. My comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated net sales in Q3 included $662 million of incremental net sales related to the beer business acquisition as we consolidated 100% of beer sales for Q3. For Q3, beer segment net sales increased 21%, primarily due to volume growth as highlighted by Rob. These results are somewhat enhanced by an easier-than-normal sales comparison versus Q3 last year when net sales increased 1%. Depletions were strong at 10% growth for the quarter. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant-currency basis increased 3%. This reflects a 4% increase in branded wine and spirits shipment volume, partially offset by higher promotion expense and lower bulk spirits sales. For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $298 million. As you know, under the Crown joint venture structure, we recognize our share of Crown's earnings on the equity earnings line. Since the close of the beer transaction on June 7, 100% of Crown's results, along with the Mexican beer production profit stream, are consolidated by Constellation. Incremental gross profit from the consolidation of beer was $301 million in Q3. This produced a beer segment gross margin of 45% for the quarter based on the incremental beer sales discussed earlier. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 42.4% versus 41% for the prior year quarter. The benefit from the consolidation of the beer business was partially offset by lower gross margin in wine and spirits, which resulted from increased product costs and higher promotional spending. SG&A for the quarter increased $96 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $88 million. Essentially all of the SG&A for the beer business is related to Crown, as the brewery had very little costs classified as SG&A. Based on what I just outlined, operating income generated by the beer business was $213 million for the quarter. This produced a beer segment operating margin of approximately 32%. Since the close of the acquisition on June 7, the consolidation of the beer business results has produced a beer operating margin of approximately 30%. The inclusion of the beer business results was the primary driver behind the 350 basis-point improvement in our consolidated operating margin for the quarter. Due to the timing of the close of the beer acquisition, we did not recognize any equity earnings for Crown during the third quarter. For the prior year third quarter, equity earnings for Crown was $39 million. Equity earnings for the wine and spirits segment increased $4 million in Q3 of this year due to strong results for Opus One. Interest expense for the quarter was $90 million, up 46% versus last year. The increase reflects higher average borrowings as a result of the acquisition, partially offset by lower average interest rate. We now expect interest expense for the year to approximate $325 million, which puts us at the low end of our previous $325 million to $335 million guidance range. Timing of our cash flow generation and benefit from our lower cost securitization facilities helped drive this improvement. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of November, our total debt was $7.1 billion. This represents a $3.8 billion increase of our debt level at the end of fiscal '13. The increase primarily reflects the financing for the beer business acquisition, partially offset by some of our cash build in advance of the transaction and our free cash flow generation. During the third quarter, our debt balance decreased by $166 million. I would also like to note that the calculation of the post-closing purchase price adjustment payment for the beer transaction has been finalized, and we expect to make a payment of $558 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. In connection with this, the calendar 2012 EBITDA related to the acquired manufacturing and brand-owner profits came in a little above the $370 million we had originally estimated. Our Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 28%, which reflected benefits from integrating the beer business as well as higher-than-anticipated foreign tax credits. Given the additional foreign tax credits, we now expect the comparable basis effective tax rate to approximate 31% for fiscal 2014 versus our previous 32% guidance. Longer term, we continue to target a 32% effective tax rate as the brewery gets built out over the next 3 years. Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first 9 months of fiscal '14, we generated $543 million of free cash flow versus $337 million for the same quarter last year -- the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to benefits from the beer business acquisition, partially offset by higher interest payments. We're pleased with the strong year-to-date free cash flow results, but we expect brewery capital expansion investments to significantly increase in the fourth quarter. We have updated our free cash flow guidance to reflect the improvement in our projected beer business results and now expect to generate free cash flow in the range of $525 million to $575 million. This puts us at the higher end of our previous guidance range. Now let's move to our full year fiscal 2014 P&L outlook. We're now forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.20 a share, versus our previous guidance of $2.80 to $3.10 a share. Strong beer business performance is driving the upward revision to our fiscal 2014 guidance. For fiscal '14, Crown is now targeting net sales growth in the high single-digits, generally in line with what Crown has experienced on a year-to-date basis. We now expect underlying operating for Crown, which is before any beer manufacturing and brand-owner profit, to be in the low- to mid-teen range. Our brewery and brand-owner profits are also expected to exceed original expectations. Higher production volumes, favorable peso to dollar exchange rates and lower-than-anticipated SG&A build are driving this favorability. As mentioned earlier, wine and spirits performance has tracked below our original targets. We now expect wine and spirits organic revenue growth to be in the low to mid single-digit range. The decrease versus our original mid single-digit target is being primarily driven by higher-than-planned promotional spending and lower-than-expected sales mix benefits. These factors are also driving a reduction in our wine and spirits operating income expectations. We now expect wine and spirits operating income to be flat to down slightly from the fiscal 2014 results. This is versus our original low to mid single-digit growth projection. The EPS guidance improvement also includes tax rate and interest rate favorability that I highlighted earlier. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the press release. Before we take your questions, I would like to emphasize how pleased we are with the transformational beer business acquisition. Our results continue to demonstrate how this transaction enhances our financial profile, as it significantly increases sales, operating profit, operating margin and free cash flow. Our beer supply chain has been operating efficiently and Crown's execution and momentum in the marketplace has been outstanding, driving the upward revision in our EPS goal and positioning us well as we head towards the completion of a phenomenal year for Constellation. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Davidson.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Let's see, the wine business did underperform a bit, but you made some comments that are sort of were in line with my bigger-picture thinking, which is that promotional spending will go down and pricing will go up in relationship to the tighter overall supply. The '13 crop was big, but longer term, I think that that thesis is correct. Can you comment at all on that?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, I would say that we agree with that thesis. It depends, of course, what segments that you're talking about historically, or at least in the last 12 months. We have seen sort of the $5 to $15 segment be fairly competitive, which in our view, necessitated some additional investment in promo this year because our principal goal and strategy is really all about brand-building and making sure that we keep our portfolio healthy, precisely so that we can take advantage of the kind of trends that you were talking about. So we feel pretty good about that thesis, and layered on to our strategy is a pretty robust new product development process of initiatives also designed to continue to enhance our mix and our margins and ROIC as well. So we think that's sort of the combination of the expectation of an improving environment, combined with NPD intended to, as I said, drive mix and margins, is a pretty good formula for success in the future.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: And if I could just follow up, one on the beer side, I think you said Corona's depletions were like 6%. Would that be indicative of kind of the pre-innovation number in the beer business? Should we kind of be thinking that baseline business was up 5 or 6, and innovation drove it higher to the 10-ish level?
Robert S. Sands: Well, I wouldn't really call that baseline performance per se. We've been inclusive of the NPD. I mean, that is very, very strong performance. We probably say that for the longer term, it's fair to count on or to expect more like mid single-digit growth in total over the longer run. But clearly, we're significantly outperforming that due to very strong consumer takeaways. So it is a little hard to predict right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley of Buckingham Research.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: I have a little housekeeping question and then another one. In terms of your beer shipments, you had 4% price mix. I'm wondering if it's reasonable to think that at the level of shipping to the retailers, there was also 4% price mix on top of the 10% volume growth for beer? And then, can you take apart the 4%? How much of it was price and how much mix?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Alice, what I would say is there might have been some anomalies year-over-year in the quarter, but our price mix in beer is consistent with what we've been talking about all year, and that's probably right around 2%, is where we'll kind of end up at the end of the year, similar to last year's.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. That's helpful. And that was all price, right, because mix is maybe even a little negative?
Robert P. Ryder: It was mostly price, yes.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Yes, and then my other question is a longer one. Your -- the only guidance you've given for where beer margins ultimately could go is, I think you said the low- to the mid-30s by fiscal '17. That's starting to look a little conservative. Can you comment on that? Where you think beer margins ultimately can go for you now that you know more about the business?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so again, this quarter, it was a fantastic quarter, so I'd be careful extrapolating that into the future. But we, right now, have no reason to change that beer operating or gross profit margin guidance. And remember, we're still new to the manufacturing of this, and as we build out the brewery and double the capacity, there's still some unknowns on what would happen. We were fortunate this year also that the peso-dollar exchange rate turned out to be much better than it was when we originally set guidance. So we're still sticking with that beer operating profit margin guidance. And as we learn more, because remember, a big piece of our finished goods is now produced by ourselves and we have less than perfect visibility into the cost structures of those when we take that over. So there's still a bit of grayness in there. So we're sticking with that guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
Sarah Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: This is Sarah Miller, on for Bill. One of our questions is on -- do you have any visibility into what your timing of marketing is going to be, I guess for the -- over the balance of the next year for the beer business?
Robert P. Ryder: Did you say -- well, I mean this year, I think we made a concerted effort to really take advantage of the peak summer sale seasons. And we kind of moved some of our marketing activities to that period of time. I think we're very happy with that result. So -- and actually at this time of year is when we're really kind of nailing down next year's plan, so it's not completely formulated yet. But I think we're pretty happy with this year's result, so there could be good probability that we replicate this year's timing of marketing spend.
Sarah Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then second question on -- can you talk about kind of the status of the draft opportunity at this point? I know you mentioned that Modelo draft was up 35% in the quarter. Where is Corona Light, and kind of where are you seeing that success there?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so total -- we're very happy with our draft business. And in addition, as we get into new accounts with draft, we do see some evidence that helps our case sales as well. It's a very good marketing point to have those tap handles in front of the consumers as they are enjoying our products on-premise. But this year, total draft is growing about 30%, and actually, our largest draft product is Pacifico, but I think we're expecting great things from Corona Light draft, which we were in test market last year and we're rolling that out nationally as we go forward. So we probably expect Corona Light to be our biggest draft brand, followed by Pacifico, and then I think Modelo Especial is closely behind that. But we see great things for our draft business.
Sarah Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And Corona Light starts to rollout now or next month? Or...
Robert P. Ryder: It's rolling out as we speak.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Two questions. One on beer and then over on to wine and spirits. On the beer side, kind of following on the last question, can you give us a little more color on what in your opinion is really driving this improvement in the Corona trend, the acceleration there? And similarly, what's driving the accelerating trends for Especial?
Robert S. Sands: I think on -- there's a number of things going on here at a number of different levels. First of all, it's a little bit of success brings more success, especially with our wholesale customers who now I would say have the assurance that they're going to continue to retain these brands as they're going to be partnered with Constellation. As you can well imagine, the rest of the beer business, which constitutes very large portions of their business, is pretty lackluster and down. So -- and our wholesalers are really looking at our business as being the only material business that they have, which is really driving growth and profitability for them for the future. So I would say that they've really gotten behind it in a big way, which from a push perspective, is really driving the continued expansion of the brands at retail. And with the consumer, I'd say number two, our marketing of these brands has been very strong. Our investment behind these brands has been strong. And really, we're seeing sort of better brand health for these brands than we've ever seen in their history. And I think that that's translating to improved and better consumer takeaway. And something that I said in the past that I think differentiates us from a lot of the competition in beer is that we've had a very consistent message to the consumer about what these products stand for, year in and year out, that has resonated with the consumer. And I think that, as I said, that's a differentiating factor versus the competition, which has kind of been all over the place trying to find some hook with the consumer in a market that's been down overall. So look, the better beer market is the place to be. We're the largest player in the better beer market. The consumer is definitely also trading up in beer to more premium products, and we're reaping the rewards of all of these trends as well as our own good marketing and sales execution, and as well as having a very strong distribution network behind our brands in a way like they probably have never gotten behind any brands in the past.
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: That's great. And if I could, on that topic, before we go over to wine and spirits, when you look at Especial specifically, can you speak to how the brand is doing when you factor out the ACV gains you're getting?
Robert S. Sands: Well, we think that -- look, we don't have those -- those numbers are very hard to really ascertain across the whole business. But to put it very simply, I believe we've got 2 things going for us, which is number one, gains in ACV which are driving growth in the brand, as well as gains in velocity per point of distribution. So put in simple terms, I think that we've got growing same-store sales as well as growing distribution. So you basically are hitting on all cylinders as far as that goes.
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it. Great. And then over on wine and spirits, this promotional need-more-money has been going on for a number of years. How are you thinking about the earnings algorithm for that business that you put out there back in June? Do you still feel good about that? Is it kind of a work in process? Can you speak to how you're thinking about that algorithm? I appreciate the comments on inputs coming down, but when you net it all together, how are you thinking about that?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, I'd say that we feel very good about the algorithm and we stick by it. I'd say that we're disappointed, we don't feel good about the fact that we're probably a bit behind in achieving the algorithm. But I think as a general proposition, we feel probably more confident than ever as we go into next year and the year after, that we will be able to grow the process in this business. So look, we've been making some calculated decisions to invest behind this business and focus on brand-building and brand health, so that the business stays fundamentally healthy. I think that as far as the wine business goes, we've got the best and healthiest wine business in the industry. I think fundamentally, the category is a great category, growing faster than almost any other consumer staple category, taking share from the other categories. We know that, that is offset to some degree by some negatives around fragmentation and lack of brand loyalty in the same sense that it exists in certain spirits segments and beer segments, but nevertheless, it's an extremely strong consumer segment that has backing of the retailers. We're the major player in premium wines. And I think that Tim Ramey expressed what we believe is going to be the trends for the future. So I think we're going to be able to translate our strong position in wine, not only into sales and market share growth, but into profit growth as well. So we feel good about it.
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So the final thing here and I appreciate -- I apologize, I'm taking so much time here, but a bit of a disconnect here with this year being flat to down slightly. Next year, you're basically saying you get back in terms of profit growth in wine and spirits. That's a function of inputs improving -- like if you had to put something at the top of the list, why are we supposed to think that that business, from a profit growth perspective, is going to get better?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, so I'll give you a few simple answers to that, which is this business continues to grow nicely, number one. We probably don't see the need for increasing promotional activity in the future and input costs, which were significantly higher this year, will not be significantly higher next year. So the conditions are pretty good for profit growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of ISI Group.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Can you remind -- a couple of questions, can you remind us what percentage of your beer sales are draft right now?
Robert P. Ryder: It may be 2%.
Robert S. Sands: It's a very low 2% or 3%, whereas the industry overall is at 10%.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes.
Robert S. Sands: So it's pretty small.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Right. And what exactly -- I mean, there's a huge competition, right, for new taps for -- on the handles of -- with craft and everybody else. What is actually is your strategy in terms of -- what do you have to do to get people to change out?
Robert S. Sands: Well, I think the great thing is that historically, there's been very pent-up demand for taps from our portfolio because we've had no draft, and our on-premise retailers have been calling and begging and asking for draft for many years. We didn't have it historically because it was the strategy of the owner of the brand, Modelo, prior to our acquisition of them, to not have draft in the United States. We didn't think that, that was a great position and we disagreed with it, but fundamentally, we didn't have any choice there. So as soon as we gained control of the brand, we've introduced draft, I think it's turned out to be a very good choice and has been completely additive to the business as opposed to cannibalistic, especially given the brands that we focused on for draft. So we don't have any trouble getting draft handles in the on-premise. So it doesn't take much of a strategy, given that it's a called-for item in most cases as opposed to a push-on. Think about the craft business, okay? You're talking about tiny little brands that nobody's ever heard of outside of their city and, in most cases, so yes, that requires a strategy to get people to put taps in on brands that nobody's ever heard of in a crowded and fragmented category. In our particular case, you're talking about the largest import brands that haven't had draft and now have draft that have a lot of consumer acceptance, which in fact, is actually building and growing, and therefore, our retailers are calling and asking for the taps.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Now look, that makes a huge amount of sense. Is there any reason to think that draft can't get to 10% of your business over time?
Robert S. Sands: I would say that there's no reason to think that draft can't get to 10% of our business over time.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, the only pause for that is the Corona Extra strategy, which is very unique in the beer marketplace because it's so well-developed and the bottle is so much of the brand equity. So we'll go slowly on that. But other than that, it's go for everything we can get.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Terrific. Moving to the wine business, is there -- can you give us a sense of how the innovations are being received in the marketplace? And how -- and whether it's given the tremendous proliferation of SKUs in all of the categories, beer, wine and spirits, is it more difficult today to get new products out on the shelves than it was a few years ago?
Robert S. Sands: Well, first of all, to the first part of your question, NPD is an interesting and tricky business and you don't expect to have 100% success, and NPD is sort of the nature of the animal. You have to have a good pipeline of it to get the occasional successes. And I'd say that true to that, we've got some really good successes. I think that if I was to say what I think is our #1 success right now, it's our brand, The Dreaming Tree, which is our joint venture with Dave Matthews, which we think is going to be a blockbuster brand in a very mix-accretive segment. We've got other NPD which I think is very solid, like our brand, Simply Naked, for instance in the super premium category. We've introduced some new products of late where we're seeing some very positive signs, a product called Besieged, which is a Sonoma product from our Ravenswood winery, which we actually saw a lot of success with. We've got a new product called SAVED, which we're very hopeful for. We've got an on-premise product called Hidden Crush. We introduced a new brand targeted towards millennials in the super premium category called Milestone, which we're seeing some early signs of success. So it's a little early to call. We've had some really good successes. I think, as I said, like Dreaming Tree is our #1 success. And then we've got a lot that we are in the process of developing at the current time and are -- I would say, have seen some early signs and are hopeful that we'll have some good successes in our pipeline.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And is it -- but is it more difficult now to get the shelf space than it was in the past?
Robert S. Sands: I think it depends who you are. So as a general proposition across the industry, I'd say yes, because of the amount, even though if you really kind of look at what percentage NPD constitutes of the business, it's been pretty stable in wine for quite a number of years now, at -- running at around 6%. So it seems like there's a lot of proliferation, but it's generally been the case for a long time. Now I think it's depends on who you are, I'd say for the leaders in the industry that have strong distribution relationships and even more importantly, strong key account relationships. The answer is, is that we can get distribution on our new products, and across the total beverage alcohol business, wine, beer and spirits in the United States, there's really only a few leaders in what we call category management. Only a couple. Okay, there's 2 or 3 companies, ourselves and a couple of our other competitors are the only companies that have world-class category management, which really means that we are the leaders in having the relationship of the key accounts that are going to matter for the future. And clearly, there's a shift going on in the business away from smaller liquor stores, mom-and-pop stores, consumers purchasing product at the large chains and mass merchandisers. And I'd say that as a consequence of a larger organization geared against that, years and years of developing those relationships, we enjoy very strong relationships with those key accounts. So we can get the distribution.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: That's great, and just one follow up on that. I saw that your relationship, I guess with Republic, was just renewed recently, I think a couple of months ago. Any change in terms that we should be aware of in that relationship?
Robert S. Sands: No. Fundamentally, the terms of the renewal are very similar to the previous agreement. We think that it's a very favorable agreement, in fact, for both parties. And we expect to see continued great performance from RNDC as we have had over the previous contract. So that's a relationship and an agreement that's working very, very well for both the relationship and a mechanical perspective.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.
Caroline Levy: Just a question on distribution opportunity with retailers seeing the kind of takeaway from your brand versus others, are you expecting some big shelf set changes in '14 calendar? Because again, that -- you were talking about the draft opportunity, but what is the takeaway opportunity as well?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, I think we're looking at good growth in '14 across wine, beer and spirits. Our retail customers, are particularly pleased with our portfolio. I think that one of the interesting things about Constellation, which is an important differentiator is that we're the largest multi-category player in beverage alcohol or TBA as we call it, total beverage alcohol, which means that 2 of the large accounts, we're either the #1 or #2 supplier to them in dollar terms. And #1 is either us or ABI. And obviously, as it relates to our portfolio across wine, beer and spirits, we're providing the growth of being the #1 TBA supplier to the retailer. We're providing the growth, and TBA is probably the most important category in grocery and to the mass merchandisers today. It is not their #1 category, number one. Number two, of the major categories, it's the only growing category from both a dollar, top line and bottom line perspective, and it's providing much, much more profitability than any of the other major categories basically in grocery. And what are the other major categories, right? CSD [ph], cigarettes and dairy. So -- and TBA is #1, and we're either #1 or #2 with all the major players, right? Costco, SUPERVALU, Kroger, Safeway, so on and so forth. So -- and then, as I said, there's a shift that's just going on in general towards those kind of retailers for beverage alcohol. So, we're in a pretty good place.
Robert P. Ryder: The other thing I'd follow -- I'd say, a very good place, the other thing I'd follow up with here and I think you might have been hinting specifically at beer because one of our compelling beer stories to retailers is the well-known national brands that we provide that -- and retail shelves turn very fast. So we all see all this stuff written about SKU-getting [ph] in craft beer, right? And we're kind of used in this in wine, but there are a lot of SKUs. It does get a little confusing in the beer aisle these days, but we believe when we go to retailers, we have a very good story that, look, we have the distribution opportunity with our non-Corona Extra brands that we think will turn much better than almost all craft brands and deserve more shelf space. Indeed, we think Corona Extra deserves a lot more shelf space than it gets because it also turns much better than craft beers. It also grows like craft beers, right? Another reason to give it more space. And it has a higher ring and more profitability to the retailer like craft beers. So we think we're like -- to a retailer, we provide a lot of the benefits of craft beers, but we have much more scale and obviously, much more tenure in the industry to actually help them do some category management, that maybe the smaller, newer craft beers aren't as expert at yet. So I think that is really -- and we have fantastic sales execution and fantastic marketing plans behind those brands, so it's really kind of synchronistic to get this volume growth. The consumers want it, the retailers want it, the distributors want it, and, of course, we want it.
Caroline Levy: That makes sense. And then just looking at the brewery, you've owned it very briefly, but can you just fill us in on what you've discovered about running a brewery since you've owned it?
Robert P. Ryder: It's big. So I'll start -- here's what I'll say, is we -- and Rob said this earlier, that the employees we inherited at the brewery, we couldn't be happier with. They fit right into Constellation's culture. They are expert at their job and...
Robert S. Sands: Highly skilled.
Robert P. Ryder: And highly skilled. And really, it's been fantastically turnkey for us and we've been able to focus more our attention on the buildout, which they're also critical to. And the other good thing we inherited is the way Modelo ran the business was pretty decentralized. So we inherited a brewery with full functions. Human resource, finance, they operate very well as a team, and every -- they fit in so well with us because there's a lot of changes and a lot of complexity on assimilating this brewery and I couldn't give a higher grade than the grade we give them on assimilation, and as Rob said, real expertise in their jobs we're thrilled with. Hopefully, they're happy with us.
Caroline Levy: And in terms of risks of delays and stuff, which happens with any big project, generally, how would you handicap the risks of things not going exactly on time and on -- in terms of just not getting exactly where you thought you would be over the next 2 to 3 years?
Robert S. Sands: Right now, we anticipate completing the project on time, and we would handicap it as a low probability that we will not be able to finish the project on time.
Caroline Levy: Okay. And the spending being a little lower than maybe expected in the current quarter, last quarter, do you fully expect to catch up in the fourth quarter on that?
Robert S. Sands: Yes.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, and spending will really ramp up. As Rob said, we're fabricating stainless steel, we're breaking ground, and the beehive will start being built because there's going to be a lot of activity around doubling the capacity of this brewery.
Caroline Levy: Okay. And then just moving to wine, and it's been a while since I looked at this in detail, but apparently, there is a lot of supply. And vats are full in Napa, in particular. Does that not mean there will be a lot of private label competition and so on? I mean, could margins be a little worse than you expect again as you go forward?
Robert S. Sands: I would say that the supply is balanced, is the way that I would describe it. I would say it's actually, over the last couple of years, depending on exactly where you're looking at, it sort of tips to slight undersupply. We've had a couple of decent harvests, which have, I'd say, tipped it to what I would call pretty much balanced. In the areas that matter to us, I would say that we're not expecting an oversupply that would drive lower pricing or higher promotion in the future. I think that we see a pretty balanced situation. And in fact, this is a general proposition, the way the wine business is growing overall and sort of given the level of plantings, especially, if we're talking about the United States. Things will continue to tip more towards undersupply.
Robert P. Ryder: I mean, that's a point -- I mean, the consumer demand for wine continues to be very robust and the mix shift also continues to be positive. So we actually need more supply just to satiate demand.
Caroline Levy: Okay. Great. And then just finally on the distributor renegotiations that are probably coming up with a number of wine and spirits distributors, do you largely expect similar terms to the ones you have, or is there room for some improvement for you there?
Robert S. Sands: I would say that we are hopeful. I think, first of all, I think we had great terms -- we have great terms to begin with, but I would be hopeful that there's room for improvement. Generally, that's going to be win-win for both parties. I mean, as we renegotiate these parties' contract, both parties look at the agreement to see what's working, what's not working, and adjustments are made to enhance the relationship for both parties. It's really the nature of it here, especially with wholesalers. It's not a one side can exact some kind of extreme favorable term out of the other side for no reason. But yes, we expect that there will be favorable enhancements to our agreements.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carla Casella of JPMorgan.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I have one quick balance sheet question here. The accounts payable were a little higher than expected for me, and I'm wondering if the terms are just different in the beer business than in the wine business? Or is there a timing issue going on there?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, terms are different in beer and wine, mostly due to regulations. So the accounts receivable terms are lower in beer than they are in wine, which is good working capital outcome. Accounts payable, there's just a lot of stuff going on with us assimilating brewery, there's a lot of timing stuff going on there.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then your cash flow, your strong guidance for the year, does that imply you should just take every 2014 million -- I'm sorry, 2014 bond maturity with cash flow, or do you intend to refinance it?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, we're still looking at that. But we'll -- in this environment, we're happy to see that go because I think it's at 8 3/8. Right now, the thinking is we won't have to refinance that. It'll just be financed from our revolver and securitization facilities which, of course, are at much lower coupons. That should be very positive arbitrage for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Eltrich of Mitsubishi.
Karen Eltrich: As we look at the year ahead, what are your thoughts with regards to priority of free cash flow, and as you make your manufacturing expansions, what kind of capacity increases can we expect?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, I mean, our priorities in the medium term on free cash flow is to pay down debt, which we've been doing. As we said, our debt was about $165 million less in Q3. We paid some debt down. We want to get our leverage below 4x EBITDA, but as you referred to, we've got a lot of builds coming our way. We've got, I'll say, the final tranche on purchase price, which we referred to right nets [ph] -- just shy of $600 million, which we talked about. And then we've got the brewery buildout, which, of course, is pretty big money over 3 years and a decent amount of that is front-loaded. So -- but we think we have all the financing we need to pay those bills, and we still think we can get below 4x EBITDA leverage by fiscal '17. Because you see, the beer this year is generating more cash than we originally anticipated. So we'll take it and pay that debt down.
Karen Eltrich: Great. And then in terms of what kind of capacity expansion is -- are these builds going to produce for you?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, the brewery is doubling its capacity from 10 million hectoliters to 20 million hectoliters.
Operator: As of this time, there are no further questions. I will now return the call to Rob Sands for any closing remarks.
Robert S. Sands: Well, thanks for joining our call today, everyone. Needless to say, we're very excited about the fact that our newly consolidated beer business is performing extremely well and driving enhanced consolidated results for the year. We certainly believe that we are well positioned in both wine and spirits as we currently stand, and are confident that our accomplishments in these businesses will position us well for the future. And overall, we feel very good about a solid final quarter for our fiscal year. So thanks, again, for your participation.
Operator: Thank you for participating in the Constellation Brand's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's Second Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has been also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis, however, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com.

While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert S. Sands: Thanks, Patty. Good morning, and welcome to our discussion of Constellation's second quarter fiscal 2014 sales and earnings results. The second quarter marks the first time that we are reporting consolidated results for Crown and our new Mexican brewery. And I'm pleased to report that the transition of our new beer business has been successful and seamless. Operations are running smoothly. There has been no disruptions to service or delays in shipment and our beer supply chain is operating efficiently. Most importantly, the Crown commercial business, which by the way had a great quarter, has not been impacted by the transition. Maintaining this high level of performance during the transition is a true testament to the talent and commitment of the Crown team and the Nava employees in Mexico. The Nava brewery is extremely important to us, and we're proud that it is now an integral part of Constellation. As you know, one of our top priorities is expanding the brewery. We've been fully immersed in the initial planning stages of the brewery expansion project, which includes the buildout of the brewhouse, packaging, warehousing and site infrastructure. We have already selected those companies that will support us in these key areas, strategically choosing the ones we believe to be the most experienced business partners. From a project management perspective, we are building the best team as it relates to engineering, supply chain, procurement, quality, finance, HR, legal and IT, doing our best to ensure that every aspect of the brewery integration and expansion will be successful. Closing the beer transaction has also been very important for our wholesalers. No one should underestimate the goodwill that has been created with our Crown distributor network with the assurance that Constellation will be their long-term business partner. As I mentioned, Crown has had a great quarter, generating sales growth of 3% while continuing to gain market share with depletion and underlying earnings growth of about 7%. All core Modelo brands posted notable depletion growth during the quarter with Modelo Especial up 17% and Corona Extra and Corona Light growing in the 4% to 5% range. Corona Extra has posted its best Corona summer since the inception of the Crown JV. The summer season success of Corona Extra was driven by a number of factors, including its well-executed summer retail promotion and TV advertising campaign called "Live it, Share it, Win it," which resulted in increased features and displays at retail. In addition, Crown leveraged its Hispanic boxing sponsorship with limited edition Corona packaging featuring boxing legends and rising champions. The recently launched Corona Light draft is growing in every market where we have introduced this new format, which is also having a positive impact on the overall growth of the brand. Now during the second quarter, Modelo Especial launched its biggest summer promotion ever with its win a trip to Brazil program. This promotion was supported with new TV advertising in English and Spanish and dedicated TV support across FOX properties, as well as promotional packaging. Pacifico introduced its national digital media campaign as well as television advertising in key focus markets during the quarter. Initial results showed strong increases in awareness and trial resulting from these efforts. Pacifico continues to be the #1 draft brand in the Crown portfolio, posting a second quarter 34% depletion increase for this format. And during the quarter, Negra Modelo officially introduced the Chef Rick Bayless sponsorship, including TV advertising, impact offers and sampling opportunities, which collectively are contributing to the success of the brand in priority markets. Overall, we are well positioned to generate organic growth throughout the remainder of the year with the following plans for our portfolio of iconic brands. Corona Extra will have a strong support throughout the football season, including new TV ads featuring Jon Gruden. In addition, we will air new Spanish-language creative on TV while also featuring game day football promotions. Modelo Especial's Hispanic real world campaign will continue to air across national Spanish-language television. And while we're on the subject of Modelo Especial, Modelo Especial Chelada will roll out in key markets earlier this week and will be supported by national Hispanic TV advertising. We have plans for a national product rollout in time for next year's key summer selling season. I recently had the opportunity to sample the Chelada, and its refreshing taste is really great. I would encourage you to give it a try. The draft beer opportunity for the Crown portfolio continues to have significant momentum with draft depletions increasing nearly 40% during the second quarter. And finally, while Somersby cider has done well in initial test markets, Crown and Carlsberg have mutually agreed that Crown will no longer represent the Somersby brand in the U.S. At this time, we need to focus our efforts from a Crown perspective on growing our current portfolio of great brands in order to realize our long-term goals. Now, before we review the operational results for our wine and spirits business, I would like to take a moment to discuss the impairment charge that we have taken for our Canadian wine business. As part of our acquisition of the Vincor Canadian wine business in 2006, we purchased some strong leading brands, like Jackson-Triggs and Inniskillin, that have been solid performers. Today, much of the market growth is coming from consumers' desire for innovation and new brands and from import wines, areas we have had some good success in the marketplace. Given these market trends, we have experienced declining performance in certain parts of our legacy business, including refreshments, wine kits and certain value wine brands. It is these areas that have contributed to the need to take the impairment charge. As a result going forward, we'll be focused on the following: sales of higher-value, higher-margin imports, including Mondavi, Crawford -- Kim Crawford and Ruffino; maintaining our focus on driving growth of our most important premium domestic wines, including Jackson-Triggs, Sawmill Creek and Inniskillin; and innovation as we continue to create new brands and products that meet the evolving taste preferences of consumers. We believe this strategic evolution will generate the most profit for Constellation and positively position us for future growth and strengthened market leadership in Canada. Canada is a growing healthy market and continues to be a strategic important business for Constellation. And now I would like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. As expected, the overall second quarter financial performance for wine and spirits was impacted by the timing of product shipments. We expect most of the growth for this business to be generated in the second half of the year, which aligns with our highest seasonal selling period for the year and a launch of most of our new product introductions. Second quarter segment net sales for wine increased 2%, driven by the U.S. wine portfolio. From a consumer takeaway perspective within IRI channels, our wine portfolio outperformed overall U.S. category growth during the quarter on a volume basis. And from a depletion perspective, our Focus Brands grew almost 3x the rate of our total portfolio, posting double-digit growth trends for Black Box, SIMI, Rex Goliath, Mark West, Ruffino, Kim Crawford and Nobilo. The year-over-year spirits sales decline for the quarter can be attributed to the timing of new product launches and product shipments for the year, as well as the unfavorable comparison versus last year when we had the benefit of some bulk spirits sales. There are no fundamental issues with the underlying health of the spirits business. As a matter of fact, from a consumer takeaway perspective, spirits increased about 4% across all channels during the quarter. We also recently launched the new Black Velvet Cinnamon Rush, which is priced at a premium versus our base Black Velvet brand. The cinnamon flavored category in whisky is currently on fire, experiencing triple-digit growth trends. Now as previously indicated, we are very excited about the second half rollout of our lineup of new wine brands and product extensions, including Rosatello, a sweet, low-alcohol wine that is targeted to Hispanic and urban female consumers; Milestone, focusing on the millennial consumer who is looking for a contemporary and aspirational offering; V.NO, a multivarietal wine that is positioned for millennials who like to travel and explorer; and Hidden Crush, an easy drinking, on-premise-only brand that is perfect by the glass pour for new drinkers; and SAVED, a new luxury priced brand that is the collaboration between tattoo artist to the stars, Scott Campbell, and our award-winning winemaker from Wild Horse, Clay Brock. Some of our successful new brands were recently honored by key industry publications including The Dreaming Tree, which received the prestigious distinction of Best New Wine Product by Market Watch and a top Hot Prospect by Impact. Primal Roots, Thorny Rose, Ruffino Prosecco and Diseño joined The Dreaming Tree on the Hot Prospect list. During the second quarter, we also received several awards for some of our key Focus Brands including Kim Crawford, which has been recognized by Impact as a newcomer Blue Chip Brand. The Robert Mondavi 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve received a 93 point rating from Robert Parker, along with the 2010 Ruffino Modus, which received a 90-plus point score. Our 2011 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Pinot Noir was rated 92 points and a best buy by Wine & Spirits Magazine. And the 2009 Simi Landslide Cabernet Sauvignon received a double gold medal at the 33rd Annual San Francisco International Wine Competition. And the Franciscan 2010 Merlot received a score of 90 points in Editor's Choice accolade in the September issue of the Wine Enthusiast. Now as is typical at this point of the year, I'd like to provide an update relating to the U.S. grape harvest, which is currently underway and off to an early start with almost 65% complete in California. Growing conditions were very good in most regions and 2013 yields are expected to be consistent with last year's crop, subject to variation in each region. Quality is expected to be very good. Overall, grape pricing is expected to decline slightly compared to last year depending on variety, location and demand. In closing, we are working diligently on the brewery expansion in Mexico while maintaining the strong momentum of the Crown commercial business. And with our wine and spirits business, we are well positioned to drive our great portfolio of brands during the upcoming holiday seasons. I'm especially gratified by the fact that Constellation remains one of the best performing S&P 500 Consumer Staple stocks this year. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for our financial discussion of our second quarter results.
Robert P. Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q2 came in at $0.96. This represents a sizable increase versus Q2 last year as we begin to realize the tremendous accretion attributable to the beer business acquisition, which is significantly enhancing our sales, operating profit, operating margin and free cash flow. Our Q2 results also benefited from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate. As a result, we are lowering our full year comparable basis tax rate estimate, which is driving an increase in our fiscal 2014 comparable basis EPS guidance. We'll now look closer at some of the highlights just mentioned as we review Q2 performance in more detail. My comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated net sales in Q2 included $763 million of incremental net sales related to the beer business acquisition as we consolidated 100% of beer sales for all but 6 days of the second quarter. For the full second quarter, the beer segment generated net sales of $815 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year second quarter period. While depletions were strong at 7% for the quarter, Crown faced a tough sales comparison versus Q2 last year when net sales increased 8% as there were some wholesaler buy-in ahead of planned price increases in select markets in the fall of last year. Wine net sales increased 2% while spirits net sales decreased 18% due to the timing of shipments. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant-currency basis decreased 1% as an increase in wine shipment volume was more than offset by higher promotion expense and a decrease in spirits volume. As a reminder from time-to-time, we will see fluctuations in growth transfer shipments, depletions and revenue on a quarter-over-quarter basis due to various factors, like the timing of new product introductions and promotional activities. We expect spirits sales trends to improve in the back half of the year as we just began the rollout of Black Velvet Cinnamon Rush, and we look forward to see benefits from the restaging of our new packaging for the SVEDKA flavors. We also expect to see better wine sales performance in the back half of the year driven by the rollout of new products and improved mix from initiatives planned for our Focus Brands during the upcoming key holiday season. For the quarter, gross profits increased $302 million. As you know, under the Crown joint venture structure, we recognize our share of Crown's earnings on the equity earnings line. Since the close of the beer transaction early in Q2, 100% of Crown's results along with the Mexican beer production profit stream are consolidated by Constellation. Incremental gross profit from the consolidation of beer was $311 million. This produced a beer gross margin of 41% for the quarter based on the incremental beer sales discussed earlier. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 40.3% versus 41% for the prior year quarter. After factoring in the impact of consolidating the beer business, the remaining change in gross margin is primarily the result of higher promotion expense and grape cost for the wine business and lower spirits sales. Some of the higher promotional expense reflects a shift for marketing spending that we originally planned. SG&A for the quarter increased $91 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $89 million. So essentially, all of the SG&A for the beer business is related to Crown as the brewery has very little cost classified as SG&A. Based on what I just outlined, the incremental operating income generated by the beer business was $221 million for the quarter. This result produced an operating margin of approximately 29%. The inclusion of the beer business results was the primary driver behind the 400 basis point improvement in our consolidated operating margin for the quarter. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $4 million versus $71 million in the prior year second quarter. The decrease was due to the consolidation of the beer business as of June 7. Interest expense for the quarter was $90 million, up 65% versus last year. The increase reflects higher average borrowings as a result of the acquisition, partially offset by a lower average interest rate. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of August, our total debt was $7.3 billion. This represents a $4 billion increase from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2013. The increase primarily reflects the financing for the beer business acquisition partially offset by some of our cash build in advance of the transaction and our free cash flow generation during the first half of fiscal '14. We continue to expect interest expense for the year to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. As you may recall, we did not include any potential impact of the beer acquisition in our initial fiscal '14 effective tax rate guidance, as we were working to close the transaction and evaluating tax structures. During Q2, we recognized the tax effect of the structure related to the beer business. This structure complements the overseas debt we put in place as part of our transaction financing. Our Q2 comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 29%, which reflected benefits from integrating the beer business, as well as the favorable outcome of various tax items related to previous years. This compares to a 16% tax rate from the prior year second quarter, which included the benefit of higher foreign tax credits. Given the anticipated lower tax rate associated with our foreign beer profit streams, we now expect the comparable basis effective tax rate to approximate 32% for fiscal 2014. We also expect the 32% rate to be a good target rate to assume for Constellation as the brewery gets built out over the next 3 years. Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first half of fiscal '14, we generated $440 million of free cash flow versus $333 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to benefits from the beer business acquisition, partially offset by higher interest payments and lower cash flow results for the wine business. While we're quite pleased with the strong year-to-date free cash flow results, we are maintaining our fiscal 2014 free cash flow guidance of $475 million to $575 million as we expect some acquisition-related integration costs and our targeted brewery capital expansion investments to temper free cash flow results in the second half of the year. Now let's move to our full year fiscal 2014 P&L outlook. We're now forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.80 to $3.10 a share. This represents a $0.20 increase versus our previous guidance and is being driven by the lower tax rate projection I outlined earlier. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the release. Let's talk a bit about 2 significant noncomparable items that were recorded in the quarter. During Q2, we recognized a $1.6 billion noncash gain from the revaluation of our original 50% ownership interest in Crown to reflect the fair value as required by GAAP. This gain is nontaxable. Similar to Q2, we expect this accounting requirement to result in a very low reported effective tax rate for the year. As outlined by Rob earlier, we recorded a $301 million in noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge related to our Canadian business. In addition, we continue to expect onetime costs associated with the beer transaction and integration activities to approximate $80 million in fiscal 2014. Before we take your questions, I would like to reiterate how pleased we are to have completed the transformational beer business acquisition. Our Q2 results started to demonstrate how this transaction enhances our financial profile as it significantly increases our sales, operating profit and operating margin. The transition of Crown and the brewery has been positive as our beer supply chain has been operating efficiently and Crown's execution in the marketplace has been outstanding. For our wine and spirits business, our investments in innovation behind new brands and our key Focus Brands position us for strong marketplace execution during the key holiday season. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Two questions related to the beer business in the quarter. First, Bob, if you could just talk about, I guess, the cost structure in the quarter to the extent that this is the first quarter you've owned the business, vertically integrated and you're accruing for certain cost for the first time, things like security, I guess, and other sort of items. Just do you think that this quarter was reflective of kind of what you expect in terms of those overhead costs going forward this year? Or was there anything unusual about what you would have accrued or booked for expenses in the quarter?
Robert P. Ryder: No, I'd say in general, as Rob said, the brewery transition, I'd say both operationally and financially, has gone very smoothly. I don't think -- well, I know we really haven't seen any surprises coming out of the financial statements or the manufacturing equipment. So no, I'd say it was a pretty smooth quarter. And I wouldn't expect any dramatic changes balance of the year.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, great. And then second question, just in terms of the depletions, beer depletions in the quarter, could you give us some color in terms of how much of that growth in the quarter was driven by new distribution versus just, I guess, velocity or growth off of your existing base? Just trying to get a sense for how much of the growth was just a greater lift because you ran summer promotions this year, which you don't normally do, and how much of it was just truly from new distribution gains?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, good question, Bryan. It was actually -- everything went well this quarter. So Corona actually experienced some of the best growth -- brand Corona, some of the best growth that we've seen since the JV was formed. And as you know, Corona is pretty much fully distributed. There's probably some opportunities on cans. But it's pretty much everywhere you'd want to be. So you'd call that probably like per cap consumption growth for Corona. In addition to that, Modelo Especial continues to grow rather well. And Modelo Especial is not nearly as well distributed as Corona. So I'd say a lot of the Especial growth is from expanded distribution. But we see per cap consumption in Especial as well. So I'd say it was a combination of all of the above.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with Davidson.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Just another follow-up on beer. Margins there might have been a little less than what I was working within my model and perhaps less than what you had pro forma-ed for 2012. I know that's probably where Bryan was going with his question. But can you shed any light on that, where we should be thinking about that?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I think the margins were pretty much where we expected, Tim. We had a gross margin in the low 40% range. That's probably kind of the neighborhood we expect until Nava gets up and operating and we save some freight and start producing the beer in a more efficient facility. So I'd say margins were pretty much what we expected.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Okay, sounds good. And in wine, the impact of the harvest really, I guess, won't be felt for another 12 months at least. But can you describe kind of what you see in the tone of the market right now? It seems like it's fairly strong, but I'd love to hear your sort of tone of market comments.
Robert S. Sands: Yes. This is Rob, Tim. I think that over the shorter term, wine consumption or the market has been perhaps a little weaker than we anticipated, sort of in the low single-digits, maybe growing around 2% or so. I think that, that's really being driven largely by the lower end of the market. So value wines, where a lot of pricing has been taken in the marketplace, I think that -- and everything overvalue, premium plus where we play, we continue to see sort of flat pricing, i.e. no pricing, to perhaps a little bit on the upside or some slightly decreased promo. I think consumer takeaway and premium plus continues to be strong certainly in super premium, ultra premium, luxury, et cetera. We still see very strong consumer takeaway, I would say that relative to the harvest, it's going to be another relatively large harvest, 2 large harvests in a row. Sort of the grape undersupply was greatly overstated. If you can put that all together, meaning there isn't much of a grape undersupply, in fact, we see in general bulk wine inventories have rebounded, are pretty strong right now. Prices for grapes have been coming down for the last couple of years ever since the perceived short harvest of, I think, 3 years ago sort of disproportionately affected that harvest because people got a little hysterical over it. And so in general, I would say that we see nothing in the wine business that is really unusual. I think even the slight weakness in consumer takeaway is really nothing odd. I think it's really, as I said, mostly a function of some significant pricing that was taken in basically 5-liter bag-in-the-box and jug wines. So I think it's a little artificial. So that's basically what I would say is the tone of the wine business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So a couple of questions from my end. First, Bob, just in terms of your guidance, I know you've raised the full year EPS guidance on lower tax rate. But I don't think you gave any update on kind of how you see the wine and the beer businesses unfolding from both top and bottom line perspective. And beer top line clearly seems like it's accelerated a bit more in the second quarter. So just if you can give us an update on how you're thinking about both line items from a guidance perspective for the full year.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, sure. You're right, Judy. The only guidance we changed was for the tax rate. Other than that, I'd say year-to-date, I'd say again you're right. I think beer is probably a little better than we anticipated and wine might be a little bit worse than we anticipated. But we don't think that those changes were material enough to change our guidance, balance of year. So we'll be reassessing it and update everybody on the January call.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And on the beer side, so I think beginning of the year, you talked about brewery profit being down with some inflation, but Crown's side of the business being up in profit. Does that sort of guidance still kind of hold and you'll reassess how sales kind of play out for the balance of the year?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I think that's fair. Yes, nothing has changed materially around that.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just on the beer pricing environment, we know that you've announced select price increases in some of the markets. If you could just give a little bit more clarity around kind of the magnitude and your sense of how well those price increases are sticking in the marketplace. We've also been hearing some chatter about price increases by the major guys being rescinded in some of the markets. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any of that kind of playing out in your major markets.
Robert S. Sands: Yes, Judy. In general, I would say that our pricing strategy has not changed at all. Yes, we announced some pricing, and we fully expect that pricing to stick. Our process is really to look at pricing market-by-market strategically and, of course, we watch the price gaps very closely. But obviously, our business is very, very strong. So we don't anticipate any change in our pricing strategy at all relative to what anybody else is doing, so...
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: A couple of questions. One is just more detail on the second quarter wine performance in the U.S. I think you said your depletions for wine in volume terms were up 2%, but you increased promotional activity. So in value terms, how did your wine do in terms of depletion and then also at retail? That's the first question.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I'd say in value terms, it was probably flattish for the quarter. Remember that wine was overlapping a real peak period last year, where we really were gaining a lot of market share and saw some pretty good top line results. So it was a difficult overlap for the quarter for wine. And we talked about in the spirits business, which is caught up with wine and spirits and those numbers, we also had some odd overlaps year-over-year. And we expect the business for both wine and spirits to pick up quite a bit in Q3 and Q4.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Do you think the promotional activity in wine will lessen in your second half?
Robert P. Ryder: It will lessen a little bit. But remember, because the second half has Christmas, and Christmas is a much richer mix of the higher-priced the product that drags more higher promotion spending to it. But yes, I would expect promotion spending to abate in the back half.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: At least in the comps.
Robert P. Ryder: Correct.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Right, okay. And then my other question is an update on the guidance you've given us for beer margins between now and fiscal '17. I think you said that you aspire to get to the low to mid-30s, but that's a pretty big range from 32% to 36%, I guess. And can you tell us if you're more comfortable in the middle of that range or the low end or the high end?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, I'd say it's not really a statistically valid sample at this point because we only had 1 quarter out of a 3-year thing. But there's nothing that we've seen in the beer business that would tell us that we're off materially from those estimates. As we said, the things that are going to drive the big improvement in margins is moving more production to the Nava facility, which is, number one, more efficient than the older breweries from which we're buying the product from InBev now. And in addition, we'll be saving quite a bit of freight because the Nava brewery is closer to its end consumer. They are the 2 big drivers. And nothing we've learned has told us that, that won't be true when the brewery gets built out.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: I guess, to be more blunt about it, I think most of us are assuming you'll get nearer the upper end of that guidance for beer margins by the '15 -- fiscal '16 and '17 period rather than the low end. And are we all being overly optimistic?
Robert P. Ryder: I would never accuse you of being overly optimistic. But as we look at our data, you're looking at your own data, we don't have enough visibility that far out to kind of put a more aggressive plank in the stand. So we still think the numbers that we've come out with are the best we have. And remember, we're all trying to extrapolate from benchmarks. And the Crown business is a very unique business coming out of one site south of the border, yet distributing throughout the United States higher price points. So it's difficult to get a benchmark with a similar kind of business in the U.S. But I know you guys will keep trying.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: On the beer trends, can you just maybe give us an update? I mean, certainly Modelo has done a phenomenal job today, but where we are in terms of ACV if that's the right way to look at it and when Modelo Light will start to -- when we would see that and what inning you think this whole rollout is.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I'd say on Modelo Especial, distribution of Modelo Especial is probably 30% to 40% less than distribution on Corona, right? And we firmly believe that Modelo Especial is the next Corona. So we still think there's considerable upside both from bottles and cans and draft. We're also extremely underpenetrated in the draft industry. Generally speaking, draft comprises about 10% of the domestic guys' sales. It's less than 2% for us. So we think there's a lot of opportunity, and Modelo Especial on draft is fantastic. So we're probably in the third or fourth inning on Especial.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And Modelo Light, any update there?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Modelo Light is being tested in one market. And we're still tweaking the product to better align with consumers' desires, mostly right now around the bottle and the label. We think the beer itself is very good, but we're trying to get the package right. So we're still kind of, I'd say, tinkering with it.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just switching back to the comments on both the discontinued distribution of the cider and the changes in Canada, does that have a meaningful impact? Or can you kind of quantify the impact on sales going forward?
Robert P. Ryder: No, I mean, the cider was tiny. And the impairment charge has no impact on how you operate the business. It's kind of a theoretical Excel model calculation that, for us, resulted in a noncash charge and has no impact on how we run the business.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: So you've already been doing that in Canada, it's just the final charge to follow that up in terms of focus?
Robert P. Ryder: Correct. Right.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Torres with HSBC.
Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division: Just a follow-up on beer and one on wine also. On beer, I understand you're not ready or you don't want to reveal your pricing strategy. But when you mentioned the fact that pricing is sticking, just curious, is this something that you took earlier this year? It wasn't for the summer selling season, I assume. And with that said, now that the summer is over, do you think seeing what your competitors are doing, there is more room for pricing for the next quarter or 2?
Robert S. Sands: First of all, our pricing and pricing in the beer industry is typically taken right about now, right, October-ish. And as is publicly known, we sent out letters to our distributors with regard to our pricing. Generally, it's not that we're not revealing our pricing strategy. We've taken some pricing. We're focused on gaps. And we fully expect that we'll achieve the pricing that we've expected throughout the year.
Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division: So there is potential now that we're in October...
Robert S. Sands: We're not going to -- typically, pricing is largely taken once a year in beer. That's the answer to your question.
Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And if I could ask on wine also with respect to the impairment charge, we've seen some similar charges for some of your other brands, particularly within the value segment. So just curious to get the skew now of value versus premium, if there's the risk of more of these types of charges coming through, where we're kind of at the end of running the risk of more of these impairment charges.
Robert S. Sands: Yes, it has nothing to do with value versus premium. We don't take charges against specific brands. It's against the acquired business in Canada. And no, we don't expect to take any further impairment charges. And as I said, it's really related to our strategy in Canada. And it's about the fact that we have focused on parts of the business, which were not acquired, such as imports, which constitute 70% of the market and are a much higher gross profit margin than our domestic business, and therefore, don't really factor in as materially into the impairment charge versus some of our legacy business, which has been declining and we always anticipated would decline, such as kits, refreshments and some of the value part of the business, which were strategically haven't been focused on -- never been focused on. And basically, since the acquisition in 2006, as you know, we're only focused on our premium businesses in general. So it's really no surprise and not indicative in any way of how the Canadian business is, in fact, performing. It's an accounting artifice, in my opinion.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel.
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions also on Crown. One is it seems like there's been a favorable disconnect between retail transfer, your portfolio and depletion rates. And of course, we're looking at scanner data that's not capturing channels you're actually selling in. So is that a fair characterization? That's question one. And then question two, on the brand specifically of Corona, can you remind us of how it's structured in terms of seasonality? Summer, I think, remains the most important period. But it's because you've had success expanding the brand in other parts of the year, just give us some flavor for how that seasonality looks and what your plans are to try to sustain the lift in trend for that brand you saw over the summer.
Robert S. Sands: Yes. Mark, in terms of depletions and IRI, there's really not a disconnect. The IRI only constitutes about, I don't know, a little bit less than 50% of the market. It doesn't include the on-premise. The on-premise has been relatively weak in general across all alcoholic beverages. It's about 20% of the beer business. So that's one of the factors. And then I would say that it's really timing. I'd say that, in general, if you really look at it kind of channel-by-channel and figure out the waiting, there is not a disconnect between depletions and IRI. As to shipments, there is a bit of a disconnect, but that's a very -- it's a short-term issue and strictly related to timing of shipments, which you basically can't look at timing of shipments on a month-by-month basis, in that we can have different -- there can be different impacts on inventories and buy-ins and things to that effect in very short periods of time, say, September versus August. So we fully expect the normal taste to occur, which is that shipments and depletions will be equal for the year. So you shouldn't count on anything weird there either.
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Fair enough. And Corona?
Robert S. Sands: What was your question on Corona?
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Well, it's still a comparatively high volume in the summer season. But can you give us the sense of how it mapped out by the year and what your intentions are for sustaining the improvement we saw over the summer?
Robert P. Ryder: I'd say -- Mark, this is Bob. The beer business obviously is a summer business. But Christmas period is one of the higher periods for Corona because people tend to get better-quality products for their holiday parties, which tends to suit us. So we've had tremendous momentum in the summer. I wouldn't expect that to continue balance of year. But we think that the marketing that's in the marketplace right now, especially the beer cooler promotion has been incredibly powerful. We plan on rerunning the Feliz Navidad commercial at Christmas, which just year-after-year people just really love. And so we're expecting a pretty good balance of year. You'll be seeing, as Rob said, some Jon Gruden commercials. We'll be advertising with the NFL and with the NBA when they start out, right? But I wouldn't expect the current momentum to continue. It'll probably slow down a little bit, and it's -- I'll say it's in more off-season than the summer. Of course, our peak season starts with Cinco, right? We start a little bit earlier than everybody else and goes right through Labor Day, and then we cool down a little bit and then picks up again at Christmas.
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And can you -- that's very helpful. Can you comment rate of depletion growth in the month of September, what kind of trends you saw?
Robert P. Ryder: No. September, again what we see in September, right, remember we had some distributor unloading at the end of the quarter in August. So they'll start to replenish those inventories as they go into the fall season.
Robert S. Sands: September also had 1 extra selling day.
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it. Okay. One final question if I...
Robert S. Sands: So the depletions will be looking good in September. You'd adjust that back by 5% right there.
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Sure. One final one if I could. On wine, nice trend we've seen continuing here, the Focus Brands do better than the non-Focus Brands. But of course, that gap implies your non-Focus Brands are declining. You talked a little bit about that. Can you talk a little bit more about why the non-Focus Brands are declining at the rate they are? And when you might actually get to a point, where these non-Focus Brands are getting to just a scale level where the rate of decline is more likely to moderate?
Robert S. Sands: Well, I mean, I think that every large wine business has Focus Brands and non-Focus Brands, as well as the spirits companies have Focus Brands and non-Focus Brands as well. No, they're not going to get to a level where they become so marginalized that they don't make a significant contribution to the business. It's all about sort of balancing, I'll say, how you're utilizing your cash flows and your profits from their non-Focus Brands against building the business and creating growth in your Focus Brand portfolio. So yes, just sort of a normal business state for most of the large beverage alcohol companies actually across all 3 segments is that how we balance that. Crown is the unusual animal in that regard, right, because the Crown business is 100% Focus Brand. It's only got 8 brands in total, all growing, all Focus Brands. So that's very unusual, I mean, compared to anybody else. Basically in the whole beverage alcohol business, the big brewers all have big portfolios as you're well aware of. I'll call them non-Focus Brands or sub premiums, value-type products that they're employing the same kind of strategy against it. I just talked about spirits companies and for that matter, the 2 or 3 other large wine companies.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with ISI.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: A couple of things. Can you give us an update on your latest thinking in terms of, I don't know, quarter maybe or half year of when you'll be ready to start producing more volume at Piedras Negras?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. Robert, I think what we said was it's 3 years out, right, because the brewery now has 10 million hectoliter capacity. We plan to get it up to 20 million. But that's going to take about 3 years, and it's all going to kind of happen at once.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And in terms of timing there, obviously no change in that right now?
Robert P. Ryder: No change in that, no.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Second, and I know we've talked about it a lot and I know -- I understand the basic idea between the difference between shipments and depletions and timing differences. But this difference was a pretty big one. And I know last year, you mentioned that 200 to 400 basis points of your shipments last year were pulled in from the third quarter as distributors did a big buy-in ahead of price increases last year. I'm just -- I'm still a little bit puzzled. I mean, you're doing a price increase again this year, why there would be that big a difference and why there wouldn't be the same sort of pull on this year, so you wouldn't have that kind of a difference between shipments and depletions.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. This year, it's a little later, that's all.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So the price increase was later?
Robert S. Sands: So it's not a second quarter, you'll see it more in the third quarter.
Robert P. Ryder: The other thing, Robert, is last year, the price increase was really the first Crown had taken in 5 years. So I think there was a bit of newness to it. I think this year, there's -- people are a little bit more practiced at it.
Robert S. Sands: But you'll see it all straighten itself out over the second quarter.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: No, I understand that. I'm just trying to get a sense of the pattern. And did you...
Robert S. Sands: It's a little later, that's the point. And there was also some other, I'll say, fluctuations in our purchases and our shipments last year that are different than this year. But again it's going to straighten itself out, month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. You can't get too focused on it. It's something that was going to be strange from the year -- on a year -- throughout the year, I mean, we'd tell you, but there's nothing going on.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. So the price increase this year was just maybe a couple of weeks later?
Robert S. Sands: It wasn't later, but the buy-in was a little later.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in terms -- as you look at the Modelo brands that you can now bring into the U.S., any new thoughts in terms of particular brands? I think there was Leon and a couple of other ones that looked promising. And also just wanted you to comment, the big guys, there's this trend to increase ABV. It would be my guess that you really can't change the ABV of any of your existing brands that are part of the Modelo portfolio. Can you confirm that? And are there any other opportunities for you to introduce brands with higher ABV?
Robert S. Sands: First of all, we can make formula changes to our brands, but we have no intention at the current time of changing the ABV of any of our brands, not because we can't, but because we don't desire to. If you see what's going on with ABV, it's largely new products that are being introduced at a higher ABV; it's not that existing products are changing their ABV. So we wouldn't do that. And we'd be -- as far as new products or line extensions that we might consider some time for the future, different style of products that may or may not have a higher ABV, will certainly be on the table to look at, so...
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So let me just -- just so I get this right, you would be allowed to come out with a Corona XX at a 6% if you wanted to?
Robert P. Ryder: Absolutely.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citigroup.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I wanted to circle back, Rob, on your comment about bulk wine in the U.S. Given how much more bulk wine there is this year versus last, as you think about the pricing that you've been seeing in the value wine segment, does that put that pricing at risk, and then in turn put more pressure on your premium business?
Robert S. Sands: I don't think so. Value wines, you're talking about 2 producers, right, that produce most of the 5-liter bag-in-the-box, Gallo and The Wine Group. I mean, I don't think they're being highly influenced by the bulk wine market necessarily. It's probably fundamentally a nonstrategic business for them. But I don't know. And in terms of pricing in general in the wine market, I would say that the fact that supply is not as tight as it's been is interesting, but we don't -- just like the perceived tighter supply and the higher cost of goods sold from a few harvests ago didn't make much of a difference in pricing, I don't think it's going to make much of a difference in pricing going forward in premium plus either. You don't see wine pricing at retail fluctuate with perceived over or undersupply pretty much period in premium plus.
Operator: That was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any closing remarks.
Robert S. Sands: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. And needless to say, we are very excited about the fact that we've completed the consolidation of our new brewery in Mexico with our Crown commercial business. And I'm also very proud to have the team as an integral part of Constellation. We have very strong momentum for our beer business as we head into the second half of the year and our wine and spirits business is well positioned for a great holiday selling season. Our next quarterly call is scheduled after the New Year, so be sure to enjoy some of our excellent products during the upcoming holiday season. So thanks again, everyone, for your participation.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release, which has also been also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release in Constellation's SEC filings. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert S. Sands: Thanks, Patty. Before we get started, I'd like to thank those of you who attended our recent New York City Investors Meeting. I hope one of your key takeaways from that meeting is that we are definitely a new Constellation. The powerful combination of our existing wine and spirits business with our newly consolidated beer business, including our New Mexican brewery and the other 50% of Crown, adds an entirely new dimension to our company, one that adds size and scale and provides new avenues for growth. Since the closing of the beer deal less than a month ago, we have experienced a smooth transition for our new brewery in Mexico. Our beer supply chain is operating efficiently as we continue to make and move beer. And we are fully engaged in working collaboratively with all brewery employees, including the operations team in Mexico. Overall, we're off to a good start for the year on all fronts, with results that were generally in line with all of our expectations. During the first quarter, our U.S. wine and spirits business continue to gain marketplace momentum, posting strong consumer takeaway growth of 9% versus category growth of 3% in IRI channels. In terms of consumer takeaway by market channel, Constellation's wine portfolio outperformed the category overall due to solid growth across every channel. Overall, we continue to benefit from continuing consumer trade-up trends, distribution gains at retail and contributions from our brand-building efforts, with our Focus Brands depletions growing at more than double the rate of our total portfolio during the quarter. Now I'd like to take a moment to highlight some of our key brand-building initiatives that were executed during the first quarter, including accolades received for some of our popular wines and spirits. The Dreaming Tree, which is one of our most successful new brand introductions to date, launched an everyday White Blend named after a song made famous by Dave Matthews. It is the perfect companion to the Crush Red Blend that was introduced last year. Building on the success of their frozen wine cocktails, Arbor Mist expanded and launched frozen spirits-style cocktails, including strawberry daiquiri, piña colada and lime margarita. Wine Enthusiasts recently awarded 90-plus points scores to several Ravenswood designate series Zinfandel wines. And the Robert Mondavi 2010 Napa Valley Fume Blanc recently received 91 points and the best buy accolade from Wine & Spirits Magazine. The month of June was dedicated to Robert Mondavi as heritage month as we celebrate his legacy and the 100th anniversary of his birth. Throughout the month, we featured special sales promotions, marketing campaigns and events for Robert Mondavi wines in an effort to celebrate his great contributions to the wine world, including many fine winemaking techniques and the creation of marketing and educational innovations that enhance the worldwide reputation of Napa Valley and California wines. We recently achieved an important milestone within our wine business by becoming the #1 wine producer and exporter of New Zealand wines with our award-winning portfolio of brands, including Kim Crawford, Nobilo and Monkey Bay. Throughout the last 52 weeks, these brands posted strong double-digit growth trends in the IRI channels. During the quarter, Kim Crawford also had the distinction of reaching the 1 million case mark in global sales over a 12-month period. From the spirits perspective, during the first quarter, both SVEDKA Vodka and Black Velvet Canadian Whisky posted double-digit consumer takeaway trends in IRI channels in addition to gaining market share of their respective market categories. Just in time for Memorial Day celebrations, we released SVEDKA Stars & Stripes 2, our limited-edition 1.75 liter party bottle, which will certainly come in handy for this week's 4th of July celebrations. SVEDKA has become the #2 imported vodka and the #3 vodka overall in the U.S. It also recently moved up to #7 on Impact magazine's list of top 10 distilled spirits brands in the U.S. We also recently launched the new Black Velvet Cinnamon Rush, which can be enjoyed straight, on the rocks or blended in a handcrafted cocktail and is priced at a premium versus our base Black Velvet brand. The cinnamon flavor category in whisky is currently on fire, experiencing triple-digit growth trends. Moving to Crown Imports in our beer business. For the first quarter of 2014, Crown posted its 13th consecutive quarter of share gains and outperformance of the total U.S. beer industry and imported beer category, gaining almost 1 point of volume share of the import category. This was the result of excellent execution during the Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays. Modelo Especial continues to be the shining star of the portfolio, posting double-digit sales in depletion growth trends during the quarter. Collectively, Corona Extra and the entire Modelo portfolio posted depletion trends that exceeded the overall U.S. beer market in the first quarter, benefiting from increased marketing investments, which include: Corona Extra launched 4 new Find Your Beach advertisements, reinforcing Corona's leadership position, demonstrating that finding your beach can be a state of mind, as well as a physical place. Corona Light also launched a new advertising campaign during the quarter that encourages consumers to trade up from domestic lights. You may remember some of these spots that we showed at our recent Investor Meeting featured the talking sheep, which encouraged consumers to ditch the herd. Overall, this brand is outpacing the imported light category in IRI channels. Following Cinco activities, we launched the "Live it. Share it. Win it." summer promotion for Corona Extra and Corona Light, which is supported by new TV and digital spots. Modelo Especial has new creative for both Hispanic and general market consumers that plays to the beer's authenticity. Collectively, the initiatives I have just outlined contributed to Crown's strong marketplace momentum as the business grew depletions by approximately 3% in the first quarter despite a difficult comparison overlap from last year's first quarter. Throughout the remainder of the year, Crown plans to launch Modelo Especial Chelada by early fall, which is expected to build in the brand strength of Modelo Especial. This product will tap into a new occasion with this brand's core Hispanic consumer. Crown is planning draft format expansions for Corona Light, Negra Modelo and Pacifico in select markets. Corona Light will also sponsor Kenny Chesney's 2013 U.S. tour, leveraging Kroger as the strategic retail partner through its Rhythms & Brews program. Pacifico will debut its first TV ads in Southern California. The new Pacifico, discovered in Baja, imported by surfers, campaign includes several TV ads that celebrate the brand's surfing origins and adventure-seeking consumers. And finally, during fiscal 2014, chef Rick Bayless will work with Crown to promote Negra Modelo, Pacifico and Victoria, creating recipes and unique food pairing options for each brand that can be leveraged at retail. In closing, from an operational perspective, we are off to a positive start for the year, gaining market share across our beer, wine and spirits businesses in IRI channels. I am particularly pleased that we have closed the beer deal and that a smooth transition is underway at our new brewery in Mexico. As you know, we have been working diligently to build a solid and sustainable foundation of operational excellence, financial strength and innovation, and we expect to continue in these areas throughout the remainder of the year. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our first quarter results.
Robert P. Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q1 came in at $0.38. At a high level, this result was generally in line with our expectations, and we are reiterating, or in the case of EPS, improving our full year guidance. We're pleased with our marketplace results as our wine, spirits and beer businesses continue to gain share in IRI for the quarter from our brand-building investments, innovation efforts and retail execution. For Q1, sales growth did not translate to higher EBIT due primarily to some timing items. In a few moments, I will highlight some additional timing and comparison impacts for Q2. As a result, we expect this year's profit growth to be generated in the back half of the year. Given those highlights, let's look at Q1 performance in more detail quarter, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 4%, primarily due to higher shipment volume. We saw shipments outpace depletions in the quarter as our U.S. domestic depletion volume growth was a little above 2%. In Q2, we expect this shipment benefit to reverse, and we expect depletion growth to be quite a bit higher than Q1. As a reminder, from time-to-time, we will see fluctuations in growth trends between shipments and depletions on a quarter-over-quarter basis due to various factors like timing of new product introductions and promotional activities. But from an overall standpoint, we continue to expect shipments and depletions to generally align on an annual basis. The acquisition of Mark West provided contribution to our total growth as total net sales for the quarter increased 6%. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 38.3% versus 39.6% for the prior year quarter. This reflect -- this result reflects an increase in COGS, driven primarily by higher grape cost. Wine and spirits segment operating income decreased $5 million to $128 million as sales growth was more than offset by the impact of higher grape and SG&A costs. The increase in SG&A was in line with our expectations and reflects compensation increases and commercial investments in the business. We expect to continue to see higher SG&A as we move through the year from this activity, along with planned marketing investment behind initiatives for some of our key focus brands. Corporate costs increased less than $1 million for the quarter. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $66 million versus $61 million last year. For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $762 million, an increase of 5%; and operating income of $134 million, an increase of 9%. The net sales and operating increase was primarily driven by volume growth, led by strong double-digit growth of Modelo Especial and the benefit of increased product pricing taken in select U.S. markets last fall. Interest expense for the quarter was $55 million, up 8% versus last year. The increase was primarily due to higher average debt balances. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position, which saw quite a bit of activity during Q1 related to the financing of the beer transaction. At the end of May, our total debt was just over $5 billion. This represents a $1.8 billion increase from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2013. The increase reflects some of the permanent financing that was executed in May in advance of the completion of the $4.75 billion beer business acquisition that closed on June 7th. This included $500 million of 3.75% senior notes due in 2021, $1 billion of 4.25% senior notes due 2023 and about $221 million drawn from our accounts receivables securitization and other revolving facilities. We funded the remainder of the purchase price with cash, term loans and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which were not drawn or utilized until after the close of the first quarter. The timing of this financing activity could not have been better. Our improved credit profile, combined with the favorable interest rate environment, helped us put in place an attractive financing package with an all-in interest rate just under 3%. This was better than our original expectations. And as a result, we now expect interest expense for the year to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million versus our original $345 million to $355 million projection. We still do not have full visibility to the timing of the brewery cash flows, and the current interest rate outlook remains quite volatile. Right now, this is our best estimate. We also finished May with $609 million of cash on our balance sheet and a little over $1.5 billion of restricted cash. The higher-than-normal cash balance primarily relates to the building funds and drawing against our AR securitization facility for the beer acquisition activities. The restricted cash relates the senior note issuances I just outlined. After factoring in the cash and restricted cash, our net debt at the end of May was $2.9 billion, and our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio came in at about 3.2x. Our comparable base effective tax rate came in at 36.2% for Q1, and this was essentially even with the prior year Q1 rate. Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we used $19 million of free cash flow, which compares to $77 million of free cash flow generation for Q1 of last year. The decrease was primarily due to funding beer transaction-related costs, higher interest expense payments and the impact of GAAP reporting on equity-based compensation. Our cash flow statement reflects excess cash benefits realized from stock benefit compensation awards as a reduction of cash from operating activities, offset by a benefiting cash from financing activities. So for the quarter, there is no net impact to our cash position, but there is a negative impact on our reported free cash flow. This is not a new reporting requirement, but it is noteworthy this quarter as we have seen a significant number of option exercises, given the substantial appreciation in our stock price over the past year. While the accounting and reporting for this area is very technical, the tax benefit associated with this activity ultimately reduces the income taxes paid by the company. Now let's move to our full year fiscal 2014 outlook. We're now forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.90 a share. This represents a $0.05 increase versus our previous guidance and is being driven by the lower interest expense projection I outlined earlier. This projection excludes any acquisition accounting impact. We continue to forecast free cash flow in the range of $475 million to $575 million. For our wine and spirits business, we continue to target organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range and low to mid-single digit operating income growth. For the beer business, Crown continues to target depletions and net sales growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. Operating income for Crown before any benefits from beer manufacturing and brand right profits is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range. We do not have any updates to our previous discussions related to the fiscal '14 incremental benefits that we are targeting from the beer manufacturing and brand rights profit stream. Our guidance also continues to assume a tax rate of 37% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 199 million. I would like to note that from a gaining perspective, we expect fiscal 2014 Q2 EBIT performance for wine and spirits to come in below Q2 of fiscal 2013. As mentioned earlier, we saw shipments in Q1 outpace depletions, and we expect this shipment benefit to reverse in Q2. We also expect a portion of our planned incremental marketing investments for some of our key Focus Brands to occur in Q2. From a Crown perspective, this is before any brewery or brand owner benefits, we expect operating growth in Q2 to be flattish versus Q2 last year. We are overlapping Q2 fiscal 2013 income from an early termination payment related to the St. Pauli Girl distribution agreement. We also expect an increase in marketing expense in Q2 as marketing spend that historically occurred in the back half of the year is shifted into Q2 to further support the key summer selling season. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the release. The onetime costs associated with the beer transaction are expected to approximate $80 million in fiscal 2014. This includes approximately $50 million, primarily related to professional services and transition costs associated with the transaction, and $30 million of costs for financing-related fees. I would like to emphasize that the onetime costs and tax rate projections factored into the guidance I just highlighted are based on preliminary estimates. As noted earlier, our guidance excludes any acquisition accounting impact. While the purchase price allocation and acquisition accounting activities are underway, I would like to note that the disclosures related to this area in our upcoming 10-Q filing will be preliminary and subject to finalization. The initial purchase price for the beer transaction is $4.75 billion. This includes $1.85 billion for the remaining interest in Crown and $2.9 billion for the brewery and perpetual brand rights. As previously discussed, we estimate there will be a post-closing adjustment payment of approximately $560 million related to the brewery EBITDA calculation. This payment is expected to occur about 12 months after close. The purchase price allocation is expected to result in a significant increase in goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. This includes a significant noncash gain from the revaluation of our original 50% ownership interest in Crown to reflect the newly established fair market value. This gain is essentially nontaxable. And as a result, we expect this accounting requirement to result in a very low reported effective tax rate for the year. Before we take your questions, I would like to reiterate a few key highlights as it relates to the completion of the beer transaction. This is truly transformational for us as it diversifies our consumer base, essentially doubles annual sales and significantly enhances operating profits and operating margins. The brewery expansion activities over the next 3 years should position us for additional beer margin enhancement opportunities. Although our leverage will move above 5x range when factoring in a full year of acquisition earnings, we expect to focus on debt paydown to delever at a good pace, and we expect to be below 4x in approximately 2 years. As we delever and complete the brewery expansion, we expect to see a dramatic increase in our free cash flow generation. This should provide us with significant financial and capital allocation flexibility. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit on the grape cost, both in the quarter and kind of looking forward. And when I'm looking at gross margin, was the decline year-over-year almost all because of the higher grape cost or was there a higher promotion? And then would you expect this type of impact throughout 2014 or should it ease as we get to the back end?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so I'll take that in pieces. So the grape cost flowing through the cost of goods sold this year are pretty much as expected, right, as we -- because the last 2 harvests in California, specifically the cost per ton had gone up, though that juice will be flowing through our cost of goods sold over the next year to 2. So the cost of goods sold is up. But to your point, for the quarter, promotion spending was up a bit, mostly due to some of the timing of the shipments versus depletions. For the full year, we don't expect promotion spending to be up except for the impact of positive mix. So do we do expect cost of goods sold to be up for the year, and that was part of our guidance. We do not expect promotion spending on a mix adjusted basis to be up for the full year, but we did have a reasonable amount of quarter-over-quarter volatility.
William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just on the beer side, was there any impact in terms of weather on the overall top line? And then have you seen any change as weather has improved in the summer?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so that's a great question. And we're very happy with our beer results. We outpaced the industry again for the 13th consecutive quarter. That being said, our results on the East Coast and in the Midwest were not very good because the weather for the spring has actually been very wet and very cold, and that's overlapping the previous year, where the weather was actually beyond ideal. So the whole beer industry had a very good first quarter last year. This year, we're all kind of suffering. We're not unique in that. But in general, we're doing better than most. And we're hoping for better weather as we come into the peak summer season, which is right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I wanted to circle back on the commentary about the reversals in terms of the shipments and depletions. I guess, I was a little surprised to hear that you get a full reversal in the second quarter. Because it looks like in the wine business, your shipments have been running ahead of depletions for 4 or 5 quarters now. It wasn't just kind of a 1Q '14 event. So can you dig a little deeper into that?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Vivien, the quarter-over-quarter thing gets a little confusing and complicated to describe, especially when you're talking changes, right, because you have to take 2 years activities into account. But the way we look at it is there is volatility quarter-over-quarter, but it kind of clears up on an annual basis. So I think if you go back and look at last year, for the full fiscal year, shipments and depletions were pretty much in line, actually they have been for the last few years. But the quarter volatility does exist.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Fair enough. And then I wanted to follow up on Bill's question about promotional spending. As I look at -- and I don't have the IRI data that you guys note. I'm using Nielsen AOC. But it looks to me that after significant easing in category level promotional spending, that's really kind of eased off and actually picked up recently. So I'm curious whether you're seeing that on a category basis in IRI, if you're seeing a shift in promotional spending from your competitive set.
Robert P. Ryder: We feel we're spending in line with the industry. Again, a lot of our growth is coming out of the premium IRI segment, right, and we're making a concerted effort to get behind some of our brands there. And we're certainly spending more of our money on Focus Brands. But I think Q1 wouldn't be reflective of what we expect for the full year, especially when you look at some year-over-year indices.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: I have a follow-up question on the difference between depletions and shipments in wine and spirits. I think you said in the second quarter, your depletions would improve significantly from up 2%, so I guess maybe up 4% or something like that. Could you, first of all, comment on why that improves? And then if there's a reversal, does that mean your shipments are up 2%?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. And again, it can drive you a little bit crazy quarter-over-quarter. So the second quarter will kind of even out some of the anomalies in the first quarter because there'll be a reversal of the trends. So shipment growth, right, will be a lot less than depletion growth in the second quarter, which was the opposite in the first quarter. And again, for the full year, they should align. So our income statement is driven off shipment growth, which is why we said that the wine and spirits business will see profits in the second quarter below the second quarter of last year.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And why do depletions accelerate?
Robert P. Ryder: So again, they just happen in different cadences, right, so depletions will accelerate. Some of it will do what happen with last year's second quarter. But the other will be as we gear up going into October, November, December, right, we expect to have better depletion results in the second quarter.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And why does depletion get better? Is it just the timing of your marketing?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, this is Rob. What really happens is that at the end of the fourth quarter, or I should say the fourth quarter, we had very, very, very strong depletions. That tends to mute depletion growth in the first quarter of this year as the inventory from -- at retail from the fourth quarter moves through. That moves through during the first quarter and, therefore, the second quarter we usually see bounce back to our normal depletion trends of -- at least around mid-single-digit depletion growth. So fourth quarter, we had very high depletion growth, almost double digit. First quarter, we have lower depletion growth, low-single digits. Next quarter, we return to sort of our normal run rate.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. I mean, I suppose, in the second quarter, your depletions could be up 6% and your shipments still up 4%. Right?
Robert S. Sands: In the second quarter, you're saying?
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Yes.
Robert S. Sands: Yes, we're not going to comment on the exact numbers, which, of course, we don't know at this moment.
Robert P. Ryder: But remember, from a shipment perspective, right, we said that shipment growth over prior year will drive negative EBIT in the second quarter. So I wouldn't expect shipment growth in the second quarter.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: All right. No shipment growth at all?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, again, we're -- let's move on because we're kind of filling out economic models. We're just trying to do a favor giving some hints on second quarter. [indiscernible]
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And can you comment on price mix in the wine business in the first quarter? I think your volume was up 5.4 and your price mix was a negative 1.4, and why would that be since...
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, that's a good question. So again, in the first quarter, we had some anomalies. I'd say price mix in the U.S. business, which usually really drives the bus, was slightly positive, okay? So that -- and if you look at the wine category, the trend continues, generally, the more expensive the wine, the faster it's growing. That was kind of consistent for us. But the anomaly in the first quarter was actually we had some negative price mix outside of the U.S., which it's normally not big enough to have an impact, but this quarter, because the first quarter's our smallest quarter and because it was a bit anomalous in -- mostly it was Canada and New Zealand, it kind of impacted the total business. Again, we don't expect that to be a full year phenomenon, which is a kind of anomalous first quarter event. So most of the negative price mix, actually all the negative price mix was outside of the United States.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And then my final question is on the beer category in the May quarter. Can you tell us what you think the growth was and when it was on premise as opposed to future consumption?
Robert S. Sands: Yes. In the first quarter, the total beer category was down in volume terms about 1%, 1.5% versus our depletions, which, in the first quarter, were up 3%. In general, the trends in on-premise are worse than the trends in off-premise. It's hard to know exactly what the on-premise trends are because they're not tracked. So we don't know exactly what those numbers are, except that we expect that they're probably, as I said, worse in the on-premise than in the off-premise. Now as it relates to the beer business overall, the negative trends were largely driven by the domestic premium segment, which, of course, is dominated by the light premium beers of the 2 major brewers of domestic brands in the United States. The import category generally outperformed the domestic category. We represent about half of the import category, and as I said in my remarks, we gained about 1 point or 100 basis points of share of the import category, and we gained about around 20 basis points or so of the overall beer business in the United States. So generally, those are the trends.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research.
Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: A couple of questions. On the wine business, you talked about the incremental, I guess, SG&A. I don't know if you're willing to give this, but I mean, how much are we talking that, that part of the wine business should be up in fiscal '14?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so the numbers that you see in SG&A are a combination of SG&A and marketing, right? And for the full year, we expect marketing to be up as we reinvest in the -- in mostly, the commercial activities, right, and mostly marketing spend. But SG&A would be up as well. The big drivers are normal raises, okay? They're kind of CPI inflation kind of numbers as we come off -- as we fully capitalize our ERP system, we have some increased depreciation around that. And then there's some overlaps from positives we incurred last year that aren't recurring this year that make SG&A looks like it's inflating, but it's really not. It's just overlapping anomalous positives in the previous year. They're the 3 big drivers for the SG&A increase.
Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: And so would you -- I mean, I don't want to put numbers in your mouth, but would you say, I mean mid-single digits, would that be off base to make that sort of assumption for that part of the business?
Robert P. Ryder: No, I mean you can see it in the P&L, right? I think SG&A was up like 7%, 8%, something like that, I think, in the P&L.
Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: I'm sorry, I was talking for the full year, not for the first quarter, how much it normalizes over the back end of the year?
Robert P. Ryder: I would say that the full year will be a little bit less, but pretty much right around where the first quarter was.
Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Okay. And then, I guess an unrelated topic, throughout the quarter, we've gotten an announcement on the wine in Brazil and SVEDKA, I think it was, whatever, it was yesterday or last week in South Korea. Can you just talk about sort of the strategy there? Are we likely to see more and more of this in the near future? Is this kind of a much longer build?
Robert S. Sands: Well, when you say more of this, what we announced in both cases was the appointment of new distributors. So around the world, whenever we appoint a new distributor for our brand, and these were just changes, so we've distributed in our brands with another distributor prior to this, whenever we appoint a new one, we usually issue a release indicating who our new customer is. So you'll continue to see, as we make adjustments in our distributions matrix, you'll see announcements announcing who our distributors are around the world. So that's really the sole import of all this. Now, as a general proposition, yes, we continue to focus on building our business in regions and countries around the world. We basically distribute every place in the world, largely. And as our brands build momentum, we make adjustments in that distributorship network, and these announcements sort of are fairly reflective of that. Brazil is a fairly bouyant market for imports so, of course, we're relatively optimistic about that business on a small base. So is South Korea, but again, on a very small base.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Torres with HSBC.
Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division: My question goes back to the Beer business. We've heard a lot over the last couple of years of you gaining share and Modelo portfolio growing faster than the U.S. beer industry. But with that said, during that time period, you've not taken pricing or now, we're seeing some minimal pricing coming through. So just curious to get your thoughts on the ability to take more pricing, are you willing to give up some volume and take that pricing? Or you think the market's just not ready to accept that yet?
Robert S. Sands: Well, first of all, Lauren, last year, we took about 2% of pricing, which is, on a percentage basis, lower than the industry, but on a dollar basis, pretty much consistent with what the rest of the industry did, right? Because you remember, our price for our product is substantially higher than the industry, in general. So on nominal terms, the same price increase results in a lower percentage for us versus the rest of the industry. So 2% was pretty healthy. That's point number one. Yes, prior to that, there was a period of time for a few years where we really didn't take much pricing because the focus of the business was largely against making sure that we maintained and, in fact, build market share following the recession of 2008, early 2009. As far as our plans going forward, we expect to continue to monitor what's going on in the industry in general, and we take a very strategic view towards pricing and really look at it on a market-by-market, brand-by-brand basis. And we're going to have to wait and see what happens with the rest of the industry as we move forward, but it looks like, up to now at least, pricing's been pretty healthy in the rest of the industry. So I suppose stay tuned for -- we'll see what happens.
Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division: Yes. And I guess as a follow-up, and I guess you did address this at your Analyst Day, but now that you're 100% owners of the Beer business, I know this is a very broad question, but any comments you'd like to make as far as things that may be done differently in beer that you may have not been able to do with a partner that you're excited about that could bring a great opportunity over the next couple of years?
Robert S. Sands: Sure. Well, probably the biggest area that we're excited about is the opportunities for innovation and new product development. With the ownership of our own production, we can produce new packages and new types that previously we were entirely reliant upon the consent of Modelo to produce. And generally, they didn't really want to do much in the way of innovation, new products, new packages, new types. No less, new brands. So we're doing a lot of thinking about what our NPD and innovation pipeline will be in the future. We already are taking advantage of it. We've intro-ed or we're test marketing, Modelo Especial Lite. We are introducing Modelo Especial Chelada, which is a Bloody Mary style beer, which is actually a pretty large category in the United States. It's dominated entirely by one other supplier, so we see a lot of opportunity there. We are introducing new SKUs in drafts that we haven't previously had. So the primary area where we can really kind of do something different than what we have historically done is in the area of innovation and NPD.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a question about the wine business. If you look at, I guess, 5 or 6 quarters ago, you made the decision to ramp up or increase your marketing and promotional investment with the aim of holding or gaining market share, which you've been successful at. And I guess when you look at it, where you stand today, are you happy with the return on a net -- on that investment, first? And then now going forward, you feel like you have the right balance between spending on new product innovation, spending on advertising and marketing, and spending on promotion, or will there be any sort of tweaks to that mix going forward?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, I think that certainly, right now, we feel like we have the right mix of those items. And yes, we have been successful in driving share. Our goal is not just to drive share. I'll say as a complete and total end goal, it's really about making sure that our brands are healthy so that we can take advantage of trends as they emerge. Now, as we move forward in the future, I am sure, in fact, we will tweak the mix between those things. And of course, in the end, our goal is to drive profitability and margins, but we really have to make sure, first and foremost, that the top line is healthy before we could turn our attention to that. So we'll definitely continue to tweak the mix between those things, and especially as we sort of monitor what's going on in the industry as we move into our next fiscal year and thereafter.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And if I could just follow up, if you look at the industry, the dynamic that's played out over the last year or so is that you've had -- the industry has been pricing at the value end of the category where you don't really participate. But I -- our impression is that helped maybe drive some mix benefit, drive consumers into the next price tiers. Just based on what you're seeing today, has anything changed in that dynamic? Is there still firm pricing at the value end of the category? And would you expect that to continue?
Robert S. Sands: Not much has changed. The pricing is almost all at the low end, but that's not the surprising because the low end is the least fragmented part of the category, dominated largely by 2 suppliers. It has very much impacted the volume growth in the low end, so the pricing was not without some impact on volume, actually, fairly significant. It has driven some trade up. We are seeing more pricing, I suppose, at the top end sort of above $15, $20 as wine supplies, especially in the above $20 category, which is largely the North Coast Sonoma/Napa wine supplies have been very tight up there. So there has been some pricing there. The, I'll say, more commercial part of the business between $5 and $15 is much more fragmented, so we tend not to see pricing occur in that category or in that -- those segments as quickly as it occurs in the other 2 segments, but I would say, over time, we probably expect to see some pricing start hitting in those categories. And we have seen it in some specific brands. We've seen some pricing being taken, and some specific suppliers have taken some pricing in that category. But I would say not overall as a general proposition.
Operator: Your next question is coming from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.
John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just a quick question here. You talked about the on-premise being a little bit weaker for the Beer business, and one of the things you're focusing on with Corona Light is more of a draft presence than getting tap handles. So does this change and do we need to see the on-premise reaccelerate before we see the payoff on this? Or is this something where you think you've got enough momentum behind the brand that even if on-premise remains a little bit weak, you can still drive some decent growth off of that?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, we are -- in our business, draft is a very, very, very small percentage of our business, about 2%, yes. Well, for us, it's even less -- I'm sorry, it's even less than 2%. But for the industry overall, it's a much higher percentage, so we under index grossly when it comes to draft. So regardless basically of what happens on the on-premise as an overall proposition, because we're so under indexed, it's a big opportunity for us. Now, that said, the strategy on draft is really all about providing the opportunity on, on premise for sampling of our products, and -- which translates directly into off premise volume and sales growth. So I don't think that the opportunity there has much to do with what's going on in the on-premise in general at all. It's all about we have traditionally just simply not participated in this segment. So the growth opportunity is quite substantial for us even without the on-premise generally growing.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, John. The on-premise, as Rob said, is not growing. We feel we are growing in the on premise in our Beer business, right? As Rob said, the numbers aren't really like incredibly nuclear, but we feel we're growing pretty well in draft. Draft is helping it, and actually, we have some tests that said when draft is on the account and people can see the tap handle, they'll actually also buy the bottle brand as well, right? So it's kind of synergistic in that way.
John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then one sort of quick follow-up here. You talked about the wine EBIT being below last year. Shipments below depletions, is the margins -- should we expect the margins to be down sort of a similar amount in Q2 versus Q1 roughly similar from that standpoint?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so we would expect margin erosion again in the second quarter because remember, I said that our profit growth is back-end weighted, right? So I don't think we'll see the -- for the full year, our guidance is for margin erosion in the wine and spirits business because we have operating profit growth estimated below net sales growth. But I think you're seeing an anomalously negative margin in the front half, which will start to come back in the second half of the year.
John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. So -- but Q2 probably somewhat similar to Q1 though?
Robert P. Ryder: Probably.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with ISI.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Guys, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what you think is driving incredibly strong beer performance. I mean last year, everything went right. I mean the weather was amazing, I mean you've -- the timing of the holidays was great. You had incredibly difficult comps. This year, the weather couldn't have been worse. I mean as you tread objectively, kind of look back in terms of what you're doing right in the marketplace on an execution side and marketing side, can you give us any sense of what you think is driving these incredibly impressive results on the beer side?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Robert. Thank you for that complement. I hope everybody heard that. I hope our Beer business guys heard that. But look, if you talk brands, right, the current juggernaut is Modelo Especial. And it continues -- it's above 40 million cases, which is a substantial brand, and it continues to grow on the 20% range. So I think that's the big buy brand section. I think the other thing that's happening is the import category's doing better than premiums or the sub-premiums, that's helping. And I think our marketing continues to resonate with the consumer, and the strong equity continues to resonate with the consumer. And very good sales execution. So I'd say not any one thing. One brand is clear, it is Modelo Especial. And then it's good execution around everything else.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Terrific. And Bob, as you continue to have more conversations with your leading retail customers about the new shape of your portfolio and kind of the increased importance of your portfolio at a lot of the retailers, can you give us any sense of how those discussions are going, whether you think you now have, obviously, a bigger seat at the table, you'll have more shelf space possibly going forward? Any color around that?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, Robert. We definitely have a bigger seat at the table. As I've commented before, total beverage alcohol is probably the most important category at retail, especially in the chain and mass merchandisers environment. And as one of the largest multi-category players or the largest multi-category player and third largest category player overall, that puts us on a very important position. So our conversations with these retailers are good, and we hope to translate our position into a better position in these retailers. So that's something that we're always working on and yes, we're making progress. We have increased points of distribution in both wine, spirits and beer. So we think that we should be seeing continued favorable trends as a result of this.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Terrific. And then just one last question. Can you give us an update on where you see kind of currency potentially affecting results this year? And are you doing any hedging of any of your peso-based costs? How should we be thinking about that in the second half of the year?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so we do, do hedging. We hedge currencies and we hedge fuel prices, are currently what we're hedging. We do not yet hedge the peso because we don't have enough data from the new business to enter into those contracts. We are looking at it, and I would expect us to start hedging the peso as we go forward. The dollar's strengthened versus the peso, but it's been very volatile. And so we're keeping our eye on it. Right now, it looks better than it did a month ago, but again, it's very volatile. Of course, the euro and dollar is very volatile as well, that's our other big exposure. And we're also hedging fuel prices, which actually, for us, and it's all around freight, is a bigger number than our exposure to currencies, okay? So I think that's what we look at going forward.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Sure. And just, I mean, so I just want to make sure I get this right. So any decrease in the peso is going to lower your cost, so that would be a benefit. Am I right about that?
Robert P. Ryder: That's correct, yes. Because we...
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And can you give us like, I don't know, for a 10% decrease roughly on an annualized basis, what that could mean?
Robert P. Ryder: No, it would -- I'm not going to give those numbers because, frankly, we're still investigating. But actually, we're not as exposed to the peso as you might think, mostly because if you go back through the myriad of contracts that we have, where the beer that we do not make, we're buying in dollars from InBev, right? So that's a big thing. Natural gas is generally priced in dollars. Natural gas fuels the plants. In addition, most of the global beer input costs, malt, barley, things like that, are also paid for in dollars. It's kind of like oil. So really, the big exposure we have in pesos is the cash cost at the facility, which is mostly labor costs, right? That's our exposure, which isn't as big as you would think it would be because remember how automated this facility is. So yes, we have peso exposure. It's not as big as you might think.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the question that we had at the Investor Day on the packaging side, and you had mentioned that there was a new packaging bottling plant that was being built in Piedras Negras, how far along is that plant in terms of -- is that plant actually in operation now? And if not, when do you think it will be operational? My understanding is, I guess, if ABI was to sell, that you have right of first refusal. Can give us any color around that situation?
Robert P. Ryder: We -- that's InBev's plant, so we don't have any insights to it. But we currently aren't sourcing any glass from that, and that's really not on our radar screen right now.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. But it is in operation now?
Robert S. Sands: No. To my knowledge, it is not in operation currently.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Mullarkey with Morningstar.
Thomas Mullarkey - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: I have a follow-up on John's question concerning draft beer. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned the rollouts in a few select markets. Are there currently supply-chain bottlenecks or strategic reasons why you don't want to do a more broad scale rollout of tap handles across America? And how do you foresee the mix of draft beer for you changing over the next 3 to 5 years? Will it be a steady creep-up or will it be a kind of a stair-step change once the bulk of the brewery expansion is done?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, no, there's not -- there's really no, I would say, overall supply chain issues other than just getting the supply chain for draft beer on a large scale up and going, is a relatively complicated process because it involves producing a lot more or having a lot more kegs than you need. It involves having the infrastructure in place for delivering kegs and having kegs returned and so on and so forth. So there's no issue, and we will continue to build the business. I would say it's going to be, as opposed to like a gigantic step change, I think it will be a slower change as we continue to build the business from where we are currently, which is about 2 million cases out of 170 million. So I said 2% is actually closer to 1% to more of the industry average, which is around 10%. So it will be a slow build. Obviously, that's a lot of draft beer as we build towards those numbers. But our intention is to continue to build the business, and we are putting the infrastructure in place. And as we continue to -- as we build out the Piedras Negras brewery, we'll be doing so, making sure that we have that capacity in mind.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so just to follow up on Rob, our draft business is doubling, still small but doubling. This is logistically complex, but also, remember, we're trying to be very selective with the accounts that we go into. So we're at a higher end, mostly on our draft, right? So we might not get the full distribution that maybe a Bud Light or Coors Light will because we'll be a little bit more selective. But we're very happy with the progress so far, and I think it's a slow build, but I'll take a slow build if it's a doubling of the business every year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel.
Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: This is Jesse Reinherz in for Mark. So a question on the SG&A spend. Sounds like we're going to see more of an uptick in marketing in 2Q than we saw in Q1. And then that's going to kind of level out in 3 or 4Q, you're going to be a little bit less than we saw in Q2. Is that correct?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, we're just trying to give you a hint towards Q2, so we're -- I'm not going to get into like quarterly guidance stuff on marketing spend. But marketing spend in Q1 was below prior year, and for the full year, it's going to be above prior year. Yes, so you'd expect balance of the year to be higher.
Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just on the decision to kind of take up marketing in second quarter, and I guess, beyond. Is this more of a proactive move or is this a symptom of you guys seeing increasing competition in wine and kind of trying to get behind that?
Robert P. Ryder: No, it's nothing. I'd say in beer, it's maybe more conscious to move some marketing spend into the second quarter. It's probably a little bit of a bigger bet on baseball and probably driving some of our Hispanic marketing. And in wine, it's more just I don't think we're that anomalous from prior years, we're just increasing total marketing spending in wine. It just so happened that Q1 was a little bit lighter and that the balance of the year will be heavier than prior year.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just one quick finance question. You mentioned you put the revolver in place to fund the acquisition. Can you just say how much you drew on it in the second quarter?
Robert P. Ryder: No, I'm not going to give second quarter balance sheet stuff, right? So we did draw on it to fund the acquisition, which happened like 7 days into the quarter.
Operator: That was our final question. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any closing remarks.
Robert S. Sands: Okay. Well, thanks for joining our call today. We are very excited about the final completion of the beer deal. We have great marketplace momentum across beer, wine and spirits, and we're on track to meet all our goals for the year. I hope you've had the opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products, especially the SVEDKA Stars and Stripes during the 4th of July holiday later this week. So thanks, again, for your participation.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Laurie, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2013 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert S. Sands: Thank you, Patty. And good morning, and welcome to our call. Before we begin our year-end review of fiscal 2013, I would like to mention that I am very excited about the fact that we have reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice, the finalization of which will allow Constellation to proceed with the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Crown Imports as well as the Piedras Negras brewery in Mexico and the perpetual brand rights for the Modelo portfolio in the U.S. Earlier this week, we received unanimous approval from the Mexican Antitrust Commission, which further paves the way to completion of the revised deal between ABI and Constellation. This transaction represents a significant milestone for Constellation, as it is the most transformational acquisition in the history of our company. It will solidify our place in the U.S. beer market for the long term as the perpetual brand owner and producer of the iconic Modelo beer portfolio, which includes Corona Extra, the best-selling imported beer; Corona Light, the leading imported light beer; and Modelo Especial, the third-largest and one of the fastest-growing major imported beer brands. Overall, this deal will allow us to nearly double the sales of our company, diversify our profit stream, significantly enhance our earnings and free cash flow and provide new avenues for growth. It will also reestablish Constellation's position as the largest multi-category supplier for beer, wine and spirits. We will not only be the third-largest total beverage alcohol company in the U.S. but the #3 brewer and supplier of beer for the U.S. market. I would like to reiterate that there are 3 key components of the new beer transaction: number one, Constellation will purchase the remaining 50% of Crown that we do not already own, giving us complete independent control of distribution, marketing, promotion and pricing as the new brand owner in the U.S.; number two, Constellation will be granted a perpetual, non-terminable license for the import and distribution of the Modelo brands that Crown currently sells in the U.S., with exclusive rights to the brands and freedom to develop brand extensions and innovations for the U.S. market; number three, Constellation will acquire one of the world's largest and most state-of-the-art brewing facilities in Piedras Negras, Mexico, as well as the full profit stream associated with all sales of the Modelo brands in the U.S. Now the Piedras Negras brewery is the crown jewel of production for Modelo. The brewery is self-sufficient, utilizes state-of-the-art technology and was built to be readily expanded to increase production capacity. Constellation's purchase of the Piedras Negras brewery provides independence of supply for Crown and complete control of the production of the Modelo brands for marketing and distribution in the U.S. Current capacity for this facility is approximately 10 million hectoliters, or about 120 million cases, with scalability to 30 million hectoliters. Our goal within the next 3 years is to expand Piedras Negras' capacity from 10 million hectoliters to 20 million hectoliters, which we project will be more than enough to supply 100% of the U.S. market into the foreseeable future. During this 3-year time frame, Constellation and ABI will enter into an interim supply agreement. This is intended to ensure continuity of supply and quality of products, with the expectation that Constellation will become fully self-sufficient thereafter. During this period, Constellation will purchase product at a fixed price per case, subject to annual adjustment based on the U.S. consumer price index. In addition, Constellation and ABI will enter into a Transition Services Agreement, primarily to provide Constellation with brewery operations and general management assistance, brewery expansion consulting and technical support and brewery procurement and logistics services. For nearly 2 decades, Constellation, either directly or through Crown, has imported, marketed and sold the Modelo brands in the U.S. During this time, the Crown team has successfully built the Modelo portfolio into an enviable position of leadership and growth driven by their strength in brand building and the strong relationships they have established with our distributors and retailers. And now, I would like to focus our discussion on Constellation's year-end fiscal 2013 sales and earnings results. I am very, very pleased with our results for fiscal 2013, and we executed against all of our key strategic goals and initiatives for the year. As you know, the fiscal 2013 -- fiscal 2013 represented a year of investment in new products and brand-building activity, particularly for our U.S. wine and spirits business. We launched approximately 50 new items, including new brands, pipeline extensions and packaging innovations. Many of these activities represented existing brand extensions, where we leveraged the equity of our Focus Brands to capture opportunities that were designated or designed to meet changing consumer taste preferences for more fruit-forward and easier-drinking wines. We targeted hot categories experiencing significant growth, like Moscato, Malbec and Sweet Red blends, launching brands like Rex Goliath, Free Range Red, which won the 2012 best red wine under $8 from the World Value Wine Challenge competition. We also increased national advertising support for certain key brands like Kim Crawford, which launched its Undo Ordinary media print campaign centered on art and fashion lifestyles. I am proud to announce that Kim Crawford recently surpassed the 1 million case mark in global sales, which is a great new milestone for this popular brand. From a TV advertising perspective, we aired commercials supporting our fast-growing Black Box, Simply Naked and SVEDKA Vodka brands, as well as our largest brand, Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. We purchased Mark West, a top-selling pinot noir brand and a fabulous addition to our portfolio, which posted double-digit sales, depletion and SymphonyIRI growth trends for the year. Overall, throughout fiscal 2013, our U.S. wine and spirits business benefited from ongoing consumer trade-up trends, positive mix, distribution gains at retail and great consumer response to our new product introductions in the marketplace. Collectively, these activities helped to drive excellent marketplace momentum, including market share gains and above-market depletion trends of nearly 4% across our entire U.S. wine and spirits portfolio, while our collection of Focus Brands grew at almost double that rate for the year. As a result of our efforts, we are garnering more awards and recognition than ever before from prominent industry publications, particularly for our new products and our Focus Brands. They include the following: constellation had 9 brands on this year's SymphonyIRI list of Top 30 Momentum Table Wine Brands for 2012; we won 11 2012 Hot Brand Awards from Impact magazine; and several of our new brands landed on Beverage Information Group's list of 2013 Growth Brand awards. Our Focus Brands that received these awards included Kim Crawford, Clos du Bois, Mark West, SVEDKA, Ruffino, Rex Goliath and Woodbridge, just to name a few. And our new product offerings included on the awards list included Simply Naked, The Dreaming Tree, Primal Roots and Thorny Rose. From a spirits perspective, for fiscal 2013, SVEDKA posted double-digit consumer takeaway trends in SymphonyIRI channels in addition to gaining volume and dollar share of the vodka category. SVEDKA is currently the #2 imported vodka brand and a top 10 spirits brand in the United States. During the fourth quarter, we launched and added 2 new unique flavors, Strawberry Colada and Orange Cream Pop, to SVEDKA's flavor lineup. For the year, Black Velvet grew double digits in SymphonyIRI channels, driven by the popularity of Black Velvet Toasted Caramel, which recently received a 90-point rating from the Wine Enthusiast magazine and a gold medal from Beverage Testing Institute's International Review of Spirits award. Now in addition, we are on the cusp of launching the new Black Velvet Cinnamon Rush as we continue to build on the momentum of Toasted Caramel with a new flavor innovation. Heading into fiscal 2014, the overarching strategy for our wine and spirits business includes 3 key tenets: number one is keep our big brands healthy; and number two, continue our focus on innovation and new products; and lastly, number three, plan to drive those key Focus Brands that have the greatest growth potential, although this will require some additional marketing investment in 2014. In a few minutes, Bob will provide additional details regarding how this factors into our wine and spirits growth model for the year. Overall, our goal is to maintain our strong marketplace momentum and pursue market share gains for our wine and spirits business in fiscal 2014. Now moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. Crown had another exceptional year, driving record sales for Modelo Especial, Corona Light, Negra Modelo and Pacifico while posting positive depletion trends for all major Modelo brands. Corona Extra exceeded the 100 million case mark for the year and was the only imported brand to achieve this sales milestone. Calendar year 2012 marked the 16th consecutive year that Corona Extra remained the leader in the imported beer category. Corona Extra continues to blaze new trails through marketing investments with sports properties that are strategic for the brand like the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association and NCAA basketball. As for Corona Light, it continues to strengthen its own identity with its new advertising campaign that is driving consumers to trade up from domestic lights. Overall, this brand is outpacing the premium light category and is growing across all major geographies. One of the gems the Crown portfolio, Modelo Especial, achieved a new milestone in calendar 2012 by surpassing 40 million cases in depletions. The brand almost -- also became the #2 import beer in the U.S. convenience store channel on a volume basis. While draft represents only a small part of the Crown overall volume, depletions grew almost 60% for this format, increasing brand recognition for the Corona Light, Negra Modelo and Pacifico brands throughout fiscal 2013. I'm also very proud of Crown's long list of achievements for fiscal 2013, which include the following: Corona was named one of the best global brands by Interbrand and was only 1 of 3 brands to be recognized. Market Watch not only recognized Modelo Especial as a Hot Brand Award winner for the 19th consecutive year but also awarded this brand its Leaders Choice Beer Brand of the Year Award. In addition, Modelo Especial ranked as the #1 momentum beer brand in 2012 in SymphonyIRI channels. And finally, Impact magazine announced that Modelo Especial, Corona Light and Pacifico were all Blue Chip Brand Award winners in 2012. Collectively, the initiatives I have just outlined contributed to Crown's strong marketplace performance as the business grew depletions in the 3% to 4% range in fiscal 2013. Overall, this is the third consecutive year that Crown has outperformed the import and total U.S. beer categories, which demonstrates the strength of the Crown brand portfolio and its marketing programs and execution at retail. I am excited about Crown's organic growth prospects for fiscal 2014, as we are once again targeting sales and depletion trends to exceed the U.S. beer industry and import trends. Although it's premature to discuss the entirety of our plans for the upcoming year, some of the initiatives that we have underway include the following: Crown plans to launch Modelo Especial Chelada by early fall, which is expected to build on the brand strength of Modelo Especial. This product will tap into a new occasion for this brand's core Hispanic consumer. Modelo Especial also added a broadcast sponsorship of the Gold Cup, a soccer tournament of 25 matches in 13 U.S. cities, which will help to build the brand's awareness and trial. Crown is planning draft format market expansions for Corona Light, Negra Modelo and Pacifico. Corona Extra will debut new TV advertising under its Find Your Beach campaign while launching new ads for the Hispanic market. Crown's new advertising for Corona Light beginning this spring will be supplemented by a combined TV, digital and social media campaign. Corona Light will also sponsor Kenny Chesney's 2013 U.S. tour, leveraging Kroger as a strategic retail partner through its Rhythm & Brews program. Pacifico will debut its first TV ads in Southern California. The new Pacifico, Discovered in Baja, Imported by Surfers campaign includes several TV ads that tell the Pacifico story in an emotional way. And finally, during 2014, Chef Rick Bayless will work with Crown to promote Negra Modelo, Pacifico and Victoria, creating recipes and unique food pairing options for each brand that can be leveraged at retail. In closing, we had a great year, driving above-market depletion growth and market share gains across our beer, wine and spirits businesses. I am very excited about the Crown deal, as Constellation's full ownership of this great beer business provides an additional strategic lever for driving profitable, organic growth. I look forward to meeting with you in New York on June 5 to discuss the future strategy for our business. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our year-end business results and our outlook for fiscal 2014.
Robert P. Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for fiscal 2013 came in at $2.19, and free cash flow came in at $494 million. Our results reflect a slightly lower-than-expected effective tax rate. Exclusive of the tax rate, our results were generally in line with our expectations. Given those brief highlights, let's look at fiscal 2013 performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable financial results. As you can see from our news release, wine and spirits net sales on an organic, constant currency basis increased 3% as higher volume and favorable mix were partially offset by higher promotional costs. Our brand-building investments and innovation efforts have contributed to improvement in our top line and depletion trend and have helped drive our market share gains for our wine and spirit business. The acquisition of Mark West and the remaining interest in Ruffino provided further contribution to our growth as total net sales for the year increased 5%. For the year, our consolidated gross margin was 39.9% versus 40.1% in the prior year. This result was generally in line with our expectations and reflects the impact of higher promotional spending and cost of goods sold, mostly offset by the benefits from the consolidation of the higher-margin Ruffino and Mark West brands and favorable organic product mix. Wine and spirits segment operating income increased $28 million to $650 million, primarily due to sales growth, as operating margin for this segment remained fairly consistent. Corporate costs increased $12 million, primarily due to higher compensation-related costs, higher costs associated with our technology investments and the overlap of a benefit recognized last year from the early redemption of notes receivable from Accolade, our former Australian and U.K. business. Consolidated equity earnings totaled $234 million versus $229 million in the prior year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $221 million versus $215 million in the prior year. When we acquired the remaining interest of Ruffino in the second half of fiscal '12, reporting for this business moved out of equity earnings. The reduction in equity earnings in fiscal '13 as a result of this reporting change was offset by strong profit growth from our Opus One joint venture. For the year, Crown generated net sales of $2.6 billion, an increase of 5%, and operating income of $448 million, an increase of 4%. The net sales increase was largely driven by volume growth led by strong, double-digit growth of Modelo Especial, which sailed past the $40 million case mark this year. Overall portfolio growth was tempered by the loss of St. Pauli Girl brand volume at the end of Q1. The increase in operating income primarily reflects volume growth. Interest expense for the year was $227 million, up 25% versus the last year. The increase was primarily due to higher average debt balances. To better help frame the drivers of interest increase, let me discuss our debt position, which saw quite a bit of activity in fiscal '13 with more to come in fiscal '14. At the end of February, our total debt was $3.3 billion. This represents a $176 million increase from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2012. We also finished February with $332 million of cash on our balance sheet, an increase of $246 million versus the prior year end. the higher-than-normal cash balance primarily relates to the funding of the pending beer acquisition. After factoring in the cash, our net debt at the end of February was just under $3 billion and slightly below the net debt balance at the end of fiscal 2012. Our net debt-to-comparable basis EBITDA ratio moved down to 3.3x at the end of fiscal 2013. As a reminder, during the first quarter of fiscal '13, we refinanced our senior credit facility and issued $600 million of 6% 10-year senior notes. Proceeds from this note issuance, along with our free cash flow generation and proceeds from stock option exercises, were effectively used to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to fund the Mark West acquisition and the Q1 stock repurchases. These repurchases totaled 18 million shares at a cost of $383 million. In addition, near the end of Q2, as part of securing the permanent financing for the original $1.85 billion Crown transaction, we issued $650 million of 4.625% senior notes, due 2023. The cash proceeds from the note issuance were placed in escrow. Because of differences between the terms of the original Crown Imports acquisition agreement announced in June 2012 and the revised transaction agreement announced in February '13, the $650 million of notes were redeemed with the escrow proceeds before the end of fiscal 2013. We recognized and paid interest for the period that these notes were outstanding. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 26% for fiscal 2013. This rate included the benefit of higher foreign tax credits and compares to a 17% rate for fiscal 2012, which reflected the favorable outcome of various tax items. Now let's briefly discuss the fourth quarter. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.47. This compares to $0.69 for Q4 last year, which included the recognition of the significant tax rate benefits. The wine and spirits performance in the quarter was strong, with organic constant currency net sales up 8%, driven by volume growth and favorable product mix. Crown's results were tempered by the overlap of a strong Q4 in fiscal '12, fewer selling days in the quarter versus the prior year period and the loss of the St. Pauli Girl volume. Crown's strong retail performance in IRI channels continued in Q4. Now let's discuss fee cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For fiscal '13, we generated free cash flow of $494 million, which was at the high end of our guidance range and compares to $715 million in fiscal '12. The decrease primarily reflects the receipt of tax refunds in the prior year period that were driven by the sale of our U.K. business and higher U.S. grape and bulk wine purchases in fiscal 2013 following the lighter grape harvest in fiscal 2012. In addition, we saw higher interest costs from the debt activity highlighted earlier. Now let me highlight some financial details related to the pending acquisition activities for the beer business before discussing our fiscal 2014 guidance. In February, we added the acquisition of the Piedras Negras brewery and the perpetual brand rights for the Modelo brands in the U.S. to the previously agreed transaction to acquire the remaining 50% of Crown. This new transaction is expected to close around the end of the first quarter of fiscal '14 or shortly thereafter. The initial purchase price for the combined transaction is $4.75 billion. This includes $1.85 billion for the remaining interest in Crown, which represents an 8.5x multiple of the acquired EBIT of Crown for fiscal 2012. The remaining $2.9 billion for the brewery and perpetual brand rights represented a 9.3x multiple based on the initial assumed EBITDA of $310 million, which represented the estimated profit stream from Modelo's sale of beer to Crown for calendar 2012. The $2.9 billion purchase price is subject to post-closing adjustment. The purchase price adjustment will be equal to 9.3x multiple for each U.S. dollar above or below the initial assumed $310 million EBITDA amount. The adjustment payment is capped at an EBITDA level of $370 million even if the calendar 2012 EBITDA amount is determined to be higher than the $370 million. We anticipate that the post-closing payment will occur in fiscal '15. We further committed bridge financing in place for the acquisition activities -- sorry, we have fully committed bridge financing. Permanent financing is expected to consist of a combination of senior notes and term loans, with the remainder of the funding coming from the company's revolving credit facility, accounts receivable securitization facility and available cash. Now let's move to our full year fiscal '14 outlook. We're forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.85 a share and free cash flow to be in the range of $475 million to $575 million. These projections assume the beer transaction closes at the end of Q1 of fiscal 2014 and exclude any acquisition accounting impacts or any variation from the statutory effective tax rate for the beer transaction. For our wine and spirits business, we are targeting to grow volume at least in line with the U.S. wine and spirits category and generate favorable product mix in fiscal '14. This should put organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range. The anticipated impact of higher grape cost and the additional marketing investments highlighted by Rob are expected to result in low to mid-single-digit operating income growth for the wine and spirits business. For the beer business, Crown is targeting depletions and net sales growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. Operating income growth for Crown before any benefits from beer manufacturing and brand owner profit is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range. Although a finalized amount is not yet available, we currently estimate the EBITDA associated with the profit stream from Modelo's sale of beer to Crown Imports in calendar 2012 was approximately $370 million versus the initial assumed amount of $310 million. Depreciation and amortization associated with the 2012 brewery profit stream is estimated to be around $50 million. In fiscal 2014, we will see less than a full year of beer manufacturing and brand owner profit. We expect beer input cost inflation in the mid-single-digit range, and we anticipate the peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate to be less favorable versus calendar 2012. We anticipate the cost of the COGS inflation and ForEx rate change to be in the $20 million to $40 million range as compared to the calendar 2012 brewery profits. Our guidance also includes the following assumptions: interest expense in the range of $345 million to $355 million; tax rate approximating 37%; and weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 199 million. The targeted increase versus last year of the shares outstanding is being driven by the significant increase in our stock price and the related impact that this stock price improvement is expected to have on stock option exercises and diluted shares outstanding. Our free cash flow guidance includes capital expenditures in the range of $200 million to $230 million. This includes CapEx of $80 million to $90 million, primarily related to our wine and spirits business, and $120 million to $140 million for expansion activities at the Piedras Negras brewery. The anticipated increase in wine and spirits CapEx represents investments to support the anticipated future growth of the business. We have recently refined our estimate of the total CapEx associated with our brewery expansion plans, and we now expect to spend between $500 million and $600 million over a 3-year period as part of our plan to increase brewery capacity from 10 million hectoliters to 20 million hectoliters. Fiscal '14 CapEx for the brewery expansion is proportionately lighter due to the timing of the transaction close. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of our press release. We currently estimate the onetime items associated with the beer transaction to approximate $80 million in fiscal 2014. This includes approximately $50 million primarily related to professional services and transition costs associated with the transaction, which will negatively impact our free cash flow for the year. The remaining $30 million of onetime costs is for financing-related fees. The payment for these fees is included in the financing section of our cash flow statement. I would like to emphasize that the onetime cost and tax rate projections factored in the guidance I just highlighted are based on preliminary estimates. This is an exciting time at Constellation. In fiscal '13, we met or exceeded our initial guidance for the year, and we demonstrated very positive commercial success across wine, spirits and beer as we gained market share in all 3 categories. We demonstrated organic sales growth, greatly improved energy around new product introductions, and we added a fast-growing, high-margin Mark West brand to our wine portfolio. Our strong free cash flow was utilized to buy back almost 10% of shares outstanding at a price more than 50% below our current stock price. We also reduced our net debt, and we used our free cash flow to acquire Mark West in an accretive transaction. As we enter 2014, there's even more good news as our sales momentum continues and, once again, we expect to gain share across the growing and high-margin beverage alcohol categories. In addition, we expect to grow organic EBIT at a better rate than in fiscal '13. As outlined by Rob, we are moving towards completion of the beer transaction. The structure of the transaction makes us completely -- makes us a completely autonomous competitor in the healthy U.S. beer industry, exclusively at the growing high end of the market. This transaction diversifies our consumer base, essentially doubles our annual sales and operating profits and greatly enhances our operating margins. Over the medium and longer term, it dramatically increases free cash flow and helps smooth out cash flow receipts over our fiscal year period. We are financing the deal in a very favorable interest rate environment, with an all-in interest rate targeted in the 3% to 4% range. Although our leverage will be in the low 5x range when factoring in a full year of acquisition earnings, we expect to focus on debt pay-down and to delever at a good pace, and we expect to be below 4x in approximately 2 years. This deleverage alone should create some dramatic improvements in earnings per share and free cash flow. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of D.A. Davidson.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: As we think about '14, Rob, I was intrigued by your comments that you do expect to see some margin pressure in wine. And we've kind of had this argument that we should begin to see wine pricing improving as the grape supply/demand balance improves. Can you expand a bit on that?
Robert S. Sands: Sure, Tim. We do have higher grape costs coming through from the calendar year 2011 and 2012 grape harvest. So that's what's primarily putting the margin pressure on the wine side. Now as it relates to pricing, we've seen pricing in the low end of the market, meaning below $5, which doesn't really impact us because we don't really have a significant portion of our portfolio in this segment. But generally, in the segments which we call Premium Plus, $5 and above, or sort of the mainstream of the commercial wine business, between $5 and $15, we've actually seen very little to no pricing when you start looking at the market on a brand-by-brand and SKU-by-SKU basis. And I say brand-by-brand and SKU-by-SKU because, if you're looking at IRI data, you have to be very careful to take into account that it appears that there's pricing, but it's really all mix-related as the higher-priced products continue to grow at a faster rate than the lower-priced products. So it's primarily higher grape cost coming through and no pricing, which is driving some margin erosion, but a relatively modest level of margin erosion. Right now, I would say our basic strategy is to continue to invest behind our Focus Brands to drive market share growth and make sure that they remain healthy so that when the opportunity does arise, we will be able to leverage the P&L to take advantage of the investments that we've made and the strength that we've achieved for our big brands and our Focus Brands.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Great. And just a follow-up on the Modelo Colada launch, if I heard you correctly, by fall. Is that innovation that occurred strictly by Crown, or it was that -- is that also something that Modelo corporate is launching as well?
Robert S. Sands: Yes. By the way, that's Chelada.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Chelada, okay, sorry.
Robert S. Sands: It would be a strange combination to have a beer colada. I'd be...
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: I was going to let you explain it.
Robert S. Sands: We're not doing coconut beer, just to be clear.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Fair. It would be innovative.
Robert S. Sands: You know, it really would be. But Chelada, just for everybody's information, if you're not familiar with it, is basically a combination of tomato juice or Clamato juice, Clamato juice and beer, and it's a typically consumed combination. And the answer is that, that's strictly a Crown innovation, although Modelo does have Cheladas in Mexico. So it is a Crown innovation for the U.S.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Doesn't sound any worse than putting coconut juice in it.
Robert S. Sands: Well, it's actually quite tasty.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So my first question is on the beer business. When I think about your guidance, I think you said depletions and net sales are pretty much in line with each other, which I guess implies very little if not any pricing in 2014. And just given the cost inflation, I was just curious how you're thinking about pricing opportunity on Crown in 2014.
Robert S. Sands: Yes, I think what we said, Judy, is low to mid-single digits on the depletions and the net sales and mid-single digits on EBIT. As it relates to pricing, generally, we're just simply not going to comment on pricing, primarily because it's so uncertain, basically, at this point as to what's going to happen in the marketplace. But that said, we're obviously pretty confident in our guidance of low to mid-single-digit growth rate on the top line, which will put us in a position of gaining market share in beer once again, and we should be able to leverage that on the bottom line to mid-single-digit EBIT growth.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just thinking more of a medium- to long-term opportunity with capacity expansion in Piedras Negras, can you just maybe either qualitatively or just give us some color as to what kind of margins you think is more of an appropriate margin once you've moved all of the capacity into Piedras Negras and what's left in your sort of long-term assumption?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Judy. This is Bob. So the way this will work, we have transition services agreement with InBev in order to secure the fact that we can keep the U.S. consumers happy with all our wonderful products. As we build out the Piedras Negras facility, the manufacturing will shift from InBev facilities to our own Piedras Negras facility. The Piedras Negras facility is very efficient, so it will be able to produce beer at a lower cost than we are buying that beer from InBev for. So over time, margins will improve because of that production shift from less efficient brewery to more efficient brewery. So you have that going on. Then you have the same dynamics that all the beer players have in what's going on with input cost, what's going on with brewery -- core brewery efficiencies, what's going on in U.S. pricing dynamics. But what's unique for us is the shift of production from InBev to Piedras Negras, and we expect that by the end of 3 years, we will be making all of our own beer, because as you get up to a $20 million (sic) [20 million] hectoliter capacity, that should be enough production capacity to last us, say, 5 to 7 years.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Got it. But your guidance for 2014 does not assume any of that benefit, because it's more medium- to long-term opportunity?
Robert P. Ryder: That's correct. There's a bit of efficiencies from some warehouse capital spend, but because of the late start to this year, most of the capital spend we're making will not result in increased production capacity. It will be like down payments on long lead time equipment, engineering, drawing, things like that.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And Bob, just on the free cash flow guidance, so -- and it relates to your leverage target. So if I hear you, you're saying, you're kind of in the low 5s today. In 2 years, you think that will step down to below kind of 4x, assuming with the free cash flow generation -- so it kind of implies maybe a free cash flow, ongoing free cash flow number of, say, maybe $700 million, $800 million per year versus this year, which, I guess, we're seeing somewhere around $475 million to $575 million. So can you kind of comment on what is sort of the right ongoing free cash flow number, and what's driving that step-up from this year into the next couple of years?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I'd say, without giving specific numbers, the 2 big drivers will be reduced leverage and reduced interest expense, right, as we delever. Reduced capital spending, but that won't happen until like year 4, right, because we'll be spending capital on the brewery for years 1, 2, 3. And actually, year 2 and year 3 will be higher than year 1, right? And increased profits from the manufacturing of the beer, because we'll be making it in our facility versus InBev making it in theirs. And then add on to that, that our product categories are in high-margin, high-growth -- it's a high-margin, high-growth industry. And also, Judy, as we get past the first year, we'll most likely have lower onetime costs, right, because we have the initial financing fees and the initial kind of professional service and transition costs that are going to hit us next year, which I talked about in my script.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: The $80 million in total?
Robert P. Ryder: Correct. A total of $80 million.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Right. Okay. Understood.
Robert P. Ryder: Pretty big numbers, right, are going in our favor as we go forward. And you'll see that as we start to delever, we should get some very good free cash flow and EPS leverage as we move out into time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of UBS.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: On the spread between revenues and operating income for wine, is it that you're now in the second year maybe of your step-up of marketing promo and new product development and that you feel you still need to spend up for an additional 12 months, but we get to a point in the curve where we can start to see some operating leverage? Or is what you're seeing in the market simply that, in order to sustain this level of revenue growth, that it just requires this level of spending?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, I would say, Kaumil, it's the former, as you described it, which is that we're choosing to step up our investment this year again, really, to continue to drive the kind of momentum in our Focus Brands that we've achieved last year and as well to drive continued innovation. This year, we'll introduce approximately 25 new products/line extension SKUs, and this will require some additional investment, which is going to flow through the marketing line. We also, as I mentioned, do have the higher grape cost flowing through, but the plan is definitely to make these investments with a view towards translating that into P&L leverage at some point in the medium-term future. So we do expect these investments to pay back. We do think it's the right thing to do for the brands. We think it's the right thing to do for the company and the health of the brands and the company for the future. But we do anticipate them to be investments with a significant return, and we do expect that to translate into leverage in the future on the wine and spirits side.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got it. And then on the topic of grape pricing, it looks like, over the next 5 to 8 years or so, we're going to be going into a much tighter supply situation. How much -- how differently should we be looking at or thinking about the next 5 years in wine versus what the last 5 years have been, which, of course, have been during a period of oversupply? And what specifically does that mean for you guys?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, I think that it's actually going to benefit the big players on the wine side around the world that have established relations with growers, that have the capacity to purchase vineyards and generally will be the beneficiaries of moving into tighter supply. It will be the smaller and the more marginal players that will potentially be hurt to the greater -- greatest degree because they simply don't have the clout and the leverage and the relationships to overcome the shortages. Now that said, we're not expecting the market to turn from oversupply to severe shortage. These things are usually overstated in the media and the press. I think last year was a good example of that, the 2012 harvest. Or when you look at sort of how things transpired from 2011 to 2012, 2011 was a little short. Everybody cried wolf, and there was going to be a grape shortage. It turned out not to be a grape shortage. 2012 turned out to be the largest harvest in California that we've ever had. There's actually plenty of wine and juice around. It remains to see how 2013 will play out. If you look around the world, Europe had a bad harvest, so there's some shortages there. Australia continues to be in oversupply; South Africa, oversupply; California is sort of balanced; South America, balanced, depending on exactly where you're talking about. So it's some and some. So you can't read the press and get too excited about it, because it tends to exaggerate both the oversupply and it tends to exaggerate the undersupply. So we don't really see, in either the short term or the medium term, anything happening that is, I'll say, terribly unexpected or that will impact our operating results in a more material way than we've indicated.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then very quickly on taxes. You were at, I believe, 26% fiscal 2012. You're looking for 37%. It's a big jump. Is it simply that there were some credits that disappear and no longer exist, or is there a chance for that 37% to be lower for fiscal '13, fiscal '14 for you?
Robert P. Ryder: As you know, Kaumil, over the last 4 or 5 years, we've had some favorable outcomes in our tax rate, and our effective tax rate is probably, average, maybe 30% or even below that. Last year was a very low rate. What those 5 years included were some positive outcomes from foreign tax credits, okay? Now before this acquisition that we're talking about, we had a lot of foreign operations historically, but this year would have drained all those foreign tax credits. So we would not have had any more going forward, okay? This would have been the last year of those positives. For the beer transaction, we've essentially given guidance at the statutory tax rate. It will not be worse than that. Because the beer transaction is so new, we haven't baked in any potential tax rate upside, so -- if there even is any. We don't know if there even is any. So we'll be keeping people advised of this as we go forward. The tax rate shouldn't get worse, but it also may not get better.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley of Buckingham Research.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: I have a question about Crown's sales in the fourth quarter. I think they were up 1%. Can you break out how much that was hurt by the calendar, how much St. Pauli Girl, how much weather? I suspect that hurt you some in February. And then how much pricing was in the 1%?
Robert P. Ryder: So you're correct. The beer industry had a, if people remember, had a very strong end last year, volumes were very good, so we were -- and we participated in that. So we were overlapping a positive period in the prior year. In addition, in the fourth quarter, there were 2 fewer selling days in this year's fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter, right? So that doesn't seem like a lot, but it is in a quarter, right? And you are correct, we did not have St. Pauli Girl this year. We -- I don't know -- I don't think we had it in last year's fourth quarter either. On a full year basis, St. Pauli Girl, this year, we sold a little less than 1 million cases. In the previous year, we sold probably twice that, a little bit more than 2 million cases. So there was some St. Pauli Girl overlap. In the grand scheme of things, St. Pauli Girl was not a big piece of our business. So I'd say that the big pieces were the selling days and the positive -- the overlap of the positive weather in the previous year. Now that was our reported sales, right? As you'll see, we still did fine on earnings in the fourth quarter. I think they were up 4%. And if you look at IRI or market trends, we were still doing great, so it was really just as we look at shipments year-over-year and allotted shipment day influence.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Would you guess that, adjusted for those items, maybe your sales would've been up 3% to 4%?
Robert P. Ryder: I haven't done that calculation, so...
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And was there any pricing in there?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, the only pricing is there -- in there -- and remember, we took pricing, as did the rest of the beer industry, but we took less, in October of calendar '12, right? So that pricing move is a positive margin enhancement throughout fiscal '14 as well. So it's a positive in the fourth quarter fiscal '13 and throughout fiscal '14 that will carry through, and that is part of the reason why our guidance is that operating profits will grow more than net sales -- and in volumes.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And I think you indicated before that maybe that pricing is averaging about 2%? Is that, what -- did you get that in the fourth quarter?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, in October, we took pricing of just under 2%. That's across our total portfolio, and the pricing was very different by geographies and by SKU. But in general, it was just under 2%.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. And just one other question. The ad ratio for the company overall is -- I know that you're investing in it, but is the ratio going to be up? Or is it just going to -- is the advertising just going to be up in line with sales?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, advertising in total and advertising as a percentage of sales will be up in the Wine and Spirits business. And it's still, in the Wine and Spirits business, still not a huge number. It's between 4% and 5%. So in fiscal '12, it was closer to 4% -- I'm sorry, fiscal '13, it was closer to 4%. Fiscal '14 will be closer to 5%. In the Beer business, there's a lot more advertising. It's more like 8% of sales. That will be consistent in fiscal '14 versus what it was in fiscal '13.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Are you going to break out the sales in...
Robert P. Ryder: Sorry, go ahead.
Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Right. And are you going to be breaking out sales and profits for Wine and Spirits versus Beer going ahead? Are we going to see the 2 separately?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. Most likely, what our segments reporting will look like is, you will have a Beer segment, which will include what we currently call Crown plus the brewery, right, so that will be a complete segment from buying the raw materials through selling through to the distributors, okay? And we will continue with our Wine and Spirits segment and our corporate segments. That's most likely. We haven't completely landed on that, but that's probably what we will have.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
Sarah Miller: This is Sarah Miller on for Bill. Our question today is kind of around the Beer business or the Wine business. The 8% organic growth that you posted this time seems to be -- well, it's higher than what you've been posting in recent years. I'm just kind of wondering, was there anything in particular that drove that higher level? Was there a specific brand? And could you give us some color around whether this is sustainable going forward?
Robert P. Ryder: Sure. The fourth quarter, as Rob said in his script, the fourth quarter had very good top line results for wine. Now there's a lot of seasonality involved, and as we said in the scripts, too, you should look at the full year versus the quarter. But the fourth quarter's a big quarter in the Wine and Spirits business, so we had a lot of our promotional and sales focus on the fourth quarter. In addition, a lot of the new product introductions, and as Rob said, there were about 50, really started to gain additional distribution as we entered the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter. So they had much better distribution in the fourth quarter this year versus the fourth quarter of last year. So I'd say it was promotional and sales execution focus in that time period and increased distribution for our new products were the 2 big drivers.
Sarah Miller: I mean, do you foresee that staying pretty similar going forward, to be able to sustain this higher level of sales?
Robert P. Ryder: No. As we said in our guidance, we expect wine and spirits sales to be in the mid-single digit for fiscal '14, all right? I'd encourage everybody to look at the full year results versus the individual quarters.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I guess a few questions. Rob, it sounds like once you get past fiscal '14, you still feel pretty good about the Wine and Spirits business's ability to put out mid-single-digit-type EBIT growth. Is that still your long-term view of that business?
Robert S. Sands: Yes.
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, and then, sorry?
Robert S. Sands: I said yes.
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And on Piedras Negras, can you speak to procurement specifically? It seems like the point of debate out there, and you guys seem to have some scale you could actually bring to the advantage of your -- that business's procurement needs. Is it -- when you think about what the current procurement costs are of that business and how they might unfold in the future once you have ownership and, ultimately, full production there, is that an advantage you bring to the business? Or is it an advantage that goes away? I mean, Modelo's not -- doesn't seem like it's the strongest at procurement as it could be, so can you just speak to that topic?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, we think that, generally, Mark, it will be an advantage to the business on all of the -- or on the major components of COGS, okay? So one of the major components of COGS, the major components of COGS in the Beer business are glass and freight, which constitute about 70% of total COGS, okay? And the -- when we look at the potentiality of combining some of our Wine and Spirits procurement activities around, as I said, those components, we do think that it's got the potential of being advantageous to the business. Some of the smaller areas of COGS, malt, hops, crowns, things to this effect, cans, should be relatively neutral. But the major components, we may have some advantage.
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: That's great. And I don't know if June 5 is too soon, but when we -- as we think about June 5, and whether it's procurement or this topic that, Bob, you were talking about, the advantages of putting all of the production into one facility over the next few years, I mean, are we going to -- are you going to lay out for us kind of a view of the kind of the 3-year pro forma scenario of what this new entity that, from a beer perspective, will look like? Are we going to speak kind of more qualitatively? Is it something that comes at year -- have you -- how are you thinking about how you choose to communicate on what might be achieved here, ultimately?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I think we won't be giving details 3 years because, as you said, it's just too early. But we will be giving some flavor about -- around what we look like when we -- how much free cash flow can this thing generate, what are the COGS makeups, how, are we advantaged, disadvantaged. We will be giving additional flavor around the beer transaction. We'll also be spending a reasonable amount of time around the marketing end of both wine and beer, with a lot of focus around new product introductions and some focus around sales execution and some of the things we have cooking there and some of the processes that we've put in place. Because as Rob said, look, we're fortunate to be in, I'll say, fast-growing, high-margin categories, right? High-end imported beer, premium wine, premium spirits. And our goal is to maintain or grow share in those categories, right, which ends up with a pretty nice top line. And as Rob said, we hope to have the bottom line growing at or better than the top line in the reasonable near future. So I don't think we'll be giving detailed 3-year financials, but we'll be talking around those themes.
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: That's great. That's very helpful. And then finally, just thinking about the cash flow profile of the business 2 years out, obviously, a lot higher than what it's been historically. The leverage comes down. You're now, as you say, kind of multi-category. You're comparatively small in Spirits, much larger in Beer and Wine. Do you think Spirits becomes a higher priority in terms of your acquisition interests? Do you continue to be more focused on Wine and Beer? I mean, as you think about those 3 categories, how does your thinking about emphasis change?
Robert P. Ryder: It's a little hard to judge. It -- clearly, Wine and Beer would be areas that make logical sense. However -- and Spirits, for that matter, makes a lot of sense. We like the Spirits business. We'd like to be bigger in the Spirits business, but it's really all a function of what opportunities are out there and the economics of those opportunities. First and foremost, we've got to get this deal closed. We've got a few years of deleveraging to focus on. That will go pretty quickly due to the strong cash flow generation of the underlying business. And then, as it relates to acquisition opportunities, all 3 categories are fertile ground for that, but we're not going to overpay. We're not going to break our financial discipline. And I think that the good thing is that we have a lot of opportunity to generate organic growth through innovation, really, in all 3 categories, but particularly so in Beer, with our own state-of-the-art brewery and the kind of production capacity that we're putting in. We're designing that so that we can innovate in the high end of the beer market and create, craft, style beers, for instance, that can take advantage of the growth in the high-end segment of the beer market, much along the lines of what we're doing with Rick Bayless. So a lot of opportunity there, and you're already seeing the innovation and the effect of the innovation we're doing on the Wine side, where wine innovation constituted almost 6% of our sales in FY '13, which is pretty similar or pretty much spot-on with what the wine market overall did in general. And we've really stepped up our innovation on the Spirits side, which we're seeing some extremely positive momentum from, particularly on the addition of our new flavors. We're going to be driving that, because the flavor segment of the vodka category is really where all of the really strong growth is. And it's a much smaller segment of the vodka category than people really think. It's only about 20% of the vodka category, but you go out there and look at what's on the shelves, okay, and it's actually astounding as to how much shelf space is being devoted to flavors in the vodka category versus what we call the straight 80 proof, which is the non-flavored version. And interestingly enough, the flavored category has even better margins than the non-flavored category. And what's going in brown spirits and flavors completely reinvigorated the brown spirits category. It's completely reinvigorated Black Velvet. I mean, that was a relatively mature brand that, historically, we would not have slated for a lot of growth. I mean, the Canadian Whisky category, which was kind of lackluster, flattish to down-ish in that particular price point, but with the introduction of our flavors, the Toasted Caramel and the introduction of the Cinnamon Rush, we're seeing very, very strong growth in that category as well. So a lot of opportunity on the organic side, and we will take advantage of acquisition opportunities as they come along in all 3 categories, but we're not going to break our financial discipline and overpay, okay, just to make deals, especially in the context of how much opportunity exists on the organic side.
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: That's great. So Cinnamon Hot SVEDKA, sounds like that's next on the list.
Robert S. Sands: Now you're getting all these flavors confused. We're not doing coconut beer, and we're not doing cinnamon SVEDKA. That was tomato juice and beer, okay, and cinnamon whisky.
Robert P. Ryder: You guys must be mixing your own cocktails, so I...
Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So we're not going to be see a V8 SVEDKA any time soon? That's good.
Robert S. Sands: You never know.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of ISI.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions on the -- what is obviously a new and important Beer business for you. You've done a great job, obviously, commercially in what's been a marketing business for the most part so far. And now you've got a huge plant, you've got supply chains. Is there a plan to bring in a CFO, if you will, a CEO, if you will, for the Beer business? Any new management there to help kind of put everything together and who will be responsible for the returns?
Robert P. Ryder: So we've got a very strong team of people that we're acquiring with the Piedras Negras brewery who are very successfully operating the brewery at the current time. We don't expect any change in employment with respect to the team that's operating that brewery. Obviously, we've got a very strong Crown team that's been responsible for the sales and marketing of that portfolio for almost 20 years and has built that business into what it is today. And in general, in the company, we have a very strong supply chain organization that operates more than 36 wineries and distilleries around the entire world and thousands and thousands of employees, of which many of them came out of the brewing industry as well as spirits and wine. We are assembling a team of people that'll be comprised of existing Crown personnel, existing Constellation production personnel, as well as some new personnel that will also be involved in the oversight of the expansion of the Piedras Negras brewery as well as operations in general. But that said, I can't overemphasize the fact that we are acquiring a very, very strong team of people that are currently very successfully operating that brewery. And by the way, not only are they very -- currently very successfully operating the brewery, but this is the team of people who built the brewery besides. It's a brand-new brewery. It was only commissioned, and it's only been operating for a couple of years. And so we have all of the resources that have gone into building this, and we negotiated transition services arrangements with ABI to ensure that we would have their expertise going forward over the next 3 years as we integrate the brewery into our production operations as well.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. So -- but who specifically will be responsible and held accountable for the -- now the total earnings profit of the Beer business?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, well, #1, I'm specifically accountable and responsible for the earnings of the Beer, Wine and Spirits business. And then underneath me, of course, we do have a very strong team of people who are responsible for the overall business. But Bill Hackett, okay, is the President of the Beer business, and he is the person who is primarily responsible for delivering the beer results. But he will be working very closely as well with the Crown supply chain side of the business that reports to him as well as the overall Constellation supply chain side of the business, which will be responsible, as I said, for oversight of the brewery and expansion of the brewery. So Bill Hackett is the person responsible for beer profit.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. Second, if you go through, I guess, some of your SEC filings this week, there's some discussion, a way of continuing government oversight, I guess, to get to the 20 million hectoliters over the next 3 years. Is there any other government oversight expected here in terms of, on the commercial side, in terms of minimum amounts of marketing or advertising or anything along those lines, after everything's done, of further government oversight?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, the answer to that is no. The government oversight is focused on the build-out of the Piedras Negras brewery over the next 3 years and ensuring that the milestones that we've set forth are met and the expansion is completed so that the production is -- so that the production aspect of our Beer business is entirely independent at the end of the 3-year period. That's the sole focus of the DOJ or government oversight. The commercial side of the business is completely under our control, period.
Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Terrific. And then just one last question. I think we all appreciate and look forward to looking at the kind of efficiencies that you're going to get at Piedras Negras, and I've heard wonderful things about that plant. And obviously, you've got some potential to drive margins there. How should we think of, if any, is there any -- going to be any incremental cost in terms of logistics supplying the United States out of 1 market as opposed to what's today, I believe, 3 different plants that would have different geographic locations and different costs, just in terms of getting the product to market?
Robert P. Ryder: No, it's the opposite. There'll be lower logistics costs in supplying from the Piedras Negras brewery, which is only 13 miles south of the Texas border and, therefore, closer to the U.S. market than any other plant that -- or brewery that was previously supplying the U.S.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.
John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just wanted to ask 2 questions. First off, can you give us an idea in terms of, if we look at the $310 million that you talked about in February versus the $370 million now, that's obviously a pretty big increase. I mean, do you have some sort of clue in terms of what came in better from that regard and how we should think about that from a comparison issue as you cycle against that? And then, from a currency standpoint, you talked about the impact of FX. As we look at sort of you guys going into Mexico at this point, I'm assuming this is just basically a straight translation of your peso-based costs. And can you tell us what percentage of your costs, as you produce at Piedras Negras, are going to be in pesos versus dollars?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. So I would encourage everybody to just kind of forget about the $310 million. And the $310 million was just an estimate at the time, so that the number we feel that would be at $370 million, it could actually be a slightly different number when the audit finally figures out. And remember, all that number represents is the translated peso profits from calendar '12 of the manufacturing of beer to be sold to Crown, right? So that is a base, and I tried to give some guidance as to how we think that will pan out in '14. Regarding the foreign exchange, actually, the beer industry, the majority of input costs are U.S. dollar-based, things like glass, aluminum, even like hops and barley and things like that. So really, the big foreign exchange exposure is the labor in the brewery is just the big, I'd say, transactional exposure because, of course, you're paying the employees in pesos, and you ultimately sell the product in dollars. Of course, there's a reasonable amount of depreciation at the brewery, which is also peso-denominated, but that's more -- that's translation versus transaction, because there's really no cash involved. So as you -- as you get down -- well, and the other thing I'll say is, so Day 1, when we're buying, say, 30%, 40% of our volumes from InBev, okay, as we buy those finished products from them, that is a dollar-denominated transaction. We will pay them in dollars, right, so we have no foreign exchange exposure. As we move towards producing at the Piedras Negras brewery, our foreign exchange exposure will increase, all right, because we'll be hiring more labor there, so -- and that will be peso-denominated. So over time, that will increase. But in the grand scheme of things, the foreign exchange exposure for our Beer business is not -- percentage-wise, isn't going to be that large, okay? Now the COGS number is a big number, right? It's $1.5 billion to $2 billion, depending how much volume you say it is. But there's probably only about 25% to 35% of that is peso-denominated.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Mariya Golub - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is actually Mariya Golub. A couple of questions on my end. In terms of your free cash flow outlook for $475 million to $575 million, what are your working cap assumptions for 2014? And does it factor in sort of a more normalized level of bulk wine purchases versus last year?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. Our working capital assumptions for '14 aren't dramatically different from '13. The -- it is a higher use of working capital, simply because the business is growing. I'd say our metrics are similar. We're assuming a harvest in, I'll say, fiscal '14 to be similar to the harvest in fiscal '13, so -- and we expect cost of grapes to be, again, up a little bit, cost per ton. But I would say that working capital isn't a huge driver in the year-over-year delta of free cash flow. Of course, the beer transaction is the big driver, and onetime cost and all that kind of stuff.
Mariya Golub - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And then, how should we think about the post-closing purchase price adjustment and sort of how that flows through to 2015? Will there be a step-up in interest expense then relative to 2014?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, in 2015, we expect to fund it out the of existing cash for the revolver, right? So if it were to occur, of course, our interest expense will be lower. But we have that in our whole financing scheme. We will not have to go to the market to borrow more money. We will be able to do that from the facilities that we are raising right at this moment.
Mariya Golub - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And then just final one for me, just on Crown Imports. Is there anything else that's -- besides pricing that's driving the positive delta between sales and OI growth for 2014? Because if I take a look at that business over the past several years, OI and Crown Imports has actually lagged sales.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I'd say it's the pricing we took in October of calendar '12 is a piece, and some efficiencies throughout the rest of the business will be another driver. But the pricing was certainly a big piece.
Operator: That does conclude the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the floor over to Rob Sands for closing remarks.
Robert S. Sands: Well, thank you, all, for joining our call today. As I mentioned, I am very excited about the prospect of finalizing the Beer transaction and integrating 100% of the Crown business and the Piedras Negras brewery with Constellation. This deal is a game changer for us, significantly enhancing our financial profile and providing new avenues for growth. I am also excited about our plans for fiscal 2014. As we enter the new year, we have great marketplace momentum across our Beer, Wine and Spirits businesses, and we are poised for solid execution of our goals for the year. Now as I mentioned, we will be hosting an Investor Conference in New York City on June 5, and I look forward to seeing many of you there at that time. So thanks, again, for your participation in our conference call.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's Constellation Brands Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

Operator:
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: And now I would like to focus our discussion on Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2013 sales and earnings results. This year is unfolding as expected. As we continue to execute in achieving our overall strategic and financial goals across our beer line and spirits businesses. On a year-to-date basis through the third quarter, we gained market share for our Canadian wine business as well as our US wine and spirits businesses collectively cross all channels, posting solid depletion trends while maintaining excellent marketplace momentum, particularly for our collection of focus brands. Our focused efforts in the area of brand building, innovation and new product development are also paying off as we are benefitting from positive mix trends and distribution gains at retail as well as receiving great consumer response to our new product introductions in the marketplace. As you know, these initiatives represent primary growth drivers for us going forward as they are also key contributors to overall US market growth, some of our strong marketplace momentum through calendar year and has been driven by this year's incremental investments in promotion and marketing, a portion of which is in connection with the launch of more than 50 new products this year. And I would like to remind everybody that as we headed into this year's fiscal fourth quarter, we began to overlap last year's increase in promotional activity. One of the things of which I am particularly proud is the ongoing strain of awards and accolades that we continue to receive from several prominent wine industries and publications for many of our new products and our focus brands. They include the following: the 2009 Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve was recently awarded a 94 point score from Robert Parkers, the line advocate; wine.com, the nation's number one online wine retailer recently released its top 100 list based entirely on consumer preferences. Some of the excellent Constellation brands that made the list include Robert Mondavi, Ruffino, Mt. Veeder and Kim Crawford. Impact presented blue chip awards to Estancia and Robert Mondavi Private Selection (inaudible) while hot brand awards were given to Black Box, Franciscan, Kim Crawford and Rex Goliath. In recent issues of Wine Enthusiast, several of our well recognized brands were awarded 90 plus point scores, including Robert Mondavi, Hogue, Ruffino, Wild Horse, Raven's Wood and (inaudible). From a new product perspective, beverage information grouped 2012 growth brand awards included the Dreaming Tree, Primal Roots, (Brio Halbega) and Simply Naked, while we also received impact hot prospect awards for Primal Roots, the Dreaming Tree, Simply Naked and (Escenia). The Rex Goliath free range red won 2012 best red wine under $8 from the World Value Wine Challenge competition. Additionally, I would like to highlight the fact that our Mark West brand, which has been an exciting addition to our portfolio, posted third quarter marketplace volume growth of almost 30% while gaining share of the ultra premium price category in the symphony IRI channels. From a spirits perspective, in an effort to enhance (spective)'s flavor lineup, we will soon be introducing two new unique flavors, strawberry colada and orange cream pop. For the third quarter, (Spectra) posted Symphony IRI growth of more than 20% in addition to gaining volume share of the boxed category. Black Velvet Reserve whiskey recently earned a rating of 91 points and took best in class for Canadian whiskey at the Los Angeles 2012 International Wine and Spirits competition. In addition, the new Black Velvet Toasted Caramel has capitalized on the hot trend of flavored whiskeys, driving overall growth of the Black Velvet brand and Symphony IRI channels to more than 20% during the third quarter. Before we move on to a discussion of the beer business, I would like to mention that one of the most frequently asked question I receive relates to the current pricing environment within the US wine industry.

Impact presented blue chip awards to Estancia and Robert Mondavi Private Selection (inaudible) while hot brand awards were given to Black Box, Franciscan, Kim Crawford and Rex Goliath. In recent issues of Wine Enthusiast, several of our well recognized brands were awarded 90 plus point scores, including Robert Mondavi, Hogue, Ruffino, Wild Horse, Raven's Wood and (inaudible). From a new product perspective, beverage information grouped 2012 growth brand awards included the Dreaming Tree, Primal Roots, (Brio Halbega) and Simply Naked, while we also received impact hot prospect awards for Primal Roots, the Dreaming Tree, Simply Naked and (Escenia). The Rex Goliath free range red won 2012 best red wine under $8 from the World Value Wine Challenge competition. Additionally, I would like to highlight the fact that our Mark West brand, which has been an exciting addition to our portfolio, posted third quarter marketplace volume growth of almost 30% while gaining share of the ultra premium price category in the symphony IRI channels. From a spirits perspective, in an effort to enhance (spective)'s flavor lineup, we will soon be introducing two new unique flavors, strawberry colada and orange cream pop. For the third quarter, (Spectra) posted Symphony IRI growth of more than 20% in addition to gaining volume share of the boxed category. Black Velvet Reserve whiskey recently earned a rating of 91 points and took best in class for Canadian whiskey at the Los Angeles 2012 International Wine and Spirits competition. In addition, the new Black Velvet Toasted Caramel has capitalized on the hot trend of flavored whiskeys, driving overall growth of the Black Velvet brand and Symphony IRI channels to more than 20% during the third quarter. Before we move on to a discussion of the beer business, I would like to mention that one of the most frequently asked question I receive relates to the current pricing environment within the US wine industry.
Bob Ryder: For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 41% versus 40.5% for the prior year. This reflects the benefits from favorable mix and the consolidation of the higher margin Ruffino and Mark West brands partially offset by the increase in promotional spending. Wine and spirits segment operating income increased $24 million to $197 million primarily due to the positive sales and gross margin results I just outlined partially offset by an increase in SG&A expense which was primarily related to an overlap of a favorable trade mark related legal settlement in Q3 of last year. Corporate costs increased $4 million primarily due to the overlap of a benefit recognized in Q3 of last year from the early redemption of notes receivable from Accolade, our former Australian and UK business. Consolidated equity earnings totaled $53 million and were level with the prior year quarter. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $39 million versus $43 million last year. The remainder of the equity earnings in Q3 of both fiscal '13 and fiscal '12 are primarily generated by our Open Swan joint venture. For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $547 million, an increase of 1% and operating income of $79 million, a decrease of 9%. Third quarter net sales for Crown were tempered by the Q2 wholesaler buy-in of beer in advance of the planned price increases and the loss of St. Pauli Girl brand volume. Crown's operating income was impacted by the volume shift and timing of marketing spend. Interest expense for the quarter was $61 million, up 33% versus last year. The increase was primarily due to the higher average debt balances. To better help frame in the drivers of the interest increase, let me discuss our debt position. At the end of November, our total debt was just under $4 billion. This represents an $866 million increase from our debt level at the end of fiscal '12. We also finished November with $201 million of available cash on our balance sheet. The higher than normal cash balance primarily relates to the funding of the pending Crown acquisition. As a reminder, in Q2, as part of securing the permanent financing for the $1.85 billion Crown transaction, we issued $650 million of 4.625% senior notes due in 2023. The cash proceeds from the notes issuance were placed in escrow and will be released when the Crown transaction closes. As a result, this cash has been recorded as restricted cash on our balance sheet. After factoring in the cash and restricted cash, our net debt at the end of November was $3.1 billion and our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio came in at 3.5 times. Also, as an additional reminder, during the first quarter, we refinanced our senior credit facility and issued $600 million of 6% 10-year senior notes. Proceeds from this note issuance, along with our free cash flow generation and proceeds from stock option exercises have been effectively used to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to fund the Q1 share repurchases and the Mark West acquisition. In December, we entered into an accounts receivable securitization facility, which can provide up to $250 million in liquidity at and interest rate that is generally expected to be about 75 basis points lower than our revolving credit facility. This new facility further enhances our financial flexibility as our $850 million revolving credit facility continues to remain in place. We will reassess our revolving credit facility after the Crown acquisition closes. We continue to expect interest expense for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 28% compared to 37% for Q3 last year. The favorable rate in the quarter was driven by higher foreign tax credits. As mentioned earlier, we now anticipate the full year fiscal '13 effective tax rate to approximately 27% as a result of the foreign tax credits and some anticipated state tax benefits.
Operator: So that could be the reason why we're really not seeing any slow down or impact of our pricing thus far because it was a pretty modest increase.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: So that could be the reason why we're really not seeing any slow down or impact of our pricing thus far because it was a pretty modest increase.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: So first on the wine business, so it sounds like you're pretty pleased with the turnaround that you're seeing on that business with stepped up innovation, increased investments this year. Do you think that you're at a point where we could potentially see some profit improvement or do you think that you should continue to see investments perhaps exceeding sales and that compromises margin because you want to sustain the volume momentum on the wine business?
Bob Ryder: Yes, where we are now, Judy, we're sticking with our guidance for the year, so we are going to see a profit improvement in the wine and spirits segment, albeit not as high as the sales improvement. But as we said at the beginning of the year, that was our conscious effort to keep the top line moving along, to maintain or grow share and continue our momentum and to see the results of all the new products we're introducing and some additional execution focus. So I think we continue to stick with that and that's why we're staying with the guidance for this year. Of course, we haven't given guidance for next year either but that -- we'll be assessing that. We actually haven't had our internal annual plan meetings yet, so we'll be providing guidance for fiscal '14 in around the April timeframe.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: And then just in terms of the Crown side of the business, so I know there's a lot of innovation and growth that's coming from the price segment that's premium (inaudible) that's going pretty strongly but Black Crown is coming into the market. Do you think that that changes the competitive landscape and whether you see risk to import pricing if you do have that price points really gaining momentum?
Robert Sands: We don’t' see that impacting the import segment. The import segment remains very strong. It's driven by completely different market dynamics. Our business' demographic is significantly different than those of some of the brands that you mentioned. So I don't see it being any issue whatsoever. If anything, it's -- rising tide will float all boats. So I don't think it's an issue for us. If anything it portends a stronger beer business in general.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Then my last question just if you can just give some commentary around the macro, some consumer behavior, particularly as you got into more December time period. If you look at some of the measured channel data, the beverage category seemed to have slowed a big in December, so just curious whether you're seeing a similar softening across both wine and beer, anything in terms of the channel dynamic on time versus off time. Any color there would be great.
Bob Ryder: Yes, so I think we've seen all three categories -- wine, beer and spirits -- slow down as we have moved into the fourth quarter this year and we have seen the on premise slow down as well. The on premise was probably in positive territory at the beginning of the year and as we've moved into fourth quarter we're estimating that the on premise is probably down for beverage alcohol about 3%. So we've seen a slow down there. The whys and wherefores of the slow down are hard to know for sure. We pretty much think that it's probably related to all of this fiscal cliff business, which impacted retail in general across all consumer goods but that's about the only thing that we can really say with respect to that. That said, the beverage alcohol category still fundamentally remains pretty strong. If we look at wine, there’s very, very strong trading up going on in wine. Just for example in the quarter, the wine industry was up about 2% in volume and 6% in dollars, with the premium plus and super premium plus categories growing double digits.So things are fundamentally good, although there has been a bit of a slowdown. And if you look at our business, getting more granular here, I would say that our business performed pretty much on expectations for the holiday season. So we’re not seeing any issue with respect to the full year in that regard.

Bob Ryder:
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America:
Robert Sands: Yes, we've discussed this before. It was a good harvest this year, both quantity and I spent a lot of time out in California with the wine makers and I've never seen them happier about the quality of the products. We're going to have some just fantastic wines when these come out to the consumer. But, look, it's a competitive marketplace. The price per ton for the grapes did go up for everybody and we were just as impacted as everybody else. Now, we're a little bit more broad, so it depends what geography you're buying the wine from. But we're buying a lot from all the regions because we have wines that hit all the different price points. But our cost per ton of wine in our tanks as we sit now is -- will be higher year-over-year when that wine comes out and hits cost of sales.
Bryan Spillane - Bank of America: One last one just in terms of the mix dynamic in wine. Your mix was pretty good this quarter in terms of price mix even in context of having some promotion. Can you talk a little bit about, A, just some of the drivers of mix within your wine and spirit segment first? And then second, are you seeing any evidence in the market at this point that as you're seeing prices rise at the value segment are consumers trading the next price tier at all?
Bob Ryder: Yes, if you look at IRI, you can see pricing in the below $5 a bottle and volumes aren't all that great in that price scheme but they really haven't been recently. When you play in that price segment you have a pretty thin margin, so if your cost of goods go up, you've got to pretty much price it on to stay profitable. But I think in the wine categories, Rob said earlier, wine above $5 a bottle continues to grow much faster than wine below $5 a bottle and we are benefitting from that industry trend. In addition to that, because we've added global Ruffino sales and we've added Mark West to our portfolio year-over-year, they are both higher price point wines and higher gross profit margin wines, so that's also helping us from a mix perspective.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays: Yes, just on the M&A front, obviously you have a big transaction pending right now but you were able to get some smaller tuck-in transactions done earlier this year. Are there more opportunities of that type that you are looking for, a type similar to Mark West as well as Ruffino or are you just really focused on the base business?
Bob Ryder: Yes, I think that if we see some strategic tuck-in opportunities manifest themselves we will consider taking advantage of them. Ruffino's worked real well. Mark West has worked real well. Those are great opportunities to fill in niches in the portfolio that are very strategic and will generate a very good return for the company. So if those type of opportunities present themselves, we will avail ourselves of it.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays: And then as far as mix, are you seeing any sales mix or volume really moving from the $10 to $15 price range back down to the $5 to $10 range or any other volume shift within those price buckets that you operate in?
Bob Ryder: No, I think that mix is generally improving in the industry, favoring the higher price product, not the lower price product, so basically people are trading up period from the $5 to the above $5, from the $8 to $12 to the above $12. So we see very, very positive mix shift in general occurring in that whole segment, so from $0 to say $20.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of (Robert Hartenstein) - ISI.
(Robert Hartenstein) - ISI: Mark West, I think you said volumes were up about 35%. Can you talk a little bit about where you are in terms of penetration of that brand and remind us on your acquisition criteria in terms of return on invested capital and how close are you to hitting your targets on Mark West and, if you aren't there yet, when do you think you will be?
Robert Sands: Yes, so first of all, I think we said the brand was up about 30%, which is very strong. And in terms of penetration, Mark West has very, very good on premise distribution as well as very good off premise distribution. In terms of our targets, Mark West has exceeded our expectations with respect of what we thought the brand would do. We probably anticipated some transition risk in buying the brand. The transition risk has not come to fruition. The brand has continued to grow basically at the same rates that it was growing prior to the acquisition. In terms of our acquisition criteria, we are always looking and anticipate a return significantly in excess of our weighted average cost of capital and we fully expect that to be the case with the Mark West acquisition which is running ahead of our expectations.
Bob Ryder: Yes, just to follow up on that, Robert, Mark West, as you recall, we didn't buy any hard assets. So what we bought was the brand and the grape contracts, so to Rob's point, the returns can be better on that because we can plug it into an existing winery and it actually leverages existing fixed costs.
(Robert Hartenstein) - ISI: Can you just give us a sense of timing of when you'll hit -- when you think you'll hit your cost to capital on that or are you there already and when you may be able to exceed? I'm just trying to get a sense of how long it takes to get there.
Bob Ryder: Yes, I would say on a transaction like this we would expect to hit it within a couple years.
(Robert Hartenstein) - ISI: And then exceed it by several hundred basis points pretty soon after?
Bob Ryder: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Rob, two-part question on the wine business, firstly, can you speak generally about how you think about promotions? It sounds like with the on premise trend you just cited to Judy in having this nice quality high level of inventory you have a bias for continued promotion. Is that a fair way of thinking about it? That's question one. And then question two is in the quarter, do you still think you'll have positive depletions in light of what you're saying about the on premise trade?
Robert Sands: Yes, so first of all, Mark, as it relates to promotions, yes, it really is vastly related to the off premise and how we sell in the off premise. Remember the on premise is only about 15% of our wine business. So the promotional activity is really geared -- although there is some on the on premise -- but it's really geared around the off premise and it's all about driving merchandising of our brand, so basically ads, displays and deals for the consumer in the marketplace because that's what drives in the wine business, in particular, growth. It's getting the product on the floor and getting it in feature ads by the retailers. So it's mostly an off premise activity. And then, no, we don't expect the slow down on the on premise to really affect the business overall because percentage wise, you're really talking about only 15% of the business and then to the extent that there is a slow down, it's a pretty small percent. So it's a small percent of the small percent, so it's not going to have any significant impact on our results. Despite the fact that the on premise has slowed down, we have some pretty strong brands that continue to grow very nicely and rapidly in the on premise, Mark West being a really good example of that, Kim Crawford being a good example. So we expect -- and Ruffino being a good example. Those were brands that regardless of the slowdown will continue to generate strong results in the on premise. So we don't really expect that to have any impact on us.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: If I could follow up, it sounds like you think low-single digit depletions all channel is still a pretty good go for a rate of growth for you guys.
Robert Sands: Yes, more like -- yes, more like mid, low to mid. You're talking wine, right?
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus:  Yes, yes, US wine.
Robert Sands: Yes, so mid and beer, too, for that matter. But year-to-date we're at about 3.5% depletion growth, which is ahead of the market by probably 100 basis points.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: So the thing that's driving my question -- I think you've answered it -- is that in the quarter you had plus 3.5% and in the prior quarter it was plus 7%, so I'm just trying to get a sense if you feel like you reached a leveling off steady state rate of growth. It sounds like you did.
Robert Sands: Well, as we've said for the full year we're anticipating mid-single digit depletion growth.
Bob Ryder: Yes, Mark, I would just repeat what I said in my script because there's just a lot of noise in line of beer by quarter. So year-to-date wine depletions are up about 3.6%. That's growing faster than the category, so the category is healthy. We're a little bit healthier. If you look at the full year -- and I think our full-year guidance is around that mid-single digit. So we're pretty happy with that level.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer - Citigroup.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup: My first question has to do with your new product introductions. In wine you clearly have been very active. I'm curious if you can comment on the contribution that new innovation -- and the contribution you've seen from new innovation to your shipment or depletion growth.
Robert Sands: Yes, as we define it, new products, which are products that have been introduced in the last 24 months, are contributing about 5% to 6%. In terms of volume, a little bit more, in terms of net sales, about 7%.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup: And can you comment on what impact the absence of St. Pauli had on the Crown Imports business this quarter?
Robert Sands: It overall for the year we're looking at about 2 million cases and it's about maybe 1% with the impact. So yes, it's not a big deal here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carla Casella - JPMorgan.
Carla Casella - JPMorgan: I'm wondering if the impact, if you'll have any impact on the industry from the fires and the drought we're seeing in Australia right now.
Robert Sands: Well, not for us, but I don't think so. I don't think we're going to see too much impact. I mean, Australia in general remains over supplied as a general proposition, so anything that impacts supply in Australia is probably good. Now, our participation in Australia at this stage is really largely through our 20% interest in Accolade, which were the Australian assets that we sold off a couple years ago. So we're not impacted by it.
Carla Casella - JPMorgan: When you look at your total grape buy for I guess either last year or this coming year, how much of it is coming from US versus other key markets? I guess when you talk about buying bulk wine, is that coming from US or is that coming from other markets?
Robert Sands: Both. The vast majority is US but we buy lots of non-US bulk as well, especially for the Canadian market, which has particular -- which is quite different from the US market in that they have a segment of product called international -- yes, well, (inaudible) international content. So we buy a lot of bulk wine for -- bulk imported wine for the Canadian market.
Carla Casella - JPMorgan: Then there's been a lot of talk about the on premise sales. How much of the -- I'm trying to get a sense of how much is the business' on versus off premise and how much it differs for wine versus beer.
Robert Sands: For wine, yes, it's about 15% for us and for beer it's a little bit more, more like a quarter, 20% to 25%.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Brent Cooper - Consumer Edge Research.
Brent Cooper - Consumer Edge Research: I think about 1.5 years ago on your analyst -- when you guys talked about blending technique, taking costs out and I'm trying to recall what the timeframe was that we're going to see that. So as we're going to calendar '13 and fiscal '14, can you just update us on those efforts and if we're likely to see the benefit of those. Is that this year or is that a calendar '14, fiscal '15 benefit for you guys?
Robert Sands: Yes, I would say that we will start to see some of it in the fourth quarter this year. Most of it will come next year and what's ending up happening is those savings, which we can see and they are real, are helping to offset some of the input cost inflation from a higher cost per ton grapes that we've seen in the harvest for the calendar '11 harvest and the calendar '12 harvest.
Brent Cooper - Consumer Edge Research: And just to be clear, when you say the fourth quarter this year, you mean fiscal '13.
Robert Sands: Yes. Some in fiscal '13 but most of it will come next year, the whites this year and most of the reds and most of the whites next year.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rob Sands for any closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Well, thank, everybody, for joining our call today. As I mentioned, we are very excited about the Crown deal and I look forward to seeing you in New York once the deal is closed to discuss the strategy for our new business model. I would say I'm very confident that we will meet our financial and strategic goals as our plan is to continue sell and execution of our initiatives throughout the final quarter of the year. So thanks, again, for your participation today.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's Second Quarter Fiscal 2013 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.

For a detailed list of risk factors that may affect the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert S. Sands: Thank you, Patty, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter call. We've reached the halfway point in the year, and I am very pleased with our progress to date, as we continue to solidly execute our profitable organic growth strategy throughout our wine, beer and spirits businesses. We are currently experiencing great marketplace momentum for our outstanding wine and spirits portfolio. This includes excellent performance for our collection of focus brands, as well as great consumer response to our new product introductions. And on the beer side, the second quarter marks the 10th consecutive quarter that the Crown business has outperformed the U.S. beer industry and the import category. We remain excited about the prospect of owning 100% of Crown Imports, as it will enhance our participation in the U.S. beer market, which is one of the most attractive sectors in the beverage alcohol industry. This transaction represents a significant milestone in the history of the company and the next transformational step in the evolution of our business, as it will solidify our place in the U.S. beer market for the long term. It will also make Constellation the largest, multi-category supplier for beer, wine and spirits and the third largest total beverage alcohol company in the United States on a volume basis. The deal is progressing as planned and is still expected to close during the first quarter of calendar 2013. And now I would like to focus our discussion on the company's operational results for the second quarter. As you know, within our wine and spirits business, we have been refocusing our resources behind brand building and innovation and new product development. This area represents one of our primary growth drivers going forward, as it is also one of the key contributors to overall U.S. market growth. As such, we continue to strengthen our focus brands while developing, launching and promoting new products in the marketplace. Throughout the second quarter, many of these brands were performing very well in the market as a result of the promotional and marketing efforts we currently have underway. Now remember we have more evenly distributed our promotional spend this year versus last year, when most of our programming was executed in the second half of the year, primarily during the holiday selling season. This year, we capitalized on the strong momentum we had generated coming out of last year and more evenly distributed that promo spend throughout this year. Our current levels of promotional spend are expected to continue throughout the second half of this year. Overall, these brand-building efforts are yielding results, as we are experiencing strong depletion trends and growing market share for our U.S. wine and spirits business. We also succeeded by increasing points of distribution at retail and implementing more effective merchandising. Throughout the remainder of the year, we plan to continue to build on this momentum, especially as we head into the critical holiday selling season. I'd like to take a moment to highlight some of the key brand-building initiatives that were executed during the second quarter. The new TV advertising campaign for Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi was a hit with consumers, driving double-digit consumer takeaway trends in SymphonyIRI channels for the quarter. Recent Woodbridge line extensions have also attracted new consumer interest with the addition of Malbec, Sweet Red and Sweet White. Black Box currently boasts strong double-digit sales and depletion growth, driven by its attention-grabbing national TV advertising campaign, which was launched Memorial Day weekend and showcases this family of wines delivering the quality of premium wine in a bottle with the value of a box. The relaunch of Robert Mondavi Private Selection is creating buzz in the trade as its new packaging is currently rolling out along with the new Coastal Crush Red with its revitalized label design and new print advertising. Rex Goliath posted strong double-digit sales and depletion growth during the second quarter, driven in part by the introduction of the Pink Moscato, Free Range White, White Zinfandel and Malbec line extensions. During the second quarter, we launched 5 varietals for our new Thorny Rose brand, which is specifically targeted to millennials who contributed to the development of this brand. Imports have also outperformed the market, with Nobilo experiencing phenomenal quarterly depletion growth of more than 40%, making it the #1 New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc in the U.S. And Kim Crawford has become the #1 luxury New Zealand wine in the U.S., with sales growing more than 30% in the quarter. The Kim Crawford Undo Ordinary print advertising campaign was launched in July in the U.S., conveying the innovative spirit of the brand with a luxury look and feel. But last, but not certainly least, on the wine side, the Mark West pinot noir brand has been a fabulous addition to our portfolio, posting quarterly double-digit SymphonyIRI growth which exceeds that of the market category where it participates. We have successfully integrated Mark West into our existing product portfolio, and we are currently increasing distribution and display activity to drive off-premise growth. Collectively, our focus brands grew depletions 11.5% during the second quarter, with several of these products recently receiving 90-plus point scores from some well-known publications. These brands include Robert Mondavi, Franciscan, Ruffino, Nobilo, Ravenswood, Wild Horse and Inniskillin. From the spirits perspective, SVEDKA remains one of the fastest-growing major vodka brands in the U.S. New must-have formats like the recently launched Stars and Stripes and the new Colada flavor continued to draw consumers to this iconic brand. So in the quarter, SVEDKA posted SymphonyIRI growth of more than 20%, in addition to gaining volume share of the vodka category. Black Velvet has capitalized on the hot growth trend of flavored whiskeys by launching the new Toasted Caramel flavor, which offers a distinctive taste that is being well received by consumers. As is typical at this point in the year, I would like to provide an update relating to the U.S. grape harvest, which is just more than 60% complete in California but finished on the East Coast. Although there are divergent estimates from varying sources relative to the expected size of this year's harvest, we are currently estimating that the 2012 U.S. industry harvest will experience high single-digit growth versus last year's short harvest. Overall, grape pricing is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range depending on variety, location and demand. Last year at this time, we had experienced the first significantly short harvest in several years. So how does this all play out from a pricing perspective? Although we are currently seeing some moderate price moves in the U.S. wine space at the less-than-$5 retail price point and less promotional activity at the greater-than-$15 price point, there is little or no pricing movement within the $5 to $15 price range, which represents the majority of our market participation. Now let's move to the Crown Imports joint venture. As I mentioned earlier, the second quarter marks the 10th consecutive quarter that Crown has outperformed the total U.S. beer industry and the import category across both on- and off-premise channels, with year-to-date depletions increasing in the mid-single digits. Crown experienced favorable consumer demand during the key summer selling season, resulting from the combined success of a number of initiatives, including the Win Your Beach sweepstakes program, the Corona Extra Find Your Beach campaign and Corona Light's new Refreshing Change of Beer ads. The strong sales generated during the second quarter benefited from distributor buy-in of product prior to some planned price adjustments this fall. These price adjustments are expected to occur in select key markets where Crown has identified pricing opportunities. However, this is no different from the pricing strategy that Crown has employed in the past. As a result of Crown's favorable year-to-date performance, we are now projecting that both depletions and operating income will grow in the mid-single-digit range for fiscal 2013 versus the previous guidance range of low single digits. And throughout the remainder of fiscal 2013, we expect Crown to be focused on strong market execution, supported by new product introductions, packaging expansions and solid promotional and media activity, which are planned for the balance of our fiscal year. I would like to take a minute to highlight some examples. Corona Extra has once again teamed up with Super Bowl-winning coach and ESPN commentator Jon Gruden to showcase the top 30 football beach destinations around the country with the launch of Corona's Find Your Beach For the Game Facebook promotion. Crown will continue to leverage the momentum for the new Corona Light creative, which is focused on driving consumers to trade up from domestic lights. Pacifico recently rolled out its new State of Pacifico, a national marketing campaign honoring the brand's free spirit lifestyle. The campaign is designed to drive Pacifico's rapid growth, which is fueled by the expansion of Pacifico on draft, now available in 37 states. Crown is leveraging the growing popularity of the cider business to launch Somersby Hard Apple Cider in key test markets across the U.S. Somersby is the leading global hard cider within the Carlsberg portfolio that will be exclusively imported into the U.S. market via Crown. And Modelo Especial, which has been an important growth driver within the Crown portfolio, recently received Market Watch magazine's Leaders Choice "Beer Brand of the Year" award. Modelo Especial also recently achieved a major milestone, becoming the #2 import beer in the U.S. convenience store channel on a volume basis. In closing, to reiterate, I am pleased with our progress so far this year. We are experiencing very strong marketplace momentum across our product portfolio. We are encouraged by our innovation initiatives, and we will continue to fill the new product pipeline for the remainder of the year. We are entering one of our strongest seasonal periods, and we plan to effectively leverage the positive marketplace momentum we already have underway for our U.S. wine, spirits and beer businesses, which positions us well to achieve our goals for the year. I'd now like to turn our call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our second quarter business results.
Robert P. Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q2 came in at $0.71. This result reflects our effective tax rate coming in better than expected due to some favorable tax benefits. EBIT was down 1%, which was a little better than the mid-single-digit decrease we previously anticipated and discussed in our last earnings call. This favorability was primarily driven by Crown, as highlighted by Rob earlier. Given those brief highlights, let's look at our second quarter 2013 P&L performance in more detail. My comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from the news release, Q2 wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis were even with Q2 last year, as higher volumes were essentially offset by higher promotional costs. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 41%, which was level with the prior year. This reflects volume growth and the benefits of the consolidation of Ruffino and Mark West, offset by the increase in promotional spend. I'd now like to discuss the segment operating income results to provide highlights of our operating income change. Wine and spirits segment operating income decreased $6 million to $161 million, primarily due to an increase in SG&A expense. This was driven primarily by the consolidation of Ruffino and some unfavorable expense overlaps. Corporate cost increased $2 million, primarily due to higher depreciation expense related to Project Fusion, our ERP system upgrade, which is now complete. Consolidated equity earnings totaled $71 million versus $64 million last year. Almost all of these earnings are related to the Crown joint venture. For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $788 million, an increase of 8%, and operating income of $143 million, an increase of 14%. The net sales increase was primarily driven by volume growth of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra, including a benefit from wholesaler buy-in ahead of the upcoming price increases in select markets. This effectively pulled ahead some sales from Q3 into Q2. Crown also recognized income from an early termination payment related to the St. Pauli Girl distribution agreement. This benefit effectively reverses the second half -- in the second half of the year as Crown loses the St. Pauli Girl volume going forward. Interest expense for the quarter was $55 million, up 28% versus last year. The increase was primarily due to higher average debt balances and an increase in average interest rates. To better help frame in the drivers of interest expense increase, let's discuss our debt position. At the end of August, our debt totaled just under $4 billion. This represents an $858 million increase from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2012. We also finished August with $179 million available in cash on our balance sheet. This extra debt and the higher-than-normal cash balance primarily relates to the pending Crown acquisition funding. During Q2, we effectively secured the permanent financing for the $1.85-billion Crown transaction. As part of this activity, we took advantage of our improved credit profile and the attractive interest rate environment to issue $650 million, 4.6% senior notes due in 2023. The cash proceeds from the notes issuance were placed in escrow and will be released when the Crown transaction closes. As a result, this cash has been reported as restricted cash on our balance sheet. During Q2, we also amended our senior credit facility to establish a $575-million delayed-draw term loan. As previously discussed, we plan to use our revolving credit facility and available cash for the remaining funding requirements of the Crown transaction. Overall, we're quite pleased with the collected financing we have put in place for the deal, as it currently represents a blended interest rate in the 3% to 3.5% range. Given the early Crown deal funding related to the notes issuance, we now expect interest expense for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million, or $15 million higher than our previous guidance range. We feel that this is a good investment to secure financing and lock in favorable rates for the 10-year period. As a reminder, during the first quarter, we refinanced our senior credit facility and issued $600 million of 6% 10-year notes. Proceeds from this note issuance, along with our free cash flow generation and proceeds from stock option exercises, have been effectively used to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to fund the Q1 share repurchase and the Mark West acquisition. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 16% compared to a 3% rate for Q2 last year. Both periods reflect favorable benefits from various tax items. During Q2 fiscal year 2013, we recorded higher foreign tax benefits, which drove the favorable rate. As a result, we now anticipate the full year fiscal '13 effective tax rate to approximate 30%. Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first half of fiscal '13, we generated free cash flow of $333 million versus $478 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to the receipt of tax refunds in the prior year period that were primarily driven by the sale of our U.K. business. Given our strong free cash flow results in the first half of the year, we're increasing our fiscal '13 free cash flow expectation by $25 million to a range of $450 million to $500 million. This increase is primarily being driven by additional tax-related cash benefits and factors in the higher interest cost mentioned earlier. Now let's move to our full year fiscal year 2013 P&L outlook. We now expect comparable basis diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of $2 to $2.10 versus the previous guidance of $1.93 to $2.03. This increase primarily reflects the benefits of the lowered interest-paying [ph] tax rate that I mentioned earlier, along with the increase in Crown operating income guidance highlighted by Rob, partially offset by the incremental interest expense for the August senior notes issuance that I previously discussed. In addition, we're now estimating weighted average shares to approximate 190 million, which is at the high end of our previous range of 185 million to 190 million shares. The increase reflects the impact of recent employee option exercise activity and the appreciation in our stock price on our diluted share calculation. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the release. It also excludes any impact from the closing of the purchase of the remaining 50% interest in Crown. Let me make a few comments to help frame in the second half of fiscal 2013. During the first half of the year, we saw improved wine volume, but muted wine sales and products, due primarily to our increased promotional and marketing investments. In the back half of '13, we should see sales and earnings grow nicely as we overlap last year's promotional marketing investments and our volumes continue to show crisp growth. For the beer business, the first half of fiscal '13 witnessed very strong sales and earnings growth. We expect this will abate in the back half of the year due primarily to marketing timing and SG&A timing, the St. Pauli Girl transition and sales calendarization. We expect most of this un-favorability for beer to occur in the third quarter. Before we take your questions, I would like to note we're seeing solid consumer takeaway and depletion trends for our U.S. wine and spirits business, with good results around our innovation efforts and initiatives supporting our focus brands. On the beer side, strong marketing programs and execution at retail continue to drive excellent marketplace performance and improved earnings. The Crown transaction is transformational, as it will solidify our participation in the U.S. beer market over the long term and strengthen our U.S. market position in beverage alcohol. The incorporation of Crown's strong business and financial model will significantly enhance our overall financial profile. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: If I could ask on wine and on promo activity, it looks like there's a balance between marketing and promotional spend. To what degree do you feel like the current rate of promo spend is necessary? And what do you expect happens to depletions if you were to pull that back a bit?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, Kaumil, this is Rob. We think that the current level of promotional spend is just about right. Obviously, it's driving the kind of growth that we want to achieve to meet our goals relative to growth in market share. And I would say that, in general, our view is that we're going to sustain the current level of promotional activity. And to your question, the market -- the wine market, in particular, is pretty sensitive to pricing and is therefore fairly elastic. So pulling back on promo would definitely have an impact on volume and growth. So our intention is to maintain our promotional levels and maintain our growth rates.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, got it. And you gave us some context on the tighter harvest and grape pricing. As of now, we haven't seen any pricing particularly in the $5 to $15 range. But do you feel, from a competitive standpoint, that, that's something we might see down the road?
Robert S. Sands: As I said relative to the harvest, the harvest was actually significantly larger this year than last year. Last year was the short harvest. This year, it's a larger harvest and, at least, an average harvest relative to previous years. I think that grape prices are definitely up from the shorter harvest, and the fact that the industry is experiencing great growth, I would say that, yes, we might see some pricing in the $5 to $15 range, but we really haven't seen any yet.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got it. And then just last question, same topic. Would you -- given your size, would you ever consider being the price leader?
Robert S. Sands: Well, if you look at what our strategic imperatives are at the current moment, Kaumil, it's really about NPD, driving growth. A lot of our NPD is in higher-price, higher-margin categories. So this is one of the ways that we're working on improving mix and margins. But in the wine category, we don't really see much of an upside in being a price leader because there are a lot of brands, and we really take sort of a market basket approach to looking at when pricing is appropriate. You really have to look at a bunch of brands, large and small players, to make that judgment. So the direct answer to your question is no. Being a price leader is not consistent with our strategic imperatives.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So first, I guess, just following up on the earlier question on the wine and spirits business. So this is a year where, obviously, you're seeing improvement on the depletion side. Profitably has been impacted by higher spending and promos. So as you look out sort of fiscal '14, what are sort of kind of bigger kind of puts and takes that you see that would cause you to kind of grow profit at that point now in line with the sales growth? Or are there any other risks to kind of not achieving that profit growth next year?
Robert S. Sands: Well, Judy, if you look at what our primary strategy is for growing profits, it's really about growing the business and our growing our volumes and growing market share. That's what should, in essence, generate profit growth as we go into 2014. So right now, we've got strong momentum. We're growing well, and I think that, that should translate into profit growth in 2014. We don't see any big puts and takes. Like everybody, there will be some cost pressures going into 2014 that will need to be offset, but we're looking at that at the current time. And the basic premise is pretty simple: grow the business, grow the profits.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the Crown business, so the 8% sales growth, can you just give us a sense of the breakdown between kind of volume and then price/mix and then just quantification of how much select pricing that you're taking right now? And then broadly speaking, just longer term, how do you sort of balance kind of volume and pricing as you think about owning 100% of that business?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Judy. I'd say for the second quarter, the great preponderance of sales increase is due to volumes. Because really, the only pricing that will be reflected in the second quarter will be that pricing that we took last year in the fall when the beer category generally goes up, which was not a big pricing level. So I'd say in the second quarter, again, most of the increase was volume. Now as you know, the beer category generally prices in like the October time frame, after the peak summer season. And we did take some pricing. It differs by region. It differs by SKU because, as you know, the beer category is very local. We have different competitors, different price points in the different geographies. And generally, like wine, Crown has really never considered itself a price leader because the domestic guys are so much larger. So we just, like wine, react to the competitive landscape, and we're doing nothing different in beer pricing as far we approach the market than we have in historic years.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then Bob, just on the free cash flow generation, clearly, you've done really well on generating a lot of cash. Kind of pro forma for Crown, I think we're looking at maybe north of $600 million, $650 million of cash flow. Can you talk about opportunities to maybe even accelerate cash generation once the deal closes? And then, I know it's early, but just kind of think about what you might be doing with the cash.
Robert P. Ryder: Sure. So as far as -- and thank you on the compliment for our free cash flow generation. And as you know, what we've done with it, we've paid down a lot of debt. And we've actually bought back, I think, almost 25% of our outstanding shares at a price way below where we're currently traded. So Rob and I are pretty happy about that. The shareholders would be as well. I think you're right, generally speaking. And as we know, the Crown deal hasn't closed, but pro forma free cash flow, full run rate with 100% of beer and wine as it currently exists, that number should start with a 6, so it should be $600 million, a little bit more than that. As far as how that could accelerate, I think we've done -- our wine guys, both the finance guys and the operations guys, have really done a great job of reducing our net working capital investments. There is some of that going forward, but I'd say the wide majority of that is behind us. So I would say probably the biggest driver for improved free cash flow going forward will be earnings growth. That's where most of it will come from. And, of course, as you know, cash taxes have been very low as well. Our tax guys have done a fantastic job there, and that's helped ramp up free cash flow growth. So that's always a big driver. And again, going forward, we would assume kind of a more normal kind of cash tax rates. But we still think, with all that being said, the number should start with a 6. And most of the growth from that, I think, should come from earnings growth. And as far as what we're going to do with the cash, I think as we said, right now the focus will be mostly pay down debt. When the Crown deal closes, and we're very confident that it will, we'll probably be at an EBITDA leverage ratio of around 4.5. That's higher than we would like. Generally speaking, it would take us about 12 months to get that under 4. So I think the primary focus that we will have will be debt paydown. But should M&A tuck-in acquisitions come up, we might look at them. And we haven't ruled out additional share buybacks because we still have $700 million remaining on our $1-billion board authorization. So I think as we look out to the medium term, I think there could be a dividend on the radar screen because, as you know, we've never paid a dividend. We're the only player in beverage alcohol that did not pay a dividend. There, I think should there -- when the Crown deal closes, we're a very different company, more mature, more diversified, much better free cash flow. And, I mean, that cash flow actually right now is, even pro forma with Crown, is generating about a 10% fee cash flow yield on the stock. So we feel we have ample opportunity to do very good things with that cash to help enhance shareholder returns.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Reza Vahabzadeh with Barclays.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: Just on the input cost for higher grape cost, with the lag that usually flows through your inventory, when would you anticipate actually experiencing that higher grape cost in your P&L? And when do you anticipate taking any incremental pricing to offset that?
Robert P. Ryder: So -- okay. So there's 2 questions. I'd say the input costs, as everyone knows, wine -- the grape wine that we make ages for a while with some tender loving care. So, generally speaking, the whites come out maybe 12 to 16 months after the harvest. The reds, maybe 6 months after that. So we will start seeing some of the impact from last year's more expensive harvest start coming through in the back half of this year, but most of that will happen next year. And then the more expensive harvest this year will be yet another 12 months out. And regarding how you look at margins in the face of those increased costs per ton, Rob touched on that, pricing in the wine category is very competitive. So we said we won't be a price leader. We'll keep a close eye on what the industry is doing, pricing-wise, and we'll try to react, again, to try to balance between volume and market share and EBIT. And we'll also look at other areas. Fortunate for us, 2 or 3 years ago, our operations guys really started on a really vibrant plan to reduce cost throughout our wineries. And we've consolidated bottling wines. We've closed wineries. We've taken a hard look at oak barreling. We've taken a hard look at wine blend, a hard look at how long we age the wines, always with wine quality as the #1 priority. But we have found some opportunities to reduce cost. And I think those strategies, which were a lot of work and impacts the wine in the tank, will help us offset some of the inflation that we've seen in the cost per ton for grapes.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: Got it. And can you comment on glass cost as well and the outlook for the next 12 months?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I mean, sure. What we do in our geographies is we have relatively medium- to long-term grape -- glass contracts. The glass industry is very consolidated on a global basis. And generally speaking, our glass contracts are kind of bifurcated. You have a cost, and then that goes kind of -- one piece of the cost goes kind of up with kind of a CPI kind of index. And then we call out the impact of natural gas on the glass price, and then we can decide whether to hedge or not hedge. So it's -- probably, there's been inflation on the core glass, but as you know, natural gas prices have come down, so that's helping offset some of that other inflation.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: Got it. And as far as uses of cash, you threw out the idea of a dividend, potentially tuck-in acquisitions. Is there a leverage level at which point in time you would be comfortable entertaining those options?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. I mean, generally speaking, right now -- and this is guidance that we gave out before the Crown deal came up. Our guidance now is to have our optimal leverage ratio between 3 and 4x, which is pretty much where we've been running. I think for the last few years or so, we've been right in the middle there. I think when the Crown deal closes, we may reassess that because we've got a lot more free cash flow and a very consistent cash flow stream from Crown. But I don't think we'll be far off. We'll probably narrow that range because 3 to 4x is pretty broad. That's why we said, right now, we're at about 3.5. When Crown closes, we'll be at about 4.5x. And within 12 months, we can get that number down closer in between 3.5 and 4x. So -- because we'll have all that beer cash flow coming in and we continue a good job on generating cash flow on wine.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citigroup.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: First question has to do with the second quarter kind of puts and takes that you saw in the beer business. One, can you quantify the volume pull-forward? And number two, can you quantify the income benefit from the St. Pauli Girl?
Robert P. Ryder: Sorry, could you repeat the first half of that? It was kind of choppy.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Sorry. Yes, absolutely. I was hoping you could quantify the volume pull forward that you saw in the beer business in the second quarter. And then, can you quantify that income benefit that you saw?
Robert P. Ryder: So the income benefit from the volume pull-forward or St. Pauli Girl -- from St. Pauli Girl?
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: St. Pauli Girl.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, the volume pull-forward, it's kind of a shift from Q3 to Q2. And it was probably worth just slightly less than half the volume growth that we experienced in the quarter. And it's a tough thing because you're kind of comparing -- it's very subjective calculation, let's put it that way, because you're comparing something that really didn't exist, how much did people pre-order, it's kind of a judgmental call. But we'd say, I think, beer grew 8% in the quarter. It was probably 2% to 4% of that growth was probably the volume pull-forward. And as I said, that we'll mollify the growth that we would have experienced in Q3. So this kind of moved from Q3 to Q4. St. Pauli Girl, from an absolute volume perspective, annually, was probably 1.5 million to 2 million cases, right? So you'd say, "Gee, that's not a big number to 170 million cases." But from a growth perspective, right, it went to 0 this quarter. And so it probably held back our growth by about 1% for the quarter.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then you -- but you mentioned that because St. Pauli went away, there was some kind of onetime income benefit.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so I'd say -- correct. So -- and that is part of my first-half, back-half story. So there was onetime income in the second quarter. Roughly speaking, because if you saw for the second quarter, EBIT grew a lot faster than sales for the Crown business. If you strip out that St. Pauli anomaly, I'd probably say income probably grew pretty much in line with net sales. And in the back half, of course, we don't have the St. Pauli Girl volume which we had in the back half of last year. And of course, we won't replicate that onetime payment. So that's why the second half for beer won't be as strong -- one of the reasons the second half won't be as strong as the first half.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Understood. That's perfect. That's exactly what I was looking for. My second question has to do with kind of the portfolio composition in wine and where you're seeing your outsized growth. Rob, you ran through a number of different brands that really kind of hit a bunch of the different price points in your portfolio that are all growing very nicely. But I'm curious, if we kind of thought about your portfolio, kind of value, mid-tier and premium, where's the majority of your growth coming from, from a price point perspective?
Robert S. Sands: Yes. Well, first of all, the vast majority of our portfolio, Vivien, is premium-plus. So value is not -- we don't really play in the value category at all, which is the under $5. Right now, we're experiencing market share growth across pretty much the entire premium-plus category. Our strongest growth rate now, and this is merely what I'm saying is really factual, our strongest growth rate now is in the premium category, which is the $5 to $8 range, and we're seeing really, really strong growth in pretty much 3 brands that are driving that big time, which is Black Box, Rex Goliath and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, Woodbridge being one of the largest brands in the entire wine business. So that's very positive. A really good thing is that we're seeing market share gains in the super-premium category as well, which is really kind of one of the key sweet spots of the entire business, so call it $8 to $12. And we have made some really, really good progress there with reintroductions of our brands like Robert Mondavi, private selection with new packaging and new products. A lot of our NPD is in that super-premium category with things like -- Simply Naked is a good example of that. So we're really seeing strong growth there as well, and that's important because that's -- we have the largest market share of that particular category. We're also seeing good market share growth in the next category up, okay, $12 to $15, which is the ultra-premium category where some of our brands like Clos du Bois play and some of our new products like Dreaming Tree, Thorny Rose. So really, in the main part of the business, $5 to $15, we're taking share across all of the categories, and we're growing well in all of those particular price points. Luxury, we continue to grow well in as well. And there, it's a really small part of the business. It constitutes something like 3% of the total business. It's important to us. We've got great brands. In some cases, we're a bit volume constrained. And in that segment, especially in the $20 and above, which is not untypical, but again, we're getting good growth out of that as well.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Understood. But fair to say that your $5 to $8 is growing faster than $8 to $12?
Robert S. Sands: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Couple of questions, transaction-related, and one back on Crown kind of underlying business question. Regarding the transaction, if we imagine, day of close, can you give us a sense -- is 4.7 or so a good number for net debt? I'm trying to project out a borrowing cost there. What's a good number for net debt assumption and weighted average borrowing cost? Is around 5 a good number, knowing what we know today about interest rates?
Robert P. Ryder: So, Mark, is your question what the interest rate would be just on the incremental Crown debt, or like the all-in rate at that point in time?
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: The all-in.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. My guess is it will probably be around 5%. It's -- I can't do the math in my head, but you're adding the incremental debt at 3% to 3.5%. And right now, we're just under 6%. So you just have to do the weighted average on that.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, great, great. And then same kind of question. Long-term effective tax rate, you're saying 30% for this fiscal year. Is that a good representation from a GAAP perspective of what your effective tax rate with Crown wholly-owned would be? Or are you getting some special benefits, again, from a GAAP perspective in this fiscal year? It's a simple question, long-term effective tax rate from a GAAP perspective post-transaction.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I'd say from a -- look, as I said, our tax guys have done a great job over the last 4 to 5 years. And generally speaking, a 30% effective tax rate is kind of where we've been around. We're primarily a U.S. business. And actually, we have a lot of presence in high tax states. A lot of the tax benefits that you've seen over the last few years were due to our international business. Our international footprint, of course, is much diminished versus prior years. So I'd say medium, long-term going forward, our tax rate would get up closer to kind of a U.S. statutory tax rate, which is more in the, say, 37%, 38% kind of range.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Longer term?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Great. And then talking a little bit more about what's going on with the brands within Crown, I'm not sure I follow the St. Pauli Girl. Are you saying, x St. Pauli Girl, kind of low- to mid-single digit underlying depletion growth for the whole Crown business in the quarter?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, so sorry for this complexity. I'll try to make this answer not too long. St. Pauli Girl wasn't a big piece for us, but when something goes from something to 0, it hurts growth. But the other thing to remember -- so Crown had just over 2% depletion growth for the second quarter. But the other thing to remember, if everyone remembers in Q1 -- this is a total beer industry kind of thing. Q1, the beer industry saw really high growth. I think the beer category in IRI was something like 8% or 9%. I think Crown in the first quarter was something like 12% or 13%. I think some of that was timing, Q1 versus Q2. So I think for the full year, what we're seeing is Crown should grow its top line around 3% to 4%. St. Pauli Girl -- Crown has just under 170 million cases. Crown -- or St. Pauli Girl was between 1.5 million and 2 million cases, and St. Pauli Girl did exist in the first quarter but not in the last 3. So that's kind of how the numbers pan out.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So I'd like to probe a little there. So depletions in the quarter, including the benefit of St. Pauli Girl, were plus 2. Is that what you said?
Robert S. Sands: It's pretty simple, okay. About 2% depletion growth in the second quarter would have been 3% growth if -- around 3% or another percent if St. Pauli Girl was there and it wasn't. It's no more complicated than that.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's what I'm trying to understand. Excluding St. Pauli Girl, depletions for your Crown business were what?
Robert S. Sands: Up about 2% to 3%.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it. Okay, great. And then can you just talk a little bit about...
Robert S. Sands: Just add 1% if St. Pauli Girl had been included, which it is not.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it, okay. So core business, plus 2% to 3%. And can you talk a little bit about this dynamic where you've got this big brand, Corona, that is back to growth, low growth, but growth nonetheless, and then the smaller brand, Especial. Can you talk a little bit more about how you think that dynamic is playing out today and the outlook there?
Robert S. Sands: Yes. I think the dynamic is playing out very well. I mean, Corona is a big brand. It's the leading import brand in the United States. Corona Extra is back into growth, which is a testament to how strong the brand is. Modelo Especial is the third largest import brand in the United States, so probably the hottest -- significant beer brands, it's the hottest significant beer brand in the country today. Growing -- continuing to grow at strong double-digit rates, taking advantage of almost every positive trend that you can imagine, okay? Interest in Hispanic or Latin American product, the growth in the Hispanic population, which is going to be particularly strong, it is skewed almost entirely Hispanic. It's now growing in the general market. I fully expect Modelo Especial, basically, to become the next Corona. It's #2 in the c-store channel, which is the largest channel for beer at the current moment in time. At its current growth rate versus the competition, I fully expect in the next relatively short period of time, a couple of years, it will become the #2 import in the United States. And it's an exciting part of our portfolio. So that's how we think that, that's going to play out. We also have some very good growth in some of our other brands like Pacifico, which is really seeing some positive results on the West Coast in particular -- and Corona Light is the #1 imported light beer in the country, in the United States. So a lot of really good things. We've introduced draft in a number of our product lines, which is going really well. The Corona Familiar line extension, which is the 32-ounce bottle, is, I got to say, a huge hit, okay, bigger than we expected, which is helping to drive the Corona Extra growth. Great addition to that portfolio. And then we have some new products that we're introducing. Cider is hot right now. We've got a great new cider brand that we're introducing, Somersby. We expect that will be very favorable. The Victoria introduction over the last year, couple of years, has gone well. So the portfolio is working well on all fronts.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just 2 questions. One, a follow-up, I guess, on Mark's question on the tax rate. I just -- the tax rate going to 37% to 38%, is that for next year? Or is that medium term? I just -- I kind of missed a little bit of that.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Mark, we're not giving guidance for next year yet, so I'm just kind of giving a medium- to longer-term number.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then the benefit that you got this quarter on the tax rate, kind of I'm just going back to where we were on the fourth quarter when we were looking forward to this year and the tax rate was going up. Were the benefits that you received this year a bit of a surprise to you versus kind of what you were looking at going into the year?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, yes, I mean because we gave 34% guidance. And now we're going 30% guidance. "Surprised" probably isn't the right word. Our tax guys are always working on a lot of different things, and they all have different probabilities and they all have different timing aspects. So I'd say, certain of the planning opportunities moved up in timing and got better on probabilities.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then just one question on wine. If you look at the industry now where there's pricing at the $5-and-below level and then pricing in the industry above $15, do you think that, that's driving demand into the $5 to $15 price point or price segment in general?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, I think that it potentially has that impact. I think that you'd see the overall growth rate in wine slowing down a little bit right now. Okay, I think that's definitely as a consequence of the below $5. But as you start looking at the growth rates of premium-plus, it's growing well. And, yes, I think that there could be a little bit of a shift there from premium varietals and below into premium-plus.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Torres with HSBC.
Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division: My question goes back to some comments on Crown and your raised guidance for mid-single-digit operating income growth. I think you've well explained depletions and the volume. But I was just curious, as we look at the second half relative to the first half, how should we think about marketing spend, promo spend, if there's a big difference as far as how that's weighted? And also to -- it seems like you downplayed a bit the ability to take pricing. And I'm not sure if you're willing to give what pricing you're doing, but it seems like the industry is firming up a bit and there are more opportunities for pricing. So I was just curious how you think about taking that either this year or maybe even any preliminary comments on next year on pricing.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. So there is, Lauren, some marketing timing expense for Crown front half versus back half. And remember, first quarter, we actually had some negative marketing impact. We took more marketing expense this year than last year. Second quarter, that was kind of the opposite. And in the back half, I think we will see an increase in marketing spend, mostly in the third quarter. We also have some selling days differences. The back half of this year has more selling days than the front half as compared to last year, right? So actually it's the other way around, right? So the front half of the year had more selling days than the back half, so that will hurt the back half. And we also have some SG&A timing front half versus back half. So net-net, a reasonable amount of noise through quarter movements. But net-net, the beer business is doing better than we originally anticipated, which is why we have increased the full year guidance from low single-digit growth to mid-single-digit growth.
Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division: And on pricing?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, pricing, there's -- I've kind of already answered that. I think Rob has already answered that. We're not doing anything differently than we've done historically. We look at it regionally depending on what the competition does, and we run our elasticity calculations and decide, what should we do versus the competition?
Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division: Yes. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense if you see things firming up generally in the U.S., and you were very slow to take pricing for a while, if the opportunities are greater, so...
Robert S. Sands: Yes. I would say that you got to remember, we're a distant third volumetrically in the beer business. We're definitely not a price leader. And much like the wine business, our primary interests and strategic imperatives are on brand health and growth. So our pricing is pretty modest.
Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division: Okay. And if I can just lastly ask, your comparable EPS guidance went up but your reported EPS guidance went down. Why was that?
Robert P. Ryder: That would just be the difference that's in the back of the press release for comparable items. It's year-over-year comparable items, right, so it gets a little complex.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just a quick question on the distribution side, the full distribution strategy. Are you -- is that pretty much finished at this time? Are you near completion of that project?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, it's pretty much finished. So in the first phase of that, we did about 60% of the business. In the second phase, which we've completed, we've -- that's another, call it, 8%, 9% of the business, 8% of the business, so we're up to about 70%. And the rest of it is not really -- there's not much we could do. There's a few states that we'll work out, but other -- there's really not much we could do because it's either control states where we have brokers and not distributors or it's franchise-law states where we can't make any move. So it's pretty much done.
Operator: That was our final question. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any closing remarks.
Robert S. Sands: All right. Well thanks, everybody, for joining our call today. As I mentioned, we are very, very excited about the prospect of owning 100% of Crown Imports, the #1 beer importer in the United States. And I'm also very pleased with our operational execution so far this year. We're growing our market share for our respective wine, beer and spirits businesses. And as we are experiencing strong marketplace momentum across our entire product portfolio, and our new products and innovation initiatives continue to gain traction in the marketplace. Overall, we believe we are well-positioned for market execution during the upcoming holiday selling season and throughout the second half of the year. Our next quarterly conference call is scheduled after the New Year, so please be sure to enjoy some of our great products during the upcoming holiday season. Thanks again, everybody, for your participation.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's first quarter fiscal 2013 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com under the Investors section in Financial History. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may affect the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert S. Sands: Thanks, Patty. And good morning, and welcome to our call. This has certainly been an exciting week for us. First and foremost, by announcing earlier today that we intend to purchase the remaining 50% of Crown from ABI, we are enhancing our participation in the U.S. beer market, which is one of the most attractive sectors of the beverage alcohol industry. The structure of this transaction will solidify our place in this market for the long-term and most importantly will remove the uncertainty that, we believe, has created a significant overhang related to the valuation of our stock. Crown is the #1 beer importer in the U.S. where it has the exclusive right to import, market and sell the Modelo brands, which include Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Pacifico, Negra Modelo and Victoria. This transaction represents a significant milestone in the history of the company and the next transformational step in the evolution of our business as it will give Constellation 100% ownership of the import, sales and marketing business for the Modelo brands currently being sold in the U.S. This will also solidify Constellation's position as the largest multi-category supplier for beer, wine and spirits and the third-largest total beverage alcohol company in the U.S. on a volume basis. Crown will have complete, independent control as a brand owner with respect to distribution, marketing, promotion and pricing. ABI will be responsible for ensuring the continuity of supply and quality of products as well as providing the ability to introduce innovation, although they will have no visibility or future influence on marketing, distribution or pricing. Bill Hackett and the Crown team have built an absolutely phenomenal business driven by their strength in brand building and the strong relationships they have established with distributors and retailers in the marketplace. This is a perpetual agreement that has an initial term of 10 years and renews automatically for subsequent 10-year terms. In addition, ABI has the right, but not the obligation, to exercise a call option at a multiple of 13x EBIT for the Grupo Modelo brands, approximately one year prior to the expiration of any 10-year term subject to regulatory approval. This arrangement will dramatically enhance Constellation's financial profile as it will result in the full consolidation of Crown's financial results within Constellation's existing business model upon closing. Bob will have specifics related to the funding of the deal and the high-level financial implications for Constellation in just a few moments. In the wine business, we are also pleased to announce today that we are purchasing the Mark West brand, which represents a synergistic, high-growth, complementary tuck-in to our existing portfolio of wine brands. Mark West is primarily a California pinot noir that is priced in the $10 to $12 price range at retail. In 2011, Mark West sold nearly 600,000 cases in the U.S. marketplace. It is currently the top-selling pinot noir brand experiencing nearly 35% volume growth in the SymphonyIRI channel. As you know, we have successful -- we have a successful track record of integrating high-growth, strong-momentum brands, and I am excited by the prospect of adding Mark West to our brand family. And now I'd like to just -- to focus our discussion on our first quarter operational results. We are off to a good start for the year with results that were generally in line with our expectations. Highlights for the first quarter include: the purchase of almost 70% of our targeted share buybacks for the year; great momentum for the Crown beer business; strong consumer takeaway trends for our U.S. wine and spirits business; the completion of the next phase of our U.S. distribution consolidation effort with the signing of exclusive multiyear agreements with additional U.S. distributors, covering almost 10% of our U.S. wine and spirits volume. Collectively, we now have almost 70% of our U.S. wine and spirits business covered by exclusive distributor arrangements. We continue to focus on developing, launching and promoting our new products and existing focus brands in the marketplace, which, to date, have received great reception by consumers. Some examples include the recently launched 4 varietals for our new Thorny Rose brand, which is specifically targeted to millennials who contributed to the development of this brand. This generation is creating a brand that is tailored to their life stage as they enter the wine category. A new summer TV campaign kicks off as we speak for Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. This innovating advertising positions Woodbridge as the catalyst for creating moments for sharing. The TV advertising is well supported by new line extensions, in-store retail support and online engagement with our rapidly growing Facebook community, and is expected to drive trial during the busy summer selling season. The Black Box national TV advertising campaign was launched Memorial Day weekend, which showcases this family of wines, delivering the quality of premium wine in a bottle with the value of a box. We launched nationally Arbor Mist Frozen Wine Cocktails in 3 flavors: Blackberry Merlot, White Pear Pinot Grigio, and Strawberry White Zinfandel. Arbor Mist is a top 20 wine brand by Volume in the U.S., demanding more than 80% market share of the wine with fruit category. Ready-to-drink pouches is one of the fastest growing segments in the U.S., experiencing more than 180% volume growth in the past year in SymphonyIRI channels. The new SVEDKA advertising campaign debuted this quarter, appearing on the top national cable TV stations and popular websites. In addition, we recently announced the expansion of SVEDKA's flavored portfolio with Colada, a unique and refreshing blend of coconut-flavored vodka, pineapple and mango. For the quarter, SVEDKA posted market growth of almost 20% in addition to gaining volume share of the vodka category. We also recently launched a new flavor for our Black Box, Velvet -- our Black Velvet Canadian Whisky. Toasted caramel is a unique, versatile, delicious addition to our spirits portfolio. Flavored whiskeys are currently on fire in the marketplace, growing at a rate of more than 120% in calendar 2011. These are just a few examples of the brand investments that we are making this year. Although we had a slow start to the year from a depletion perspective, our overall depletion trends improved as we progressed through the quarter as our marketing and promotional efforts gained traction in the marketplace. And in May, our depletion trends exceeded industry trends. We expect positive depletion momentum to continue into the second quarter. Now these trends follow a strong close to our fiscal year last February when we launched several new products at year-end. You may remember that some of that strong fourth quarter depletion performance was driven by selling of new products to distributor and retail channels, which we indicated would unfavorably impact our sales and depletion performance in the first quarter. While this has taken some time to work through the system, the great programming we put in place during the first quarter helped pull through volume to consumers, which you are seeing in our very strong SymphonyIRI trends. Overall, we are growing in line with the total U.S. wine and spirits industry across all channels at a first quarter growth rate of about 4%. Remember, we may remain committed to growing in line with the U.S. wine and spirits industry growth for fiscal 2013 and beyond. Now moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. The first quarter marked the ninth consecutive quarter that Crown has outperformed the total U.S. beer industry and the import category, both on- and off-premise channels. Crown continues to build on the exceptional momentum generated last year, posting depletions in the high single-digit range in the first quarter. This is the result of several key initiatives including the Corona Win Your Beach retail promotion, which was very successful during last year's summer season. It is bigger and better this year, offering consumers more ways to enter and more chances to win prizes of their choice to fit their preferred beach experience. This promotion is accompanied by a new Win Your Beach TV spot. The new Corona Light campaign debuted in April and is centered on being the beer that breaks consumer free from their boring routine, offering a refreshing change of pace. Corona Extra has extended the Find Your Beach advertising campaign with new creative, supplemented by a combined TV, digital and social media campaign. I'd like to bring your attention to the fact that Corona Extra posted depletion trends of more than 5% during the first quarter, which is quite a turnaround story for this brand. It is the result of Crown's relentless focus on the brand, especially in on-premise channels where Crown has done an excellent job of expanding distribution. Crown also benefited from unusually warm weather in March and favorable timing of the Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays. In closing, today's exciting announcements, coupled with solid execution of first quarter results, demonstrate that we continue to deliver on our key strategic imperatives, which, I believe, will drive the achievement of our one common goal: profitable organic growth. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our first quarter business results.
Robert P. Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. There's a lot of exciting news to speak about today. In addition to Q1 results, we also have 2 acquisitions to discuss for which I'm sure you have many questions. So let me briefly provide some details on our first quarter P&L performance where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results, so I can then provide some financial details around the transactions outlined by Rob. And then we'll discuss our full year outlook. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q1 came in at $0.40. At a high level, this result was generally in line with our expectations and puts us on track to meet our EPS goal for the year. EBIT was down 4%, which was slightly better than the range we discussed on our last earnings call. Our weighted average shares came in better than planned while our effective tax rate came in a little higher than expected just due to timing. As you can see from our news release, wine and spirits net sales, on an organic constant currency basis, decreased 1% as higher promotional costs and a decrease in volume were mostly offset by positive mix. As Rob mentioned, we had some timing items holding back shipment and depletion growth for the quarter. Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 39.6%, which was essentially level with the prior year. This primarily reflects the increase in promotion costs offset by the favorable product mix. I'd now like to discuss the segment operating income results to provide highlights of our operating income change. Wine and spirits segment operating income decreased $4 million to $133 million, primarily due to the higher promotional spending along with marketing investments. Corporate costs increased $2 million, primarily due to our technology investments. Consolidated equity earnings totaled $61 million versus $62 million last year. This includes a reduction for consolidating Ruffino in Q1 versus equity accounting treatment in Q1 last year. For the quarter, Crown generated sales of $724 million, an increase of 7%; and operating income of $123 million, an increase of 3%. The net sales increase was primarily driven by volume growth of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra. A timing-related increase in marketing and the contractual cost-of-goods increase drove operating income growth below sales growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $51 million, up 14% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher average debt balances and an increase in average interest rates. To better help frame in the drivers of the interest increase, let me discuss our debt position, share purchases and recently financing activity. At the end of May, our debt totaled $3.4 billion. This represents a $292 million increase from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2012. The increase was driven by our share repurchases, net of the free cash flow generation during the quarter. During Q1, we repurchased 18 million shares at a cost of $383 million. That's an average cost of $21.28 a share. Versus prior year, we have reduced our Q1 weighted average share count by 25 million shares or 11%. This represents a significant return to shareholders for our improved cash flow generation. During the first quarter, we took advantage of our improved credit profile and the attractive interest rate environment to refinance our senior credit facility and issue $600 million of 6% 10-year senior notes. Proceeds from the note issuance were effectively used to reduce borrowings under our senior credit facility and to fund the share repurchases. The new senior credit facility includes an $850 million revolving credit facility and $800 million term loans, which effectively replaced our previous term loans. The revolver and term loans are generally tied to LIBOR plus a margin. The margin is a grid based on the grid centering on margins in the 1.75 to 2.0 range. At the end of the quarter, borrowings under our revolver were approximately $26 million. Our average interest rate for Q1 was approximately 6%, which was about 0.5% higher than Q1 last year. The rate increase reflects the senior note issuance I just outlined. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 36% compared to a 37% rate for Q1 last year. We are still targeting an effective tax rate of 34% for the full year. Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated free cash flow of $77 million versus $220 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to the receipt of tax refunds in the prior year's first quarter that were primarily driven by the sale of our U.K. business. We are continuing to target free cash flow for fiscal 2013 in the range of $425 million to $475 million. This includes CapEx in the $70 million to $80 million range. Before reviewing our fiscal 2013 P&L outlook, let me provide some financial highlights related to the Mark West and Crown transactions. For Mark West, we expect to finance the $160 million purchase price with borrowings under our revolver. On an annual basis, this brand has been selling nearly 600,000 cases in the $10 to $12 price range at retail and generating net sales of about $35 million at a margin profile higher than the average of our current U.S. wine business. We expect the transaction to close in July and estimate the acquisition to be slightly accretive to diluted EPS for fiscal 2013. We are only buying the brand, inventory and some grape supply contracts, so we do not expect any meaningful integration costs. The acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Crown Imports is truly transformational and represents a significant milestone in our history and participation in the beer business. The incorporation of Crown's strong business and financial model will dramatically enhance the financial profile of Constellation. During fiscal 2012, Crown sold 164 million cases and generated $2.47 billion of net sales and $431 million of EBIT. We currently account for a 50% interest in Crown under the equity method and recognize $215 million of equity earnings from Crown in fiscal '12. Upon completion of the transaction, which is expected sometime during the first quarter of calendar 2013, we will begin consolidating the full financial results of Crown. As a result, we will be layering in 100% of Crown's sales and earnings throughout our income statement. The Crown business is very complementary to our wine and spirits business. It has strong financial profile with similar absolute sales dollars and EBIT margins. It diversifies our consumer base and allows us to fully participate as a major competitor in the U.S. beer industry. With low working capital and fixed asset needs, it has an even higher operating return on invested capital profile than wine and spirits and is a very strong cash flow generator. It has a strong and prudent management team with whom we have worked closely for a very long time. And the business is currently experiencing very positive momentum. We do not expect to incur any meaningful integration costs related to the transaction. Our cost of debt for this specific transaction will be in the 4% to 4.5% interest rate range with a tax rate in the 35% to 37% range for this transaction. The transaction is expected to be significantly accretive to annual diluted EPS and free cash flow. From a financing perspective, we have fully committed bridge financing in place to complete the acquisition. Permanent financing of a $1.8 billion purchase price is expected to consist of a combination of revolver borrowings, our new term loan under our existing senior credit facility and the issuance of senior notes. Depending on market conditions, some of the permanent financing may be put in place and drawn prior to transaction close. As a result, we could see some incremental interest expense and banking fees before the deal closes. At the end of May, our debt-to-comparable basis EBITDA ratio was 3.9x. Exclusive of the Crown transaction, we expect this measure to be around the mid-3x range at fiscal year end. The Crown transaction is expected to increase this ratio to the mid-4x range when factoring in a full year of additional Crown EBITDA. With our strong free cash flow generation, leverage should decrease back into our targeted ratio of 3x to 4x EBITDA within the first 12 months after the close of the transaction. Given the funding requirements just outlined, we plan to suspend our share repurchase program. The $1 billion share repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors this past April continues to be in effect with approximately $700 million of repurchase availability remaining. As outlined earlier, we purchased $383 million of stock during Q1. This represents nearly 70% of our original fiscal '13 share repurchase target of $550 million to $600 million. Since we are able to buy such a significant amount of stock so early in the year, we are maintaining our fiscal '13 weighted average share estimate of 185 million to 190 million shares even though we do not expect to repurchase any additional shares in fiscal '13. Now for a full year 2013 P&L outlook. We are continuing to forecast comparable basis diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of $1.93 to $2.03 per share. This includes the acquisition of the Mark West brand, but excludes any impact from the anticipated purchase of the remaining 50% interest in Crown. For now, we are also continuing to target interest expense in the range of $210 million to $220 million a year. I would like to note that from a gaining perspective, we expect fiscal 2013 Q2 EBIT performance to come in below Q2 of fiscal 2012 by a mid single-digit percentage. The reasons for the expected reduction are similar to what we experienced in Q1 and are due to an increase in promotional spending. As a reminder, we're making promotional spending investments in the first half of the year to support new products and provide a more even distribution of promotional expense throughout fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012, which was heavily weighted to the second half of the year. This should drive continued portfolio momentum going into the key October, November, December holiday selling season. In addition, we expect Q2 to be impacted by the timing of U.S. marketing expense as we support new products and launch a new national advertising campaign for Woodbridge, Black Box and Kim Crawford during the summer. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the release. Before we take your questions, I would like to summarize by saying Q1 represents a very good start to the year, and we're on track to achieving our financial goals. We're seeing solid consumer takeaway trends for our U.S. wine and spirits business with good energy around new products and initiatives supporting our focus brands. On the beer side, strong marketing programs and execution at retail continue to drive excellent marketplace performance and improved earnings. The Mark West brand has a good growth profile and will be a nice addition to our wine portfolio. And finally, by purchasing the remaining 50% interest in the Crown beer business, we will significantly strengthen our U.S. market position in beverage alcohol and our overall financial profile. We also feel that pending the close of this transaction, the perpetuity of the beer business has become quite clear: we are much happier participating in the beer category on a perpetual basis than receiving an 8x multiple buyout at the end of calendar 2016. We feel our shareholders should also be pleased. We had 100% of the powerful consumer franchise and 100% of the excellent financial model that currently exist at Crown. We financed the acquisition in favorable market conditions and de-lever to pre-Crown acquisition levels within the first 12 months. And we eliminate the speculation around the perpetuity of our exclusive importer agreement. We hope this provides the opportunity for Constellation's valuation to be more in line with our beverage alcohol peers. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So first on the Crown, the new agreement. So just in terms of the terms of the contract, I know ABI said the spirits of the new contracts are pretty similar in terms of the existing one that you have with Modelo, but can you just walk us through any changes in terms of the terms of the new contract versus the old one?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, Judy. Basically, the new contract was generally designed to preserve the economics of the old contract. So in terms of how Crown will operate or the economics, there's really no significant or material changes to that.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Do you still have that COGS increase every year that you'll be facing?
Robert S. Sands: The specific contractual provisions in the new contract with regards to Crown with regard to COGS increases. But again, the contract was designed to preserve the economics of the -- our current agreement.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then I guess we can kind of walk through the financial accretion based on some of the details that you've given us, Bob. But I guess in terms of strategic perspective and as you think about the Crown business longer term, can you give us some perspective on how you think about sales growth, EBIT growth, potential going forward for the business? And then do you envision also adding more brands into this portfolio? And whether that includes maybe other imports or craft brands to really expand the beer business within Constellation?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I'll answer the first half of that and I'll let Rob answer the second half. So from an economic perspective, we're very happy with Crown's market share performance and its actually core depletion performance. We would expect, going forward now, that we control 100% of the business, and its future from our perspective is perpetual. I think that we would hope to get EBIT growth doing better than it has historically. And we'll be focused on that. And I think the current momentum that the Crown business had established will certainly help EBIT growth as we move into fiscal '14 and beyond. Let me let Rob answer the second half.
Robert S. Sands: Yes, so you talked about -- your question was on new brands and innovation and things to that effect. I think that, number one, under the new agreements with ABI, we've secured a good innovation pipeline from Mexico. And then secondly, there is no restrictions on what we're able to do with non-Mexican beer brands. So in other words, we can add either through organic development or otherwise any new non-Mexican beer brands that we wish, so we don't have any restrictions in that regard. So clearly, with the 100% ownership of the Crown business and the ability to entirely control that business, just like our wine and spirits business, we'll be looking at the beer business very similarly to how we look at the wine business as it relates to our innovation and new product plans.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, Bob, just clarification on the leverage. So the mid-4x with Crown, the 100% of Crown, that assumes that you suspend the buyback as of today or pretty recent and then -- so you get the cash flow contribution for the year, but basically adding the $1.85 billion of debt. So you're assuming that the buyback stops in the 4 -- mid-4s?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, that's correct. And Judy, that assumes a full year of Crown EBITDA. So we think when the deal closes, if you assume the full year Crown EBITDA will be around 4.5, and within 12 months will be well below 4x EBITDA. And from -- and it assumes that -- all our calculations assume, including any accretion that you guys do, the incremental financing from the $1.85 billion.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Right. And when leverage then comes back down to kind of your targeted level, is it your intention to then resume buyback at that point?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I mean, we still have the authorization. So I think at that point, we're happy because we've got a lot of financial flexibility to do pretty much anything we want around the capital structure. So I think all of that should bode well for our shareholders. Because, again, Crown is a very strong cash flow generator and a very consistent cash flow generator. So I think it really complements quite nicely the wine and spirits business. We were lucky to be in a category that's very consistent in pretty much all economic scenarios. And right now, beer in IRI is doing quite well, spirits is doing quite well and wine is doing quite well. So it's pretty good times for beverage alcohol.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I guess the first thing is, over the last couple of years there have been some public disagreements on how to run the Crown business between yourselves and Modelo. So it's now fully in your control. What are some of the things that you want to see change over the next couple of years?
Robert S. Sands: Yeah, we don't really see that a lot of change is necessary. Obviously, the business is performing very well at the current time. Specifically, we have no intention of changing management. The current management team under Bill Hackett has done a great job and we certainly intend to leave that in place. And we see no change in distribution and the distribution network, which has also performed very well for us. So obviously, we don't have the issue hanging over us, so the 2016 date and -- so we'll be thinking about the beer business very much as we think about the wine and spirits business in terms of what investments make sense to drive the business for the future and to achieve our strategic imperative of driving profitable organic growth.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Kaumil, just to follow that up, I think some of the disagreements between Modelo and Constellation were probably kind of natural given how the contract was set up and how both parties were looking at duration. I think part of the reason that you saw a different buyout multiple for us, meaning like 8.5x, and a different exit multiple, say 13x, is I think InBev really wants us to really think like a long-term brand owner of the Corona brand in the U.S. And a 13x exit multiple is kind of like a perpetuity multiple, right? So they really want us to have that kind of mindset. So I think going forward, we'll have a very similar mindset. We'll be thinking very long term.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got it. Well, if I could also -- considering long term, I think 2 things: one is the idea of potentially importing other brands from around the world and putting it into Crown. But I also want to add, is there also opportunity to pick up -- to maybe better leverage your sales resources by picking up domestic brands?
Robert S. Sands: So there's no limitation on our ability to add brands whether imported or domestic with the exception of Mexican brands, okay? Modelo will continue to be our exclusive supplier of Mexican brands, but there -- but other than that, there's no limitation on what we can add in the Crown business or as part as of the Crown portfolio.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: All right. So is it possible to think about that business, that maybe we can justify a step-up of investment because the opportunities are broader than they were prior?
Robert S. Sands: Yes. Well, it's premature for us really to address that. But as I said, we'll be looking at that business almost in the exact same way that we look at our wine and spirits business and making decisions as to where we want to invest to get the best return from our investment dollars. And we're a very disciplined company in that regard and we're very focused on ROIC. So it's basically no different than any other part of our business. And it's a great business. More importantly, the imported beer business is very strong. We've got the best brands in that business and we've got a fantastic platform with the Crown management team. And our distribution network for Crown is, we think, the strongest in the business. So we're very positive about the future opportunities there.
Robert P. Ryder: So, but let me be clear, when we're saying -- when Rob and I are saying "long term," right, we're not going to be sacrificing short-term profitability. We are focused, as Rob said earlier, on profitable organic growth. The guidance for this year is for Crown to grow EBIT. We don't expect to come off that and we expect to grow EBIT every year. And we're just going to be prudent businessmen. So you mentioned a comment, Would we pick up distribution of domestic brands? Well, maybe, but one of the business we'd make is the Crown business has quite a strong profit margin. So we will be careful of diluting our salesmen's attention perhaps on other products that don't have the same kind of margin. So there'll be the kind of balancing acts that any company with a long-term view thinks about.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with D.A. Davidson.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Just on the cost of debt, I was a little surprised by the 4%-4.5%, particularly since you were recently issuing bonds at over 6%. Is that just the mix of revolver plus term loans that you'll be using?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so good question, Tim. So if you think about it, our revolver, which we have $800 million or so capacity against, is, say, 2% right now, right? I mean things can change if LIBOR changes, right? So that's pretty low-cost funding. The senior notes we issued before, you're correct, we issued them at 6%. They're currently trading below 5%. So if that would be -- if we were to fund today, that might be reflective of thereabout the funding we'd get on that paper. And then also bank debt, which is LIBOR plus 200-ish. So it would be the mix of those 3, and obviously the shorter-term paper has a much lower yield, much lower interest rate, but we want to get some duration as we look at the maturities of our credits in total. So as we balance all those things out, that's when we come out about 4% or 4.5%. But of course, that's subject to when we fund and what the market rates are when we do fund.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Would it be wrong to think of your credit profile actually probably being better today than it was yesterday? Just given that the debt markets would have had the same concerns about the sustainability of the JV income stream, now those questions are put to bed, your funding rate probably went down today.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. So actually, it's another great question, Tim. And it's not actually a question, but it's a correct statement. So if you look -- the rating agencies will be coming out. I think Moody's already came out this morning. And we don't expect any negative ramifications for that. There'll be wording, I think, in their press releases around the more permanence of the dependable beer cash flows. And if you look at how our bonds are traded, since the rumors of this transaction just started, the yields came way down. And as I said, those 6% senior notes, or the yield on those, are now below 5%. So I think what you said is exactly right. From a credit perspective, we are now in better position than we were before this transaction. Even though, as we said, our leverage will go up a little bit in the short term, but we will pay that off frequently.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a couple of questions. First, just to follow up on the Crown transaction. Is there any goodwill amortization, or any kind of step-up in goodwill that we'll have to think about when we model -- when we plug it into our model?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so another good question. So the way this will work -- the way this will probably work, right, the transaction hasn't closed, we haven't completely formulated all the absolutes -- is the $1.8 million, okay, that will have -- that will almost be all intangibles. Because, as you know, 100% of the Crown business has about $200 million of net assets, okay? So heavy intangible acquisition there. The fortunate piece of that is those intangibles are tax-deductible, right, so it should help the tax rate on this deal. Now the other kind of geeky GAAP thing that's going to happen here is, most likely, we're going to have to mark our existing interest in Crown to market. So what that means is we will record quite a significant gain, right, which will again increase the asset base of the Crown business. So in essence, although cash going out the door will essentially be the $1.8 billion, and most of that will be goodwill, we will also have a gain and also record more intangibles for the first half we own. So the intangible asset will go up just shy of $4 billion, more likely than not, when this thing closes.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And so then as we're just -- if we're taking a baseline EBITDA, or EBITDA for Crown of, I don't know, let's just -- just to use a round number, $450 million, we still have to -- we will have to make some adjustments for that for the increase -- or I'm sorry, EBIT, of about, let's say, $430 million, we'll have to make some adjustment for a higher amortization?
Robert P. Ryder: No, the amortization won't occur on the GAAP financials. We will be able to amortize it for tax purposes. And again, we haven't finished this. But my guess is a lot of the intangibles from a book perspective won't be amortizing.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then the tax benefit that would be created is included in the, what you've described, I guess, like a 36% tax rate or so to use for GAAP.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so that's a good point, too. Because as we said before, the Crown business, by its nature, has a pretty high tax rate because the majority of its sales are in high-tax rate districts and it has nexus in a lot of the states because of the distribution centers so it's relatively high state tax rate. But the amortization of the purchase price helps bring that tax rate down. So your statutory rate would be, I don't know, say 38%, 39%. You're back down to, say, the 35%, 36% effective tax rate, including the amortization of the purchase price.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, okay. And then are there any synergies once -- looking forward, once you've got full control of Crown, are there any -- is there any like overhead leverage and overhead things, like systems, any kind of cost synergies that are material that we should think about?
Robert P. Ryder: No, really not, Bryan. And because as we said, one of the glories of this acquisition is it's kind of like buying yourself, right? We've known this business for so long. We know the people. We know how good they are. We know the work they've done even before the JV was formed. And there's actually a lot of symbiosis already between that 2. As we put in our ERP system, Crown put in the same system, the same instance. So those synergies pretty much already exist. The other great thing about the Crown business, not only is it not capital-intensive, because I said the total net asset base is around $200 million for businesses you said that has, like, $2.5 billion of sales and $450 million of EBIT, thereabouts. It's not very people-intensive. They don't have a lot of -- I think the total headcount in Crown is like 300 people.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And just one last one, if I could ask just about the wine market. We've begun to see -- you can see it in the scanner data. You could see it in some of the other third-party sources that you're beginning to see some general price increases in the industry. And so I guess just so far from your perspective, how -- has that surprised you? Is the way that the market's reacting to the supply shortages and the higher costs for both bulk wine and grapes, has the industry responded in a way that you would have expected? Just sort of your outlook on how that's evolved -- your perspective on how it's evolving now and what you think may be happening as we go through the balance of the year will be helpful.
Robert S. Sands: Yes. I mean, I think that the industry is reacting in a fairly rational manner. As you said, grape supplies are a little tight. It's probably been exaggerated to some degree, but they're a bit tight and grape prices are up. And therefore, with raw material costs being up as well as supply being somewhat limited, in certain categories, price categories, you are seeing some pricing. So now where have we seen that? We've seen a little bit of it in the value segment, or the everyday segment below $5, which is relatively irrelevant to us. And we're also seeing in the top end, call it sort of above $20, which is also from a business perspective not particularly relevant because it represents less than 3% of the total industry. So you're seeing a little bit of it here and there and you are seeing, as what I said, some rational behavior in the marketplace. And I would expect to continue to see that as the harvest comes in and throughout the year. We're not expecting to see any, like, major changes in those trends.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: My first question is a follow-up to Judy's, when you guys talked about the opportunity to improve the EBIT growth. Is there an opportunity to expand margins or is it just a matter of kind of closing the gap between the top line and the EBIT from a gross perspective?
Robert S. Sands: You're talking about the beer business?
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes, I'm sorry. Excuse me, yes, for Crown.
Robert S. Sands: Just like all of our businesses in terms of driving EBIT growth, margin expansion is certainly one of those levers and margin expansion can occur in a variety of ways. But driving the mix of the products is certainly one of those levers. But we'll be wanting to, just like any other part of the business, continue to focus on growing that business from a top line and bottom line perspective.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Fair enough. And my second question also has to do with Crown. I'm curious if you could offer a little more detail on how innovation is going to work, given that ABI is going to be your greatest competitor in the U.S. and now they're going to be in charge of producing your products, but also handling the innovation.
Robert S. Sands: Yes, well, they're very interested and have provided for innovation because this is an important part of the business for them. So in our agreements, so to speak, we've provided for a strong innovation pipeline as it relates to new products and new packages from Mexico, and therefore, from Modelo. And then, as I stated previously, there isn't any prohibition on our part from introducing new products that are not Mexican in origin in essence. So we're also not limited there and can look at domestic and imports from other countries, as well, with respect to our innovation plans. So basically, we will run this business like any other business. We have, fundamentally, no limitations on what we can do.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So in terms of driving the innovation, and presumably it's coming from you guys and you're asking ABI, Hey, I want either this new package or this new kind of formulation, is that right? Or they can...
Robert S. Sands: Yes. New packages, new products or formulations, right.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then lastly, is there something in the contract that then precludes ABI from then replicating whatever clever idea you have that you're going to execute with Corona from taking that and applying it to Stella or something like that?
Robert S. Sands: Well, I think the -- I guess the basic answer to your question is, yes. Okay. We are the exclusive importer in the United States of their Mexican products. Okay? And basically, they can't do knockoffs and we can't do knockoffs. So the answer to your question is, fundamentally, yes. There are provisions that actually protect both parties from that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: On Crown -- it seems to be a popular topic -- a couple questions. Firstly, the -- I didn't catch it, but did you say Crown will continue to operate even though it's going to be consolidated as a separate entity?
Robert S. Sands: Yes. So Crown will operate as the beer division of Constellation, and will continue to operate pretty much the same as it operates right now, with very little difference. Same management team, same distribution network, same sales force. So yes, separate division.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it. Great. And then the incentive structure there at Crown, any intent -- I assume it's a different incentive structure than that for the presently wholly-owned businesses. Is any intent to have it be aligned with the incentive structure for the wine and spirits business or leave it as is?
Robert S. Sands: Well, right now Crown is a private company, right? So they don't have some of the benefits of being a wholly-owned subsidiary of a public company. So we'll be looking at ways to enhance the incentives that the Crown employees have. And I think that, clearly, that will involve looking at sort of the incentives on both sides and making sure that -- meaning wine and spirits and beer, and making sure that they're equivalent as well as consistent with the goals that we've set for the Crown business. I mean, that's what incentives are all about, is making sure that the incentives are aligned with the goals that you're trying to drive. So that was a long answer, a long way of saying, sort of, yes.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And that -- and is it -- can you just speak to generally how they are incentivized? It seems like it's more of a volume-based incentive structure than a profit weighting in the equation. Can you just speak generally to that?
Robert S. Sands: No. It's a pretty balanced system that relates to volume, profit and market share. That's how they're currently incentivized and they will be incentivized in the future in that regard. And then there's the typical sort of split between short-term incentives and long-term incentives. But both of those are based on pretty much the 3 things that I just talked about: market share, profit and volume depletions.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Mark, it's a lot like the wine business. We basically set an annual plan and those 3 components get rolled up. And if they beat those numbers in the plan, they get better than a 100% bonus. And if they don't hit market share depletions and EBIT, they get less than 100% target bonus.
Robert S. Sands: So very balanced in that regard. And it always is.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it. That's great. And then finally, on Crown, and I'll get back in the queue with a couple of wine questions. But finally, on Crown, it sounds like if you were to come up with the $1.85 billion today, it would be roughly in the neighborhood of 4.5%, 5% borrowing costs. Is that a fair sense of what the market for this transaction is?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, that's what we said earlier. We said 4% to 4.5%.
Robert S. Sands: Incremental on the...
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. I thought it was on the...
Robert P. Ryder: That was just on the $1.8 billion.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Oh, okay, I thought that was financing relating to just refinancing your existing borrowings, but okay. Fair enough.
Robert P. Ryder: No.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I just want to get some more clarity on the long-term pricing algorithm you'd expect with the Crown business. There hasn't been much pricing over the last few years here despite some aggressive increases from the domestic brew brands. So given the pricing gap on Corona has closed significantly, I'm just wondering if it's reasonable to assume that perhaps you'd take more robust pricing going forward now that you've taken full control of the business in the context of improved volume trends also in general for the brand.
Robert S. Sands: Yes, Dara. We're generally not going to comment on pricing. Suffice it to say that the Crown management team is going to do what makes commercial sense for the business. That's pretty much as much as we can say, or are going to say at this point in time.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then on the on-premise side, the rebound we've seen recently in the alcohol industry in general over the last few months here. I was just looking for more clarity on what you're seeing post the quarter here. Do you think that rebound is sustainable, or was it more transient and related to some of the favorable weather we saw earlier this year?
Robert S. Sands: No, we think that the rebound in on-premise is sustainable. I think that we're seeing the on-premise return to growth, and probably it's just about getting back to the pre-recession levels after taking a pretty good hit. So it's still, I would say -- no one knows for sure, but in terms of the on-premise in general for beverage alcohol, I would say that we're probably now looking at low, very low single-digit growth on the on-premise. But that's a positive development from probably flat, looking 6, 12 months ago, to significantly down immediately postrecession 2008. So we're optimistic on that [indiscernible] and Crown's business is doing very well on the on-premise, so we're happy.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And on the Mark West acquisition, obviously a high-growth brand. I'm wondering if you can give us a bit more detail on what attracted you to the brand strategically? And also just implications going forward in terms of maybe consummating additional acquisitions in the same type of vain.
Robert S. Sands: Sure. Well, first of all, pinot noir is one of the hottest major categories/varietals in wine, and has been for some time. And secondly, Mark West is the -- is now the #1 brand in the pinot noir category. So that makes it a extremely dynamic brand to be in a major, hot varietal category and to be the #1 player, growing in IRI for the last 12 weeks at 35%. So a lot of momentum behind the brand. We think that it's got tremendous opportunity for the future. And I think in terms of why it makes a very attractive -- makes itself a very attractive acquisition candidate when you think about the fact that it doesn't come with many physical assets, obviously there's a lot of synergy there in putting the brand into our production infrastructure. Furthermore, it comes with a very good supply of grapes to ensure that we maintain the supply and quality of the product in, again, a varietal category where supplies are tight. So we've got assured supply. We've got assured quality. We don't have the physical assets. We can pop it in to our production infrastructure. There's a lot of synergies there. It's the #1 brand in pinot noir, so it's a very logical fit for us. Also just in terms of its price positioning, it still is a nice little niche for us in that it sort of fits right between 2 of our major brands, which are Robert Mondavi Private Selection and Estancia. So it's a good fit in terms of laddering from a price perspective as well. So it's kind of a perfect tuck-in, as we said.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Reza Vahabzadeh with Barclays.
Jamie Robins: This is actually Jamie Robins on for Reza. Can I ask you guys, can you bring us up to date us on your outlook for grape costs in fiscal 2013 for the business?
Robert S. Sands: Yes. We're looking for sort of normal inflationary increases in grape costs for -- did you say 2014 or 20- -- what did you said?
Jamie Robins: 2013, sorry, coming year.
Robert S. Sands: Yes, I think we've talked about sort of mid-single-digit increases in just that component. But in terms of how that affects our overall cost of goods sold, it's only -- it's less than a -- it's only a relatively small percentage of our total cost of goods sold grapes, per se. And therefore, again, we're looking sort of mid-single-digit increases there. But on overall COGS, it's just sort of normal inflationary increases.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Dreyer with Gabelli Asset Management.
Kevin V. Dreyer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Just curious, again, a couple questions around taxes and the tax basis. So will that be stepped up as well, for the tax basis of the joint venture?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I mean the tax basis of the joint venture will be stepped up by our purchase price, by the $1.8 billion.
Kevin V. Dreyer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then -- and it sounds like partially -- and then is that affected by the partial amortization of those intangibles, or it'll just stay there?
Robert P. Ryder: No, so the way it will work, we pay the $1.8 billion, that will be tax-deductible over, say, 15 to 20 years. So we'll get a tax deduction on that. You won't see the amortization on the GAAP income statements. You'll just see that, that's going to sit in goodwill, which doesn't -- most of it, which doesn't get amortized. So but the effective tax rate for the beer business will be helped by the tax deductibility of our $1.8 billion purchase price.
Kevin V. Dreyer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Right. Okay. So the tax basis would basically be, roughly speaking, $3.7 billion then?
Robert P. Ryder: No. Tax basis will be about $1.8 billion.
Kevin V. Dreyer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Oh, the $1.8 billion, okay. Okay. Just by the -- so it's not...
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, it's pretty confusing. What I said earlier was, we're going to have to mark-to-market the 50% interest that we currently have. That does not impact the tax basis because there's no cash associated with that. It's kind of just like a book entry. So the thing that impacts the tax basis is the check we cut for the $1.8 billion.
Kevin V. Dreyer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: Got it. Got it. And then just in terms of -- with all the buyback and whatnot, what are the current shares outstanding?
Robert S. Sands: The current shares outstanding?
Kevin V. Dreyer - GAMCO Investors, Inc.: Yes.
Robert S. Sands: About 190 -- 190 million.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I had a couple questions. One is when you look at the Crown EBITDA margins -- or EBIT margins, they're coming down a little bit. Is that all of a result of the step-up in your purchasing terms from Modelo that's built into the contract?
Robert P. Ryder: I'm sorry. The question was about the Crown EBIT margins?
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes, the margins that you've been reporting on Crown. It's been coming down slightly every year. And I'm wondering if it's purchasing...
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, that's the relation -- the big drivers there are -- is cost of goods going up, advertising costs going up, and not offsetting that with price increases. That's the big reason why margins have come down.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. When is the next step-up in the purchasing costs? Or is it something where it's tied to their production costs, or is it tied to some kind of index?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. The way -- the purchasing costs will be reassessed every year as we enter our fiscal year. So they get reset based on inflationary trends each year.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And did you give the depreciation for Crown, so I could figure out an EBITDA?
Robert P. Ryder: Why don't you call maybe IR on that one.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then one debt question. I show -- it looks to me like you can add about $750 million of additional in term loans. Am I reading that right, or do you think you have additional availability?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, we have availability under the revolver of almost $800 million. Term loans, you have to go out -- we have an accordion feature, right? So we can issue more term loans, but it's not really like a revolver where it's like that available, you can get it on a daily basis. But when we go to finance the Crown acquisition, we do plan to use our revolver, which we think is on good terms, to utilize the accordion feature that we put in to our recent May refinancing, and to access the senior note markets, which, as we said earlier, our credit worthiness has gotten a little better, so the rates on our senior notes have come down since issuance almost 100 basis points.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. Okay. Great. And one I forgot to follow up on the -- on the purchasing of products from Modelo. Is there some type of a stipulation in the contract if there's -- if Modelo fails to deliver quantity or quality of beer?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I mean it's a normal commercial contract where we order and they have to deliver to us within x number of days. And they have to deliver the SKUs we ordered, and the product quality has to be what we expect. So kind of normal commercial terms that you would expect, that also existed under the joint venture agreement.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Sands for any closing remarks.
Robert S. Sands: Yes. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining our call today. We're extremely pleased about the prospect of owning 100% of Crown Imports, the #1 beer importer in the United States. And I'm also very excited that we will be adding the Mark West brand, the top-selling pinot noir brand in the U.S., to our award-winning portfolio of wines. From an operational perspective, we're off to a good start for the year with strong marketplace momentum for our Crown beer business as well as our U.S. wine and spirits business, which positions us well for fiscal 2013. Our new products are being very well received in the marketplace and we are planning several new initiatives in this area throughout the coming year. And of course, I hope you all have the opportunity to enjoy some of these fine products during the upcoming 4th of July holiday. So thanks, again, for your participation, everybody.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Maria, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Full Year Earnings Report. [Operator Instructions]  I would now turn the conference over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations, for opening comments. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End 2012 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.  This call complements our news release, which has been also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results.

Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed risk of list -- list of risk factors that may affect the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert Sands: Thanks, Patty, and good morning, and welcome to our call. This morning, I plan to discuss Constellation's year-end results and provide a high-level outline for our plans for fiscal 2013.  It is certainly worth noting that we have had a very productive year in 2012, delivering against a number of key strategic goals and business initiatives. I would like to take a minute to highlight some of our achievements.  I am especially pleased with our record free cash flow results and our significantly improved consolidated margin structure, resulting from last year's sale of our U.K. and Australian businesses. We utilized our free cash flow to reduce debt and repurchased more than $400 million of our shares in fiscal 2012. This follows a $300 million accelerated share buyback transaction, which was completed in fiscal 2011. And in fiscal 2013, we plan to continue to return value to our shareholders in the form of a new $1 billion share repurchase program that has been recently authorized by our Board of Directors. We expect to execute approximately 50% of the new authorization this year after repurchasing the remaining shares available under our fiscal 2012 authorization.  We purchased the remaining portion of the Ruffino wine business, which is an iconic old world wine brand that builds a niche for Constellation in the growing Italian premium wine category. Ruffino is one of our larger focus brands, posting depletion growth of almost 10% in fiscal 2012. It is also the #3 Italian super-premium wine brand in SymphonyIRI channels.  We became more unified and integrated as one company by advancing our fusion technology initiative, and we are currently implementing a shared service infrastructure. Collectively, these initiatives are designed to create an integrated technology platform and enhance the processes that support our business.  We expanded our international presence by establishing an office in Hong Kong, and we are currently in the process of exploring next steps for our emerging market participation strategy.  Fiscal 2012 marked our highest level of brand building activity in recent history, which is paying off in the marketplace. A few examples include SVEDKA. We introduced new packaging configurations and flavor profiles, which helped the brand to surpass Gray Goose in volume sales, making it the second largest imported vodka brand in the U.S. today.  We launched more than 25 new products in fiscal 2012, including the introduction of 4 new wine brands in fast-growing categories. They include Simply Naked, Primal Roots, Rioja Vega and The Dreaming Tree.  In the U.S. beer market, Crown continued its launch of Victoria, which posted significant growth and was awarded the Leader's Choice Award as the Best New Product by Market Watch magazine. Victoria has also become the #1 new beer in terms of dollar sales in the SymphonyIRI food, drug, mass and convenience channels.  In response to the need of consumers looking for additional ways to enjoy products, Crown also expanded its draft beer offerings, which resulted in depletion growth of almost 60% for this format and increased brand recognition for the Modelo Especial, Negra Modelo, Pacifico and Victoria brands.  We have recently launched the next phase of our U.S. distributor consolidation efforts in markets where it makes sense. The signing of multi-year agreements with additional U.S. distributors covering almost 10% of our U.S. wine and spirits volume will give them the right to sell Constellation's portfolio of wine and/or spirits exclusively in their respective markets.  In the first phase of our U.S. distributor consolidation initiative, which incurred -- occurred in the latter half of 2009, we gave exclusive appointments to 4 distributors to represent approximately 60% of our U.S. wine and spirits business in 22 states. As you know, the ultimate goal of this differentiated distributor model is to drive profitable organic growth through fully dedicated distributor teams more closely aligned with Constellation's sales force; investment of incremental marketing and promotional support behind Constellation brands; a distributor incentive structure designed to significantly increase distributor performance, with a focus on higher-margin, higher ROIC brands. One of the key metrics we utilized to measure the success of our U.S. distributor consolidation effort is depletion trends. I am pleased to report that those dates where our business has already transitioned to this model have outperformed the states where reconciliation has not occurred. And in terms of overall U.S. depletion performance for fiscal 2012, our distributor sales to retail for Constellation's total U.S. wine and spirits business across all channels increased approximately 2% for the year, with wine-only portion growing slightly less. In comparison from an industry perspective, according to recently released data from the Beverage Information Group for calendar 2011, the U.S. market grew about 2.5% in total across all channels. As previously discussed, our depletion results somewhat lagged the industry in fiscal 2012. This was primarily the result of price increases taken for some of our higher volume brands, which negatively impacted their sales to a greater degree than we originally anticipated, as well as soft performance for our Blackstone and Ravenswood brands.  However, we relaunched, reformulated and repackaged Blackstone and Ravenswood, which experienced improved depletion performance later in the year. And overall depletion trends improved as we progressed through the year due to the gating of promotional spend for our U.S. wine and spirits businesses. In fact, during the fourth quarter, we posted depletion growth of more than 7% for our entire portfolio, exceeding the growth rate of the total U.S. wine and spirits category.  Some of that fourth quarter performance was driven by channel fill for new products, which may unfavorably impact our sales and depletion performance in the first quarter. However, we expect consumer takeaway of our products at retail to continue to meet our expectations. Overall, we remain committed to growing in line with U.S. wine and spirits industry growth for fiscal 2013 and beyond.  For the year, SVEDKA posted double-digit depletion and consumer takeaway trends in addition to gaining volume share of the vodka category. SVEDKA remains one of the fastest-growing vodka brands and has become the #2 imported vodka in the U.S. It is also a top 100 global spirits brand, reaching more than 3.7 million cases in depletions in fiscal 2012. The new SVEDKA advertising campaign will debut this month, appearing on the top national cable TV stations and popular websites. Be sure to look for the fembot on your favorite cable TV channel, perhaps while you're watching Real Housewives on the Bravo channel or SportsCenter on ESPN.  Now I'd like to focus our discussion on where we're headed in fiscal 2013. We will continue to focus on innovation and new product development activities as we plan to introduce more than 50 new items throughout fiscal 2013, some of which are new brands or packaging innovations, such as Arbor Mist frozen wine cocktails. I am particularly excited about a new brand introduction called Thorny Rose, which is specifically targeted for the millennial generation.  As we've discussed today, today's wine market is growing by the legal drinking age millennials, a group which numbers more than 55 million and is expected to grow by an additional 12 million within the next 3 years. We have -- also have a national TV launch planned for our Black Box and new Simply Naked wine brands, which currently have great marketplace momentum.  Similar to last year, many of our new products are included in the hot categories that are experiencing significant growth, and we expect to have an increasing percentage of our overall sales growth this year coming from the contribution of new products. One of the most important things to keep in mind is that many of our new products will be line extensions to our existing portfolio of focus brands, which represent the majority of our U.S. wine profitability and posted depletion trends of more than 6% last year.  As many of these focus brands have recently received recognition in the form of awards and accolades, the following of which are particularly noteworthy. Constellation recently received Impact 2011 Hot Brand awards for SVEDKA, Franciscan, Kim Crawford, Rex Goliath and Black Box. Three of our newly launched U.S. wine brands were included in IRI's list of the Top 10 New Table Wine Brands.  We recently received Beverage Information Group's 2012 Growth Brand Awards for SVEDKA, Kim Crawford, Simply Naked, Primal Roots, The Dreaming Tree, Rioja Vega, Black Box, blüfeld and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. Our U.S. business was recognized with the 2012 Cheers' Supplier Excellence Award as Supplier of the Year for Best Large Wine Company and the Vibe Supplier Excellence Award as Supplier of the Year.  As you can infer from our fiscal 2013 guidance, our EBITDA growth this year will be somewhat impacted by our brand building initiatives, as well as additional sales investments. Bob will provide additional details on this in a moment. Now moving to our Crown imports joint venture. Crown had an exceptional year in the marketplace. Overall, calendar 2011 was the largest sales volume year for the collection of Modelo brands in the U.S. marketplace. And although you've heard us this many times throughout fiscal 2012, I believe it's worth repeating. Crown outperformed the total U.S. beer industry and the import category across both on- and off-premise channels and gained market share for the year. This is the result of a great product innovation, creative advertising campaigns, the ongoing support of wholesalers and excellent market execution.  Crown implemented several new initiatives, increased marketing investments and launched new items and packaging configurations in an effort to continue building value and increasing brand recognition. This is the 15th consecutive year that Corona Extra remains the leader in the premium imported beer category. Corona Familiar, a new SKU introduced in 2010, depleted more than 3.5 million cases in fiscal 2012. Modelo Especial remains the #3 imported beer in the U.S. This brand grew double digits and achieved a new milestone of 35 million cases sold last year. Corona Light holds the top spot among imported light beers, and Negra Modelo and Pacifico remain among the top 25 import brands, with Victoria already breaking through and becoming a top 25 brand as well.  Throughout fiscal 2012, Crown achieved several milestones and received recognition from some of the most notable beer and marketing channels in the industry, including Impact Hot Brand and Blue Chip Awards for Modelo Especial and Corona Light. These awards highlight the continuing success of the brand portfolio and underscore Crown's unique approach to marketing. As we head into fiscal 2013, Crown has some exciting marketing initiatives underway. Some examples include the Corona Win Your Beach Retail promotion, which was so successful during last year's summer selling season, will be bigger and better this year, offering consumers more ways to enter and more chances to win prizes of their choice to fit their preferred beach experience. This promotion will be accompanied by a new Win Your Beach TV spot.  Crown will be dedicating additional resources to its continuing sponsorship of Jon Gruden's ESPN Monday Night Football Countdown. And beginning in the second quarter, Crown will launch new advertising for Corona Light, which will be supplemented by a combined TV, digital and social media campaign. For Modelo Especial, the first-ever English language TV campaign will highlight the quality of Modelo Especial and engage the general market consumer. Separate advertising will continue for the Hispanic consumer as well. Crown will once again partner with Kenny Chesney for his U.S. tour, with Corona Light as the sponsor. This initiative allows for greater awareness opportunity for Corona Light and fits with the current Chesney consumer profile. TV commercials promoting Corona Light and Kenny will run in tour markets in the weeks leading up to the shows. The successful Find Your Beach advertising campaign will be extended, with new creative in fiscal 2013.  Crown also plans to expand its draft offerings and will introduce new packaging configurations to the Modelo Especial lineup during the year. These initiatives are expected to result in fiscal 2013 depletion and operating income growth in the low single-digit range for Crown.  Now with closing, as you can see, fiscal 2013 is shaping up to be another year of strong progress towards our strategic goals. With the achievements we made in fiscal 2012, our focus this year will remain largely unchanged. We will continue to drive growth in our base business through brand building and innovation, expand our international business in new and emerging markets and further strengthen the core of the company. And our strong free cash flow target enables us to create value in the form of significant share buyback program. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our year-end business results and forecasted guidance for 2013.
Robert P. Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis EPS for fiscal 2012 came in at $2.34. This result included tax rate benefits recognized in Q4, which drove the full year tax rate of 17% versus our previous 27% rate expectation. Exclusive of the reduced tax rate, our results were generally in line with our expectations.  From an operational perspective, our comparable basis operating margin improved more than 400 basis points, reflecting benefits from the sale of our Australian and U.K. business at the end of fiscal 2011. While our U.S. wines and spirits sales and depletions came in below target for the year, we saw improving trends in the fourth quarter, with good energy around new products and our focus brands.  On the beer side, marketing investments and solid execution drove strong marketplace performance for the year. Our EBIT came in a bit lower than originally expected. This was due to the North American wine sales results just discussed and realizing less sales mix benefit at Crown versus our initial expectations. SG&A austerity measures and some positive nonrecurring benefits mollified the impact of the sales shortfall on EBIT. From a free cash flow perspective, we generated $716 million for the year. This was a record by a large measure and included significant tax-related cash benefits. This strong result enabled us to repurchase a significant amount of stock, acquire the remaining interest in Ruffino business and reduce debt. I will outline more details on these activities in a moment. Given these brief highlights, let's look at fiscal 2012 P&L performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated reported net sales decreased 20%, primarily due to the divestiture of our Australian and U.K. business. North American net sales on an organic constant currency basis decreased 1%. This was primarily due to a decrease in volume, driven by the overlap of a distributor inventory build last year, partially offset by positive mix.  Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis. For the year, our consolidated gross margin was 40.1% versus 35.9% for the prior year. This primarily reflects the benefit of divesting the lower gross margin Australian and U.K. business, partially offset by the overlap of the prior year build in distributor inventory.  I'd now like to discuss the segment operating income results to provide highlights of our operating income change. North America segment operating income decreased $9 million to $622 million, primarily due to lower volume, partially offset by favorable mix. Corporate costs were down $25 million, primarily related to overlapping a higher compensation expense result in fiscal '11, lower professional services costs and the early redemption of notes receivable from Accolade, our former Australian and U.K. business. And as a reminder, the Australian/Europe segment reported EBIT of $15 million last year. Consolidated equity earnings totaled $229 million versus $244 million last year. The reduction is primarily due to the sale of our interest in Matthew Clark and other joint ventures as part of our Australian and U.K. business divestiture and from reduced earnings at Crown.  For the year, Crown generated net sales of $2.5 billion, an increase of 3%, and operating income of $431 million, a decrease of 5%. The net sales increase was primarily driven by volume growth of Modelo Especial and from the expansion of Corona Familiar and Victoria. Higher marketing cost drove the operating income decrease. Interest expense for the year was $181 million, down 7% versus the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings. Let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of February, our total debt totaled $3.1 billion. This represents a $107 million decrease from our debt level at the end of the previous year. Our continued strong free cash flow generation and deleveraging efforts over the past several years have enabled us to redeploy a portion of free cash flow to repurchase stock. During fiscal 2012, we repurchased 21.2 million shares at a cost of $414 million. That's an average cost of $19.48 a share. This follows a repurchase of 17.2 million shares at a cost of $300 million in fiscal '11. As a reminder, during the third quarter, we funded the purchase of the remaining 50% of the Ruffino business for EUR 50 million or USD $69 million. We also assumed debt, net of cash acquired, of EUR 54 million or USD $73 million. As mentioned earlier, our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 17%, which reflected a favorable outcome of various federal items in the second quarter and state tax items in the fourth quarter. This compares to a 30% rate for the prior year. This was a very favorable outcome that we highlighted as a possibility in our Q3 call.  Now let's briefly discuss Q4 results. The recognition of tax rate benefits in the fourth quarter helped drive a comparable basis EPS result of $0.69 versus $0.35 in Q4 last year. Organic constant currency net sales increased 5%, primarily due to volume growth and some favorable mix. The higher sales and lower SG&A helped to increase consolidated operating income by $19 million during Q4. Equity earnings for Crown in the quarter increased 2% to $49 million. For Q4, Crown's net sales increased 9% and operating income increased 2% as volume growth was mostly offset by higher marketing expense. Corporate expenses decreased $4 million, primarily due to lower compensation expense.  Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For fiscal 2012, we generated free cash flow of $716 million versus $531 million for the same period in the previous year. This improvement reflects a cash benefit for taxes, primarily driven by the sale of our U.K. business. In addition, our receivable balance increased less than the previous year due to the timing of sales, while interest payments and CapEx spending were lower. We're targeting free cash flow for fiscal 2013 in the $425 million to $475 million range. This includes CapEx in the range of $70 million to $80 million. The projected decrease in free cash flow from fiscal 2012 is primarily due to the absence of approximately $170 million in cash tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2012 related to the sale of our U.K. business. We are also expecting a higher inventory investment as we overlap the lower calendar 2011 harvest and higher interest cost, which I will discuss further in a few minutes. We still feel confident that we can generate $500 million plus a year in free cash flow over the longer term.  Now let's move to our free cash flow fiscal 2012 -- fiscal 2013 P&L outlook. We're forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of $1.93 to $2.03 versus our $2.34 result for fiscal '12. There are many moving parts in this comparison, including share repurchases, debt refinancing and the most significant driver, an increase in the full year tax rate. For fiscal '13, we anticipate getting closer to a statutory rate as we're targeting a tax rate of 34% versus the abnormal 17% rate in fiscal '12. As outlined by Rob, we expect to grow U.S. depletions in line with the U.S. category growth, and we expect shipment growth to align with depletion growth. This, combined with an anticipated mix benefit, is expected to result in sales growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. However, the overlap of our low fiscal 2012 SG&A, along with some additional brand building and selling investment in fiscal '13, is expected to keep operating income in the low single-digit growth range. For Crown, we're targeting low single-digit depletion and operating income growth for the year. This depletion expectation versus fiscal 2012 is due to the overlap of the Victoria and Corona Familiar rollouts. A contractual COGS increase will keep operating income growth slightly less than net sales growth. We look forward to celebrating Cinco de Mayo again this year by ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, May 4.  As discussed earlier, the company repurchased 21.2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $414 million during fiscal '12. Since the end of fiscal '12 through March 31, the company repurchased an additional 2.1 million shares at a cost of $46 million. Through March 31, the company has purchased a total of 23.3 million shares at a cost of $460 million under its current $500 million authorization.  Our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase of up to $1 billion of common stock. This is in addition to the remaining $40 million under the fiscal 2012 authorization. The company currently expects to execute the new $1 billion authorization over a 2-year period. As a result of the various activities just outlined, we're targeting $550 million to $600 million of total share repurchases in our fiscal 2013 guidance. In the near term, we plan to take advantage of the favorable credit and public debt market environment. This should further enhance financial flexibility, while executing our new repurchase authorization. The anticipated share repurchases and debt refinancing activities have been factored into our guidance. As a result, we're targeting interest expense in the range of $210 million to $220 million and weighted average shares in the range of 185 million to 190 million for fiscal 2013.  The forecasted increase in interest is being driven by an assumption that we can issue fixed rate public debt quite early in our fiscal year at an interest rate more favorable than our current fixed rate notes but a rate higher than current bank debt. Interest will also be unfavorably impacted by the full year effect of an interest rate swap that became effective on September 2011 and from the full year impact of the funding of the Ruffino purchase. From a leverage perspective, our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio came in at 3.6x at the end of fiscal 2012. Even with the share repurchase and refinancing activity that I just outlined, our goal for fiscal '13 is to continue to maintain a leverage ratio in our targeted 3x to 4x range. I would like to note that from a gating perspective, we expect fiscal 2013 Q1 EBIT performance to come in approximately 5% to 10% below Q1 of fiscal 2012, and we expect higher interest expense throughout the year. The EBIT reduction is due to lower sales growth in Q1 due to timing and overlaps. This is due in part to timing of promotional spending, reflecting support of new products and from a more even distribution of promotional expense throughout fiscal 2013. As a reminder, fiscal 2012 promotional spending was weighted to the second half of the year. In addition, we expect Q1 to be impacted by timing of U.S. marketing expense as we launch new SVEDKA advertising and support several other new products.  Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the press release. For fiscal 2013, we expect to incur diluted EPS charges of $0.04 for these items. This primarily relates to our cost reduction and efficiency initiative, focused on centralizing certain administrative, operational and commercial functions on a global basis that we previously outlined at Q1 of fiscal '12. This is timing-related and represents charges that were originally targeted to occur in fiscal '12 that have shifted into fiscal '13. As we entered fiscal 2012, we're a very different company from just a few years ago. We've greatly increased our focus on profitable organic growth, and we are beginning to see results. In Q4, our sales growth accelerated as our new products began to have a greater impact on our top line. The efficiencies from our ongoing COGS reduction activities have helped offset some of the inflationary pressures around grapes and transportation and should benefit us as we move forward.  We have also focused on improving our balance sheet. We've greatly improved our free cash flow generation, reduced leverage and returned significant cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Since the end of fiscal 2010, we've reduced debt by over $700 million and reduced our EBITDA leverage ratio from 4.1x to 3.6x, while buying back over $700 million of stock and acquiring the remainder of Ruffino. For fiscal 2012, free cash flow hit an all-time high, and EPS greatly exceeded guidance provided at the beginning of the year, primarily due to tax benefits and share repurchases. Although we did not hit our top line targets, we were able to offset most of the shortfall with lower SG&A.  For fiscal '13, we're expecting to utilize our commercial product initiatives to grow in line with the U.S. wine market. We plan to return cash to shareholders through stock repurchases, while continuing to focus on maintaining a healthy balance sheet. We plan to take advantage of the current favorable debt markets to refinance our debt. While these actions will result in higher net debt and interest expense, they lengthen the tenure of our debt. We remain focused on maintaining our 3x to 4x leverage ratio target.  With that, we'll open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of UBS.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I guess first question on the step-up in spending. Is this a fiscal '13 onetime step-up? Should we be thinking of it as part of the base or something that you're going to be stepping up spending in fiscal '13 and then as we look forward from that point, it starts to come down?
Robert Sands: Yes, Kaumil, it really depends. All I can say is that, certainly, we're putting more investment behind brand building in 2013. As to what we'll do in the future, a lot will depend upon the competitiveness in the marketplace, what happens with grapes supply and pricing. So it's hard to say what we'll do past 2013. But obviously, our intention is to translate our sales growth into good earnings growth in the future.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got it. Then maybe if I could ask a slightly different way. Given the success of some of the new products in the wine industry over the last couple of years and how much they've contributed to growth in the wine industry, do you feel that maybe structurally it's changed, the cost of growth is perhaps higher than it used to be?
Robert Sands: Well, I think that sort of post the recession, the market has been very competitive. Promotional expense in wine, in particular, has been higher and has remained higher over the last several years. The consumer is definitely looking for a bargain when it comes to the buying of product. On the other hand, I'd say the growth has been pretty robust, and there's a lot of good activity in terms of consumers and new consumers in the wine market. So I think that bodes well for the future.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then also in the same context of marketing, there was a step-up in marketing at Crown. We know what the numbers are for the year. Can you talk about the -- your need or desire to spend on Crown for fiscal 2013? And then also, I may have missed it, I don't know, in your commentary, did you provide us with what the current depletions were at Crown as well?
Robert P. Ryder: For which year, Kaumil?
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So I don't know if you gave us a quarter to date after giving us what your current reported quarter was on Crown trends.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, in fiscal '12, depletions were like up mid-single digits. For fiscal '13, they're going to be low single digits. And for the fourth quarter, both shipments and depletions were up quite a bit. That's in the press release. And really, as you know, the beer industry really had a good fourth quarter. It kind of surprised everyone in the industry, I think, but we're all happy about it. Maybe the warmer weather, maybe some economic recovery helped the beer industry come back a little bit. As far as marketing spend in Crown, I think the big increase in marketing spend is behind us. That was -- that would have been fully realized in fiscal '12. In fiscal '13, the marketing spend will be more business as usual. So we don't expect a big increase in marketing spending in fiscal '13. We continue to expect some great advertising and some great new media behind our products, but it won't be an absolute increase in spend.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then, Bob, also for you, and this is kind of brings back -- a little bit back of the envelope math. But based on your commentary on taking advantage of the current state of the debt markets, at least to me, it sounds like you could be raising up to $1 billion. Looking at your leverage, looking at the buyback, the amount of free cash flow that you're guiding towards, there will be quite a bit of cash, I think, sitting there. What would be -- could you maybe talk about what the uses of that cash would be?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I think depending on when we go in the market and how our rates move, I think we might be sitting on a little bit of cash for a short period of time. But I think right now, the use of the cash will be to reinvest in the business. And outside of reinvesting the business, the primary use will be to buy back shares.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Rob and Bob, I guess you've talked about how the company is now in a better position to grow profitably on an organic basis. I sort of looked at your P&Ls in the last 2 or 3 years. Your EBIT has been essentially flat, and you have another year where EBIT is barely going to grow. So I guess conceptually and structurally speaking, when you look at your business, is this a business where you think you can at best grow in line with the category growth and pretty much get no leverage in terms of growing EBIT above your sales growth? Or do you think that this is still a business where you can still potentially get pretty healthy sales growth and that potentially translates to healthy EBIT growth? And how do we get confidence that, that will be the case over time?
Robert Sands: Yes, Judy, I think what's going on is, first of all, this year or last year, I should say, 2012 was a little disappointing in terms of our overall growth. And we felt that the healthiest thing to do for the business was to increase our investment behind brand building to really keep the momentum that we developed in the fourth quarter going throughout 2013. And that is what is resulting in, I'll say, the muted EBIT growth although we are growing EBIT. Now to your specific question, we definitely think that we can leverage the P&L, so to speak. It's not going to occur overall in 2013. But as we introduce new products, take advantage of some of the new trends in the marketplace, continue the kind of underlying sales growth momentum that we've achieved relative to consumer takeaway, we definitely think that we can leverage the P&L and grow EBIT therefore faster than sales.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Judy, this is Bob. Just to follow up on that, there's a bit of timing involved here. So remember, we did fall short of our sales expectations in fiscal '12. At the beginning of the year, we said we expected to grow with the U.S. wine market. We did not do that. Yet, we pretty much -- we actually blew our EPS estimate away but most of that was due to taxes. But we pretty much hit the EBIT number. Now that was due to some fortuitous SG&A outcomes, which I talked about, I think, in the third quarter call, some positives there that hit the SG&A line and some belt-tightening. So I think the company said, "Hey, we're not hitting the sales numbers. Let's really try to go after the EBIT." In fiscal '13, we do expect to grow with the market, and we are making some increased brand investments. But remember, we got those SG&A overlaps, which is holding back our EBIT growth. So I wouldn't say, if you're just saying Constellation in the wine industry in general, I would hope that in a normal year with a lot of strange overlaps, that you could grow EBIT at least very close to what you're growing your net sales number. And as you know, the net sales growth in the wine category is pretty healthy.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just maybe to follow up on that, Bob. So can you quantify the SG&A overlap and then the brand investment step-up?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, for '13 over '12, I think we told the SG&A overlaps were $7 million to $10 million were positives in '12 that we're nonrecurring. And we -- I don't have a number on the top of my head for the brand building initiatives because it's in a lot of different areas. Its increased sales cost, increased marketing cost and some increased promotion costs. Some of the increased brand building costs kind of go with the mix shift in the business because the higher priced wine tends to carry with it higher brand building costs. So some of that is natural, and some of it is a little bit of a ramp-up in the stuff because we're playing a little bit of catch-up after fiscal '12. But I think the fourth quarter showed that we are very close to being caught up, and we're pretty confident about the top line estimates for fiscal '13.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And Bob, the 7% depletion growth in Q4, you said that there was some channel fill that helped that number. Can you quantify how much that is? When you said the sales growth in fiscal '13, I think you said low to mid-single-digit, is that incorporating, I guess, the negative impact as the channel fill is reversed?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. So the guidance would incorporate kind of the reversal of those -- the channel fill for the new product because you just have to make sure everything is loaded before the commercial activities kick in. So in general, I'd say the channel fill might have added to the top line growth, maybe 2% or 3%, in the fourth quarter.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: 2% or 3%, okay. Okay. And then Bob, just in terms of ongoing tax rate, so obviously, 2012 was a good year. It steps up to 34%. I was under the impression that over time, you also have the opportunity to lower your effective tax rate. Is that not the case anymore? How should we think about your long-term tax rate?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, so really, the last few years, from a tax rate perspective, have been anomalous because we've been able to take advantage of some opportunities from some international tax planning. Now going forward, as we're primarily a North American business, and really most of our sales and most of our people are in pretty high-tax states, mostly California and New York, probably the statutory rate for us would be around 38%. So a 34% rate next year also has some positive tax planning in it. And we have a very good tax department, so I presume that we'll always have some positive tax planning. But I would say, on an ongoing basis, we should assume a statutory tax rate, probably 34% to 37%. The cash tax rates might be below that because of some timing benefits.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Torres of HSBC.
Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division: My question has to do with pricing, particularly at Crown. As we know, we haven't pricing there for quite some time. Just curious, when or where do you think there's opportunity to do that? I mean, are you just reacting to your competitors? Do you think the environment is just not ready for it? And then I guess just thinking about your guidance, as you talk about, I guess, low single-digit income growth this year at Crown, how do you get there if you're increasing your spend, not taking pricing? I mean, is this all volume or there's something else in that number that we should understand?
Robert P. Ryder: I would say, in beer pricing, Crown did take pricing in the fall of calendar '11, not quite as much as the domestic players took, but it took some pricing, which you can see in IRI. And remember, Crown, although it's the number -- it's the third largest beer company in the U.S., it's a very distant #3. So I would say that for fiscal '13, our beer business is closely watching what the large domestic players do. And should they move up, and generally they do in -- after the peak summer season, we might follow. Over the last few years, because of the economy and some other reasons, we've -- the import beer price gap to the domestic premium has gotten less. So we're closer priced to the domestic premium, but I would hope -- I think that, that reduction has stopped. So we're not anticipating in our guidance a lot of pricing in beer. But if the domestic guys move and we feel that we can move, we'll probably look at it in certain regions. I would say for the Crown earnings guidance, essentially, the EBIT growth is coming from increased volumes. The operating earnings guidance growth is slightly less than the net sales growth because of the contractual cost of goods sold increase from Modelo, the brand owner.
Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division: Okay. And when we think about that cost increase you just mentioned and the spend -- the marketing spend this year versus last, I mean, is this significant as far as what's going into the business in fiscal '13 versus last year?
Robert P. Ryder: No, I'd say the cost of goods sold increase on a percentage basis is less than CPI. So it's, say, 1% to 2% kind of rate, and marketing spend in fiscal '13 will not be much more than the marketing spend in fiscal '12.
Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division: So the volume growth that you're expecting, I don't know if you mentioned, is it similar to low to mid-single-digit or mid-single-digit for this year at Crown? Like you said, that's coming from volume growth. So in your sense, is that being supported just by more investment, new brand instructions, more draft? What's driving that growth? If we saw such a good year last year, why should we expect the same this year?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, I think we've got some good momentum in the marketplace from some pretty good media spend. We -- our weight in media has increased because of our big marketing increases in both fiscal '11 and fiscal '12. Specifically, Modelo Especial has some great momentum if you look at IRI. I mean it's growing double digits. The import Beer business, in general, is quite robust. So we feel that, that growth will continue into next year, and that's why we give the guidance of say, low single-digit net sales growth for next year. I think that it's just less than fiscal '12 because we're overlapping the very successful introduction and rollout of Victoria and the Corona Familiar, which is a 32-ounce Corona Extra mostly targeted at the convenience store channel, where that brand has helped us gain a lot of share in the convenience channel.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of D.A. Davidson.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Just following up on the commentary on the higher depletion growth in the fourth quarter being somewhat related to the channel. I mean, normally, we think about depletions as being a fairly sanitized number. So what was going on at the retailer level to build inventory there? Were you offering promotions through your distribution system that caused inventory build at the retail level or can you characterize that?
Robert Sands: Sure, Tim. What we said was that the channel sale was related primarily to the distribution of new products. So when you put new products in, right, the first step is getting the new product from the distributor to the retailer, which doesn't necessarily or, in fact, doesn't at all, reflect consumer takeaway. Right? So when you got a big new product pipeline, you're going to have some channel sales from the distributor to the retailer. That's what we were talking about.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Got you, okay. And then just relating back to an earlier question. Can you be more specific about what you plan to do with terming out a portion of your debt? It would be helpful for our modeling because I think that, of course, was the big variance for most folks in terms of their outlook versus what you said today.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I mean, I think, essentially, what we'll be doing, Tim, is -- and you see this with a lot of your other companies that the debt markets are quite robust. There's a lot of demand for less-than-investment grade paper, and we would be included in that. So we're going to take advantage of the rate environment and refinance our bank debt and also access the senior note market. So the -- we think with senior notes, we can get very good rates on, say, 8- to 10-year paper, which we'll be very happy to have, I think, as the interest rates go up going into the future. This gives us quite a bit of liquidity and gives us a good staggered tenure on our debt portfolio.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: I get all of that. But do you have a way of kind of telling us the size of that, Bob, or is it something like $1 billion?
Robert P. Ryder: No, we don't know. We have to wait until we go into the marketplace.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Okay. What size were you thinking of when you issued $210 million to $220 million in interest expense guidance?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, again, Tim, you just have to wait until we issue our papers around that. Now remember, there's also the stuff that is out there is -- I mentioned in my comments, that we'll have a full year of our interest rate swap next year versus only a partial year in fiscal '12, so that will increase interest expense. And we also financed much of the Ruffino purchase with euro-denominated debt. So we'll have a full year of that debt year-over-year as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research.
Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Just a quick question. If you guys are investing the business in '13 and you're accelerating innovation, why is it that we shouldn't expect a step-up in the growth rate versus your long-term targets?
Robert Sands: Well, I think that in general, there's a lot of things going on in the portfolio. Yes, there will be a step-up in growth rates related to innovation. There's also the tactical end of our portfolio, which we manage in a different basis. So we're generally planning on growing in line with the market. Now when we say that, innovation is very robust in the market. So if you look at what percentage of the growth in the market is related to innovation, it's very high. So basically, we're going to be matching that. And in general, we expect, being the largest premium plus wine player, that we'll grow in line with the premium plus category.
Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC: Great. And then just one follow-up. If the U.S. industry is more likely to be in shortage in the coming years, can you just talk about your, I guess, confidence and ability to offset rising input costs, basically to get back to the question of being able to grow EBIT at or above sales growth?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, if you've been reading the industry newspapers, you're right. The U.S. wine harvest was less than it was the previous year. And as you know, the U.S. wine growth is still robust. Consumers want more growth. So there's more people chasing fewer grapes. We are obviating some of those issues because of some of the initiatives we undertook 2 or 3 years ago to consolidate our wineries, consolidate our bottling lines, and our winemakers have done a lot of fantastic work in reducing the costs of our wines without impacting the quality. So I think the benefits of those initiatives will be offsetting most of the increase in the cost per ton of grapes that did actually happen in this year's harvest and most likely will happen again in next year's harvest.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Reza Vahabzadeh of Barclays.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: Just on the leverage target, you mentioned 3x to 4x in FY '13. Is that the same leverage target from thereon as well?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, on a longer-term basis, we expect to stay within 3x to 4x EBITDA leverage ratio.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: Got it. And then did you just comment on on-premise sales for Crown, as well as your wine and spirits portfolio?
Robert Sands: Yes, we did. We said that we gained share in both on- and off-premise for Crown.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: And is that channel improving, strengthening from where you sit?
Robert Sands: Yes, we think that the on-premise channel is definitely strengthening with the improvement in the economy. Right now, I'd say that as we moved into 2012, off-premise channel is growing low single digits from flat to down in previous years, flat last year, down prior to that.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: Got it. And then you talked about productivity savings in the base business last couple of years. Is there more to go here in FY '13 and '14?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, we're constantly looking at productivity measures. I think in some of the comments we talked about, some shared service activities, it will be looking at -- that will be getting productivity and we're constantly looking certainly, as I mentioned, in the cost of goods sold area, most of our operations guys wake up in the morning thinking of productivity measures. So that's an ongoing initiative that we have.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: But the rate of realization of the productivity savings, is that going to moderate from last couple of years?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I would say it will moderate because we've had some pretty dramatic reductions over the last 2 or 3 years.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: Right. And then on the cost of goods inflation, you mentioned low single digits, a couple of percent on the Crown side. What's the rate of cost inflation in FY '13 for the wine and spirits portfolio?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, our operating costs in the wine business, because of our productivity initiatives, we expect cost per case to be just up slightly.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: Got it. So that's net of savings?
Robert P. Ryder: Pardon?
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: That's net of your savings?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. Yes, that's net of everything. That's all in.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I guess, a few topics, firstly, with SVEDKA. Can you give us some numbers there, where we are in terms of portion of mix that is SVEDKA and how that brand did in the latest quarter?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I mean, SVEDKA for fiscal '12 grew. You see in IRI, it grew quite robustly. Depletions were still up double digits and total volumes are just short of 4 million cases.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it. And how did it do in the latest quarter?
Robert P. Ryder: The fourth quarter was similar to that. Actually, like the other products in the fourth quarter, it actually did better than its full year number.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it, great. Okay, and then just changing topics. Bob, as we think about this free cash flow delta, the $425 million to $475 million and the long-term objective being $500 million plus. How much -- there's obviously a lot of moving parts here in the coming fiscal year, but on the -- and you mentioned inventory drag in your prepared remarks, kind of higher level of inventory. Can you give us a number there? How -- are we talking $10 million, $20 million, $30 million? Can you just give us either...
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I'd say, Mark, we've gotten -- with all the initiatives in our operations function, we've gotten quite a bit of inventory, which you can see in our free cash flow, out of the business over the last 2 years. I'd say, what happened in fiscal '12 is the harvest came in a little bit light. Okay? And our volumes came in lighter than we expected, so we didn't have to buy as much bulk wine in fiscal '12, and we were able to sell-through preexisting products. So I'd say we had better inventory results in '12 than we probably should have, certainly better than we anticipated. But now what happened is since in '13, we expect to grow with the category. The wine that we didn't take in, in '12, we have to taken in, in '13, okay, to fuel the growth. And we expect absolute growth to be higher in '13 than it was in '12. So all that being said, if it were more normalized, I think our '13 guidance would have been in the $500 million range. So I'd say that inventory switch from year-to-year, it was probably worth $30 million to $50 million.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it. Okay, that makes sense. And staying on this topic of free cash flow and trying to think about the underlying business versus what's happening in fiscal '13. The borrowing costs are going up this year. You've talked about why and that's helpful stuff. But as we think about getting beyond the effects of the swap, getting beyond the effects of the refinancing and just assume for a moment, maybe just the constant level of absolute net debt, can you speak generally to -- again, are we talking $5 million, $10 million, $50 million? How much higher than kind of the underlying new, if you will, cap structure do you think this interest expense guidance of $210 million to $220 million, is it above the underlying number or do you think the underlying really, it's representative of the underlying number?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, I think the number that we're giving for next year will reflect the average borrowings for the year and the average rates for this year. Now it will depend if we buy a lot of stock back, I would expect our principal balance to go up. If we do an acquisition, I would expect our principal balance to go up. But the plan now is to issue senior notes, which will be fixed rate, and to refinance the bank debt. But because the swap, actually most of our bank debt is also fixed. So the rates, when we come out with the loan paper, should be pretty well known. And it will depend how much we tap into the revolver, the new revolver that we will be issuing in fiscal '13.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it, okay. And then I don't know if it's you Bob or Rob, but just thinking about the business itself and this question Judy raised and kind of -- and perhaps just kind of this issue of when do we get to kind of a sweeter spot, so to speak. What in your opinion -- is it a moment in time? Is it a change in the way you run your business? Is it something happening out there in the marketplace? Because this cycle of growth but it's going to cost you has been going on for quite a while. So is there something you're seeing either up in the marketplace or in the way you run your business that makes you think, okay, you get to the end of fiscal '13 and we're really going to be in a sweeter spot?
Robert Sands: Yes, I think that you could say that we will be in a sweeter spot. But first and foremost, the important thing is to ensure that our business is healthy, our brands are strong, that we've got the right products within our brands to take advantage of the trends in the marketplace. That's the first thing that we need to make sure is the case. And we've been working on that and actually quite successfully throughout last year, and we'll continue to work on that this year. As I said to Judy, I do expect that we will be able to leverage that into EBIT growth. So no, it's not a point in time, and we'll have to continue to keep our eye on the market and make sure that we're successful in our brand building activities. But I would say that we should be able to see a pretty positive result relative to that in the relatively short term, talking beyond FY '13. Now obviously, there's been a lot of improvement in the business. We've streamlined our portfolio. We've functionalized the business. We've improved our go-to-market strategy. Our free cash flow results have been, I think, quite stellar, and we've significantly reduced debt. So you're already seeing a lot of the benefits of our activities, as well as our return of value to our shareholders with over $700 million of stock repurchases over the last 2 years and another $1 billion announced with this release. So I think that there's been a huge amount of positive progress.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then finally, as we think about where this incremental spending is going, you've called out some specific activities, China, new products, some national TV, I believe, new campaign for SVEDKA. Is there any way to sort of just give us a sense of relative emphasis? I mean, China, for example, obviously, a market that's growing and has a lot of potential. But as we think about you're looking at your total spend budget this coming fiscal year versus the past, how do we rank or how do you rank where those new dollars are going?
Robert Sands: Well, I think they're going into the things that you mentioned. Those are exactly the items that are driving increased expense. So it's SVEDKA advertising. It's television advertising campaigns on Black Box, on Simply Naked. SVEDKA, as you mentioned, it's more investment to build the business in China. So those are the major items.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And is there anyone that stands out larger in terms of year-on-year increase versus the other? Is it evenly spread?
Robert Sands: Yes, it's evenly spread. I mean, it's a bit here, a bit there so.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Albanese of Auriga.
Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division: Just going back to the taxes. I know you mentioned the 34% expected rate. Are there any more potential tax benefits that are being negotiated or is that all resolved now?
Robert P. Ryder: Look, we're always working on new stuff, and they all have different levels of probabilities. 34% rate for next year, I think, has our highest level of probability. But we're already planning for things in '14 and '15. So hopefully, they'll come to fruition. But at -- remember, we are primarily a North American business. So actually, a 34% effective tax rate for a strictly North American business, especially heavily weighted towards high-tax states, is actually a pretty good rate.
Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division: Okay, okay. And just going back to the working capital, the expectations for usage -- uses for this year. Are you able to quantify what the expected use is going to be?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, when you say usage, I mean the big swing...
Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division: In terms of the amount.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I won't give numbers. But the big swing is going to be in the inventory line item. Okay? Because we've seen some pretty good performance in inventories, actually, over the last 2 or 3 years. And I think next year, there's a bit of a catch-up because we probably had a bit too much of positives in fiscal '12. Because remember in fiscal '12, we generated over $700 million of free cash flow. That's quite a number for a business our size. So there's a bit of catch-up on inventories in '13. I think also interest -- cash interest will be higher in '13 because of the refinancing. So outside of taxes, it will be in inventories and interest.
Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division: Okay. And just regarding on Victoria, can you talk about the rollout, how far -- how much is it, how far has it been rolled out in terms of the coverage in domestically and how much you expect it to be rolled out this year?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I'd say, we've -- geographically, I think right now, we're going to take a pause. It's been rolled out to all of the large states that we anticipate. And really the strategy was Victoria is a very well known and one of the oldest beer brands in Mexico, so the strategy was to roll it out in cities where the Mexican consumer would recognize the brand and would have very good sell-through. I think on a go-forward basis, we're taking a little bit more pause as far as what geographies we would roll it out to because I think, so far, it was P&L positive right off the bat because the consumer knew what it was. To roll it out in additional cities where the brand is not as well-known will take a lot more investment, so we're thinking of that more carefully.
Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. Just one last thing, when do expect to file your K, your 10-K?
Robert P. Ryder: I believe it's going to be in the end of April.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Dreyer of Gabelli Asset Management.
Kevin V. Dreyer - GAMCO Investors, Inc.: Just curious about Crown. Is there any update or what's your thinking or expectation regarding that business going forward? Are you going to be trying to negotiate over the next year or so for an extension of the agreement? I think -- correct me if I'm wrong, but they have -- they would have to notify you by the end of 2013 if they were planning to do something different with that business?
Robert Sands: Yes, they have to notify us at the end of that in 2013, which is 3 years in advance of the end of the contract of what their intention is relative to the end of the contract. So that's still 1 3/4 year off, and then there's 3 years left on the contract, which means that there's almost 5 years left on the contract. So I think it's premature to really know what any of the parties' intentions are in that regard.
Kevin V. Dreyer - GAMCO Investors, Inc.: Okay. And just about the wine industry generally, I'm curious with the repurchase announcement. Do you expect further consolidation in the industry over the next year or 2? And if so, would you plan to participate in that?
Robert Sands: Yes, I'd say we would expect to see some further consolidation in the industry. There's been some deals that have been done. Our primary use of free cash flow, as we have indicated, is that -- is now really to focus on our stock buyback program. So we also have capacity if a strategic acquisition comes along that we think that fits well in the portfolio, it meets our financial criterion, we have the capacity to continue to buy back stock and do that as well. So it really depends on what opportunities are out there, so maybe is the answer to that question. But in the interim, our primary focus is going to be on the stock buyback program and returning cash therefore to shareholders in that form.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just -- I wanted to ask your view on -- relative to, I guess, where you're expecting the industry to grow this year. Is there a pricing expectation built into your growth assumptions for the industry? And then, is there any pricing embedded in your own revenue assumptions for fiscal '13?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Bryan, this is Bob. We did not bake any pricing into our guidance. The wine category continues to be relatively promotional versus the other beverage alcohol. And as far as the growth for the industry, we're assuming it's low to mid-single digits.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So your base case is that the industry will kind of -- will remain the same in terms of the trade-off for the balance between volume and pricing?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, yes, but remember the industry always tends to experience positive mix shifts. So we can still expect net sales to grow higher than volumes. But right now, we're not anticipating any increase in pricing.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then based on the comments that you had made earlier with regards to your -- I guess, your net inflation, your inflation being offset to some degree by -- or almost fully offset by productivity. Is -- there's not a real need from your end at least over the next 12 months to raise prices to cover your cost of goods inflation. Is that correct?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, again, it's -- I wish it were that formulaic, right, because there's a lot of competitors out there with different motivations. So we're assuming that we won't be able to price, and we've got to offset our own inflation because we are focused on growing EBIT.
Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Right. I guess what I'm driving is, is it just given you're seeing some tightness in supply, not just on grapes, but even in bulk wine, there's some tightness in supply in California right now. And we're beginning to see or hear that some of your competitors, especially at the value end, you're starting to see some price increases get pushed through. And that -- to the extent that the industry, there's some pricing in the industry, is it right to think about your plan as you've got some flexibility with regards to whether or not you'd follow? And if there is some benefit to be derived from pricing, that's sort of upside to your base case. Is that the right way to think about I?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I mean, obviously, we're -- like all the other wine competitors, we're keeping a close eye on what each other is doing. And it's a constant balance between pricing and volumes, right, so -- and market share. So we'll keep a close eye on it. We're not anticipating price increases because remember, depending on the product and the price point, the bulk wine that's bought, how long is it before it hits the cost of goods sold line? And that depends on the aging and the price point of the wine. But we have a lot of people keeping a close eye on what's going on in the market, and we're constantly balancing those priorities.
Operator: And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I'll now turn the call back over to Rob Sands for any closing remarks.
Robert Sands: Well, thanks for joining our call today. And as I have indicated, I am very pleased with the progress that we've made throughout the past year in terms of improving our financial profile and the areas of free cash flow generation, debt reduction and margin improvement. In addition, we have strong marketplace momentum for our Crown beer business, as well as our U.S. wine and spirits business, which positions us well for fiscal 2013. Our new products are being well received in the marketplace, and we are planning several new initiatives in this area throughout the coming year. Our plan for fiscal 2013 is to continue to execute on our strategic initiatives and driving profitable organic growth.  We will be on the road frequently throughout the months of April and May, and Bob and I look forward to seeing many of you. Thanks again for your participation in our call.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2012 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com under the Investors section and Financial History. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert Sands: Thanks, Patty, and good morning, and happy new year to everyone. I hope you all had a great holiday and the opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products throughout the season. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2012 Sales and Earnings Results.  We continue to progress through the year with results that are generally in line with our expectations for most areas of the business. I'm especially pleased with our significantly improved consolidated margin structure and our continued progress in the area of free cash flow generation, which has essentially enabled us to fund our share repurchase efforts where we have already completed more than 50% of our current authorization. Our top line performance for the quarter was not surprising, as we continue to lap last year's third quarter U.S. distributor inventory build. As a reminder, our shipments to distributors last year exceeded distributors’ sales to retail as part of our U.S. distributor transition initiative. This had the effect of benefiting our sales and profits for fiscal 2011, but created a sales and EBIT comparison challenge for fiscal 2012. Now despite these sales trends, our U.S. Wine & Spirits depletions improved sequentially during the third quarter, with the entire portfolio growing almost 2% and focused brands growing about 6%. As previously discussed, we expected our depletion trends to improve as we progressed through the year due to the gating of the promotional spend for our U.S. Wine & Spirits businesses. This year, we are driving enhanced promotional and merchandising activity in the second half to better align with the seasonality of our business. As such, you can see in the IRI data, coinciding with our third quarter, that we gained volume share for total table wine and the Premium Plus segment, which represents the greater-than-$5 retail price point. This channel accounts for about 35% of our business. And our spirits sales remain robust as we gain share driven by our SVEDKA Vodka brand. However, growth for our total U.S. wine portfolio continues to lag that of the overall U.S. wine category on a year-to-date basis through the third quarter. Our U.S. wine share loss for this time period can be primarily attributed to a decline in value brands below the $5 retail price point as we increased net prices for some of our higher volume value brands such as Vendange and Arbor Mist. As would be expected, this action negatively impacted volumes, but to a bit greater degree than we originally anticipated. So what are we doing about this market share issue? We are in the process of revamping up innovation and new product development where we currently have more than 20 new product launches underway in fiscal 2012, many of which are included in hot categories that are experiencing significant growth. We currently have strong momentum for many of our newly launched products like Primal Roots Sweet Red Blend, Rex Goliath Moscato, Ruffino Prosecco, Woodbridge Malbec and the Simply Naked unoaked line of varietals. Our most recent introduction to the new product lineup is The Dreaming Tree brand, a collaboration between Steve Reeder, our award-winning winemaker at Simi, and acclaimed musician Dave Matthews, that is receiving rave reviews. This collection of new products is gaining traction and performed very well in the marketplace during the holiday selling season. And next year in fiscal 2013, we expect to have an increasing percentage of our sales growth coming from innovation. As I mentioned earlier, from a depletion perspective, during the third quarter our focus brands grew almost 6%, with several brands growing double digits, including SVEDKA Vodka, Black Box, Rex Goliath and Kim Crawford, just to name a few. However, the previously mentioned price increase on Arbor Mist has reduced our focus brands growth rate somewhat. To mitigate this, we have introduced Arbor Mist Pomegranate Berry Pinot Noir, which is doing very well in the marketplace, and we recently launched Arbor Mist Strawberry Moscato at Wal-Mart. This new flavor extension has exceeded all initial launch expectations. Next month, we are introducing Arbor Mist frozen wine cocktails at Wal-Mart in order to capitalize on one of the fastest-growing segments in beverage alcohol. We have other initiatives underway to drive some of our key focus brands. They include our recent relaunch of the Ravenswood brand with new labeling and a refinement of the Ravenswood blend to produce a more fruit-forward taste profile. Ravenswood is a great turnaround story, with recent SymphonyIRI trend showing mid-single digit volume growth rates during the third quarter.  For Blackstone, we have new packaging in the works and 2 new line extensions. A red blend was introduced last fall, and we will be rolling out a Malbec in the New Year. One of the things which I am particularly proud is the string of awards and accolades that we continue to receive for many of our focus brands from several industry-leading publications. They include the following: in the December 31 issue of Wine Spectator, the 2008 Robert Mondavi Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon was named one of the Top 100 Wines of 2011. Wine Spectator also awarded the 2008 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay 93 points, while the 2009 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Reserve Pinot Noir was awarded a 91-point score. The Franciscan Cabernet Sauvignon 2007 was named to the Wine Enthusiast Top 100 of 2011 list. And the Inniskillin 2007 Vidal Icewine received 92 points from the wine enthusiasts and 95 points from the tasting panel. Five of our brands made wine.com's Top 100 list for 2011, including varietals from Franciscan, Robert Mondavi, Ravenswood, Ruffino and Kim Crawford. Finally, IMPACT Blue Chip awards were given to Clos du Bois, Estancia, Robert Mondavi Private Selection and SVEDKA.  Overall, we are catching up with industry trends in addressing some of the short-term challenges we face within our portfolio of brands. As you can see, we have several initiatives underway, and I believe we are firing on all cylinders from an innovation and new product development perspective.  While our recent trends are improving, we are tracking a bit short of our goal of growing in line with the U.S. wine category growth for the year due primarily to our tactical decision earlier this year to take pricing in the value segment. However, we remain focused on achieving this goal and we are strongly committed to this as one of our strategic objectives in driving profitable organic growth over the long term. Moving to SVEDKA Vodka. During the quarter, SVEDKA posted double-digit sales depletion and consumer takeaway trends in addition to gaining share in the vodka category IRI channels. In advance of the holiday selling season, SVEDKA launched its first-ever limited edition party bottle package in the marketplace. This was accompanied by a multichannel marketing campaign, including mobile and social media applications.  Now moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. As expected, Crown faced a difficult third quarter sales and earnings comparison versus last year when sales increased 22% driven by the rebuild of wholesaler inventories to more affable [ph] levels after Crown experienced supply-chain disruptions in the summer of calendar 2010. Despite these comparison issues, the Crown business remains very healthy, with depletions growing mid-single digits during the third quarter driven by Modelo Especial, Victoria and Corona Familiar. In addition, Crown continues to experience strong consumer demand resulting from the combined success of a number of promotional and marketing initiatives, including the Corona Extra "Find Your Beach" campaign and additional advertising investments during the NFL season. According to SymphonyIRI retail data, coinciding with the end of our third quarter, Crown continues to outperform the total U.S. beer industry, the import category and the other 3 major beer suppliers in both case and dollar sales trends in the food, drug, mass and convenience channels. And Crown is also the only major supplier to gain industry dollar share or case share.  Throughout calendar 2011, Crown achieved several milestones and has received recognition from some of the most notable beer and marketing channels in the industry, including the following. This is the first year that Crown Imports has been named to Advertising Age's prestigious Marketers A-List. This is the second consecutive year that Corona Extra has been named one of the best global brands by Interbrand. Modelo Especial won an Impact Hot Brands Award and an IMPACT Blue Chip award, with Corona Light winning a Blue Chip award from Impact as well. Modelo Especial and Victoria each received Cheers Growth Brand Awards, and Victoria also received a Market Watch Leaders Choice Award in the best new product segment. These awards highlight the continuing success of the brand portfolio and understand -- underscore Crown's unique approach to marketing. Overall, calendar 2011 was the largest volume year for the collection of Modelo brands in the U.S. Throughout the remainder of the year, Crown has focused on market execution and optimizing promotional and marketing initial -- initiatives. Some examples include the continued expansion of the Corona Familiar 32-ounce bottle, primarily in Mexican and Hispanic markets throughout the U.S. Launched in the U.S. in calendar 2010, Corona Familiar had strong depletions in calendar 2011. Victoria will expand to select cities within those states where it is already available. In addition, new packaging configurations are being introduced for the brand in existing markets. Victoria already ranks as a top import and is larger than many national distributed competitors in the import category. Crown continues to expand its draft offerings for the Pacifico, Negra Modelo, Modelo Especial and Victoria brands, which are doing extremely well in existing markets. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, Crown's depletions for its draft offerings increased 60% versus the same period last year. Now in closing, we believe we are in good shape to deliver our financial objectives for the year. Even though we may fall a bit short of our depletion goals for our U.S. Wine business, we have solid promotional programs in place designed to drive continued improvement in these trends throughout the remainder of the year.  I would now like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for our financial discussion of our third quarter business results.
Robert P. Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. The quarter came in essentially in line with our Q2 earnings call discussion. Our free cash flow is running ahead of expectations and we've increased our free cash flow guidance for the year. As it relates to earnings guidance for the year, we're maintaining our comparable basis EPS goal of $2 to $2.10 provided at Q2, which is essentially the guidance provided at the beginning of the year exclusive of the benefits from reduced shares and reduced tax rate. For Q3, our comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $0.50 versus $0.66 last year. The majority of the EPS decrease was driven by a 17% decline in comparable basis EBIT. This EBIT result was in line with the expectations we outlined last quarter and was driven primarily by 3 items all related to overlaps of events which occurred in fiscal '11. These include the overlap of the Q3 fiscal 2011 distributor inventory build from our U.S. Wine & Spirits distributor consolidation initiative, the overlap of the Q3 fiscal '11 distributor inventory replenishment combined with the incremental marketing funding at Crown and the divestiture of the Australia and U.K. Wine business. We've generated $587 million of free cash flow for the first 9 months of the year, $287 million more than the same period last year. Due to this excellent performance, we've increased our fiscal '12 free cash flow target by $100 million to a range of $700 million to $750 million, an all-time high at Constellation. Through Q3, our strong free cash flow generation has enabled us to reduce debt, repurchase stock and acquire the remaining 50% interest in the Ruffino business. I will outline more details on this activity in a moment. Given those brief highlights, let's look at our third quarter 2012 P&L performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated reported net sales decreased 27%, primarily due to the divestiture of our Australian and U.K. business. North American net sales on an organic constant currency basis decreased 8%, primarily due to a decrease in volume driven by the overlap of distributor inventory build in Q3 last year. This result also reflects higher promotion cost partially offset by positive mix. Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 40.5% versus 36.5% the prior year. This primarily reflects the benefit of divesting the lower gross margin Australian and U.K. business.  I'd now like to discuss the segment operating income results to provide highlights of our operating income change. North America segment operating income decreased $21 million to $172 million, primarily due to the lower volume combined with higher promotional and transportation costs partially offset by favorable product mix. Corporate costs were down $6 million, primarily related to a benefit from the early redemption of notes receivable from Accolade, our former Australian and U.K. business, and from lower compensation cost. As a reminder, the Australia and Europe segment reported EBIT of $11 million in Q3 last year.  Consolidated equity earnings totaled $53 million versus $71 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $43 million versus $58 million for the prior year. The remainder of equity earnings in Q3 of both fiscal 2012 and 2011 are primarily generated by Opus One.  For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $541 million, a decrease of 12%, and operating income of $87 million, a decrease of 25%. The net sales decrease was primarily driven by lower volume due to the overlap of the prior-year quarter distributor inventory build following the supply chain issues during the summer of 2010. As Rob mentioned, Crown depletions have been growing mid-single digits in an industry experiencing negative volume growth for the year. Lower volume and higher marketing cost drove operating income decrease. Interest expense for the quarter was $46 million, down 6% versus last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings. Let's take a look at debt. At the end of November, our debt totaled $3.1 billion. This represents a $132 million decrease from our debt level at the end of fiscal '11. Our continued strong free cash flow generation and deleveraging efforts over the past several years have enabled us to redeploy a portion of free cash flow to repurchase stock. During Q3 2012, we repurchased about 5 million shares at a cost of $94 million. During the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, we repurchased 15 million shares at a cost of $281 million for an average cost of $18.79 a share. We expect total repurchases through Q3 to benefit diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 for fiscal 2012. During the third quarter, we funded the purchase of the remaining 50% of the Ruffino business for EUR 50 million or about USD $69 million. We also assumed debt net of cash acquired of EUR 54 million or about USD $73 million. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 37% versus 29% in Q3 last year, which reflected the favorable outcome of various tax items. We continue to target a full-year tax rate of 27% for fiscal 2012. Several state and federal audits are still underway. The timing and resolution of these could favorably impact our tax rate for the year. Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, we generated free cash flow of $587 million versus $299 million for the same period last year. This improvement primarily reflects a reduced use of cash to fund receivables and a cash benefit for taxes. Our receivable balance increased less in [ph] the previous year due to timing of sales and the sale of our Australia and U.K. business. As a reminder, in Q1, we received a net refund of taxes primarily related to the Q4 fiscal '11 sale of our U.K. business. As mentioned earlier, we are increasing our fiscal 2012 free cash flow target by $100 million to a range of $700 million to $750 million. The increase is primarily due to the expected realization of additional cash tax benefits from the sale of our U.K. business that were previously targeted for fiscal 2013. We are also reducing our CapEx estimate by $15 million to a range of $70 million to $80 million. As previously discussed, we believe our sustainable free cash flow is in the $500 million-plus range. Now let's move to our full-year fiscal 2012 P&L outlook. As noted earlier, we continue to expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $2 to $2.10 versus our $1.91 result in fiscal '11. This includes the estimated $0.06 benefit for share repurchases, which is consistent with our previous guidance. As outlined by Rob, we now expect depletions for our U.S. Wine & Spirits business to come in a bit below the market trend and our planned target for the full year. We expect the corresponding shortfall in sales volume to be somewhat offset by some mix benefits and cost reductions. We've also reduced our interest expense guidance. For Crown, we continue to target low to mid-single digit depletion growth for the year and flat to slightly down operating earnings due to the incremental marketing funding. I would also like to highlight a few Q4 fiscal '12 comparison items for you. For our North American business, we're facing an easier shipment comparison for Q4, as the inventory build during fiscal '11 was effectively completed by the end of Q3. We are also expecting lower promotional expense and some additional mix benefit in Q4 versus Q4 last year. For Crown, in Q4, we expect an improvement in sales growth and marketing spend to moderate versus the higher levels experienced in Q2 and Q3 of this fiscal year. Overall, the good news is that the Beer business continues to drive growth in a difficult category, and we are seeing improving depletions and marketplace trends for our Wine & Spirit business, as our focus brands are performing better and our new product development initiatives are gaining traction.  Our strong free cash flow generation and deleveraging efforts have created flexibility in our capital structure management. This flexibility has enabled us to buy back a significant number of shares as we have repurchased $281 million of stock through Q3, which is on top of the $300 million we repurchased in the last fiscal year. We expect to continue to evaluate share repurchases as an opportunistic basis as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize the capital structure of the business. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: If I could start maybe and just see if you can quantify for us the impact that Arbor Mist and Vendange have on your overall focus brand depletions?
Robert Sands: Yes. It actually [indiscernible] had quite a significant impact. And if we had -- if we stripped out just those 2 brands, we would have gained share in the overall category -- wine category for the quarter. So that was -- that really has been a big driver of our overall market share loss in total wine. Now if you look at just table wine, we did gain share in the quarter. And if you look at Premium Plus, we gained share in the quarter too, and I mentioned that because clearly, the Premium Plus category above $5 is our primary focus.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got it. And then also just a follow-up on quantification, is there any way for you to give us some context on what growth may have been -- on shipments, excluding the inventory build from -- at Crown last year?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. This is Bob. Kaumil, I don't think we'd get into that kind of detail.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, no problem. And then just clarifying something on your guidance for Crown. You said improved sales growth and marketing spend to moderate. I just want to understand because -- was that from a depletions perspective or is that from a shipments perspective? And then also, was the increased volume last year in 4Q also the replenishment of the supply issues?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. So the replenishment of the supply chain issues in the Beer business was done by the end of the fourth quarter –- by the end of the third quarter. So the fourth quarter from a shipment depletion perspective was pretty clean, okay? So we expect to -- for shipments and depletions to continue to have pretty good growth in the fourth quarter. Now this year, one of the reasons that the Beer business' EBIT is down is the incremental marketing spend. We think the majority of that is behind us, as this year they spent the wide majority of that incremental monies in the peak summer season, so in Q2, Q3. So that's why I said Q4, we expect continued or even slightly better sales growth, which would -- the same as depletion growth for the fourth quarter and reduced marketing as opposed to the previous year.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got it. And final question on prioritization of the free cash flow, you now have $100 million more than planned. Should we -- given how often you talked about the buyback in your prepared remarks, should we assume that much of that can go towards -- in incremental buyback?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. Well, I mean, our board authorization is still at the $500 million level. We have a little bit over $200 million left on that. We don't have any additional board authorization at this point. But as usual, we’ll be looking at the market and general trends to see whether we should be out there buying back more of our shares.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Rob, just on the Wine business, just as you think about the payback that you've gotten in this -- in the current quarter from higher promotions. Obviously, depletions improved sequentially, but it seems like it sort of came at the expense of higher promos. So can you maybe help us understand, do you think you've got enough payback on those spending? What will sort of the competitive environment look like? And then as you look out in fiscal '13, with all lot of these new products coming in line, how should we think about the promotional spending? And then is 2013, finally, the year where you think that you can get your Wine business to grow in line with the category growth?
Robert Sands: Yes. So, I think in terms of payback on promotional spending, we certainly feel that we are getting a payback, and you can sort of see it as a result of the sequential improvement in growth when we increased promotional spending. Now we do also mitigate that to a degree and fund it, by taking some of the actions, which we've taken such as increasing that price on our value brands, where we frankly don't care that much about share to help fund and offset some of the cost of promoting our Premium Plus portfolio. But in general, yes, promotional expense is up net net net. And yes, we think that it is paying back, given where we would otherwise be if we didn't do so. What was your second question, Judy?
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So if that's the case...
Robert Sands: As far as growing with the category next year, our plan is certainly to grow in line with the category next year. And as we built momentum this year and are either depending on the category, exceeding growth rates or nearing total category growth rates, we should go into next year with good momentum to achieve that.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then Bob, just in terms of the whole shipment versus depletion delta on the wine business, are we completely now done just in terms of the distortions in the fourth quarter would still distort [ph] off cleanly as depletions matches shipments at your wholesaler level?
Robert Sands: Yes. I mean, I'd say the wide majority of it is done. There could still be some adjustments for the fourth quarter because what we've said is for the full year, shipments will equal depletions, right? So you kind of adjust in the fourth quarter to get to the full year balance.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the Crown side, just any update on thinking just in terms of how you're thinking about pricing? Clearly, your depletion trends have been pretty healthy, but the margins have not really followed through. So just how you're thinking about pricing at this point?
Robert Sands: Yes, good question. So as we know, the beer category has been experiencing negative volumes. The larger domestic players have been taking some pricing. We actually at the Crown business took some frontline pricing in October, not as much as the domestic players, and the pricing was different by brands and by geographies. But the other thing that the Crown business is doing is reducing its promotion spending, which is, in essence, an increase in the net price to the consumer. Now that reduced promotion spending is reinvested in marketing. So that's why when you see the Crown income statement, you'll see a pretty big increase in marketing expense because there's 2 things going on there. There's money coming from promotion down into marketing and there's the incremental funding that's occurring on the Crown P&L versus the prior year. So it's a pretty big increase in the marketing spend. And looking at how volumes and how dollars sales growth has been doing versus the category, it seems to be being pretty successful, and the marketing has been pretty well received. Rob gave some of those awards. So I think those guys are doing a good job and feeling good about their top line. I think the marketing overlaps from prior year are kind of hurting the bottom line, but that should abate as we go into next year.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So if you take the frontline pricing and the reduced promo spending on Crown, the net price per barrel would've been up sort of 1% to 2% kind of level?
Robert P. Ryder: That's probably about right, maybe on the high end of that. Judy, you can kind of look at IRI and look at the volume growth versus the net sales growth, so you'll see that the net pricing to the consumer and IRI is up just north of 2%, which is less than the domestic guys but still pretty healthy, especially when you compare that to how the volumes are doing to prior year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So you mentioned innovation as one of the primary drivers to drive improved wine market share trends going forward. But I think previously, you would thought that would play out this holiday season. So I just want to get a sense from you on how much of an increase in innovation contribution you're expecting in calendar 2012 versus 2011 or the pipeline of innovation you have planned versus this year, and if there's a significant ramp-up going forward?
Robert Sands: Yes. We expect pretty significant increase in the contribution of innovation to our growth in next year, whether it's calendar 2012 or fiscal 2013, almost probably double the rate of the contribution that innovation made in 2012 or calendar 2011. So as I mentioned in my talk, we have very ramped up new product initiatives and expect to introduce almost 20 new products into the marketplace. And this year, it contributed roughly 200 basis points or 2% to our overall growth. And next year it should, as I said, contribute significantly more.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And can you give us an update on your thoughts for the pricing environment in the wine category as we look out to calendar 2012 here and an update on the promotional environment?
Robert Sands: Yes. I would say, starting with the promotional environment and the holiday season, it's been fairly consistent with how things have played out through the year and basically with last year. Now as you are aware from previous calls, this year's harvest in California was down, and in certain areas and certain varietals, oversupply is turning into undersupply, especially in the North Coast. And as a consequence to that, I would say that we probably think that you will see some pricing being taken on some -- especially higher end products that are suffering from some of the undersupply. That said, are we seeing any widespread examples of that? No. I've put that just more in the category of what people think as opposed to what's really happening. So we're going to be watching it very carefully as we go into next year and see what's happening out there in the marketplace.
Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And are you anticipating adjusting pricing at all in the value wines, given some of the demand elasticity issues, or are you more focused on profitability at this point?
Robert Sands: We kind of pulsed that activity, so we've taken some pricing up on some of the value wines and then we've taken some of the pricing back down on the value wines, depending on whether we think we're getting the benefit from the pricing or not over an appropriate period of time. So it can kind of go both ways. But in general, I would say that we're going to be more inclined to price value wines than the opposite, meaning take pricing down or drive for volume or share.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with D.A. Davidson.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Just -- Rob, wondering how you think about the dollar price point positioning of your portfolio now versus the wine category. It seems to me that it skews more favorably up the price point than it did several years ago, and that's been kind of where the growth is in the wine sector. Why shouldn’t we think that you would outperform the overall wine category in 2013, or fiscal 2013, I should say?
Robert Sands: Well, again, whether we gain share or lose share in the category, it will be very dependent on sort of the decisions we make as to how we price various elements of our portfolio. Our portfolio is large. We've got a lot of wine, and I'll say outside of mainstream categories, whether it's beverage dessert wines, kosher wines, fruit-flavored varietal wine. And we are very tactical on our decisions from a financial perspective as to whether to opt more for pricing or whether to opt more for value. I'd say that's sort of the best measure of how we're doing overall is how we're doing on our focus brands, which is a relatively small portfolio of 17 brands and constitutes the vast majority of our profitability in the United States. So there, we're particularly interested in whether we're gaining or losing share. Now that said, one of the focus brands is the value brand. It is Arbor Mist, it's a big brand. And as I have said, we have made the decision, and we did so last year to -- or this year actuality of this current year to tactically raise prices on that particular brand and to sacrifice some volume, which did impact the overall growth rate of the focus brands. So it's some and some.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Got you. And just a quick one on some of the brands that you used to own over at Essencia. Any -- I hear that some of those are either on the block or somewhat distressed. Any thoughts on that? You've done -- you've managed those brands before, would it make sense to look at them again?
Robert Sands: No. We sold them.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Okay. That's definitive.
Robert Sands: Nothing that we sold that we want back at the moment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Reza Vahabzadeh with Barclays Capital.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: You talked about optimizing the cap structure, as well as the share buyback activities. Can you continue with the share repurchase activities and delever the balance sheet and get the leverage down to perhaps below 3x in the coming year, given your $600 million to $700 million -- $600 million to $750 million of cash flow?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, Reza. This is Bob. I mean, obviously, you decide how much stock to buy back, right? So this year, we've given new guidance, which is improved, and we decide if we're going to buy any more stock in the fourth quarter, we have to decide, because next year, we should have $500 million-plus of free cash flow because it will be at least a sustainable year next year. So we would be able to delever and buy stock depending how much stock we buy back.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: Right. And you still want to delever, right? In the past, I think you've thrown out 2.5, 3 turns as well?
Robert P. Ryder: No. I think what we've said is our ideal structure is 3 to 4 turns, right? And year-to-date, I think as of the -- if you just use our guidance and assume we don't buy back any more stock, I think we'll finish the year just under 3.4. Had we not bought any stock back, I think we would've been much closer to 3.0. So we've made conscious decisions by buying back stock to stay north of 3.0, and we will assess those as we go along.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: Fair enough. And then have you commented on the food service channel, the restaurant channel on how sales are progressing in that channel for your products?
Robert Sands: Yes. I think that we're seeing the on-premise channel up for the first time in a long time for us. We've probably gained share on a dollar perspective and lost share on a volume perspective because we've significantly changed the mix of product that we're selling in the on-premise to more high-end Premium Plus product from, I'd say lower end. So the on-premise is rebounding. It's up a bit, we believe, overall, and we believe we're gaining share from a dollar perspective.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: But to the category itself, on-premise is up in terms of sales?
Robert Sands: Correct. Probably in the 1% to 2% range.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citigroup.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: My question has to do with the focus brand strategy, specifically while I recognize that the wine category is highly fragmented, so you need a number of offerings to compete effectively. I do wonder a little bit whether 19 focus brands is maybe too many, and could you possibly better leverage your investments if you narrowed your focus a little bit? Is that under consideration at all?
Robert Sands: So I don't think that 19 is necessarily too many. But that said, we have had, I'll say, a strategy of narrowing our focus and investment against a smaller number of brand even within our focus brands. So fundamentally, the answer to your question is no, they're not too many, but yes, we agree that in terms of investment that probably narrowing the focus and making bigger bets against a smaller number of brands is probably strategically the way to go. On the other hand, a lot of these brands are very profitable and need to be looked after appropriately. So fundamentally, we agree strategically with what you just suggested.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Within that subset then, the really focused focus brands, where do those fall generally across the pricing spectrum?
Robert Sands: Well, we look at those at -- first of all, we don't have a subset of focused focus brands. You made that up, not us. But going along with that concept, you kind of start with what is the biggest piece of the portfolio, and that's the Mondavi franchise, Robert Mondavi at Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, okay? That in and of itself is a large part or the most important part of the focus brand portfolio. Then you got a few -- I'm not just talking about wine here, you got a few other important brands, like SVEDKA Vodka, like Kim Crawford. Those would be examples of brands that really rise to the top in terms of their level of importance, Clos du Bois in the overall focus brand portfolio. And I guess I didn't quite answer your question. If you look at Woodbridge, that's Premium. If you look at Clos du Bois, that's Super-Premium. If you look at Kim Crawford, that's Luxury. If you look at Robert Mondavi Private Selection, that's Super-Premium and Robert Mondavi Napa is Luxury.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: So couple of questions on wine, and then one on Crown. Rob, you gave us that 2% depletion or that 2% contribution from innovation year-to-date for the wine business. Is that a contribution to depletions?
Robert Sands: Yes.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it, great. And then as you think about -- you remarked that you think you can grow in line with the wine category still in spite of some of these value challenges this year. How do you feel about your ability to grow operating income faster than the wine category, given the experience with spending and the mix issue and so forth?
Robert Sands: Yes. So to your first question, we did not say that we would grow in line with the category this year. I would say that...
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I'm sorry, I mean calendar '12, fiscal '13.
Robert Sands: Okay, yes. And then to your second question, we should be able to leverage the P&L.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: You do expect to, great. And then over on Crown, are we kind of done with the structural step-up in marketing spend? Do you think fiscal '13 is more of a operating income in line with revenue type of year?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. I mean, I think we're done, Mark, with the step-up in marketing. There might still be some flux between promo spend in marketing, but they kind of zero off, it kind of gets to the bottom line. So all you'll be left with is pretty much pricing and -- normal stuff, pricing and mix. Now we do have the contractual cost of goods sold increase, okay? So just normal stuff, but I think the increased marketing and promotion spending will be behind us, and it will be a apples-to-apples year if you look at fiscal '13 over fiscal '12 from a marketing and spending perspective at Crown.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Great. And if I could build a little on the earlier question about operating income in wine growing faster than revenue. From where I sit, it's hard to see why your -- you have that view. Is that a function of your mix view? Is it simply leveraging of the fixed costs? Can you talk a little bit more about that, Rob?
Robert Sands: Yes, I think, Mark, most of it would come from -- we have some pretty robust plans in place to reduce cost of goods sold, and we talked about these a number of times around things like reduced number of bottling lines or higher fixed cost leverage, some blend changes, some better warehouse management, some better grape buying, things around that. I think that we will keep SG&A growing below net sales, okay? So I think those 2 areas and COGS is the big number will be -- will help us leverage the P&L. The wild card, I think, will be promotion spending, okay? Because as you know, it's a pretty fractious industry. We're not the only player, and we kind of can't raise prices when nobody else is, which is -- Rob mentioned some of that earlier. So I think the things within our control, we feel pretty good about. I think the things that are little less within our control, like pricing and promotions, well, they're not within our control. That being said, we've had 2 years in a row of short harvests. So you would hope that the industry would reduce promotion spend and maybe increase prices, but time will tell.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Albanese with Auriga USA.
Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division: I was wondering if you could touch upon inventory levels, is that roughly what you were expecting? And was that impacted from the cost of the higher cost from your grape harvest this year?
Robert Sands: In terms of the harvest, the harvest from a dollar perspective will be smaller this year than it was last. And therefore, that's had a positive impact on our inventories and our cash flow this year. And I will say that the harvest was a bit smaller than we expected, and therefore, the inventory impact and positive cash flow impact was a bit greater than we expected. Hence, we started the year with lower cash flow guidance than we're ending the year with. And we've increased our cash flow guidance, and that was one of the components of why cash flow is coming in higher than our initial guidance. Is that what you were asking me about, Gary?
Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division: To some degree, to some degree. Let me move on to SVEDKA. I mean, double-digit growth again in the quarter. Are you guys still on pace to exceed or was it 4 million cases I think you said the last quarter?
Robert P. Ryder: Gary, I'm sorry, we're having a tough time hearing you.
Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division: Sure. SVEDKA, are you still on pace to exceed 4 million cases this year?
Robert Sands: No, we'll be at slightly under it, but we're fundamentally on pace to be around 4 million cases. So yes, it's -- it will be around 4 million, and certainly, the run rate is at that level. And SVEDKA is generally meeting all of our expectations and continues to grow double-digit now on a very large base. It's the third-largest vodka brand.
Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division: Yes. I mean, being that, that’s a smallest segment, I know it's been posed -- the question’s been posed to you in the past about whether it fits. But is that actually an area that the Spirits business that you contemplate actually growing?
Robert Sands: Well, our Spirits business is 3 brands basically, SVEDKA, Black Velvet and Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy, 3 big brands. And yes, I mean, we're certainly, conscientiously and specifically trying to grow that business, with our primary focus being taking advantage of our position in the vodka category with basically the hottest large brand.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: If you -- looking at your distributor markets, what percentage of your business now is in markets where it's a sole distributor? And is there still more markets to go there?
Robert Sands: So in terms of what we've consolidated, 60% of our business is -- has been consolidated in those markets where we've been able to do that in the United States, so 60%. And then of the remaining 40%, there's probably about another 8% for argument's sake that, in theory, could be more consolidated in the manner that we consolidated the initial 60%. And the reason that there's only 8% of the remaining 40% is because you have to remember that some of the markets are controlled state markets, like Pennsylvania, where there's really -- where the whole concept of consolidating contributors is inapplicable. And then another large percentage are what are called franchise [indiscernible], which means that we don't have the ability to necessarily terminate the existing distributors pursuant to consolidation plan. So it's difficult to change your distribution network in those franchise markets. So 8%.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And then do you see -- oh, go ahead sorry?
Robert Sands: Sorry, just saying 8%.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Do you see a big difference in performance between the distributor and then -- I'm sorry, the sole distributor and the multiple distributor markets?
Robert Sands: Yes, and it's not so much sole distributor and multiple distributor, although that's a part of it. But what really -- yes, the answer is yes. We definitely are outperforming in markets where we've implemented our distributor consolidation efforts. But then that -- what are some of the things that really drive that the -- where we're able to consolidate, we're able to have exclusive sales forces within those distributors selling only our products. And that gives us a lot of additional focus on our portfolio as being -- opposed to being just part of a general sales force that’s selling multiple products. So the answer is yes, we're outperforming in those markets.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just one follow-up, you may have already answered, and I may have missed it, but can you say whether there's been any change in terms of the timing of the Crown JV decision? Is that still an end of -- I think it's end of 2012 event we should know?
Robert Sands: No. There's -- the initial term of the Crown contract was 10 years ending 2016. It cannot be terminated or altered for 5 more years. There are notice provisions as to what they may propose that would require them to give us notice 3 years in advance of the termination at the end of 2016. But there's 5 years left on the Crown contract period, and it automatically renews for another 10 years in the -- except in the event of their giving us advanced notice of nonrenewal.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. So the earliest would be the notice period would be end of 2013?
Robert Sands: That's only notice.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right, only notice for the termination in 2012 if that were to occur, okay.
Operator: That was our final question. And I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Rob Sands for any closing remarks.
Robert Sands: Okay. Well, thank you all for joining our call today. I would say that overall, I'm very satisfied with the third quarter results, and would summarize the highlights as follows: We generated very, very strong free cash flow, and as a result, have increased our guidance for the year; our strong free cash flow results have enabled us to fund share repurchases, and we expect to be opportunistic in this regard as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize the capital structure of the business; we are experienced improving depletion momentum for our U.S. Wine business and the Spirits business as well, and our new product development initiatives are being well received in the marketplace; and our Crown Imports Beer business continues its strong marketplace momentum. Our plan is to continue solid execution of our initiatives throughout the final quarter of the year. Thanks again, everyone, for your participation.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's Second Quarter Fiscal 2012 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com under the Investors section and Financial History. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release in Constellation's SEC filing. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert P. Ryder: Thanks, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's Second Quarter Fiscal 2012 Sales and Earnings Results. Now before we get started, I would like to take a few moments to discuss this morning's announcement of Constellation's purchase of the remaining portion of the Ruffino Wine business. Ruffino is an iconic Old World Wine brand, that filled a vital niche for Constellation in the Italian imported premium wine category. Our relationship with Ruffino began in 2004, when we purchased a 40% stake in the company and became the U.S. importer of the brand. In May 2010, we increased our ownership interest to almost 50%. And since that time, the Ruffino brand has become one of Constellation U.S. focus brands. Working together with Ruffino during the past several years, we've accomplished a great deal, driving the Ruffino brand to become the #3 Italian Super Premium wine brand in SymphonyIRI channels and the #2 U.S. Chianti brand with a 50% market share of the Chianti market in the greater than $20 per bottle price point at retail. And according to SymphonyIRI industry data for the last 52 weeks, Ruffino is experiencing 8% growth in U.S. dollar sales with Ruffino's year-to-date global sales growing 9%. Ruffino annually produces about 1.4 [indiscernible] cases of wine, more than half of which were sold by Constellation in the U.S. last year, with the next most important markets including Canada and Italy. In fiscal 2013, we expect to realize incremental sales and slightly accretive earnings, resulting from Constellation's 100% ownership of the Ruffino portfolio. And now, I'd like to turn our discussion to a review of our quarterly results. We've reached the halfway point in the year, and I'm pleased with our progress to date despite growing market concerns related to subdued consumer confidence in the U.S. economy. I am especially pleased with our significantly improved consolidated margin structure and our strong free cash flow results, which have essentially enabled us to fund our share repurchase efforts, while continuing to reduce debt. While we plan to continue to pay down debt in fiscal 2012, we have redeployed a portion of our free cash flow to repurchase our stock. We currently believe that Constellation's shares represent good value, especially as our market momentum builds in the second half of this year, and as we continue to reap the benefits of our ongoing transformation initiatives. In addition, the Crown joint venture continues to outperform the U.S. beer industry and the import category. As expected, depletion trends for our U.S. Wine & Spirits business lagged the market somewhat in the second quarter. This is primarily the result of the following actions. Earlier this year, we took price increases on certain specialty and value products, which negatively impacted volumes. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have changed the gating of our promotional activities in fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 to better align with the upcoming holiday selling season, which will be upon us shortly. Overall, for fiscal 2012, we are targeting promotional dollar spend that is in line with last year, although the timing is different and that it is skewed more towards the second half of the year. It is through a combination of promotional spend and new product development initiatives that we expect to achieve our goal of category growth that is in line with the U.S. Wine & Spirits market for the year. As such, we expect to see improving depletion and market trends as we move through the balance of the year. The good news is that you can already see evidence of this improving market trends for Constellation. At the end of the second quarter, we began to ramp up our promotional spend in advance of the key holiday selling season, and this has manifested itself in the market trends you see in recent IRI data. During calendar 2010, we maintained our U.S. market share on a volume basis in total across all channels. And our intent is to replicate this performance again this year while achieving our profitability goals. An increasing portion of our growth this year is expected to come from innovation and new product development. As a reminder, we have 20 new product launches planned for fiscal 2012, many of which are included in hot categories that are experiencing significant growth. Sample of our new products have already hit store shelves, and are gaining traction as they are now readily available in the marketplace. Those brands that are particularly noteworthy include Primal Roots, a sweet red blend, Rex Goliath Moscato, Ruffino Prosecco, Woodbridge Malbec and the Simply Naked unoaked line of varietals. Our most recent introduction to the new product lineup is the Dreaming Tree brand, a collaboration between Steve Reeder, our award-winning winemaker at Simi and acclaimed musician, Dave Matthews. We are excited about the opportunity for this fun and approachable ultra premium product offering, which will be supported by a robust social media campaign. As is typical at this point in the year, I'd like to provide an update relating to the U.S. grape harvest, which is just more than 50% complete at this point. Although they are virgin estimates from varying sources relative to the expected size of this year's harvest, we are currently estimating that the 2011 U.S. industry harvest will be down 10% to 15%, versus last year's harvest. An early season frost in parts of the central coast and a mild growing season has led to lower yields with tightening supply for some key varietals. And moving on to SVEDKA Vodka. The SVEDKA Vodka momentum continues with the brand posting double-digit completion growth and consumer takeaway trends in IRI channels for the second quarter. This summer, SVEDKA launched its first-ever total portfolio of program entitled Summer of SVEDKA that showcase the depth and breadth of the brand's portfolio during the high-consumption summer months. Overall, we have increased our SVEDKA digital and media investment, and we are introducing new packaging configurations and flavor profiles that are highly innovative. As a matter of fact, SVEDKA Grape was launched in August as the sixth flavor added to the portfolio. Grape is currently a top 10 flavor in the imported vodka category, growing at a rate of about 20% in SymphonyIRI data. By the way, don't forget to purchase your SVEDKA girl fembot Halloween costume, which debuted during the New York Fashion Week, receiving positive press in the Wall Street Journal. Demand is very high for these costumes as they are literally flying off the shelves. Now moving to Crown Imports joint venture. Crown posted positive second quarter results in terms of both sales and depletions, which increased in the mid-single digit range, driven primarily by Modelo Especial and momentum from the continuing brand launches of Corona Familiar and Victoria. Crown experienced strong consumer demand during the busy summer selling season, resulting from the combined success of a number of initiatives including the Corona Win the Beach Promotion, Modelo Especial's VIP Soccer Sweepstakes program and the Corona Extra Find Your Beach advertising campaign. According to SymphonyIRI retail data coinciding with the end of our second quarter, Crown outperformed the total U.S. beer industry, the import category and the other 3 major beer suppliers in both case and dollar sales trends in the food, drug, mass and convenience channels. And among the 4 major U.S. beer suppliers, Crown was the only one to gain case and dollar market share. And earlier this week, Corona Extra was named one of the best global brands for 2011 by Interbrand. As we enter the remainder of fiscal 2012, Crown is focused on market execution and optimizing promotional and market initiatives. Some examples include the continued expansion of the Corona Familiar 32-ounce bottle, primarily in Mexican and Hispanic markets throughout the U.S. Victoria, which is already available in several states, will be expanded to cities that are adjacent to current markets. In addition, new packaging configurations are being introduced for the brand in existing markets. Crown is expanding its draft offerings for the Pacifico, Negra Modelo, Modelo Especial and Victoria brands, which are doing extremely well in existing markets. During the second quarter, Crown depletions for its draft offering increased strong double digits, making this the best quarter in the history of the joint venture for this format. Once again, Crown will be advertising during the National Football League season, which includes advertising on ESPN SportsCenter and Spanish-language ESPN. In closing, we continue to make significant progress in a number of areas despite the prospects of an unsettled consumer environment. We are entering one of our strongest seasonal periods, and I feel that we are well positioned for market execution in order to achieve our goals for the year. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our second quarter business results.
Robert P. Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.77 versus $0.52 last year. The majority of the EPS increase was driven by a lower tax rate in the quarter, 3% this year versus 35% last year. Comparable basis EBIT came in $4 million lower than last year, while interest expense decreased $8 million. For the first half of fiscal '12, EBIT is $15 million higher than the same period last year. This is timing related, as we continue to expect a flattish EBIT results for the full year. The quarter reflected a 4 percentage point operating margin improvement driven primarily by the divestiture of Australia and U.K. business.  We've generated $478 million of free cash flow for the first 6 months, $215 million more than the same period last year. This strong performance has enabled us to reduce debt by $290 million since the end of fiscal 2011 and utilize $188 million to repurchase shares during the second quarter. I will outline more details on the share repurchases in a moment. Given those brief highlights, let's look at our second quarter 2012 P&L performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated reported net sales decreased 20%, primarily due to the divestiture of our Australia and U.K. business. The North American net sales on an organic constant currency basis were even with the prior year. This reflects favorable mix, offset by a decrease in volume and higher promotion costs in the U.S. Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 41% versus 36.5% for the prior year. This primarily reflects the benefit of divesting the lower gross margin Australian and U.K. business, partially offset by higher promotion and transportation costs in the U.S. I'd now like to discuss the segment operating income results to provide highlights on our operating income change. The North American segment operating income decreased $14 million to $167 million. The decrease was driven by lower volumes combined with higher marketing, promotion and transportation costs, partially offset by favorable product mix. Corporate costs were down $9 million, primarily related to lower compensation costs in Project Fusion. As a reminder, the Australia and Europe segment reported an operating loss of $3 million in Q2 last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $63 million versus $65 million for the prior-year quarter. For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $727 million, an increase of 7% and operating income of $126 million, a decrease of 4%. The net sales growth was driven by volume growth from Modelo Especial and the roll out of Corona Familiar and Victoria. Crown also saw improvement in net pricing and mix. Higher marketing costs during the quarter more than offset the benefit of higher sales. Interest expense for the quarter was $43 million, down 16% versus last year. The decrease was driven by reduced balances of lower term debt.  Let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of August, our debt totaled $2.9 billion. This represents a $290 million decrease from the debt level at the end of fiscal 2011, and was driven by our strong free cash flow generation. The net debt increase drove our debt-to-comparable basis EBITDA ratio down to 3.2x at the end of August from a 3.6x at the end of February. Our continued strong free cash flow generation and deleveraging efforts have created flexibility in the management of our capital structure.  This flexibility enabled us to redeploy a portion of free cash flow to repurchase 9.8 million shares at a cost of $188 million during the second quarter. From the end of the second quarter through September 30, the company repurchased an additional 3.5 million shares at a cost of $63 million. In total, we've repurchased 13.3 million shares at a cost of just over $250 million. We expect the repurchases through September 30 that I just outlined to benefit diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 for fiscal 2012.  As mentioned earlier, we decreased debt by $200 million for the first half of 2012. In fiscal 2011, we utilized $300 million of cash to repurchase shares and decreased debt by approximately $600 million. Cumulatively, since the beginning of fiscal 2011, we've repurchased approximately 31 million shares or $550 million in a highly accretive manner. During that same time, we decreased debt by $890 million and reduced our leverage ratio from 4.1x down to 3.2x. This activity highlights that our free cash flow priorities are focused on debt reduction and share repurchases, as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize the capital structure of the business. As mentioned earlier, our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 3% versus 35% in Q2 due to the favorable outcome of various tax items. The Q2 rate came in better than previously expected, and as a result, we're now targeting the full-year tax rate of 27% versus our previous 29% guidance. Constellation's tax rate has varied quite a bit in the recent years. This is due to finalization of various audits by foreign, state and federal jurisdictions from multiple prior periods. As an audit is concluded, the impact of the years under audit is reflected in the rate of the quarter in which the audit was settled. This causes some unusual quarterly tax rates. These tax rate settlements are equally beneficial to cash, as reflected in this year's free cash flow guidance. Several state and federal audits are still underway. The timing and resolution of these could impact our tax rate guidance before the end of the year.  Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first half of fiscal 2012, we generated free cash flow of $478 million versus $263 million for the same period last year. This improvement primarily reflects a reduced use of cash to fund receivables and a cash benefit for taxes. Our receivable balance increased less than the previous year due to the timing of sales and the sale of our Australian and U.K. business. As previously discussed, in Q1, we received a net refund of taxes primarily related to the Q4 fiscal '11 sale of our U.K. business. We continue to target free cash flow for fiscal 2012 in the $600 million to $650 million range. As a reminder, free cash flow in the back half of the year is impacted by the funding of the U.S. harvest and the divestiture of the Australian and U.K. business, as its earnings and cash flow were primarily generated in the third and fourth quarters. Now let's move to our full-year fiscal 2012 P&L outlook. We now expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $2 to $2.10 versus our $1.91 result for fiscal '11 and our previous guidance of $1.90 to $2. The increase in EPS guidance reflects the share repurchase benefit and the change in tax rate guidance I just outlined. I would now like to reiterate a couple of items related to our fiscal '12 guidance. As a reminder, the overlap of the fiscal 2011 distributor inventory build from our U.S. distributor consolidation initiative should keep our North American business at flattish organic sales and a modest EBIT growth for fiscal 2012. You saw this in the Q2 results I just outlined, as U.S. domestic shipment volumes were down 3%, while U.S. domestic depletions were down only slightly. We expect the overlap impact to be greater in the third quarter. Turning to the Beer business. Crown is still targeting low- to mid-single digit depletion growth for this year. As we have previously outlined, the JV partners decided on incremental funding levels of marketing and promotion spending by Crown for calendar 2011 and thereafter. This additional investment is expected to drive flat to slightly down operating earnings for Crown in fiscal '12. This marketing spend is more heavily weighted in our second and third quarters. In addition, Crown faces a difficult sales comparison in Q3 fiscal '12 versus Q3 fiscal '11 when Crown sales grew 22% as inventories were rebuilt to more optimal levels after the supply chain issues experienced during the summer 2010. As a reminder, the divested Australia and U.K. business produced about $11 million of EBIT in the third quarter of last year. Given the challenging comparison in Q3 that I just outlined, we expect Q3 EBIT to be down approximately 15% to 20% versus Q3 last year. I would also like to note that interest expense is still expected to be in the range of $180 million to $190 million, even with the funding of the share repurchases. As a reminder, in fiscal 2011, we entered into a delayed start interest rate swap that just became effective in September 2011. It fixed the LIBOR rate before borrowing margin at an average rate of 2.9% or $500 million of term loan debt. We expect weighted average diluted shares to now approximate $210 million versus our previous guidance of $216 million. This reflects the benefit of share repurchases made through September 30, but excludes any repurchases of common stock that may occur subsequent to September 30. So exclusive of the shares and tax rate, we're essentially maintaining the comparable basis guidance we issued at the beginning of the year, which given the current economic sentiment is a positive. While we are behind the market from a depletion and consumer takeaway perspective, we expect to pick up this lost ground during the key holiday selling season. Our free cash flow remains quite strong, and we've utilized it to further deleverage while buying back a significant number of shares. The accretion from these share repurchases and from our lower tax rate has been reflected in our increased EPS guidance. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with D.A. Davidson.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Just remarking on the strong reduction in corporate and unallocated, and you chalked that up to lower corporate expense and the cost reduction program. Should we think that, that level is somewhat sustainable in the $19 million, $20 million a quarter, or will that go higher?
Robert P. Ryder: Tim, I think that the cost of that versus the prior year I think is sustainable. Most of that decrease is due to the overlap of some compensation costs last year. So we do think that, that run rate will persist for the balance of the year. And we should see a reduced corporate cost for the full year.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: And just, Rob, maybe if you could just comment on what you think the overall picture is for wine sales for the category. You've been pretty pressing in on that for the last 18 months to 2 years. I'd love to hear your thoughts.
Robert Sands: Yes. We think that the category is actually pretty robust right now. You can see that in IRI and Nielsen. A few trends that continue are sort of high-double digit, high-single digit growth trading up in general, continues to be a pretty strong trend. And there continues to be a lot of confusion on that. And we see the consumer trading up to higher price category, but there is some trading down that's going on at the -- I'll say, at sort of the highest end of the business from products above $20 down into products that are more in say $15 to $25 range. And promotional activity remains pretty robust in the market as well. So in general, we see the category growing well. We don't anticipate that, that's likely to stop, and we see trading up to be a trend that's also going to continue. So we expect to see dollar sales growth in the category continue to be ahead of volume sales growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Reza Vahabzadeh with Barclays Capital.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: As far as the impact of the lighter smaller grape harvest, can you just talk about the impact of that going forward, whether it's on your cost base, promotional activity and how much pricing you need to offset that?
Robert Sands: Yes. Basically, you see a shorter harvest as I said in the 10% to 15% range. Even with that being the case, I would say that the supply-demand situation in the United States remains pretty well balanced, especially when you take into account supplies of wine from outside the United States that are often used in brands and various SKUs and brands like Malbec and so on and so forth. Pricing will be up. We definitely expect pricing to be up. So volume will be down, pricing will be up. But therefore, the 2 probably balance each other out in terms of the cost of the overall harvest. And as I said, since supply and demand pretty much remains balanced, we don't expect higher grape prices per ton to really affect us beyond what we've already built into our guidance and expectations in general. So it's probably a positive thing for the industry to have a bit of a short harvest this year because we've had some historically some longer harvest. So we think that is not a bad thing.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: And I'm sorry, the increase in cost per ton is going to be how much?
Robert Sands: We don't know exactly what that is, but we do expect some increase in cost per ton. It basically depends on where we're talking about. We're seeing the biggest probably impacts in the south central valley for some of the typically lower-priced grapes that are used in value and lower premium product. So that will probably impact us to the least extent, because we focus more on the Premium Plus categories. And so they're not going to be impacted as much.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.: And then, as far as cash flow, you've been using cash flow to reduce leverage and also buy some shares. Is that likely to be the scenario going forward, or would you foresee other uses of cash flow such as M&A going forward?
Robert Sands: Yes. Our priorities remain the same, which is our first priority continues to be paying down debt. And obviously, we've been very successful and aggressive in taking our debt down to now about 3.2x debt to EBITDA at the end of the second quarter. We've moderated that because our cash flow is so strong with stock repurchases taking advantage of what we believe has been some very good values for our stock in the marketplace, as our transformational activities have kicked into gear and as we become more and more optimistic about our performance and our expectations for the future. And then relative to M&A, basically, what I've said is that we're not categorically ruling it out. And if something that we think is strategic and material comes along, we'll consider the opportunity. But it's not really our core strategy at the moment, which is really focused on brand building, organic growth, innovation. That's really where we're focusing all of our attention from a strategic point of view.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just following up on the last comment you made about the use of cash. I'm just looking at the leverage ratio right now, and understanding that in 2Q, you wanted to take opportunity of your stock prices. But if you just look at your leverage target, is it still your intention to continue to take that down as your priority or just given that the leverage has not come down, you have more flexibility to do more buyback?
Robert Sands: Yes. We'll continue to take it down. But we also, obviously, have put in place a multiyear buyback program for our stock. And therefore, we also continue to take it -- we also intend to continue to take advantage of that as well. So just mathematically, the leverage has got to come down in all likelihood, the leverage ratio.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just in terms of your comment about the M&A strategy, because I guess at the Analyst Meeting, it sounded like you were a little bit more focused on M&A as part of your core strategy. And today, what we're hearing from you is that, that isn't the case. So I'm just wondering, has there been a bit of a change in thinking as you think about M&A, whether because. . .
Robert Sands: No, Judy. It's basically the same. If there's some opportunities that arise, which we think are both strategic and synergistic and material, we'll certainly consider it. But as I said at the Analyst Meeting, and as I said today, our primary focus is going to continue to be on driving organic growth. We will continue to pay down debt. And we do have the stock buyback program in place. So nothing has really changed. I mean, obviously, we also announced simultaneously today that we did purchase the remaining 50% of Ruffino. That was expected. That's turned out to be a pretty strategic brand for us, as it builds a niche, i.e., Old World Wine and Italy, which Italy in particular is a growing category. So M&A is really quite unpredictable and not a key part of the strategy. But it's not something that we will ignore either. So no change in our philosophy or approach relative to that.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, Bob, just in terms of your net sales outlook for North America wine in the back half of this year. So if you look at year-to-date, I think you're up about 0.8%. I think in the last call, you talked about flattish sales numbers in that part of the business. It sounds like depletion will be better in the back half given some of the new product and the promotional programs that are going to be in place. So how shall we think about the net sales growth in the back half? Do we see an acceleration or does the price mix then becomes a little bit of a less positive as you put more promotions in place?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. So I apologize for this, it gets a little confusing because of the overlap, right? So our sales growth versus prior year, especially in the third quarter won't look very strong for wine or for beer, because there were distributor inventory builds in the third quarter. Now the fourth quarter, it will not be that way. And as Rob had said from a depletion perspective, we do expect to experience better depletion growth in the back half of the year than we did the front half because of the incremental promotion spend and the kick in of additional new products. So expect to start gaining share back in the back half of the year. But I would say from a full year perspective, I think sales are expected to be relatively flattish because of the distributor overlap.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: How about just in terms of price mix trends? Because it sounds like in 2Q, you had a benefit of close to 3 points or so.
Robert P. Ryder: The mix shift, it's interesting not just to us, it's the category and Rob alluded to it. Generally, the more expensive wines are growing much faster than the less expensive wines. So if you look at the wines above $5 a bottle at retail, they're growing at a multiple of wines below $5 at retail. So we have experienced, and it was in the first quarter as well, a very positive mix shift. I would anticipate that to continue in the balance of the year, because that's driven by consumer behavior.
Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then can you just help us understand. So the nature of the higher promotional spending in the back half, is that more focused on just really price-related promotions or other type -- are there any other consumer-driving promotions that you're looking at?
Robert Sands: Yes. Those promotional activities are definitely not just focused on price, but really focused on driving merchandising activity, i.e., displays, feature ads and things of that nature, which in the licenses is what really drives sales. So in actuality, what we try to do is be very careful not to put all of our promotional dollars against price, but to put them against things like incentives that help to, as I said, drive the kind of merchandising activities that drives sale that don't necessarily impact margins on an ongoing basis. So it's really a good mix of promotional activity. Some price and a lot, again as I said, is incentives.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Albanese with Auriga.
Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division: Looking at the focus brands, the depletion level seemed to be much higher than I guess the rest of the wine shipments and it's even above the focus shipments. Is that something that you expect to continue? I know you mentioned trading up, but is this the kind of level that you expect to continue?
Robert Sands: Well, we actually think that depletion trends will accelerate for the focus brands. They've been growing in the 3% to 4% range in the first half actually, 3.6% in depletions that is in Q2, which is pretty robust. But clearly, with our promotional activities, much more focused towards the second half, we expect our focus brands, which are growing at a faster rate than the total portfolio to benefit even disproportionately, positively versus the rest of the portfolio. So we expect to see that the depletion trends accelerate on those.
Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division: Okay. And what's the...
Robert Sands: They represent about 85% of our U.S. profitability, actually about 70% of our U.S. profitably. So the focus brands are what are really important.
Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's good to know. With the Modelo new products, I mean, I know you're expanding into new markets, but how quickly is that expansion going? At what one point do you consider yourself to be fully, I guess entrenched into the markets that you're targeting?
Robert Sands: On the new products for Modelo, we see a lot of room to continue expanding within the U.S. on those price. I mean Victoria is not in full distribution by any stretch in the United States. So it's not even in some of the major markets like Florida and New York, for example. So there's a lot of runway on that and also a lot of runway on the new packages like the Familiar in particular, which has been a very, very successful package for Corona Extra.
Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division: Is that going to be like a 2-year kind of, I guess, growth period for these products or is it going to be a little bit longer or...
Robert Sands: We haven't put any definitive time frame on that, but it will definitely take a couple years to expand those products nationally. Yes, for sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicholas.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I guess 2 questions. Firstly, Bob, the corporate expense coming in so much lighter than last year, what was the cause of that?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. Mark, it was primarily an overlap of higher compensation cost last year. So that this year's run rate should continue.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. So I'm still trying to understand why the EBIT then came in, like I would assume you knew that at the start of the fiscal year. I'm still trying to figure out why the EBIT came in better than expected in the quarter than what you guided for the first quarter.
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. I think a lot of that would be just the timing amongst quarters for both sales and how the expenses hit. But I think for the full year, we're reiterating EBIT guidance. It will be relatively flattish for the full year.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then, Rob, just the tail of these non-focus brands are getting smaller as a percentage of your mix. Just trying to get a sense of how we should think about when that starts to become small enough but it's not a drag, the drag that's been on your total portfolio. Can you give us an update on what portion of the mix is now non-focus? What kind of decline rates are you seeing there and when you think you see it become less of a drag on the total portfolio?
Robert Sands: We don't necessarily see it as a big drag on the portfolio. Our tail is very similar to the industry's tail in general. Our focus brands represent about 60% of our volume. The rest is, you can call it -- some of it is not tail, some of it is actually what we might even call incubatored. Our new brands, for instance, are not in our focus brands and they're not in the tail. So I guess what I'm telling is that the tail is not a huge drag in general, but it's more about growing the rest of the portfolio at a faster rate to achieve our growth goals. So I wouldn't be thinking of the tail as a big inefficient to meeting any of our goals at this moment in time. So it's not something that we're looking forward to in the future, i.e., it diminishing. It's simply not a big issue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I think it's very encouraging to hear that you guys are going to maintain your guidance for the business as well as for the category. I'm just wondering, what's the different today relative to a couple of years ago in terms of what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior. Because it seems to be every category you're seeing the consumer respond a little bit differently in terms of some stepped up economic concerns.
Robert Sands: Well, Vivien, a couple of years ago, we were in the midst of the greatest recession since the Great Depression. So things are quite different today. We've seen the consumer rebound from where they were in 2009, in 2008, in particular. Our industry was not as impacted as other industry, so the rebound has been quite so stark because we didn't see the consumer basically go away and then come back again. We just saw the consumer shift channels and shift a little bit into some lower-priced segments, even though trading up actually almost remain constant throughout the recession and into the current period. If we look at sort of prerecession, postrecession, I'd say the biggest change in consumer behavior is that the consumer is still looking for more of a bargain than they have historically. The consumers become very accustomed to looking for deals, buying on promotion. And that's a trend that I think we would expect to continue for some time until things like unemployment abate and the economy becomes a bit more stabilized. So in general, the consumer is back. The business is robust, a lot of trading up going on, but the business remains fairly competitive in terms of promotional activity. The consumer remains highly sensitive thereto.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. But just in terms of thinking about your promotional strategy for the back half, you were talking about kind of the balance of incentives versus price promotions. How quickly can you adjust that to the extent that the consumer does get more price-sensitive bargain holiday?
Robert Sands: Most of our promotional activity is pretty lax and loaded for the holiday season. But we're also pretty confident that we put the dollars in the right place to drive depletion growth. And you can already see our depletion growth or consumer takeaway accelerating in IRI beginning with the beginning of September, so I think you'll continue to see that. We're basically in R&D, so it's pretty locked. But that's not an issue. We're there. This is the holidays.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with D.A. Davidson.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Rob, I was just thinking back to almost 5 years ago when you bought SVEDKA for $384 million. I think it was a 1.1 million case brand then. It's like 4.4 million now. And would you hazard a guess on what that's worth? I mean it might be worth half your market cap at this point or 1/3 or something.
Robert Sands: I'll let you hazard that guess, Tim. But it's obviously a very valuable asset. And as a standalone brand, yes, it probably does have a significant value, a disproportionate value to our market cap. There's no question about that.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: I guess I have to apologize for making fun of you over that purchase back then, but...
Robert Sands: You do. It’s actually turned out to be a very good purchase. The brand has performed fantastically and continues to perform fantastically. We're the third largest import and pretty much tied for second, and growing faster than the #2 import, right, which is Gray Goose.
Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: And would you now call it about 4.4 million cases? Is that about right?
Robert Sands: It's not quite 4 million or 4.4 million now. The question is what's the run rate? And definitely has a run rate similar to that.
Robert P. Ryder: We think it will hit around 4 million cases by the end for this fiscal year.
Robert Sands: And it continues to grow at double digits. So obviously, it will get to a 4.4 million case run rate as well. So we haven't seen a diminishment in the double digit sort of consumer takeaway growth rate. So we're pretty optimistic it's got a pretty good runway. And the beauty of SVEDKA is that most of its business is in the 80 proof, the non-flavored. So that bodes extremely well for the future and that it's not a flavor proliferation or trendy kind of thing with flavors coming into fashion and going out of fashion. The vast, vast majority of the business is, as I said, in the non-flavored 80 proof. And that means that it's a very, very stable business, and the growth in the business can be relied upon.
Robert P. Ryder: So you must have gotten to the 4.4 million by assuming the sales of the Halloween costumes. But they don't end up in the top line, so you got to take that away and that will get you close to the 4 million.
Operator: That was our final question. I'll turn the floor back over to you, Mr. Sands, any closing remarks.
Robert Sands: Okay. Well, thanks, everybody for joining our call today. And as I mentioned, I'm very pleased with our second quarter results, and I'm confident that we'll continue to execute in order to achieve our goals for the year. And most importantly, I remain focused on growing our U.S. Wine & Spirits business in line with the category of growth. And we're excited about the initiatives, which we have put in place for the second half of the year in this regard. We have all hands on deck and we believe we are well positioned for market execution during the holiday selling season in particular. Our next quarterly call is scheduled after the New Year, so please be sure to enjoy some of our excellent products during the upcoming holiday season. And as Tim and I just discussed, don't forget to wear your fembot Halloween costume while sampling our newest flavor of SVEDKA Vodka. So thanks again for everybody's participation. And again, happy holidays to everyone.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Melissa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's first quarter fiscal 2012 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com under the Investors section and Financial History. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For details of the risk factors that may affect the company's estimates, please refer to the news release in Constellation's SEC filing. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert Sands: Thanks, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's first quarter fiscal 2012 sales and earnings results. Before we get started, I'd like to thank those of you who attended our recent New York City Investor Meeting. I hope one of your key takeaways from that meeting is that Constellation is evolving as a disciplined and tightly aligned company. We are executing on our strategic imperatives to premiumize our portfolio, build our brands, strengthen our financial profile and unify the core foundation of our businesses, all in an effort to achieve one common goal: profitable organic growth. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve the business as outlined in this morning's press release, we are taking steps to further strengthen the core foundation of our business. With the recent sale of our U.K. and our Australian business, we have significantly improved our financial profile and simplified our business, which provides an opportunity for us to increase efficiencies and streamline our organization worldwide. During the first quarter, we began to implement organizational changes in an effort to align our cost structure with our simplified business model. Bob will provide additional financial details in a few minutes.  And now, I would like to focus on a discussion of our quarterly results. We're off to a good start for the year with results that were generally in line with our expectations. Highlights for the first quarter include our excellent free cash flow results, continued debt reduction activities and significantly improved profit margins. In addition, the Crown joint venture continues to outperform the U.S. beer industry and the import category. This is being driven by Crown's focused marketing efforts for Cinco de Mayo and the second annual Win the Beach sweepstakes, as well as incremental volume generated from the continuing launch of the Victoria brand.  As expected, depletion churns for our U.S. Wine & Spirits business in the first quarter were a bit muted. This is the result of the following actions: During the first quarter, we took price increases on certain specialty and value products, which negatively impacted volumes; and, it was during last year's first quarter that our promotional spend exceeded that of the market as we worked to jumpstart the portfolio following the distributor transitions when we were focused on executing on consolidation strategy. Therefore, this year's first quarter represents a tough sales comparison versus last year, as we overlap higher-than-average promotional spend from last year. Overall for fiscal 2012, we are targeting promotional spend that is in line with last year's, although the timing is different, in that it is less skewed to the first quarter. Therefore, our expectation is that you will see improving depletion trends as we move through the year. As you know, at any given point in time during the year, we do post our promo activity as appropriate based on any number of factors, including business seasonality and the competitive environment, as well as consumer takeaway trends.  Our marketplace performance reflects this in the form of an increase or decrease in promotional activities that typically drives volume results during any given time period throughout the year. During fiscal 2012 and for the remainder of the contract term, we expect our U.S. domestic shipment to essentially equal distributor depletions on an annual basis. And on an absolute case volume basis, we achieved this goal in the first quarter. We are committed to maintaining market share and growing at least in line with category growth for the U.S. Wine & Spirits industry. During calendar 2010, we accomplished this objective and maintained U.S. market share on a volume basis in total across all channels, and we intend to replicate this performance again this year while achieving our profitability goals. As I mentioned earlier, our total portfolio, including focus brands, is facing a tough comparison issue versus last year due to the timing of promotional activity, which drove focus brands' depletion in last year's first quarter to a growth rate of more than 11%. If you average the depletion growth for last year's first quarter with this year's first quarter, you will see that an average depletion growth rate of more than 7% over the last 2 years. And while we're on the topic of focus brands, I'd like to discuss a new initiative that was recently launched called maximizing velocity and profit, or we call it MVP. This program is a result of our work in the area of pricing and promotional effectiveness, where we have developed a model to measure the success of different promotional techniques and identify the incremental returns for key promotional activities. Maximizing velocity and profit is dedicated to committing a higher share of promotional dollars against our highest velocity, highest margin, U.S. wine SKUs, of which are included within our focus brand groups. We expect to see the benefit of this initiative as we progress throughout the year.  From an innovation and new product development perspective, we have already launched about 50% of our planned product introductions for the year. These brands include Rex Goliath Muscato, Arbor Mist Pomegranate Berry Pinot Noir, Ruffino Prosecco, Woodbridge, Malbec and the Simply Naked unoaked wine varietals just to name a few. SVEDKA Vodka sales declined in the quarter due to an unfavorable comparison versus last year when there was significant buy-in in advance of a price increase for SVEDKA. This is certainly not reflective of underlying consumer demand for SVEDKA, which posted double-digit consumer takeaway growth in IRI channels during the first quarter.  SVEDKA continued to be the fastest-growing major premium U.S. spirits brand, approaching 4 million cases this year. It is also the biggest climber on this year's Global Power 100 Wine and Spirits Brand list, moving up 17 places to #29. For 2012, we will continue to build expected on premise brand awareness. We have plans in place to increase our digital and media investment, and we expect that you'll find our planned introduction of new packaging configurations and flavor profiles to be highly innovative. Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. Crown posted a very positive first quarter with wholesalers increasing their inventory to more optimal levels in advance of the key summer selling season and in support of the continued rollout of Victoria and the Corona Familiar. Crown also realized positive depletion trends in the low single-digit range during the quarter.  At retail, Crown outperformed the total U.S. spirit industry, the imports category and the other 3 major beer suppliers in both case sellers and sales trends in the IRI food, drug, mass and convenience channels, posting positive trends in both case and dollar sales. And among the 4 major beer suppliers, Crown was the only one to gain case and dollar market share. During Cinco, once again, Corona executed full range of on and off premise retail promotions, outperforming all key competitors. Crown was the only major supplier to gain market share in either case sales or dollar sales during that timeframe, which is the second-largest selling period during the year for Corona. As we progress through 2012, Crown has some exciting business initiatives underway. And some of the examples include the expansion of the Corona Familiar 32-ounce bottle, Victoria, which has already been extended beyond the initial Chicago test market into Colorado and Texas, and was expanded into other top U.S. imported beer markets in early calendar 2011, including Arizona, California, Georgia and 5 other states. The Corona Beach Getaway promotion, which was so successful during last year's summer selling season, will be bigger and better this year. Now in its second year, the Corona Beach Getaway promotion will mark the biggest retail promotion in the history of Crown Imports and represents an evolution from last year's promotion including more prizes, more packages and a new promotional TV spot to drive consumers to retail to participate in the promo and drive display activity during the critical summer selling season. Crown also plans to extend its successful Find Your Beach advertising campaign, with several new executions which are set to debut throughout the summer selling season. Crown is excited to announce that Corona partner, Kenny Chesney, is back for a full 49-city Going Coastal Tour in calendar 2011, which is already underway. As presenting sponsor, Corona will capitalize on this partnership via retail support and in-venue programming to promote the brand. Lastly, the 2011 Modelo Especial summer promotion will build on the 2010 momentum by partnering with Sports Illustrated to offer consumers the chance to win an exclusive international soccer trip to any match worldwide. Collectively, these initiatives are expected to result in fiscal 2010 depletion growth in the low to mid single-digit rate for the second consecutive year for Crown. In closing, our first quarter results reflect progress against our strategic imperatives, including brand building and the strengthening of our financial profile and core foundation. Overall, I believe we are well positioned to deliver our financial and strategic goals for the year.  I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our first quarter business results.
Robert Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Q1 results were generally in line with our expectations. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.39 versus $0.38 last year. And we generated $220 million of free cash flow. That's $185 million more than Q1 last year. Let me provide some high-level comments to frame in these results before I go into more details. Throughout the year, we expect to have quarterly comparison discussions. Due to the FY '11 U.S. distributor inventory build, the overlap of the FY '11 supply chain disruption at Crown, increased marketing at Crown, the sale of our Australian and U.K. business and the outcome of various tax items in both years. Q1 happens to reflect favorable comparison items, which we'll discuss. Comparable basis EBIT came in nearly $20 million or 12% higher than last year. Of this $20 million, the North American segment increased $6 million, the Crown JV earnings increased about $6 million, corporate expenses were down $5 million and our Australian U.K. business lost $3 million in the prior year. These upsides in Q1 are timing related as we continue to expect a flattish EBIT results for the full year of fiscal 2012. This is the first full quarter we will report results without the Australian and U.K. business. Consolidated gross margin and operating margin improved significantly in the quarter as a result of this divestiture.  Following the sale of the Australian U.K. business, we have initiated plans to refine the structure of our remaining business and gain efficiencies. I will outline the financial details of this initiative in a few moments. We continued to generate very strong free cash flow, de-lever the balance sheet and reduce interest expense during the quarter. The EBIT growth and lower interest expense was essentially offset by some unfavorable timing related to our comparable basis effective tax rate, which came in at 37% versus 24% in Q1 last year. Given that overview, let's look at our first quarter 2012 P&L performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated reported net sales decreased 19%, primarily due to the divestiture of our Australian and U.K. business. North American net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 2%. This reflects favorable mix and lower promotions in the U.S., partially offset by a decrease in volume.  Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 39.5% versus 34.5% in the prior year. This primarily reflects the benefit of divesting the lower gross margin Australian and U.K. business. Favorable product mix and lower promotion costs in the U.S. were offset by higher costs for imported products and transportation costs, mostly fuel. Our consolidated SG&A margin for the quarter came in at 21.4% of net sales, which was even with Q1 last year. Consolidated operating income increased 12% to $116 million, and operating margin increased 5 percentage points to 18%. I'd now like to highlight the segment operating income results to provide highlights for our operating income change. North American segment operating income increased $4 million to $137 million. Improvement in sales mix and lower promotions was partially offset by the higher cost of goods sold I mentioned earlier and increases in G&A and marketing expenses. Corporate costs were down $5 million, primarily related to lower expenses for our Project Fusion initiatives. As mentioned earlier, the Australia and Europe segment reported an operating loss of $3 million in Q1 last year. Consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $62 million versus $55 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $60 million versus $54 million for the prior year quarter. For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $678 million, an increase of 9%, and operating income of $120 million, an increase of 10%. As Rob mentioned, Crown had positive depletion growth and gained share in measured channels. The robust net sales and EBIT growth, however, was primarily driven by shipments, which exceeded depletions for the quarter, as distributor inventories are better positioned going into the summer selling season versus last year. Crown also saw improvement in net pricing and mix, but had higher marketing costs during the quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $44 million, down 9% versus last year. The decrease was driven by reduced debt levels during the quarter. Let's take a look at debt. At the end of May, our debt totaled $3 billion. This represents the $244 million decrease from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2011, and was driven by our strong free cash flow generation. Given our near-term focus on debt reduction, we prepaid $400 million of term loan debt through a combination of cash and revolver proceeds during Q1. The net debt decrease drove our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio down to 3.2x at the end of May from a 3.6x ratio at the end of February. Our continuing de-leveraging efforts drove credit rating upgrades during the quarter. These ratings are now one notch below investment grade, and represent the highest ever achieved by Constellation. As mentioned earlier, our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 37% versus 24% in Q1 last year, which reflected the favorable outcomes of various tax items. Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated free cash flow of $220 million versus $35 million in Q1 last year. This improvement reflects a cash benefit for taxes and reduced use of cash to fund receivables. In the quarter, we received a net refund of taxes, primarily related to the Q4 fiscal '11 sale of our U.K. business. In addition, our receivable balance increased less in the previous year, due to timing within the quarter and the sale of our Australian and U.K. business. We continue to target free cash flow for fiscal 2012 in the $600 million to $650 million range. This includes CapEx in the range of $85 million to $95 million and cash restructuring cost of approximately $26 million. Now let's move to our full year fiscal 2012 P&L outlook. We continue to expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.90 to $2 a share, versus the $1.91 result for fiscal '11. I would like to reiterate a couple of items related to our guidance for fiscal '12. As a reminder, shipments exceeded depletions during fiscal 2011 for our U.S. Wine & Spirits business. For fiscal 2012 and thereafter, shipments should generally align with depletions on an annual basis. Our fiscal '12 year-over-year EBIT growth will be impacted by the fiscal '11 shipment number exceeding the fiscal '11 depletion number. In Q1 of both FY '11 and FY '12, shipments were generally aligned with depletions so there was no overlap issue. In the second and third quarters of fiscal '11, shipments exceeded depletions, therefore, in the second and third quarters of fiscal '12, this will present overlap issues on reported sales growth, which will negatively impact EBIT growth. For the full fiscal year, we continue to anticipate depletion growth for the U.S. Wine & Spirits business in the 3% range. As Rob mentioned, we expect improving depletion trends as we move through the year, given our promotional program, prior year overlaps and new product launches. The overlap of the prior year distributor inventory build should keep our North American Wine business at flattish organic sales growth and modest EBIT growth for the full year. Turning to the Beer business, as noted earlier by Rob, Crown is still targeting low to mid single-digit depletion growth for this year. As we have previously outlined, the JV partners decided on incremental funding levels of marketing and promotion spending by Crown for calendar 2011 and thereafter. This additional investment is expected to drive flat to slightly down operating earnings for Crown in fiscal '12. This marketing spend is more heavily weighted to our second and third quarters. For Q2 fiscal '12, we expect EBIT to be $15 million to $20 million less than Q2 last year, essentially reversing the Q1 fiscal '12 EBIT growth. This reflects the impact of the overlap of the prior year distributor inventory build in the U.S., higher promotional marketing expense in wine and increased marketing at Crown. This will be partially offset by continued positive mix shift in the U.S. wine. I would also like to reiterate that interest expense is expected to be in the range of $180 million to $190 million. And we are targeting a 29% effective tax rate for the full year fiscal '12. Given the 37% rate in Q1, we expect our quarterly tax rate to fluctuate over the remaining quarters. And due to the timing of various tax items, we currently expect the Q2 rate to be around 10%. We expect weighted average diluted shares to approximate 216 million. We did not repurchase any common stock during Q1, and our guidance excludes the impact of any potential repurchases of common stock. As discussed earlier, we began to implement organizational changes to increase efficiencies. As a result, we expect to generate cost savings of more than $10 million from centralizing certain administrative, operational and commercial functions on a global basis. This benefit should be minimal for fiscal '12, and most of it should be realized in fiscal '13. In connection with these initiatives, the company expects to incur one-time cash charges of approximately $26 million, including $13 million of restructuring charges from employee reduction and $13 million of other related costs. Nearly all of the charges are expected to be recognized during fiscal 2012, and would be excluded from our comparable basis results. Before we take your questions, I would like to reiterate that Q1 results were in-line with expectations, and we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2012 comparable basis diluted EPS goal. We're also on track to achieve our $600 million to $650 million free cash flow goal, including funding for the restructuring program as we continue to take steps to improve the organization and streamline the business. Our strong free cash flow should move our comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio to around 3x by the end of fiscal 2012. This provides us flexibility on our capital structure management.  With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Just on the wine depletion trend, obviously, the comparisons were pretty tough on a promotional spending timing period. But if I just look at your mix now, so your focus brands is roughly 2/3 of your total U.S. domestic volume. If the focus brands can sort of grow in that high single-digit rate, it sounds like the non-focus brands really have to show much more moderation in terms of the decline or that the focus brands really have to accelerate at a faster pace. So can you just help us understand how we think about what's going to drive the focus brands to really grow even beyond kind of that high single-digits that you've mentioned sort of on a 2-year run rate basis?
Robert Sands: Yes, Judy. First of all, if you look at first quarter of last year, the focus brands grew, as I mentioned in my talk, about 11%. And of course, first quarter this year, they grew at a much faster pace than our overall growth rate. And on a blended basis, as we said all along, as we move throughout the year, we expect -- taking into account how the non-focus brands will perform the overall portfolio to maintain market share against the category.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. So it sounds like you really have to then step up spending more meaningfully. So can you maybe just talk about the margin implications as that happens? Do you have -- what was sort of embedded in that expectation?
Robert Sands: Right. We will spend on promo the same amount this year on a per-case basis taking into account mix, as we spent last year. Therefore, since we significantly underspent what we spent last year in the first quarter, we will step up promo spend in the latter part of this year versus last year. So basically, we just simply have the reverse pattern of what we did last year with promo last year more geared towards the beginning of the year, and promo this year more geared towards the middle or latter part of the year. So the answer is yes. It's going to increase significantly as we go through the year. But that's all baked into our guidance and expected -- was expected and this is what we've been discussing with you for some time now.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And then, Bob, just in terms of the comparison items that you cited. So for the full year fiscal 2012, you have unfavorable comparisons because of the shipments and depletions like last year. But in Q1, you've talked about actually benefiting from some of the favorable comparison items. So on the Crown, it sounds like it's really shipments exceeding depletions which reverses in the back half. You talked about the Australia and U.K. business, which lost money in Q1. So you've got sort of the positive comparison there. But on the North American wine and on the corporate side where you saw favorability there, is there any timing issue that benefited your Q1 as well?
Robert Sands: Not really. I mean, Judy, every quarter, there's some timing issues about when marketing is spent or when SG&A happened versus when it happened in the prior year, but we would expect that to kind of smooth out in the balance of the year. So I would say, there wasn't a tremendous amount of timing aspects in the North American business.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And then just on the -- on your balance sheet side, just obviously, you've continued to take leverage down. You're now below your sort of 3.5x leverage -- the target leverage ratio, how are you thinking about share buyback at this point?
Robert Sands: Yes, I mean, we're constantly assessing the capital structure and constantly weighing debt pay down versus stock buybacks. So the constant thing in the first quarter, as we said, we decided not to buy any stock back, but we'll continue to look at it as the year progresses.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lauren Torres of HSBC.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: Bob, just go back to your guidance with respect to the reduction in your reported EPS range. Now that we're thinking about these restructuring charges flowing through, any guidance of how you think about that over the course of the year as far as quarterly flow? And then also, as you think about cost savings and maybe also the one-time charges hitting over the course of the year, I mean is that number, the guidance that you have on that cost savings number pretty clear now? It seems like maybe there's more opportunity for that. And I guess on the other side, if there's the potential for that charge number to go up, too, and then once again impacting your reported EPS guidance. Just any guidance on how to think about that.
Robert Ryder: Yes, I mean. So the numbers that we disclosed in the press release should -- that's our plan for the restructuring charge. Of course, the costs are not included in comparable results. We don't expect the savings to have much of an impact in fiscal '12, but they should be full impact in fiscal '13. Now obviously, we're not issuing fiscal '13 guidance. There's a lot of innings between now and when we'll issue guidance. So certainly, that will be taken into account when we come out with what our EBIT will be for fiscal '13.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: But is the clarity good? Particularly I guess on the charge side for fiscal '12, what the impact will be, and I guess any guidance about how to flow through that impact over the course of this year?
Robert Ryder: Yes, I mean, we're not giving guidance by quarter, but it's going to be the -- it will all be in there for the full year, probably mostly back-end loaded. And it's the $26 million that we have in the press release, if I recall that number correctly.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: Okay. And if I could also ask on Crown, you mentioned that you did see some improvement in that pricing. Just curious about the import pricing environment in the U.S. at this point, where is your portfolio versus your competitors? Is there room for more pricing? How are you thinking about that?
Robert Sands: Yes, this is Rob. Basically, the import pricing situation is very stable in the U.S. at the current time. And as far as our portfolio goes, we really don't have any plan to take pricing in our portfolio this fiscal year. We have talked about some reductions and promo from time to time and shift from promo to marketing. But fundamentally, we don't have any pricing plans on our cross-the-board basis. Now we do look at every market on a case-by-case basis. And if things have happened in the market relative to competition that warrants pricing, then of course, Crown will consider that on a case-by-case basis. But we're not taking -- I have no plans to take aggressive price increases.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: Okay. And I guess last question on the launch and the continued rollout of Victoria. I'm not sure if you mentioned how far through that process are you and how much more of that we'll see benefit the Crown business for the remainder of the year.
Robert Sands: Yes. Well, what I said is that we've now intro-ed beyond the Chicago market on Victoria in quite a few other markets in the United States, in some big markets like California, Arizona and Texas, Colorado to name a few. And the roll out will continue, but this was the next stage and we're working on plans for further rollout in the future. So...
Robert Ryder: Well, I mean the Victoria volumes were probably incremental for the quarter. And obviously, we're not in the fine beer selling season. So it won't have an insignificant impact on our growth. It's going to be a nice add, but it's all included in our guidance
Lauren Torres - HSBC: And that is priced out of premium or compared to the Corona and the other primary brands in the portfolio?
Robert Ryder: Correct. It is priced at a premium to Corona Extra.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tim Ramey of D. A. Davidson.
Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.: I wonder if you could give us any more visibility on the volatility or just the components of the rate volatility because that is -- it was a much higher rate, this quarter obviously a much lower rate in the 2Q. Can you help us understand that a little bit?
Robert Ryder: Yes, I'll try, but it won't be easy. So, I mean, look, there's a lot of different things going on in the tax rate in various tax jurisdictions. And essentially what happens under current accounting, when a company and a tax regulator come to a conclusion on a particular matter, that's when it hits your P&L. So as these things come to a conclusion, when the others come in and they sit down with our tax guys and they say, "Okay, this is the deal." That's when we book the upside. So by nature, it will be choppy throughout the year.
Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.: And just one more, for Rob maybe. The wine industry, I think, has shown some incremental sales lift recently. I don't know how that's factored into your view of the overall sales of the category and how it would affect your focus brands versus your total portfolio?
Robert Sands: Yes, the wine industry is pretty healthy right now. And I'd say that in general, we anticipate that it tends to be about where it is. And we geared a lot of activity relative to MTV and line extensions and things to this is effect in the areas that are experiencing some of that incremental volume, Muscato, Sweet Red, Prosecco are examples. And we have new products, new SKUs in all of those areas and therefore, we should benefit from that. But nevertheless, we anticipate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess a couple of questions. Firstly, just to better understand the second quarter commentary. You said Crown down $15 million to $20 million. Is that right, year-on-year?
Robert Ryder: No. Total -- from the second quarter, we said total EBIT will be down $15 million to $20 million, Mark.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it, got it. And how much do you think Crown will be down?
Robert Ryder: We're not really giving specific guidance on Crown. But do remember that last year, we did have kind of a shortage of inventory at Crown, okay? So you might see an okay sales number, but remember, our increased marketing expense will really start kicking in, in Q2, Q3, because that's when the media is launched in the season. So you will -- if we say for the full year, Crown EBIT is going to be flattish to slightly down, and you saw our first quarter was way up, you can expect that to start to happen in the balance of the year, of course.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And if we look at the Wine business, it sounds like you still expect operating income there to be up. But sales, you're saying -- what are you saying about sales given the debt comparison? Sales get worse before they get better in terms of rate of decline? Or what do you say there?
Robert Ryder: Second quarter or balance of the year?
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Second quarter, sorry.
Robert Ryder: Yes. It's the second quarter, remember, reported sales last year included shipments ahead of depletions. So we will be overlapping that shipment in excess of depletions for the U.S. Wine business in mostly Q2, Q3. But that will hurt our reported sales growth number and our reported EBIT growth number. So I would expect in the second quarter both wine and beer EBIT to be down to prior year because of these overlap issues.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And is it fair to think of the 3.5% U.S. shipment decline in the quarter, in light of what you just said, you'll see a little bit greater rate of decline in the second quarter?
Robert Ryder: I don't know, Mark. I don't want to get into economic models.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, fair enough. And then, interest expense guide of $180 million to $190 million seems high when you look at what the rate -- what the spent -- what the interest expense was in the quarter and you're de-levered. So why the $180 million to $190 million?
Robert Ryder: Well, so what's going on in that line item, remember we prepaid $400 million in Q1, so our rates have become more fixed because we're paying back variable. And we also have a swap kicking in, in September of this year, also at a fixed rate. So you can't just take, I guess, current variable LIBOR and extrapolate it forward. So I think if you do the math on that, you'd see that our interest expense will probably come out maybe at the lower end of our guidance. But remember, that assumes we do no stock buybacks.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. Okay. Is it fair to say that swaps is materially above kind of what your blended cost it right now, your blended coupon is right now?
Robert Ryder: Yes, I think that the all-in swap rate would probably be just below 5%.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then this comment, this next logical step comment, and you called out the $10 million in savings and $26 million to get it. But should we think about the $10 million as the next logical step, so to speak? Or is the $10 million one of a series of next logical steps?
Robert Ryder: It's the next logical step. We have no other steps planned in that regard beyond the $26 million charge and the $10 million in associated savings. We don't anticipate any further charge into that nature this time.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then finally, you're seeing healthy growth in your non-U.S. business, I think it was up something like 300,000 cases year-on-year in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about, and you talked about this at your analyst day, but can you talk a little bit about what countries are driving that growth? And in terms of cases, how much incremental opportunity you think is out there over the next year or 2?
Robert Sands: Yes. So I'm not, Mark, and I -- I haven't done the math so I can think of how you do the analysis to get to your 300,000 cases. The difficult thing on the math is, and I'll try to explain this, it's kind of technical. In last year's -- first quarter of last year, as the North American segment sold products to say, our international segments, right? They were, of course, illuminated in consolidation in the ultimate sale appeared in the international segment. Now this year, we continue to sell those same products through what used to be our international segment, but is now a third-party. Now in this year, we report those as third-party sales, right? So it's -- that's why, in the press release, we kind of highlight that and it gets you from that 8% kind of GAAP growth to more like a 3% comparable growth. Now we did not do that comparable adjustments down in the supplemental shipment depletion data, where I assume you did your calculation to get that international volume growth.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. So in that particular table, it should've been reclassified in a sense in North America?
Robert Ryder: Right. So you can't really do the analysis you're trying to do.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it, got it. Okay well then that's helpful. And then finally on that, can you just talk about the case opportunity you think is out there for your non-U.S. business just over the next year or 2?
Robert Ryder: Yes. I mean, I'll do the organic thing, and then Rob talk about other stuff. But right now, the existing business we have, of course, is we do it in Canada. The view in the domestic market is quite small. It's not really worth talking about a lot. The Canadian market is like the U.S. It's pretty healthy, and there's a positive mix shift going on. In our first quarter, we actually had negative volumes up there, mostly because the lower end of the Canadian market is shrinking. And we have a heavy participation in that, but we did have, like the U.S., very positive mix shift because we are selling a lot of what the Canadians call, VQA wine, which is the upper end wine. So we had negative volumes, much better sales and positive EBIT growth in Canada for the quarter. And we would expect that to pretty much stay for the balance of the year. Now I'll call it kind of the nonorganic international growth, which is kind of our new international segment. I'll let Rob speak to that.
Robert Sands: And that is a relatively small part of the business at the current time. But as we've said, or I said recently, and I was certainly looking at some of the emerging markets, China in particular, and contemplating how many might take advantage of what appears to be fairly explosive growth for wine in that market in particular. So I won't expect anything material relative to that in the very short term, but we'll tell you more about that as we develop our plans.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin Dreyer of GAMCO Asset Management.
Kevin Dreyer - Gabelli: I may have missed it in the call, but did you breakout spirits versus wine sales and growth during the quarter?
Robert Ryder: So Kevin, to simplify our press release, we stopped breaking that out. But we do comment on the spirits growth for the quarter. Usually, the activity is around SVEDKA. And I think Rob spoke to the fact that SVEDKA growth in our financials was not good, but that was simply due to a price increase we took in a couple of state last year in the load in prior to that price increase occurring last year's first quarter. So our Spirits business had negative volume growth this year, but if you look at IRI, SVEDKA is still growing in say, the 20% kind of range. So it's more of just a technical overlap thing. We continue to be very happy with our Spirits business.
Kevin Dreyer - Gabelli: Okay. So from your shipment perspective, it is down slightly?
Robert Ryder: It is down, like, sort of low double digits.
Kevin Dreyer - Gabelli: Low double digits. And help me out, I'm sorry, I just don't understand how there can be such a big delta between up 20 to low double digits other than the...
Robert Ryder: Last year in the first quarter, it was like up 45%, 50%, because [indiscernible].
Kevin Dreyer - Gabelli: So it's just distributors running down in your total?
Robert Ryder: It's a difficult thing when you have a price increase. Everybody tries to load up the fuel price.
Operator: Your next question comes from Carlos LaBoy of Crédit Suisse.
Carlos LaBoy - Crédit Suisse AG: We might take our wine questions offline and focus on beer instead. Rob, Corona Light seems to be getting a really nice pickup of facings out there. Are you refocusing or reconsidering the long-term prospects of Corona Light? And on a related basis, the second question is about Victoria. If you could share with us what you learned about the rollout in Chicago, who had sourcing volumes from and what you might have learned about Victoria in Chicago that you can reapply elsewhere.
Robert Sands: Yes, I think first of all the Corona Light, we're pretty optimistic about Corona Light. We think that there's more -- a lot more upside in Corona Light. It's the largest light import at this point. We're doing a lot of work differentiating it from Corona and giving it a life of its own. We've got new ads for Corona Light that are differentiating it, again, that are geared towards differentiating it from Corona. And as I said, I think that we're very optimistic about it. As it relates to Victoria, it's been a very, very strong rollout is the bottom line. And I would say that the volume that we've gained from it is actually kind of quite phenomenal for a new rollout, given the amount of the country that we're in. We're seeing good velocity on the brand in the markets where we've intro-ed it, and continued good velocity as some of those markets have become more mature. Meaning, you typically see when you introduce a new brand, sort of accelerated velocity initially, and then you sort of look to see what it's going to settle down to, and it's selling down very nicely to levels that should make it a very nice growing and sustainable business for us. So we're really optimistic. As for source, it's pretty across the board in terms of source. It's not cannibalizing our own business to a particularly great extent, but it's premium priced anyways, point #1. But you know, it's sourcing from pretty much across the board, much like the imports, much like Corona in general. It sources from the domestic premiums, it's sourcing from craft. It's sourcing pretty much evenly across the board, so it's a great product. And I'd encourage everybody to try it. It's got a lot of the characteristics of the craft segments, but it's also got the advantage, I think, of drinkability. Very drinkable.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I'll now turn the call back to Mr. Sands for any closing remarks.
Robert Sands: Okay. Well, I want to thank everybody for joining our call today. And as I mentioned, I think we're off to a good start this year in a number of areas. And we are certainly on track to deliver our goals for the year. Our plan is to continue execution on our strategic imperatives through the remainder of our fiscal year. So thanks again for your participation, and we hope you have the opportunity to enjoy some of those great beers like Victoria and our Wine & Spirits products during the upcoming 4th of July holiday. We'll see you all soon, I'm sure.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Wes, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will turn the conference over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Wes. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End 2011 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release, which has been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial estimation on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com under the Investor section. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release in Constellation's SEC filing. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert Sands: Thanks, Patty. Good morning, and welcome to our call. We recently completed a year of significant accomplishments as we delivered against a number of key strategic goals and business initiatives. I would like to take a minute to highlight some of these accomplishments.  We sold the majority of our U.K. and Australian business to the CHAMP Private Equity for approximately $220 million. This transaction represented another transformational step in the execution of our strategy as this business was no longer aligned with our strategic imperatives. We utilized the proceeds from this transaction in combination with strong free cash flow to reduce debt by almost $600 million. This also enabled a decrease in our leverage ratio to the mid-3x range, a level we have not achieved since May 2006. We generated free cash flow of $530 million for the year, and we are targeting, for fiscal 2012, free cash flow to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million. We have obviously made significant progress from our ongoing focus in this area. These strong free cash flow results essentially enabled us to fund an accelerated stock buyback transaction while continuing to reduce debt. We are approaching the final leg of Project Fusion, which was designed to create an integrated technology platform and develop world-class systems to support our business. Our Fusion initiatives have reached major milestones within the past year, and the work being done within this program is helping Constellation become more connected as one company, improving efficiencies and achieving cost savings across our business.  Lastly, we have strengthened the core foundation of our U.S. business to the implementation of our U.S. distributor initiative, which is also one of the primary catalysts driving profitable, organic growth. Presently, this program gives five distributors the rights to sell Constellation's portfolio of wine and spirits exclusively in their respective markets in 22 states and currently represents approximately 60% of our total U.S. wine and spirit volume.  As we previously discussed, our sales volume to distributors exceeded distributor sales to retail and on-premise channel throughout fiscal 2011 due to the distributor transition. This had the effect of benefiting sales and profits for our U.S. business and will create an EBIT comparison challenge for fiscal 2012, the impact of which has been factored into our guidance for this year. During fiscal 2012 and for the remainder of the contract term, we expect our shipments to essentially equal distributor depletions on an annual basis.  Meanwhile, in order to put things into perspective relative to how Constellation is performing in the U.S. marketplace, it is best to review a combination of our shipment data, distributor depletions and consumer takeaway trend as they are indicative of the underlying health of our business. In an effort to help you better understand this part of our business, we have added shipment and depletion information to the Financial Attachments section of our press release. We expect to provide this information on a quarterly and year-to-date basis going forward so that you will be able to better understand the results of our efforts. As you can see, for our fiscal year ended in February, depletion volumes or distributor sales to retail for Constellation's total U.S. total Wine and Spirits business across all channels increased approximately 3% for the year, which is in line with industry trends. And according to recently released data from the Beverage Information Group for calendar 2010, we maintained U.S. market share on a volume basis in total across all channels and therefore, essentially grew in line with the category, which has been our goal since the launch of the U.S. distributor initiative. However, more recently, you may have noticed a bit of market weakness for our U.S. Wine business in the IRI or Nielsen data that you receive and analyze on a regular basis. I'd like to take a minute to describe what's driving these trends and remind everybody that the IRI food and drug channels represent approximately 30% of our business with the next two largest channels represented by the liquor and on-premise channels. At any given point during the year, we post our promo activities as appropriate based on a number of factors including business seasonality, the competitive environment and consumer takeaway trends.  Our marketplace performance reflects this in the form of an increase or decrease in promotional activity that typically drives volume results during any given time period throughout the year. You may remember that during the first half of fiscal 2011, our promotional spend exceeded that of the market as we worked to regain market share that we had lost during the distributor transition, when we were focused on executing our consolidation strategy. During the second half of fiscal 2011, we resumed more normalized levels of promotional activity but also scaled back promotional support for the lower margin, non-premium brand at the less than $5 retail price point. This was done in an effort to improve margins on these products. But as expected, this action negatively impacted volumes. This activity will happen from time to time throughout the year as part of the normal course of operations, because we are focused on taking actions appropriate for the long-term health of the business. As a matter of fact, during the first quarter, we will take selected price increases on certain specialty and value product to continue to enhance margins. So you will continue to see this kind of volatility in IRI. Keep in mind, however, that this IRI data represents only a portion of our entire business. As we discussed, going forward, our goal remains the same. From a depletion and consumer takeaway perspective, we expect to grow in line with the market across all channels for fiscal '12 and beyond. The promotional environment overall in the U.S. market appears to have stabilized yet remains competitive. One of the most important things to keep in mind is that our focus brands, which represent the majority of our U.S. wine profitability, posted positive depletion trends of almost 10%, 10% for the year, and we gained market share for this entire group of products. It's many of these focus brands that have recently received recognition in the form of awards and accolades. The following, which I think are particularly noteworthy: Constellation recently received Impact 2010 Hot Brand Awards for SVEDKA, Black Box, Kim Crawford, Rex Goliath and Modelo Especial. Seven of our U.S. wine brands were included in IRI's list of 30 Top Momentum Table Wine Brands.  We received the Beverage Information Group's 2011 Growth Brands Awards for blüfeld, SVEDKA, Black Box, Kim Crawford, Cook's and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. And blüfeld became one of the Top 10 IRI New Table Wine Brands. And in terms of new product development, we have several initiatives underway with the recent launch of Toasted Head Untamed White, Arbor Mist Pomegranate Pinot Noir and Simply Naked, which is a line of unoaked varietals. Rex Goliath, one of the fastest-growing major brand, introduced Sauvignon Blanc and Moscato brand extensions. Moving on to SVEDKA, our Spirits business. Our Spirits sales results for the year are certainly not reflective of depletion trends or underlying consumer demand for SVEDKA vodka, which posted double-digit sales depletion and IRI growth for 2011. For 2012, we will continue to build SVEDKA's on-premise brand awareness. We have plans in place to increase our digital and media investment, and we will be innovative with our planned introduction of new packaging configuration and flavor profiles. Bob will have more to say about factors driving the overall Spirits numbers in a moment. Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. For fiscal 2011, Crown benefited from the positive marketplace momentum that they built throughout the year. During this time frame, Crown outperformed the total beer industry, the import category and the other three major beer suppliers in both case and dollar sales trends in the SymphonyIRI food, drug mass and convenience channels. And among the four major beer suppliers, Crown was the only one to gain dollar market share. This is the result of product innovation, creative advertising campaigns, the ongoing support of wholesalers and excellent market execution.  Throughout the year, Crown implemented several new initiatives, increased marketing investments and launched new brand and packaging configurations in an effort to continue building value and increasing brand recognition, and it worked. Corona Extra was included in the first time in the Best Global Brands ranking published by Interbrand. And Modelo Especial was once again awarded Hot Brand designation from Impact magazine.  Collectively, these initiatives resulted in Crown posting depletion growth in the low- to mid-single digit range for fiscal 2011. As we head into fiscal 2012, Crown has some exciting business initiatives underway. Some examples include the expansion of the Corona Familiar 32-ounce bottle. Victoria, which has already been extended beyond the initial Chicago test market into Colorado and Texas and will enter it's next phase launch in Arizona, California, Georgia and five other states.  The Corona Beach Getaway promotion, which was so successful during last year's summer selling season, it will be bigger and better this year. Crown also plans to extend its successful 'Find Your Beach' advertising campaign with several new executions, which are set to debut throughout the spring and summer selling season. Lastly, Crown is excited to announce that Corona partner, Kenny Chesney, will be back for a full, 49-city Goin' Coastal Tour during calendar 2011. As presenting sponsor, Corona will capitalize on this partnership via retail support and in-venue programming to promote the brand. These initiatives are expected to result in fiscal 2012 depletion growth in the low- to mid-single digit range for the second consecutive year.  And finally, as I mentioned last quarter, the majority shareholder of Ruffino attempted to exercise an option to put their equity interest in Ruffino to Constellation. Prior to this notification, we initiated proceedings against the majority shareholder, questioning the validity of the put option. Although negotiations continue, we now anticipate that we will complete the transaction on substantially revised terms. In closing, I am certainly pleased with the outcome of fiscal 2011. I firmly believe our results validate our strategic imperatives, emphasizing premiumization, financial strength and profitable organic growth. We are very well positioned for the year ahead, and I look forward to sharing with you our vision for the future when we meet next month in New York City for our Investors Day. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob, our CFO, for a financial discussion of our year-end business results.
Robert Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. From a historical perspective, Constellation recorded highest-ever reported in comparable basis EPS results and highest-ever free cash flow result. We also exceeded the EPS and free cash flow guidance provided at the beginning of the year. From an operational perspective, our U.S. depletion trends improved considerably from the previous year, and in fact, grew in line with the overall U.S. wine and spirits market. Our focus brands, the brand against which we want our sales force and the distributors sales force to concentrate their efforts, grew depletion depth 3x the overall market.  On the beer side, Crown gained volume and dollar market share and grew EBIT for the first time since the JV formation. We sold our Australian and U.K. business, which was the last major portfolio move to premiumize the business. This follows the 2008 sale of our Value Wine business, the 2009 sale of our Value Spirits brands and the 2010 sale of our U.K. Cider business. From a free cash flow perspective, we delivered an all-time high by a large measure. Inventory investments were reduced dramatically. Payments for interest and restructuring were reduced, and capital spending was down. We believe all these are sustainable within our current portfolio of businesses. In addition, we significantly reduced taxes paid during the year. This lower level of tax payment is expected to continue for the next couple of years. We utilized our free cash flow and proceeds from asset sales to buy back shares in a highly accretive fashion, and we reduced our comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio by a half a point to about 3.6x. Putting these items I just outlined aside, higher promotional spending and SG&A contributed to our fiscal 2011 comparable EBIT decreasing almost 3%. The increase in promotional spending was in response to competitive activities and our efforts to regain momentum in our U.S. Wine business, following transition impacts related to our U.S. distributor consolidation initiative. The SG&A increase was due to a higher level of Project Fusion expenses, higher incentive compensation cost and the translation of foreign-denominated SG&A into U.S. dollars. Even with our planned EBIT reduction, our comparable basis EPS grew 13% to $1.91 and established a new foundation from which we can build in future years. Now let's look at our fiscal 2011 P&L performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, full year consolidated reported net sales decreased 1%, primarily due to the divestitures of our U.K. Cider and Australian and U.K. Wine businesses. Excluding the impact of the divestitures and currency, net sales increased 3%.  Before drilling down further on sales, I want to highlight some changes intended to improve our reporting. We've now combined wine and spirits sales in our North America segment reporting. This reporting is more closely aligned with our management of the business. Prior period results in our press release and our segment history schedule on our website have been restated to conform to this new presentation. In conjunction with that change, we've added information for North America, U.S. and focus brands shipment volumes, as well as U.S. depletion and focused brand depletion growth rates to the Net Sales page of the press release. With that, my commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Full year North American organic net sales increased 4% as U.S. volume growth combined with favorable U.S. product mix was partially offset by higher promotional cost. The U.S. shipment volume increase reflects shipments running ahead of depletions as part of our distributor consolidation transition activities. Australia, Europe organic net sales were level with the prior year.  While we're reporting wine and spirits net sales on a combined basis going forward, we provided supplemental spirits sales information as part of this reporting transition. Spirits organic net sales increased 4% as strong SVEDKA performance was somewhat offset by lower Black Velvet sales and lower contract service revenue. The lower contract service revenue was related to a service arrangement with the buyer of our Value Spirits business, which was in place throughout fiscal '10 but for only about half of fiscal 2011. Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis. For the year, our consolidated gross margin was 35.9% versus 35% for the prior year. This primarily reflects favorable product mix and grape cost benefits in Australia partially offset by higher promotion expense and grape costs in the U.S. Our consolidated SG&A margin for the year came in at 19.8% of net sales compared with 18.3% in the prior year. This primarily reflects incremental investments in technology for Project Fusion activities, unfavorable foreign exchange translation and increased incentive compensation. Consolidated operating income decreased 5% to $534 million and operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 16%. I'd now like to turn to our segment operating income results to provide highlights of our full year operating income change. North American segment operating income decreased $7 million to $631 million. Improvement in U.S. sales volume and mix was more than offset by higher promotion costs, higher grape cost, investments in technology and selling functions and higher incentive compensation cost.  The Australia and Europe segment reported operating income of $9 million, an $8 million decrease versus the prior year. The decrease was predominantly due to the divestiture of the U.K. Cider business in fiscal 2010. Consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $244 million versus $239 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $226 million versus $222 million for the prior year. The remainder of equity earnings in fiscal 2011 included $13 million from North America, which was primarily generated by Opus One and $6 million for the Australia Europe segment.  For the year, Crown generated net sales of $2.4 billion, an increase of 6%, and operating income of $453 million, an increase of 2%. Sales primarily benefited from volume growth driven by an improvement in consumer demand and from distributor inventories returning to more optimal levels as we head into the Cinco de Mayo and summer selling seasons. Crown operating results benefited from the volume improvement but were unfavorably impacted by a contractual product cost increase, a legal arbitration decision regarding a former distributor as discussed in Q3 and an increase in marketing cost. Interest expense for the year was $195 million, down 26% versus last year. The decrease was driven by a lower average interest rate due in part to our refinancing activities at the end of fiscal 2010 and reduced debt levels during the year. Our average interest rate for the year was around 5%. Let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of February, our debt totaled $3.2 billion, which represents an approximate $600 million decrease from our debt level at the end of 2010. This decrease is impressive given the funding of our $300 million stock buyback earlier in the year. Our comparable basis effective tax rate benefited from the favorable outcome of certain tax items and came in at 30%. This rate was level with the prior-year rate.  During the fourth quarter, we reported a net pretax gain of $84 million on the sale of our Australian and U.K. business. We also recognized a $198 million tax benefit in our reported income tax line related to our Australia and U.K. business. These items were excluded from our comparable results. From a cash perspective, we anticipate receiving the full benefit of this $198 million. We realized approximately $30 million of the total cash benefit in fiscal 2011. We currently expect to realize the remaining $168 million cash benefit on a fairly equal basis over fiscal '12 and fiscal '13. Now let's briefly discuss Q4. For the fourth quarter, organic constant currency net sales increased 10%. This was driven by 14% organic constant currency growth for North America, due primarily to a combination of higher volume and positive mix in the U.S. As you will recall, net sales for Q4 of fiscal 2010 were impacted by inventory reductions at certain U.S. distributors, which in turn drove unfavorable mix and reduced operating leverage at that time. The higher sales volume and mix drove a $29 million increase in North America operating income for Q4 fiscal 2011. The improved volume and mix helped drive a 360-basis point gross margin increase and improved operating leverage as SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 40 basis points. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $49 million versus $41 million for the prior year quarter. For the quarter, Crown's net sales increased 15% while operating income increased 18%. The strong results were driven by an improvement in consumer demand and from distributor inventories returning to more optimal levels heading into the key selling periods. Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For fiscal 2011, we generated free cash flow of $530 million versus $295 million for the same period last year. This improvement reflects lower payment for taxes, interest and restructuring. In addition, we saw a sizable source of cash resulting from a reduction in inventory. There was also an increased use of cash from accounts receivable due to the timing of sales. CapEx came in at $89 million versus $108 million for the prior year.  We're targeting free cash flow for fiscal 2012 in the $600 million to $650 million range. This includes CapEx in the range of $85 million to $95 million. The primary drivers of the projected $70 million to $120 million increase from FY '11 to FY '12 are lower interest and tax payments and a reduction in cash restructuring cost. Interest is projected to be down primarily due to anticipated lower debt balances. Our lower tax payment estimate is due to the previously mentioned tax benefit related to the Australian and U.K. business. Our fiscal 2011 free cash flow is a record for Constellation. We've made a lot of progress in reducing our net working capital investment, improving our process around capital expenditures and selling capital-intensive businesses. Our fiscal 2012 free cash flow guidance exceeds $600 million, which will be another record for Constellation. While FY '11 and FY '12 reflect lower-than-normal tax payments, we do feel many of our initiatives will provide lasting benefits and that our current business is capable of generating $500 million of annual free cash flow on average over the longer term. Now let's move to our full year fiscal 2012 P&L outlook. We’re forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of $1.90 to $2 versus our $1.91 result for fiscal '11. Currently, we do not anticipate restructuring charges or unusual items to impact EPS. Accordingly, reported basis diluted EPS is also targeted to be $1.90 to $2.  I would like to frame in a couple of items related to our flattish to up-slightly comparable basis EPS guidance for fiscal '12. While we're pleased with the underlying U.S. depletion trends, as mentioned earlier, shipments exceeded depletions during fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2012 and thereafter, shipments should generally align with depletion on an annual basis. As we overlap FY '11 shipments running ahead of depletions, we will face a difficult comparison in FY '12 as we currently anticipate flattish organic sales and modest EBIT growth for our U.S. Wine business.  As shipments align more closely to depletions, we expect to see some change in the year-over-year timing of sales and EBIT by quarter. The most significant impact will be about $0.07 to $0.10 of EPS, which will move from Q3 to Q4. Our EBIT will also be impacted by the sale of the Australian and U.K. business. As mentioned earlier, this business produced $9 million of operating income and $6 million of equity earnings or $15 million of EBIT in fiscal 2011. This EBIT was earned in the third and fourth quarters. With interest and cost savings, we expect the transaction to be slightly dilutive for fiscal 2012. This business recorded sales of $775 million in fiscal 2011. We estimate approximately $90 million of those sales will become third-party sales for our North American segment going forward, which will be adjusted in our organic sales reporting. While there's some minor near-term earnings impact, the sale of this business improves our financial profile, as operating margin should improve by more than 400 basis points. We also expect earnings to be less volatile and foreign currency exposure to be greatly reduced. Turning to the Beer business. Rob noted that Crown is targeting low- to mid-single digit depletion growth for the next year. As we outlined last quarter, the JV partners decided on incremental funding levels for marketing and promotion spending by Crown for calendar 2011 and thereafter. This additional investment is expected to drive flat to slightly down operating earnings for Crown in fiscal '12. This marketing spend is weighted to the second and third quarters. I would also like to note that interest expense is expected to be in the range of $180 million to $190 million. We are targeting a 29% tax rate. This rate will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, with the first quarter rate anticipated to be the highest. We expect weighted average diluted shares to approximate 216 million. Our board of directors has authorized a $500 million share repurchase program, which we expect to implement over multi-year time horizon. Currently, our near-term focus is on debt reduction. However, we believe it is important to have a share repurchase authorization in place to provide flexibility subject to market and other conditions, as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize the capital structure of the business. Our guidance excludes the impact of any potential repurchases of common stock. Before we take your questions, I'd like to highlight that fiscal 2011 demonstrated significant progress in our efforts to enhance the financial profile of the company. Our simplified U.S. organizational structure, streamlined brand portfolio and consolidated U.S. distributor network have contributed to improved depletion volumes and marketplace performance versus last year. In the Beer business, we continue to see positive depletion and retail results from Crown's marketplace execution. The sale of our Australian and U.K. business will result in a dramatic improvement to most financial metrics. Our free cash flow generation profile has stepped up significantly. Our $600 million to $650 million free cash flow projection represents an approximate 14% yield on our current market capitalization. With that level of free cash flow, rough math would indicate a comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio around 3x by the end of fiscal 2012. This provides us flexibility in our capital structure management.  With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of UBS.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: As we think about the difference between shipments and depletions or the guidance of flat revenue growth on flat to marginal EBIT growth, can you give us a read on where maybe the flex points would be in SG&A or somewhere else where there might be some leverage if trends are any better or any worse than expected?
Robert Ryder: Well, Kaumil, the guidance is really what the guidance is. As far as the flattish EBIT growth in the guidance for next year, it is strictly a function of overlapping this year's shipment and depletion in balance. The underlying business, as I think that we reported, remained pretty strong. You look at the focus brands in particular, which constitute the majority of our profitability, are growing -- grew last year in the 10% range from a depletion point of view. So as far as flex points go, we'll be watching all lines of the P&L very carefully to ensure that we generate the results that we've guided to.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: Maybe another way is there's probably some corporate expenses related to the divestitures that will get pulled out of SG&A. Would any benefits from that just be offset by negative leverage or something?
Robert Ryder: It's all figured into the guidance. We don't expect SG&A to go up much in fiscal '12. It will be relatively flattish.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. Got it. And then as you think between debt reduction and buyback, is there a target cap structure at which there's less benefit to reducing debt beyond that point?
Robert Ryder: Yes. I mean, to optimize our lag, we should probably have an EBITDA leverage ratio in between three and four. So we'll probably be in that -- that will be the ideal range. That's not saying we wouldn't go lower than that if we felt that, for a temporary period of time, that made the most sense.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank: Okay, got it. And then last question on Crown. Are there any particular regions of the country that are disproportionately benefiting or contributing to the improvements at Crown? I'm trying to get a little bit of a read on if there's regions of the country where the economy is improving at a different pace than what would be happening on average nationally.
Robert Ryder: Yes, I would say, not really. I mean Texas has been a fairly strong market for us even through the recession, largely because of the oil interest in Texas. The economy there has not been as badly hit as other places, but in general it's a fairly across-the-board kind of thing.
Robert Sands: We'd expect better growth in the geographies where we’re launching the Victoria brand, which we expect big things from. It did quite well when we did the test market in Chicago. So we expect that to grow in those geographies, one of which is Texas. Other than that, there's probably puts and takes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: First on the U.S. Wine business. So in the fourth quarter, can you give us the wine depletion number? I know you gave us the wine and spirits together, but just the total U.S. wine depletion number, and then also the focus brands that are just wine brands?
Robert Ryder: Yes. So depletions in the fourth quarter were low-single digit and below the total year. So the total year was about 30% depletion growth. So they were below that but still within the low-single digit range. And the focus brands were fairly consistent with what they invest for the year.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. So high-single digit level?
Robert Sands: Yes. And the focus brands are much higher than that, obviously.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And then, Rob, as you think about the health of the Wine business, and I think you've talked about generally being pleased with the health of the business. But it sounds like maybe the promotional activity remains intense. You're taking select price increases in some of the markets in wine. So I'm just trying to understand how you think about your ability to really pace your wine sales growth in line with the category growth. Does it really hinge upon the competitive dynamics getting more rational? Is there a risk that you really have to step up more spending to drive that improved depletion growth as you get into fiscal '12?
Robert Sands: So what I said, Judy, was that we expect in 2012 to grow our depletions in line with the market growth. And we expect the market growth to be somewhat similar to what it was last year. So we, in other words, expect our depletion growth to be similar to what it was last year. Now, this is not premised on any significant or material change in the marketplace. Meaning, we are not premising our depletion growth this year on the fact that promotional activity will decrease or increase. We expect it to remain fairly constant and very similar to last year.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. So is the softening trend that we're seeing in the food store data, is that more limited to that channel, and that other channels, the depletion trends are actually a little bit better than -- and your share performance is better than what you see in the food store channel?
Robert Sands: In some cases, yes, and in some cases, no. Clearly, the mass merchandise channel is probably our strongest channel where we’re, I would say, significantly outperforming the market. And when I say mass merchandise, I'm talking about [indiscernible] mass merchandise, the Targets, the Calpians [ph] the Wal-Marts. We're doing extremely well in that particular channel. The on-premises remains a tough channel, and we're not planning on it getting much better. It's probably flattish at this stage. IRI is about 30% of the market. You see how that channel performed. We probably outperformed in liquor store states, the IRI channel. But all that said, what's really going on here is -- last year, we promoted extremely heavily in the first half of the year and then pulled back fairly dramatically on our promotional activity in the second half of the year. And you can see that in the IRI. It's plain and simple. As we move in to this year, we are smoothing our promotional activity quite considerably versus what we did last year. Okay? So you're probably going to see that because we were overlapping the very strong promotional activity in the first half of the year last year, and we're not going to do it the same way this year, we're actually smoothing it out more, you'll see IRI weakness during the first half as we overlap that strong promotional activity. And then, as we choose to promote more heavily during the year, eventually, you’ll see that reflected in IRI-type data. So I expect the IRI to be fairly volatile.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And then on the Crown JV, it looks like your guidance implies margin compression as you step up spending. So I guess it also implies that you're not planning to really look at pricing as a lever to get more margin. Is that correct?
Robert Sands: Yes, so we talked about this in the third quarter. Crown's top line is moving quite well. We're actually in quite a good position pricing-wise. Crown really doesn't anticipate taking a lot of I'll call it front-line pricing, meaning just flat-out price increases. What they do anticipate doing is reducing promotion spending, which will end up -- you'll see it in IRI. You’ll end up with a higher net sales per case. The wide majority of that promotion savings will be reinvested in media and marketing, right? So you won't see much of that reduced promotion spending flow to the bottom line. However, the increase, the net increase in promotion and marketing in '12 over '11 is due to the JV partners’ agreement to ramp up that spending. And so Crown will be spending in absolute dollars more in FY '12 than it did in FY '11. You will see that flowing through their P&L.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And is that kind of a one-time incremental spending? Or is there some year-over-year increase obligation that Crown needs to take every year from a spending perspective?
Robert Sands: No. Essentially, it is an increase in fiscal '12 over fiscal '11. That increase will remain through the eternity of the JV.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lauren Torres of HSBC.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: Just actually trying to understand also your earnings growth guidance for this year. I'm just thinking about the pieces here. Obviously, I do understand the impact of the distributor inventory levels being high. But knowing that you're taking some pricing, maybe promotional activity won’t be that high generally for the industry this year, and depletions may still grow at this low-single digit rate. I'm just thinking about all that combined, why can't we see some better earnings growth? I don't know if your guidance here is just conservative at this point or there's other issues that we're not really thinking about in that mix.
Robert Sands: There's one factor that you left out, which is you will see higher promotional expense this year versus last year. And the reason for that is you got to remember, we promote against depletions. And while shipments are fairly flat because of the overlap of the inventory build during the distributor transition, depletions are growing and therefore you'll see promotion growing. Now on a depletion basis, promotional expense per case won't really change very significantly. Okay? But if you're looking at the P&L, which is really based on shipments and not depletions, you're going to see promo grow as depletions grow. So that is what is going to offset what would apparently generate more EBIT growth this year, if you were only looking at the factors that you mentioned. So that's really what's going on here.
Robert Ryder: So let me augment that a little bit. Rob explained the big piece, which is basically, sales are going to be flattish. Sales are going to be flattish and EBIT will be slightly up for the North American wine business and it's due to the overlap of the inventory increase in fiscal '11. The other two pieces, remember, are Crown EBIT we’re forecasting to be down year-over-year because of the incremental marketing spend that I just described, and the Australia Europe business. Those profits are no longer there. So they have EBIT of about $15 million in fiscal '11 that -- they aren't there in fiscal '12. So they're the big three pieces.
Robert Sands: That's about $0.03 or $0.04 on the CWAE Australia and Europe EBIT loss, by the way.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And also too with respect to U.S. consumer trends. Rob, I know you mentioned on-premise still being tough and not really expecting an improvement this year. With that said though, are you seeing as far as just take-home consumption, increased frequency of purchases, maybe trading up? Is the U.S. consumer you're seeing firming up a bit or we're really not seeing that yet?
Robert Sands: I think that we have already seen the U.S. consumer firm up. I don't think that we're anticipating a big change in consumer behavior during our FY '12, so calendar year '11 and the beginning of calendar year '12. What we have seen is the consumer is definitely back, is definitely purchasing. We see very good growth in the Wine business in particular. The only negative -- there's really two negatives that we see, which is the consumer still remains extremely price-sensitive and is looking for a deal. And therefore, promotional activity remains robust. So the consumer is there and the consumer is purchasing, but the consumer really wants a deal. And number two, interestingly enough, the consumer is really taking advantage of the fact that there are deals out there, and we see a lot of trading up going on in the business because we see a lot of good promotional activity at some of the higher price points. So a good example is sort of wines between sort of $15 and $25 where the consumer is definitely taking advantage of the fact that you're seeing a lot of wines that we're selling above $20 pre-recession, now selling below $20. And therefore, they’re trading up to those wines from either the Super Premium or Ultra Premium category or they're trading from Super to Ultra or Ultra to Luxury. So you may recall, Super Premium, when we talk about that, that's $8 to $12. When we talk about Ultra Premium, it's $12 to $15. When we talk about Luxury, it's over $15. So we're seeing a lot of trade up activity driven by promotional activity in that regard. On-premise remains flattish. I don't see that changing that much either. I mean it could move to slightly up. And that's just going to take time, and it's going to be very closely tied to unemployment, and we all have our own opinion on where that's going to go. But I think everybody largely predicts that, as a trailing indicator, that unemployment will continue to be slow to rebound. There's other factors in the marketplace but I think they're going to keep sort of consumer behavior the same. I think that everybody has concerns about inflationary pressures as we go into this year. We don't expect it to really affect our business the way that it might affect others because it's very linked to gas and oil prices. And that isn't really a big, big factor in our cost of goods sold or that kind of thing. But I think it's going to be a negative -- continue to be a negative headwind relative to the consumer. So you get some positive headwind with the consumer or some positive wins with the consumer on the one hand offset with some headwinds related to inflationary pressure. So this all sort of reads to me that we're going to see a similar consumer environment to what we saw last year.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. And if I could just ask lastly on Crown. You mentioned that incremental marketing investment. Is that really behind Victoria and the Modelo Especial or are you putting any more money behind the Corona brand?
Robert Sands: Yes. We're putting more money behind the Corona brand. I mean, Crown is the strongest major beer company in the United States today, probably by a wide margin. The brands are performing very well as we come out of the recession. Corona has rebounded. Modelo Especial is probably the strongest major beer brand or significant beer brand of any beer brand in the country. And Crown is going to put more spending behind brand building and maintaining the strength of what are already very, very strong brands. And we are completely behind that and anticipate that for the long-term, it's going to be a very, very solid investment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vivien Azer of Citigroup.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc: My first question has to do with the pricing that you guys are going to be taking. It seems like maybe we're already seeing a little bit in the scanner data. And I was wondering if you could comment on whether the price increases you're taking are in line with what you're seeing with your competitors. Are you more or less pricing relative to the category?
Robert Sands: Our pricing that we take – we’ve got systems and processes in place to make sure that it's in line with our competitors and that we're not getting out of whack with competitors. But remember, almost all of our pricing is in our non-focus and nonstrategic brand, which, you also have to remember, constitute a very large percentage of our business, not from a profit perspective but from a volume perspective. So we may take some pricing on things like dessert wines, sparkling wine, value products that are relatively large from a volume perspective but relatively small from a margin perspective. So it impacts our overall numbers quite considerably. That's why we have now added information about our focus brands and how those focus brands are doing from a depletion perspective. So that it's easier to separate sort of what's going on with the nonstrategic part of our portfolio versus the more strategic part of our portfolio or the strategic part of our portfolio. Really those 17 brands which we highlighted. Hopefully, that's going to be helpful to you.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc: No, definitely, it is. In terms of the nonstrategic brands in the portfolio, is there room to kind of clean it up, help you guys maybe better execute against the focus brand strategy?
Robert Sands: Well, that's what we're doing in a sense. But they are profitable. And so, we're very carefully balancing with those brands, margin and volume. What we're not particularly concerned with is market share or volume per se because they're nonstrategic. So, we have to balance volume and margin on those brands very carefully. On the focus brands, we're very concerned with brand building. And the strength of those brands, both from a market share and volume metric point of view. On the other hand, even on those brands, like in any business, we want to make sure that we maintain their integrity from a margin perspective as well. So it's always a balance.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc: Got it. And my last question has to do with ad spending. I know you guys will disclose it when you put out your K. But can you give us a sense of what your ad spending was in the year?
Robert Sands: When you say ad, do you mean specifically on like targeted media or what we call marketing?
Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc: It's the advertising. The advertising line that you guys break out as part of SG&A.
Robert Sands: Outside of the beer business, we don't do a ton of advertising in the Wine business. Most of what we call marketing is on-premise. Now the Crown guys do, do quite a bit but that's not in our P&L.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Can you discuss if your beer depletion results in the quarter came in relatively in line with your expectations prior to the quarter, or if there was any upside? And so far, in March and April post this quarter, have you seen any deceleration in the convenience channel with the higher gas prices or is momentum continuing?
Robert Sands: Yes, I mean, it's a little early and that’s a pretty specific question, Dara. But I think in general, beer depletions are pretty much going in line with what our expectations are for the year. And as you know, we’re approaching, or at least the Mexican Beer business, the piece which is Cinco de Mayo, we’re kind of walking them, we kind of own that holiday. And that kind of kicks off the key beer selling seasons, and we are focused that we'll be doing a lot of our marketing spend in the second and third quarters, as we mentioned. You'll see a lot of our stuff on Major League Baseball. You'll see some new commercials, which have already started. And we're anticipating having relatively heavy marketing spend for the NFL season as well. So that's where you'll see our focus, and that's where most of the beer sales occur.
Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Have you seen any slowdown in convenience with the higher gas prices? Is that a big concern?
Robert Sands: The convenience channel has actually come back a bit. But it could be affected by gas prices, it could be. And in our convenience channel, we do have a new – well, this year will be there for a full year, the 24-ounce Modelo Especial can. So that might be helping our results year-over-year as well.
Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Okay, that's helpful. And then, Rob, can you just give us an update on where acquisitions fit into your cash flow priorities? Obviously, you've outlined debt paydown and repurchases but I'm just wondering where acquisitions fit in at this point.
Robert Sands: It's not terribly different than it has been in the past. Acquisitions are hard to predict because the opportunities have to be there, and they need to be very strategic, and they need to meet our financial criteria. And so we can't really predict when those types of acquisitions will present themselves. Clearly, our debt is down to levels and will get down to even lower levels where it shouldn’t be a concern relative to our making selective acquisitions. But those acquisitions have to be available and have to make sense for us. And lastly, until there are any, debt paydown will continue to be a priority for us. And obviously, with respect to the multi-year stock buyback that we announced, we will be evaluating the market and evaluating whether it makes sense to buy back stock as we move forward. So we’ve got a good mix of things that we can use cash for at this stage. And cash utilization strategy clearly is something that we're thinking about, given our very strong cash flow performance last year and our even stronger predicted cash flow performance this year and the fact that we expect a fairly strong level of cash flow generation going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Reza Vahabzadeh [Barclays Capital]
Reza Vahabzadeh - Lehman Brothers: So on the issue of the balance sheet, given your share repurchase program, would you anticipate continuing to reduce net leverage after FY '12 and getting below three turns or would you anticipate basically staying at those leverage levels? I'm just trying to find out what the ultimate net leverage goal is.
Robert Sands: Yes, the answer to your question is it depends. If we don't find it appropriate to utilize cash in any other way, we will continue to reduce debt levels beyond FY '12. On the other hand, if opportunities present themselves that we think make sense or we determine to take advantage of our stock repurchase program, that will impede the rate at which we will continue to pay down debt. But absent a significant transaction, regardless of other activities, debt will continue to be paid down. I'm not going to make predictions beyond FY '12, but it is inconceivable that debt will continue to be paid down beyond '12.
Robert Ryder: Yes, this is like our favorite business issue, I guess, what to do with our cash. Good place to be.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Lehman Brothers: Right. Well, it's a fair amount of free cash flow so it's a big question, I guess.
Robert Ryder: Sure.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Lehman Brothers: And then as far as operating results for the fourth quarter, were they in line with your expectations for North America Wines as well as Crown Imports at the beginning of the quarter?
Robert Ryder: Yes. I'd say they're probably in line to slightly better than we anticipated. I'd say that the better mostly came from the Beer business and actually from the Australia U.K. business. They both performed a little better than we anticipated at the end of the third quarter. The U.S. Wine business was pretty much in line with what we thought.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Rob, also talking a bit here about the U.S. Wine outlook. Could you talk a little bit more about the focus on the focus brands? The 9.6% we saw for the year, how was that in the quarter? And as you think about fiscal '12, what kind of assumption are you making about how that trend performs versus the overall portfolio trend?
Robert Sands: Fourth quarter, the performance of the focus brands was very similar to the whole year. Okay? So high-single digit. On the depletion trends on the focus brands for the fourth quarter, we expect to see focus brands will continue to grow at a similar rate for next year as well.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. And as we try to think about the mass merchants having seemingly particularly strong growth in the quarter, how does that affect your product mix? Is that a good thing, a bad thing, an indifferent thing? I presume that the focus there is with your focus brands. But if that's the kind of right assumption, if you will, thinking out for the balance of the year, if that channel does better than your overall channel mix, how does that affect your mix, your product mix?
Robert Ryder: I think it's not an enormous impact. The on-premise channel generally has a better mix of product, meaning a higher-priced, higher-margin product. So that's not a huge part of the business. So the big thing we focus on from a mix perspective is the focus brands because these are our largest scale products, with the best gross margin and ROIC profile. So from a mix perspective, we really try to focus on that. From a channel perspective, outside of that on-premise that [indiscernible] commented on on-premise, we're kind of agnostic as to -- we make the same money generally by channel.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, fair enough. And then just on the pricing commentary from the prepared remarks and here in the Q&A, can you flesh that out a little bit more for us? Is it fair to think you're taking pricing really across the portfolio of different percentage levels? Or what's the detail I might have missed there?
Robert Sands: No, I specifically said, we're taking pricing on value and specialty products.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it, value and specialty.
Robert Sands: Specialty products are products like dessert wines, social wine, sparkling wine and things like that.
Robert Ryder: None of them are in -- I don't think any of them are – one of them, maybe -- in our focused wine.
Robert Sands: But largely on nonstrategic specialty and value product.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And is the thought there that it helps encourage folks to trade up while also improving profitability in those particular products or is it more cost [indiscernible]?
Robert Sands: No, we're just balancing margin and volume. And being strategic as to where we think we can take some pricing or reduce promotion and where we don't. That's basically it.
Robert Ryder: Yes, it's dissimilar, Mark. I think I know where you're going. What the beer guys are doing with the sub-premium pricing versus the premium pricing. Just because of the sheer SKU count in wine versus beer, I don't think we approach the Wine business, "Let's price this and they're going to move up to this category." There's kind of too many SKUs to do that.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. And then just finally here, as we think about GM for U.S. wine or North America wine as we look out -- I guess two final question. What is your view about the kind of cost per case outlook you'll be facing over the next 12 months versus the last 12 and grapes obviously being a factor there? And then be -- I mean how are you thinking about GM overall? Obviously, the quarter was strong in the GM, some of that was just the sheer scale of the volume versus the cost base. But how are you thinking about the GM trend for North America wine over the next 12 months?
Robert Ryder: I guess a couple of things. The fourth quarter gross margin trend, I wouldn't get overly ingratiated with because of the year-over-year overlap and the fact that inventories were taken down in last year's fourth quarter. Okay? But that being said, in fiscal '11, the extensive harvest ’08 red vintage flowed through the P&L, so that increased our grape costs in fiscal '11, which tended to reduce our gross profit margin. That vintage is now behind us. So we don't anticipate increased grape cost per ton. Gross margin, we are focused on improving our gross margin in a number of ways. We have quite a few initiatives that we'll bring you through at the investor conference of how we're reducing our operating costs and how we’re approaching that quite differently, plus the focus brands, which you saw are growing faster than the rest of the category, tends to have a better gross margin profile. That will help us, and the U.S. consumer is trading up. You can see that in IRI and that also helps our gross margin profile. So trading up, our focus on reducing operating costs should all -- and reducing grape costs should all benefit our North American gross profit margin going forward.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That’s great. And if I could just change topics for you, Bob. It's nice to see this tax rate having the benefits it is and you're saying it's kind of a multiyear phenomenon. If we kind of try to zero in on one of the things driving that improvement, which is simply these capital losses on the international wine sales, can you put some parameters over the kind of cumulative loss you think is deductible? Does it exceed $1 billion? And how deductible is it and what piece of deductibility might you get versus that capital loss?
Robert Ryder: Yes. I addressed a lot of this in my scripts. But I think what we said was, this gets a little confusing. From an effective tax rate perspective, meaning just the P&L tax rate, okay? All of that hit in the fourth quarter of 2011, and we called it noncomparable. Now from a cash perspective, in that noncomparable P&L benefit in the fourth quarter, it's just shy of $200 million. We said that, that $200 million number will be a positive cash in the bank in FY '11, FY '12 and FY '13. $30 million of it hit in FY '11, the remainder is about 50% in FY '12, 50% in FY '13. That's our current best guess.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. And you think that's the extent of the benefit from all the losses, the accumulated capital losses whether it was this latest sale or does that include the other sales that preceded that?
Robert Ryder: Right now, that's all we're anticipating. It’s about that $200 million cash benefit. Remember, that $200 million is an after-tax number, right. So the loss, you have to tax effect that.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And if there is upside to that number, just kind of the potential upside of 10%, 40%, are we pretty close knowing where you are with...
Robert Ryder: Right now, we're really focused at putting the $200 million in the bank. So as new information comes forward on anything additional, we'll talk about it at that time.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christine Farkas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch: Just quickly in the fourth quarter, you were helpful with respect to the $29 million of incremental profits that came from the step up in volumes, if you will, or the year-over-year timing. Could you help us with what the impact was on the revenue? And did you tell us what the shipment growth was in the quarter, not just for the year?
Robert Ryder: Yes, on the revenue side, Christine -- we said this last year, in the fourth quarter, it's about $60 million or $70 million of reduced revenue in fiscal '10 that we are overlapping. And that equivalized to, I think, $0.05 to $0.07 of EPS -- $0.07 to $0.09 of EPS, sorry.
Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch: Would I then look at your incremental $29 million on top of the revenue lap to give us an implication of what the margins were on those products sold, because that seems pretty high?
Robert Ryder: I don't know. That's pretty detailed. There's a lot of moving parts. So what I think, Christine, maybe you should give Patty or Bob Czudak a call.
Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then on the shipments, your press release was helpful and gave us some shipments for the year, about 3½% in North America. Given the overlap, would you have the shipment growth in the fourth quarter?
Robert Ryder: Again, that's relatively detailed. The shipment growth in the fourth quarter would have been impacted by that $60 million to $70 million of overlap in the prior year. And we’ve given you the additional disclosures in the press release, but the one thing you have to be aware of when you look at shipment versus depletions, although the growth rate in both look similar, it's kind of a coincidence because you have to think about what the underlying absolute number is. And because in fiscal '11, shipments exceeded depletions, they don't necessarily work in concert. You have to really think through that.
Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. I’ll follow up. And then just finally, you already touched on your views about acquisitions. But I'm just wondering, given your last transaction in Spirits with a net sale, how do you position yourself or how would you view yourself with respect to your Spirits portfolio. Is there room for acquisitions down the road?
Robert Sands: Yes, I think that there is room for acquisitions down the road. Again, they have to serve a purpose. They have to be strategic, they have to contribute to our overall profitable organic growth imperative. There is room, but it's very hard to predict when acquisition opportunities will present themselves that make sense for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carlos LaBoy of Crédit Suisse.
Carlos LaBoy - Crédit Suisse AG: Two questions. The first one on wine promotional spending, can you expand on that? I know you've spoken at length about it today. But if can you give us some more insight on the size, scope, timing, nature of this promotional spending for 2012. And walk us through how this goes through the P&L. Does it put pressure on pricing, as we go forward?
Robert Sands: Sure. So we're expecting promotional spending levels rate per case basis, based on depletions, to be roughly similar to 2011 is the basic answer to your question. And just remember that promotion flows through the P&L as a reduction of gross sales and is, therefore, between the gross sales and the net sales line on the P&L. So you don't see it in net sales, you see it -- it's reflected in net sales but it reduces gross sales.
Carlos LaBoy - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. And just to clarify, is it flat relative to '11 or up relative to '11?
Robert Sands: I’d said that it is relatively flat to '11 on a per case basis...
Robert Ryder: Or absolute dollars.
Robert Sands: Okay, or absolute dollars for that matter, as Bob just pointed out.
Carlos LaBoy - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay, and on Crown, what's the EBIT growth scenario for Crown looking out beyond 2012 if this reinvestment rate and spending behind the brand stays high? Do you expect it to remain high given the stage of development where these growth brands are or do you expect that we’ll see earnings growth out of Crown at least in line with revenue growth beyond this year?
Robert Ryder: The way the joint venture works, Carlos, is a lot of things are contractual. The Crown EBIT growth this year was a bit anomalous because of the increase in marketing spend. We don't anticipate any more increases in marketing or promotion spend, in the future. But the EBIT growth generally will go in line with what volume and pricing does. So if they continue to perform as well in the marketplace as they are now, yes, I'd anticipate EBIT growth.
Operator: Your final question comes from Neal Rudowitz of JPMorgan.
Neal Rudowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I'll just ask one question at this point. Can you just give us an update on the level of inventory at your distributors? It seems like the average inventory days would have to be higher relative to where they were when you started the transition. So is that the case? And if so, how much higher and is that sustainable going forward?
Robert Sands: Yes. Our distributors carry, on average, about 60 to 90 days of inventory, and through the distributor transition, we added about five to 10 days, but we're within the 60 to 90 days on average that I mentioned.
Neal Rudowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So you started out lower then or just at the lower end of that average, I guess, before the transition?
Robert Sands: I'm sorry, say that again.
Neal Rudowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So you started out at a lower than average level or at the low end of the range before the transition then? If you're still within the range now after a year and a half, is that correct?
Robert Sands: Yes, it's a wide range though. I guess you could characterize it that way.
Operator: And that will be the end of our Q&A session for today's conference. I will turn the conference back to you, Mr. Rob Sands, for any further remarks.
Robert Sands: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining our call today. As I indicated, I am very pleased with the progress that we made throughout the past year, particularly in the areas of free cash flow generation and debt reduction. Our significantly enhanced financial profile, the momentum achieved from our U.S. distributor initiative and our operational improvements position us for success in the future. As I mentioned, we'll be hosting our Investor Conference in New York on May 18, and I look forward to seeing, hopefully, all of you there at that time. So thanks, again, for your participation.

===== 2011 Q3  (2011-01-06 10:30:00) =====
Executives: Patty Yahn-Urlaub – VP, IR Rob Sands – President and CEO Bob Ryder – EVP and CFO
Analysts:  Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs Vivien Azer – Citigroup Lauren Torres – HSBC Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus Tim Ramey – D.A. Davidson Christine Farkas – Bank of America Merrill Lynch Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse
Operator: At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions.] I would now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub:
 : During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com under the Investor section. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. Although statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. 
Rob Sands: Thanks Patty, and good morning and happy New Year everyone. I hope you all had a great holiday and certainly had the opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products during the festive season. Now before we get started with a review of our third quarter results, I'd like to spend a few moments discussing the strategic intent behind the recent announcement of our plans to sell our U.K. and Australian business to CHAMP Private Equity. Since the time that we acquired Hardys in Australia and Matthew Clark, we have adopted a new business strategy which has been focused on premiumizing our portfolio, generating strong free cash flow, and improving return on invested capital, all in an effort to drive profitable organic growth. And the sale of the U.K. and Australia is the next transformational step in the execution of this strategy, as the business is no longer aligned with our strategic imperatives.  These international markets have been consistently challenged by foreign exchange volatility, grape oversupply, retail pricing pressures, and ongoing duty assessments which have collectively eroded profitability. And the majority of our sales volume in Australia has been dedicated to value-priced bag in the box products. However, we will continue to maintain a 20% interest in the business. As a private equity firm, CHAMP will be operating the business very differently, and our remaining interest will enable us to participate in the potential upside. All employees currently dedicated to this business will transfer to the new entity. Despite the sale of our two largest international businesses, Constellation remains the world's number one premium wine company, and we remain committed to growing an international operation that is consistent with our overall strategy.  Remember we currently sell and distribute our portfolio of brands in about 150 countries worldwide through Constellation Wines International, which will continue to invest resources in new, emerging, and established markets around the world. Constellation Wines International represents growth potential for the company going forward, and will continue to drive our premium portfolio around the world.  And now I would like to focus our discussion on our financial and operational results for the third quarter. This quarter marks the continuation of the strong momentum we've experienced this year in a number of areas which include the generation of record free cash flow levels that has been driven in part by our diligent focus, particularly in the area of working capital.  The great news about this new level of free cash flow is that we believe it is sustainable longer term. And, it was during last year's third quarter that we began the official transition for our new U.S. distributor network, giving select distributors the right to sell Constellation's portfolio of wine and spirits exclusively in their respective U.S. markets.  There seems to be some confusion related to the intricacies of the distributor contracts and their impact on our financial results since the inception of this initiative, which commenced September 1, 2009, so I will take a minute to describe how you should be thinking about the nuances of these contracts. We initially negotiated long-term contracts with five U.S. distributors currently representing about 60% of our wine and spirits volume in the U.S. These contracts included shipment commitments that required distributors to purchase specified levels of product in fiscal 2010 and during this fiscal year, 2011.  Last year, depletions or distributor sales to retail lagged our shipments to distributors due to the challenging economic environment and the disruption caused by the distributor transition activity and our sales force reorganization. In fiscal 2011, while depletion trends for our products are healthy, they have not caught up to the contractual shipment levels. As a result, our sales volumes to distributors are exceeding distributor sales to retail and on-premise channels. This has benefitted sales and profits for our U.S. wine business and will create an EBIT comparison challenge for fiscal 2012. After the shipment commitments roll off at the end of fiscal 2011, under the distributor contract we expect shipments to essentially equal depletions for the remainder of the contract term on an annual basis. This was absolutely the best way to execute the distributor contracts as it ensured more stable sales, earnings, and cash flow, as well as complete distributor focus on the Constellation portfolio of products during the transition period. So, to put things into perspective relative to how Constellation is performing, it's best to consider the following. For the three months ending November, which coincides with the end of our fiscal third quarter, estimated depletions or distributor sales to retail for Constellation's total U.S. wine and spirits business across all channels increased 3%.  Interestingly, this includes the on-premise channel, which has been slowly improving throughout the year and posted positive growth trends in the low single-digit range during the third quarter for Constellation and for the industry as well. More importantly, our focused brand group, which represents the majority of our U.S. wine profitability, posted depletion trends of almost 10% in the third quarter.  We are managing for cash and margin our other, more mature U.S. wine brands, many of which are in declining categories. Overall, consumer takeaway trends for our U.S. wine portfolio are generally aligned with industry trends across all channels in the mid-single-digit range. It is a combination of these and depletion trends that are indicative of the underlying health of our business. Additionally, although promotional spending on an industry wide basis appears to be abating slightly, it is a bit higher than last year and what we originally anticipated. During the third quarter Constellation Wines U.S. also progressed in efforts to improve cost, cash, and operational effectiveness with activities that included completion of the east coast winery consolidation effort, further consolidation of the California warehouse system, continued expansion of the solar energy initiative at several of our California facilities, and in addition to these accomplishments, we've recently received several accolades for our well-known portfolio of brands, the following of which are particularly noteworthy. Robert Mondavi's director of wine making, Genevieve Janssens, has received one of the industry's highest honors and was named 2010 Wine Star Winemaker of the Year by Wine Enthusiast magazine. Constellation also won eight Impact Blue Chip Brand Awards, more than any wine company has ever won in a single year. Our winning U.S. brands include Estancia, Blackstone, Clos du Bois, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Woodbridge, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, and SVEDKA.  Wine and Spirits Magazine named Ravenswood as one of the top 100 wineries of the year and Joe Peterson, founder of Ravenswood, is being inducted into the Culinary Institute of America's Vintner's Hall of Fame in February. The accolades also continue for our Canadian business. At the International Wine and Spirits competition in London, Vincor achieved Gold and Best in Class wins for Inniskillin Wines' Niagara, the 2007 Cabernet Franc Icewine, and 2007 Sparkling Vidal Icewine. Jackson-Triggs Okanagan Estate 2007 Proprietors Grand Reserve Riesling Icewine, and 2007 Sunrock Vineyards Shiraz. And Jackson-Triggs Okanagan Estate was also awarded best Canadian producer. And moving on to SVEDKA and our spirits business, SVEDKA delivered strong year-to-date performance, posting double-digit sales and depletion growth. We continue to build SVEDKA's on-premise brand awareness by leveraging new distributor roots to market. We are growing our national accounts in on- and off-premise channels, and are expanding in other core markets outside the U.S.  Moving to Crown Imports, we previously reported during the third quarter we settled our legal dispute with Modelo relating to the calendar 2010 funding of marketing and promotional spending, which was incremental to that [inaudible] original Crown joint venture agreement. As part of this settlement, the partners decided on future funding levels for these same expenditures for calendar 2011, through the remainder of the term of the joint venture agreement, which requires that Crown pay for a percentage of the incremental funding going forward. This investment by Crown will ensure that the joint venture continues to have the world-class marketing and promotional programs that have made it the unrivaled leader in the U.S. imported beer category.  I would now like to move on to a discussion of Crown's operational results for the third quarter. During the third quarter, Crown worked closely with distributors to bring their inventories to more normal levels after experiencing supply chain disruptions this summer related to a combination of Hurricane Alex and a Modelo brewery strike in Mexico.  This effort, combined with the positive marketplace momentum that the Crown portfolio of products has experienced throughout the year, resulted in improved performance through the third quarter. During this timeframe, Crown outperformed the industry, the import category, and the other three major beer suppliers in the SymphonyIRI Food, Drug, Mass Merchant, and Convenience channels on a dollar sales basis. Among the four major suppliers, Crown was the only one to gain dollar and case volume market share. This is the third consecutive quarter that Crown posted positive depletion results, which increased in the mid-single-digit range, including positive depletion trends for Corona Extra. Based on Crown's year-to-date results, we are revising their depletion estimate upward for fiscal 2011 to growth in the low to mid-single-digit range with profits increasing low-single digits versus last year. Originally, Crown's estimated depletions were to be down slightly, with operating income declines in the mid-single-digit range.  Throughout the remainder of our fiscal 2011, we expect Crown to be focused on strong market execution, supported by new product introductions, package expansions, and solid promotional activities, which are planned for the balance of our fiscal year. Some examples include: Following the successful introduction of Modelo's Victoria beer brand in Chicago as an initial test market in June, Mexico's oldest beer was launched state-wide in Texas and in key Colorado markets in December.  Victoria is one of Mexico's most prestigious beer brands and is being introduced at a price point premium to Corona Extra, the brand that's scheduled for rollout in additional markets in early calendar 2011. Modelo Especial, one of the fastest-growing large beer brands, eclipsed yet-another major milestone by surpassing 30 million cases sold in the 12-month period through October. Since its U.S. introduction in the 1980s, Modelo Especial has risen through the ranks to become the number three imported beer and the number 15 ranked beer on a dollar sales basis in the total U.S. beer market. The Corona Extra "Find Your Beach" campaign was kicked off in September, and has been well received in the marketplace. It includes a TV spot called "Moments" that encourages consumers to find their beach wherever it may be. And Corona Light's national multimedia campaign continues to carve out a distinct personality for this brand. In fact, one measure of its success is the fact that the number of Facebook fans has increased from 3,000 to more than 200,000 in just two months. Before we turn the call over to Bob, I wanted to inform you that we have received notification by the majority shareholder of Ruffino of their exercise of its option to put its interest in Ruffino to Constellation. Prior to this notification, we had initiated proceedings against the majority shareholder questioning the validity of the put option. This action should take some time to resolve.  In closing, we continue to execute and make great progress in a number of areas. We have strong marketplace momentum for our U.S. wine and beer business, and the U.S. distributor transition is working well. I'm especially pleased that we have found a suitable buyer for our U.K. and Australia operations who we believe is committed to growing the business and providing a home for our dedicated employees in these markets. Collectively, these efforts reflect our diligent focus on achieving profitable organic growth. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for our financial discussion of our third quarter business results.
Bob Ryder: Thanks Bob. Good morning everyone. Q3 comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $0.66 versus $0.54 last year, as we saw improvement in interest expense and tax favorability versus the prior-year quarter. The third quarter also marks pretty significant progress in our strategy to drive profitable organic growth: improve the flow through of EBITDA to free cash flow and enhance the financial profile of the company.  Efforts to strengthen our organic business model under our new U.S. business structure and consolidated U.S. distributor network continue to progress. These efforts have helped to drive continued positive depletion, retail, and mix trends for our U.S. wine business.  Our increased focus on improving free cash flow generation continues to drive benefits. This is demonstrated by our very strong free cash flow performance during the first nine months of fiscal 2011 and our improved visibility to future cash flow generation. As a result, we're increasing our full-year cash flow target by $100 million to a new range of $475 million to $525 million.  In addition to reducing interest costs, cash, taxes, and restructuring costs, we continue to make progress in reducing our network and capital investment and we believe this new level of free cash flow is sustainable on a longer-term basis. This will be a new record of free cash flow generation at Constellation, and we are pleased with our results. Many dedicated people, from grape buyers to wine makers, throughout the company, are thinking in new ways to generate better financial returns from our business.  We completed our accelerated stock buyback transaction during the quarter. Under this transaction we paid $300 million in April 2010 and received 17.2 million shares for an average cost of $17.42 a share. 13.8 million of the shares were received in the first quarter, and the remaining 3.4 million shares came in on November 30. We estimate the transaction will generate about $0.09 of diluted earnings per share accretion in fiscal 2011, and this has been reflected in our guidance since the first quarter. We also delisted from the Australia Securities Exchange during the quarter, which helped us eliminate the cost and administrative burden associated with that listing.  As Rob noted, we've reached an agreement to sell our Australian and U.K. business. The transaction is valued at $290 million Australian dollars, and should close by the end of January. We will retain 20% of this business. We expect proceeds of about $230 million, which will be used to reduce borrowings. With interest and cost savings, we expect the transaction to be neutral to slightly dilutive to comparable basis EPS for fiscal 2012. More importantly, this transaction is aligned with our strategy to premiumize the business and improve the financial profile of the company. Our consolidated comparable basis gross profit and operating margins should improve by about 400 to 500 basis points, and our earnings should be less volatile and we'll have much lower exposure to foreign currency swings. Without this lower return business, our ROIC metrics will also be enhanced. Now let's look at our fiscal Q3 P&L performance in more detail, though my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated reported net sales decreased 2%, primarily due to the divestiture of our U.K. cider business. Excluding the cider sale and impact of currency, net sales were level with the prior-year quarter. My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. North America wine net sales were even with the prior year, and reflected favorable product mix, offset by a decrease in U.S. shipment volume as the number of distributors under shipment commitments were less than a year ago.  Australia and Europe sales decreased 1%. Spirits organic net sales increased 8% for the quarter, with SVEDKA leading the way with a 34% growth rate. It continues to maintain strong momentum in the marketplace, with sales and depletions growing double digits on a fiscal year-to-date basis. Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 36.5% versus 35.4% for the prior year. This primarily reflects product mix benefits. U.S. promotion expense on a dollar basis was roughly even with the prior year, as we increased promotion spending in the back half of last year, following the implementation of the new distributor contracts, which commenced in September 2009. An increase in U.S. freight costs from the higher-cost calendar 2008 red grape harvest were offset by grape cost benefits in Australia.  Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $19 million and came in at 18.3% of net sales compared with 15.9% a year ago. This reflects incremental investments in technology around Project Fusion activities, some year-over-year incentive compensation variances, and an increase in marketing and selling expenses. Consolidated operating income decreased 8% to $176 million, and operating margin decreased 1.2% to 18.2%. I'd now like to turn to our segment operating income results and provide highlights of our third quarter operating income [inaudible]. North America segment operating income decreased $18 million to $193 million. Improved sales mix in the current year's quarter was more than offset by higher grape costs, investments in technology, marketing and selling, and higher incentive compensation costs. The Australian and Europe wine segment reported operating income of $9 million, a $2 million increase versus the prior-year quarter. The increase was mostly due to grape cost benefits in Australia. Corporate and other expenses totaled $26 million versus $27 million for the prior-year quarter. Consolidated equity earnings totaled $71 million versus $60 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $58 million versus $46 million for the prior-year quarter. The remainder of equity earnings in Q3 fiscal 2011 and Q3 fiscal 2010 are primarily generated by Opus One. In the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $612 million, an increase of 22%, and operating income of $116 million, an increase of 27%. As Rob mentioned, sales and operating income primarily benefitted from volume growth as wholesaler inventories returned to more optimal levels following very low Q2 inventories resulting from supply chain issues experienced during the summer. Crown's operating results also benefitted from lower promotional spending, but were unfavorably impacted by a legal arbitration decision regarding a former distributor and the contractual cost increase for Modelo products. As Rob mentioned, we now expect Crown to deliver growth in sales and depletions and a slight increase in operating income for fiscal 2011. Interest expense for the quarter was $49 million, down 25% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower average interest rate and reduced debt levels during the quarter. Our average interest rate for the quarter was a little above 5%. Let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of November, our debt totaled $3.7 billion. This represents a $109 million decrease from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2010. This decrease is impressive given the funding of our $300 million stock buyback earlier in the year. Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of November was 4.3 times.  With our increased free cash flow guidance, and expected proceeds from the sale of the Australian and U.K. business, we're targeting to be around the high 3 times range by the end of fiscal 2011. Our comparable-basis effective tax rate benefitted from the favorable outcome of certain tax items and came in at 29%. This compares to a 35% rage for Q3 last year. Given the favorable run rate for the first nine months of the year, we're now targeting a full-year tax rate of 31%. Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities, less cap ex. For the nine months of fiscal 2011, we generated free cash flow of $299 million versus $100 million for the same period last year. This improvement reflects lower interest, tax, and restructuring payments. We saw a sizable source of cash resulting from the reduction of inventory. There was also an increased use of cash from accounts receivable due to the timing of sales in the quarter. Cap ex came in at $70 million versus $89 million for the first nine months of last year. As mentioned earlier, we're now targeting free cash flow for fiscal 2011 in the $475 million to $525 million range. This includes cap ex in the region of $100 million to $120 million, a $10 million reduction from our previous projection. Now let's move to our full-year fiscal 2011 P&L outlook. We are tightening our range and increasing our comparable basis EPS guidance to $1.80 to $1.85 from our previous range of $1.63 to $1.78 per share. This increase is primarily driven by the improvement of our targeted tax rate, which I discussed earlier. The tax rate improvement represents about $0.10 of benefit per share. Please remember that in Q4 of last year, we reduced distributor inventories, so our FY11 Q4 EBIT should look very positive to the previous year. Our full-year EBIT is essentially on our guidance, as the beer upside is being reinvested in U.S. wine promotion spending. We now expect interest expense to be in the range of $195 million to $200 million, and weighted average diluted shares to be about $214 million. Our comparable basis EPS guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed in our news release. Consistent with the past few years, we intend to provide next year's detailed financial guidance after we finalize our plan, and in connection with our fourth quarter press release and conference call, which is scheduled for early April. However, given our earlier discussion, I would like to frame in a couple of potential impacts to FY12 for you. As highlighted by Rob, while we are pleased with our underlying U.S. depletion trends, our contracts with newly appointed distributors require specified product purchase levels. This will result in shipments exceeding depletions during fiscal 2011. All product purchase requirements will have expired as of the end of fiscal 2011.  Going forward, shipments should align with depletions through the balance of the contracts on an annual basis. As we overlap the FY11 shipment commitments in FY12, we will face a difficult comparison, and as a result we currently anticipate nominal EBIT growth for our U.S. wine business in fiscal 2012. Rob outlined the incremental marketing and promotional funding by Crown going forward. This is expected to inhibit operating earnings growth in FY12. However, we expect slightly lower interest expense and a continued low comparable tax rate due to additional anticipated tax outcomes.  Given the factors just mentioned, directionally we currently anticipate comparable basis diluted EPS for FY12 to be slightly above FY11 guidance. As mentioned earlier, we feel the improvements we have made in generating free cash flow are sustainable and we currently estimate that free cash flow in FY12 will be at least in line with that in FY11.  With that level of free cash flow, [rough map] would indicate a comparable EBITDA leverage ratio in the low 3 times range by the end of fiscal 2012. That will be towards the lower end of our targeted leverage ratio, and we have not ruled out future stock buybacks. Before we take your questions, I would like to note that our simplified U.S. organizational structure, streamlined brand portfolio, and consolidated U.S. distributor network have contributed to improved depletion volumes and marketplace performance versus last year. Promotion spending has not yet abated in the U.S. wine category, and we will need to keep an eye on market spending rates.  In the beer business, we continue seeing positive depletion and retail results from Crown's branding and marketing initiatives. The sale of our Australian and U.K. business will result in a dramatic improvement to most financial metrics. Although the business constituted roughly a quarter of our net sales, it contributed very little of the profits.  Our free cash flow generation profile has improved dramatically, and we are on track to produce an all-time high free cash flow result for the year, and we anticipate that level of free cash flow in future years. This will provide opportunities for further deleveraging of stock buybacks. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions.] Your first question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of UBS.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: On these noncore brands, they're a small piece in terms of your profit but a good piece of your volume. Can you talk about what you're doing there to see if you can get trends to stabilize on some of those noncore wine assets?
Rob Sands: You're talking about our noncore brands?
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: Yes, outside of the 15 or 17 focused brands.
Rob Sands: There's about 17 focused brands, and then we have other categories which we describe as either tactical or protect and defend. The object is not really to stabilize those particular brands, and as I said in my talk our focus is really to operate those brands with a focus on margins and cash flow. That will continue to be our focus for those brands.
Bob Ryder: There in, like, eroding categories, but they have very good financial profile, so you can't really turn them around on growth, but we're trying to sell as much as we can because they have very good financial metrics.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: And then in talking about your fiscal 2012, it sounds like depletion should be ahead of shipments. Are you willing to give some sort of estimate on what you're expecting for the depletion in fiscal 2012?
Rob Sands: In our next fiscal year we expect depletions and shipments to be essentially equal.
Bob Ryder: So this gets a little confusing. The shipments, absent shipments and depletions, will be relatively aligned, but because of FY11, the base - when you do a growth calculation depletions will grow faster than shipments, but we'll ship in absolute numbers about the same number of cases as will be depleted, if that makes sense.
Operator: Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: First, just from a big picture perspective, obviously you guys have been focusing on at least pacing your volume in line with the category growth in the U.S. wine business. It looks like the category, I think you said is growing at a mid-single-digit rate. Your depletions are up about 2%. I know there's some drag in terms of these noncore brands, but can you just give us some big-picture comment about how you think you're performing in terms of the market performance, especially in light of the heightened promotional environment that you continue to see in the marketplace as well as your stepped-up spending to gain some of that share in the market?
Rob Sands: I think our performance is actually pretty good. You quoted the 2% depletion in the third quarter, and that's only for the quarter. For the whole year our depletion growth has been in excess of that, and very much in line with the marketplace. As you also mentioned, yes, there is some drag on that depletion growth as a result of how we operate our noncore brands. But when we really look at our core brands, which is the vast majority, vast vast majority, of our profitability in only 17 brands, as I said we had about 10% depletion growth in the third quarter, and I think that that's really indicative of the strength of the business, and I think is really the critical thing in looking at how we're performing relative to the marketplace. And that performance is well in excess of industry growth rates, so we're pretty pleased about that.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: And then just a little bit more color in terms of the promotional environment. Are you looking at certain price segments or certain channels, or certain brands that are being a little bit more aggressive here? What is your strategy to tackle that situation going forward as you relate to more price discounts, or new products, innovation, marketing, and so forth.
Rob Sands: We're looking at that very carefully. I would characterize the current environment as promotional activity in general being slightly higher than it has been in the past, or let me say versus last year. Our promotional activity similarly has been at the higher level, but we're balancing that out, in fact, by being judicious in the way that we promote our noncore brands versus how we promote our core brands, meaning we're investing more in promoting our core brands than in our noncore brands to balance our overall promotional activity. That's part of our strategy of how we're dealing with this to make sure that it stays within our own expectations.  In the future, our total strategy around driving profitable organic growth is all about brand-building, and brand-building is really all about having brands that are strong enough to not have the degree of price sensitivity that more commodicized brands have, so that they don't have to be promoted to an extent greater than we think is necessary. So that's how we're thinking about all of this, and a lot of our activities around how we're marketing our brands and advertising our brands and the new products and line extensions that we're developing, is all about our brand-building efforts.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: And then Bob, just in terms of that mismatch between shipments and depletions, a few questions there. One is how does that play out in the fourth quarter, because last year you had a pretty significant destocking. So I'm wondering if you're going to now benefit from a shipment perspective in the fourth quarter. Two, the 40% of the distributors that are not under the new distribution agreements, how is their inventory level right now. And then finally, I guess the understanding in terms of fiscal '12 shipments and depletions now matching going forward, does that suggest basically the distributors that are under the new agreements will carry higher inventory than they have previously?
Bob Ryder: So your comment on Q4 is correct. I tried to indicate that a little bit in my script. Your recollection is correct, we did reduce distributor inventories last year in the fourth quarter in return for some distributor investments in our brands. We thought that was a pretty good tradeoff. So in the fourth quarter you should see pretty healthy sales and EBIT growth in the North American wine and spirit category. So that would be correct. And for the full year, our EBIT should be pretty well aligned with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year and actually might be slightly higher than what you guys think on average. So that's the Q4 comment. On the other distributors, meaning the distributors that were not converted to a consolidated distributor system, that's been business as usual. So ships have pretty much equaled depletes all along. There's not been a lot of action there. And as far as FY12, again you are correct. The way we distribute our contracts, or agree to, was that there was this initial period of shipment guarantees and the day those shipment guarantees end the inventory on that day stays with the distributors through the end of the contract. So it does get a bit confusing. So as of the end of this year, those shipment guarantees end, so next year we expect in general shipments to equal depletions. However, as you do a growth calculation, the sales growth will be less than the depletion growth, simply because of the respective denominators.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vivien Azer of Citi.
Vivien Azer – Citigroup: I'm just wondering, with respect to your distributors is there a difference in the product mix that they're selling, i.e. that the five distributors that have 60% of your volume do they skew more to your focus brands or is it pretty much even across your distribution system?
Rob Sands: No, there's not really a difference in - I mean there's differences in makes and markets and in distributors in general, but as a general proposition there's no difference in mix in the distributors that have contracts versus those that don't. We as a company are very focused on mix, and driving the mix towards our core brands, which are higher margin, higher gross profit as a general proposition, and that gives us the opportunity not only for depletion growth but also for a positive mix effect. So that's what we try to do in general across all our markets, but there isn't a huge difference or there's nothing peculiar about mix in distributors with contracts versus those that don't have contracts.
Vivien Azer – Citigroup: The reason I asked is while I understand that there is a difference between the depletions and the shipments from a growth perspective and how that's going to impact FY12. I guess I'm still kind of surprised because you're putting up such good depletion growth for your higher margin brands that that's not going to show up any more in EBIT than what you've indicated for FY12.
Rob Sands: That also emanates from the fact that the shipment guarantees that were in place this year also took into account mix, and therefore shipments next year will be at a similar mix level as this year because we're comparing shipments not depletions. Whereas, as to what we're doing in the market place it's all about driving depletions for future growth and for future mix benefits. I'm sorry that this is as confusing as it is, but it's shipments versus shipments from a financial point of view but from an underlying growth perspective it's depletions versus depletions, year-over-year.
Bob Ryder: And what we have seen, in the market and IRI, we have seen positive mix shift. The whole market has seen positive mix shifts. We don't anticipate that changing dramatically next year, but the gravity is basically just overlapping the fact that shipments exceeded depletions in fiscal '11.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lauren Torres of HSBC.
Lauren Torres – HSBC: My question is on the beer business. You're benefitting, and we're seeing some upside here as a result of easy comps. Also, coming back from some of these supply chain challenges. But with that said, I'm just curious about the actual health of the beer business, whether it be on-premise trends, also maybe with your competitors taking some pricing, how the narrowing of that price gap is helping your numbers. Once again, just an overall sense of how these trends are improving ex the comps and ex some of these supply chain challenges.
Rob Sands: Our beer business, Crown, is, I would say, particularly healthy at the moment. As you know, we increased our guidance on what we expected on depletions this year, for the total year, to the low to mid-single-digit levels. In the third quarter we actually experienced very solid mid-single depletion growth, up approximately 5%, and year-to-date depletions are running also in the mid-single digits. So I think that's indicative of a very healthy beer business.  Imports in general are outperforming the total beer business, the domestic beer business. Crown is outperforming the other three major suppliers. As it relates to our specific brands, we probably have, in terms of scale brands, we have the hottest brand in the marketplace with Modelo Especial, which is now the third largest import, as I said. It's now the 15th largest beer overall. On a dollar sales basis, it's the third-largest import. It's in excess of 30 million cases. And it's got very strong growth.  Corona Extra has returned back to growth. So as I've said in the past, the beer business has proved to be one of the most cyclical parts of our business and the silver lining in that cloud is that as the economy continues to recover I think that the Crown business is going to continue to improve as well. So in general, we're really pleased with how Crown is performing and how that business is doing from an underlying depletion trend point of view.
Lauren Torres – HSBC: And just with respect to the relationship, obviously now that the litigation is out of the way, does that open more avenues to kind of grow your brands and open up discussions between the two? Has that changed at all?
Rob Sands: Well, the relationship is good, and the consequence of how we resolved that matter was an agreement relative to incremental spending against the brand for marketing and promotion. And I think that that's playing out well. We've got great programs in place and I think that those programs are driving some of our results, our very positive results, really because I think that our marketing programs and advertising is truly a cut above really anything else in the industry in a lot of ways.  I think that our execution is fantastic, and I think that more importantly, our brand, we have delivered a very consistent message relative to Corona Extra and our brand, which has resonated with the consumer. As opposed to, I think, some of the herky jerky marketing programs and activities of some of the competitors, which I don't think has worked to their benefit. And it's hard to repair because the consistency hasn't been there for the number of years that it has been for Corona Extra in particular.
Lauren Torres – HSBC: And lastly, can I Bob, the cap ex guidance for this year now is $100 million to $120 million? Is that what you said?
Bob Ryder: Correct.
Lauren Torres – HSBC: So that would imply $30 million to $50 million in the fourth quarter. Just wondering why that seems a bit high relative to the last couple of quarters?
Bob Ryder: You know, if you've spent as much time with engineers as I have, they like to kind of wait until the fourth quarter to spend all their cap ex. Every company I've been at. So it's all like year-over-year timing stuff.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: Bob, what tax rate are you assuming in the 2012 earnings guidance range you gave us? Comparable tax rate?
Bob Ryder: Good question. I expected a lot of tax questions. We're not giving a specific rate right now. We will on the April call, but what we're saying is the rate will not be above the rate guidance for this year, which is about 31%. So you shouldn't expect any tax rate in FY12 above 31%.
Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: I assume that's not an ongoing tax rate, and what kind of range do you think your ongoing long-term tax rate is? Does that include some one-time benefits next year?
Bob Ryder: We generally don't give longer-term guidance, but we have, and it kind of sorted out a little bit last year, more this year, and we expect some of it in future years, some relatively positive outcomes with some tax jurisdictions we have around the world. So we're seeing that flow through a lower effective tax rate, and you also see some lower cash tax payments as well, so we're very happy with our tax rates and we think that's why we can say this year will be a low rate and next year will be a low rate. But when the dust settles, and this could be a number of years out, if we're just a North American business, generally in the U.S. tax rates are higher than anywhere else in the world. So I wouldn't assume that we're going to have a 31% tax rate for like a 12-year duration, but I think we'll have some positive tax outcomes for the relative near future.
Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley: And then Rob, you commented promotional levels in wine were worse than you expected. Can you give us more detail there? Is it a significant gap? And it sounds like you'll be matching that with higher than expected promotional levels on your part than you originally expected?
Rob Sands: I said that they're a little higher than perhaps we had expected. I wouldn't say that it's anything particularly outstanding. Our promotional levels have been higher throughout the year, but we've also had the benefit of that in our depletion trends and we don't expect anything outside of our communicated expectations for the remainder of the year. So we expect them to continue to remain moderately higher than they have in the past, but at this stage not beyond our expectations, and it's baked into all of our thinking and our guidance for the year, so that's where we're at.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: A few questions, but staying here on wine, the promotional spending being a little bit higher in the quarter than expected, a little higher in the coming quarter than expected. I wonder if we could kind of step back a little bit here. And the game plan here circa summer of 2009, I guess, was to do things that are going to allow you to improve share and we're yet to see that happening. And the spending is going to be greater than what you had anticipated. So sometimes these things take longer than anticipated, but can you just kind of give us a state of the union in terms of what you think from a one-year, two-year, three-year timeframe from here. Do you think there's going to be the things that are going to allow you to actually deliver on that hope of indeed being a share taker without dollars being the only driver of that?
Rob Sands: Yeah, when you're looking at the longer range, the thing that we're trying to accomplish as I said is all about the underlying depletion growth. And we've established some pretty good trends in our underlying depletion growth as it relates to both actual percentage growth and mix, meaning that if you look at our depletion mix, in terms of dollar sales of depletions, it would be significantly ahead of our actual physical case growth. Therefore, as we move into periods next year and the year after and so on and so forth where the depletions equal shipments and we don't have this overlap and the imbalance issue, and we won't. That's going to bode very well for our underlying growth, and let me put it this way, as that starts to flow through to sales, we ought to be able to leverage that throughout the P&L to a positive net income result.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: So you feel like it's early innings - I guess I'm still struggling, but okay. Fair enough. As we look at the contract you have with these larger distributors and that 60% of volume, can you remind us what the duration on them is, how much time is left on them? And then if we think, and I realize there's confidentiality here, but if we think from their perspective in terms of early termination rights, are there share objectives that have to be achieved? Are there certain absolute rates of depletion growth? Can you talk a little bit about what rights they have it there comes a point where they're not happy with the relationship?
Rob Sands: Contracts generally run for about 5.5 years from our fiscal 2010 and [inaudible] includes fiscal 2010. So partially through '15, fiscal year '15. 
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: And any thoughts on early termination or performance provisions that would make it earlier?
Rob Sands: No. There's generally, related to performance, no early termination. In fact, it's the opposite, in that there are incentives and disincentives in the contracts for distributor performance, meaning if distributors overperform there's incentives for them. If they underperform there's disincentives for them. But there's not early termination so to speak.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: And then just shifting over to the Ruffino comment, can you just - I realize it's a dispute, but from Ruffino's perspective what kind of number are we talking about in terms of the put they're trying to implement here?
Bob Ryder: It was in last year's Q and there will be a little bit more verbiage in this quarter's Q as in last quarter's Q. The maximum amount of the put is EUR55 million. We're disputing the put in total. But under SEC regs we have to disclose the maximum amount of the put, so that's EUR55 million. 
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: And Bob, also on the tax rate, can you talk a little bit more, kind of flesh it out a little bit more in terms of what's driving this improvement? It seems like you think it will be multi-year in nature. Can you talk in a little bit more detail about what is the source of these improvements?
Bob Ryder: In the tax world, it gets so complicated. And the other thing is there's these big time lags between, you know, when the original tax return was filed and when the ultimate settlement happens that we'd rather not talk about specifics.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: And then last one, over on beer, can you give us some sense of how December was? Obviously weather was an issue, but the industry, or at least your business, picked up nicely in the quarter, your quarter. Can you talk about December?
Bob Ryder: I don't know if we can talk about December specifically, but right now both us and the Crown business are very happy with the momentum that our beer business has. In the third quarter, Corona Extra, as Rob had mentioned, actually registered positive growth, which is the first time since the JV was formed, so we're very happy about that. We think that's some of our nice marketing, and we've done some restructuring in our sales organization, so we think our execution is getting a little bit better there. And we remain quite bullish on Modelo Especial, which you know as Rob said, is at 30 million cases, and it's still growing at 15-20%. It's pretty amazing. And we're very bullish, although very early days, on the launch of Victoria. We're bringing it into new states next year, so we expect pretty good things from that brand, which also has a high deal of brand equity and resonates pretty immediately with, especially the Hispanic community, but we think it could even have legs beyond that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Ramey of D.A. Davidson.
Tim Ramey – D.A. Davidson: Just as we think about the target inventory levels before the end of the fourth quarter, the idea of freezing them, are there levers that the distributors can pull in terms of incremental promotion to kind of work those down since there, I assume, would be a multi-year incentive for them to do extra-well this quarter.
Rob Sands: To work what down?
Tim Ramey – D.A. Davidson: Their distributor inventory.
Rob Sands: Yeah, there are some mechanisms in the contract that the distributors can utilize to pull down inventory through overperformance, yes.
Tim Ramey – D.A. Davidson: Does any of that require copayment along with you, or co-investment, or how does that work?
Rob Sands: That's up to them how they generate the performance other than they can't generate performance in a manner that's not to the benefit of the brand. But they can increase their investment against the brand to drive growth as long as it's done in a manner that's consistent with the brand health.
Bob Ryder: And they can't, irrespective of what they do, they can't force us to do anything that we do not want to do, so we're kind of independent. So they can spend more promotion out of their pocket if they want, but it has to be consistent with what we both agree is the brand equity. And no matter what they do, they cannot force us to follow them.
Tim Ramey – D.A. Davidson: So in general, the fourth quarter performance could be both organically and optically a little better than what -
Bob Ryder: Well, fourth quarter, again, on a year-over-year basis, we're overlapping the fact that we took inventories down last year, so that will make both sales and EBIT growth look pretty robust in the fourth quarter, but that's mostly a prior-year overlap issue. Normally, the third quarter is the Christmas build. Everybody builds inventory in the third quarter. The normal cadence would be for the fourth quarter for depletions to actually exceed shipments as that Christmas inventory kind of gets [inaudible].
Operator: Your next question comes from Christine Farkas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Christine Farkas – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I had a question on Australia and grapes if I could. One of the beautiful things about the global structure of Constellation is your ability to source globally, and I'm just wondering if the sale of the Australian operations will change that ability to act as to or source the [inaudible] from Australia to use in some of your operations.
Rob Sands: Nope. Doesn't change that. In fact, it gives us more flexibility over the longer range than less flexibility, because we're not tied any further to the bricks and mortars of our own operations and therefore if there are supply imbalances or oversupply around the world in various appellations, whether it's Australia or otherwise, we can take advantage of that and take advantage of favorable pricing trends to buy bulk wine if that's what we decide to do, from other operation. Whereas obviously if you've got your own vineyard, plants, etc. your first instinct would be to utilize your own production regardless of how that matches up with other opportunities that are available in the marketplace. Or advantageous situations. 
Christine Farkas – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Then if the reverse were true, if there was a shortage, that's where your scale would potentially come into advantage as well?
Rob Sands: You could say that, but there's no shortages anticipated in the near future on a worldwide basis, and we certainly have sufficient production capabilities in the rest of the business overall to meet any demand needs that we think could be foreseeable as well as the ability to move or switch appellations in brand, certain brands, where it's appropriate, as we need to do. So we don't anticipate any issue in that regard in any timeframe that would be of concern to any of us, you or I.
Christine Farkas – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then just to round out on grapes, you did mention or highlight grape costs as a source of pressure on gross margins. I'm wondering if you could just highlight for us where we are in that inventory. Is this high-cost inventory going to run through for the next few quarters, or are we at the end of that? Just kind of frame how that inventory situation is working out. 
Bob Ryder: In the U.S. the harvest year '08 was a relatively expensive harvest, and that is flushing through cost of goods sold this year, which is making the fiscal '11 COGS look higher than fiscal '10. We expect most of that to flush through this year. There might be a tiny amount in next year, but it probably won't be noticeable. So that should be behind us. The opposite is happening on the Australia COGS, where last year they flushed through more expensive grapes in fiscal '10 than we are seeing in fiscal '11, but of course that won't be much more of a concern to us on a consolidated basis. It will only be a concern for our 20% equity interest in the new entity.
Operator: Your final question comes from Carlos Laboy of Credit Suisse.
Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse: Rob, how do you gauge, or what is the danger, that these line distributors build excessive inventories to meet these distribution commitments? And if it does happen, what do you do about it? How do you go about it?
Rob Sands: Well, first of all, the distributors don't have excessive inventories, and the shipment guarantees are over, and so on average those distributors with shipment guarantees are running about 2-3 months of inventory, which is pretty standard in the industry. So if anything, you might argue that inventory levels are where we want them - that's we, meaning us, the supplier. Distributors would always like to have lower inventories to higher inventories. And since the shipment guarantees are over, in one case halfway through this fiscal year and the rest of the cases at the end of the fiscal year, and then under the agreement shipments have to equal depletes, those inventory levels in terms of number of cases will remain where they are. Now, they'll come down as the business grows, or if the business grows let me say, which of course we expect that it will, but they'll come down in a number of days as the business grows thereafter.
Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse: And to close out with a beer question, Rob, would you buy back the other 50% of Crown if you could? And what keeps you from asking for it?
Rob Sands: My answer to that is I really can't comment on that. We have no intention at the current time of buying back the other 50% interest in Crown. I did see what you wrote in Beer Business Daily, by the way, or your quote in Beer Business Daily. But obviously that's your own speculation and we as I said really have no plans that we can comment on.
Operator: That was your final question. I'll now turn the call back over to Rob Sands for closing remarks.
Rob Sands: Well thank you everybody for joining our call today. I am pleased with our third quarter, and would like to summarize the highlights as follows. Number one, we did generate very strong free cash flow, which has enabled us to not only fund our share buyback, but has allowed us to continue our debt reduction efforts. We increased our free cash flow target for the year and believe it is sustainable for the longer term. We are experiencing strong momentum in our imported beer business, and marketplace trends for our U.S. wine and spirits business are healthy and our U.S. distributor initiative is working. Our plan is to continue solid execution of our initiatives throughout the final quarter of the year.  I would also like to mention that we are planning an investor day in New York City in the mid-May timeframe, so stay tuned for the details. Thanks again for your participation.

Operator: At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands first quarter 2011 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Good morning everyone and welcome to Constellation's first quarter fiscal 2011 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During the call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com under the Investor section. Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. Although statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Sands: Thanks, Patty, and good morning everyone and welcome to our discussion on Constellation's first quarter sales and earnings results. We're off to a good start for the year, with results that were generally in line with our expectations. I believe the highlight of the first quarter relates to the fact that we are beginning to realize the benefits from our consolidation of our U.S. distribution network in key markets and the implementation of our new go-to market strategy. Remember, it was during last year's first quarter that we began to scale back promotional activities for our U.S. wine and spirits business in advance of the initiation of our U.S. distributor consolidation program and sales force restructuring efforts. And we did not increase promotions to more normalized levels until the end of last year's third quarter, in advance of our holiday selling season. Nonetheless, in the market, promotional activity has remained strong throughout this period, especially in the premium plus category. Now having completed the most significant phase of our U.S. distributor transition, during this year's first quarter, we increased promotional activities and brand investments, launched new products, and began to improve our in-store execution at retail. Some examples of these activities include, continuation of what we call the biggest holiday ever promotion during Easter, new product launches including the introduction of blufeld German Riesling, Arbor Mist, White Pear Pinot Grigio, Black Box Malbec and Woodbridge sparkling wines, brand investment in Spectrum, relaunch of Ravenswood No More Wimpy Wines campaign using digital media. Collectively these efforts drove improved marketplace depletion growth in the mid-single digit range for our U.S. wine business. And as I mentioned last quarter, we are refocusing our energies towards improving depletions and consumer takeaway, and we made measurable progress toward this goal. We expect to grow our U.S. wine business in line with total industry growth trends, and are working diligently to achieve this target as we progress through fiscal 2011. Current growth in the IRI channel remains healthy at about 5% on a dollar basis according to recent 12-week IRI data. In particular, the super premium plus segment where wine sells for greater than $8 a bottle at retail is currently growing at double digit rates. And within these price segments, many of our leading well-known brands continued to perform well in the marketplace, including Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Blackstone, Clos du Bois, Estancia, Toasted Head, Simi, Franciscan, Wild Horse, and Kim Crawford. In fact with our streamlined portfolio, our top 15 U.S. wine brands represent the vast majority of our U.S. wine profitability. And it's these brands that are growing at a pace faster than the market due to our U.S. distributor consolidation efforts and our renewed focus on building and promoting our brands. During the quarter, Constellation gained international recognition at having some of the best and most powerful brands in the industry. The 2010 Power 100 List recognizes the world's most powerful line in spirits brands. This year's list includes several of our brands, with SVEDKA as one of the most powerful vodka brand and Black Velvet as one of the most powerful whisky brands. Robert Mondavi and Hardys are two of the most powerful wine brands, and Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy is one of the most powerful brandy brands. In addition, Beverage Information Group recently recognized Constellation with three fast track awards for our Black Box, Kim Crawford and SVEDKA brands. In early June, Constellation participated in the inaugural Ultimate Wine Challenge in New York City, which is a professional tasting event of nearly 500 wines, representing 15 countries and 43 Appalachian. The Chairman's trophy was awarded to the best wines in 23 different wine categories. Constellation won trophies for Nobilo Sauvignon Blanc, 2009, Hogue Cellars Genesis Riesling '08, Simi Cabernet Sauvignon 2006, Clos du Bois Pinot Noir 2007, and Ravenswood Napa Valley Zinfandel 2007. Moving to our Canadian business, the accolades also continue. In early June, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which is the largest purchaser of beverage alcohol in the world, awarded Vincor Supplier of the Year across all beverage alcohol categories. In addition, they received the Best New Product Launch and Best Image Program awards for their new open wine brand. These results indicate that our brand strength and reputation are continuing to grow in today's competitive marketplace, which validates our strategic imperatives emphasizing premiumisation, brand building and organic sales growth. Now from an operating perspective, our Canadian wine business posted positive net sales results for the quarter, primarily driven by the premium wine portfolio including Jackson-Triggs and Inniskillin. In our spirits business, during the first quarter, SVEDKA Vodka posted sales growth of 40% versus last year and continued to gain market share. As I mentioned earlier, SVEDKA was recognized on the 2010 Power 100 list as one of the world's most powerful spirits brands, but was also honored as the highest-rated single new category entrant and earned a 2010 Business Star Performance Award. As you know, SVEDKA is the fastest growing major U.S. spirits brand and has now become the fourth largest vodka brand in the United States. And during the quarter we launched SVEDKA's first national TV advertising campaign, which began airing March 1. Black Velvet also posted strong results in the first quarter, with sales increasing low double digits. Now moving to our international business. The 2010 grape harvest in Australia is now complete and it appears that the current harvest estimate is about 1.5 million tons, a 12% decrease from the 2009 harvest of approximately 1.7 million tons. While this harvest intake is closer to current demand, a surplus remains from prior years over supply. Current marketplace dynamics in the U.K. and Australia remain unchanged. Therefore, we continue to aggressively restructure our business in these markets through cost reductions, minimization of working capital investments and asset sales. Our primary goal is to generate cash, increase efficiencies and improve gross profits. The U.K. and Australian business combined represent less than 5% of our total consolidated EBIT in 2010. Now moving to the Crown Imports joint venture, during the first quarter, sales and operating income for the Crown joint venture continued to be impacted by economically driven challenges for the U.S. beer industry in general. These challenging trends that were pervasive throughout 2009 have continued into 2010 with major premium domestic brands loosing volume and share to Craft Beers sub premiums and now imports. Now within the import category, Crown has recently faired better than most, but I'll discuss this in greater detail in a moment. Crown's first quarter operating income was unfavorably impacted not only by volume declines and unfavorable mix, but the timing of marketing and promotional activities such as programming for the Cinco de Mayo holiday. Distribution of value added coupons in select markets, World Cup Soccer advertising and the Win a Beach getaway sweepstakes. However, the good news is, is that we believe these promotional activities were successful in driving positive depletion trends during the quarter. I'd like to provide a few examples; Crown outperformed key competitors in the U.S. beer market during two important first quarter events, Cinco de Mayo and the Memorial Day holiday. During Cinco, Crown outperformed the total beer and import categories and case growth, with Modelo Especial outperforming every major domestic and import brand per IRI data corresponding with this timeframe. During the Memorial Day holiday, Crown not only increased case sales, but grew market share in IRI channels including food, drug, convenience and mass markets. Crown's promotional activities and timing factors resulted in temporary inventory reductions at the wholesale level during the first quarter. Having said that, Crown is closely managing inventories at wholesale and retail to ensure seamless execution during the summer selling season. Throughout the remainder of fiscal 2011, Crown has focused on further enhancing the integration of sales and marketing efforts by optimizing promotional activity and media support during peak seasonal periods, when consumers buy the most. Some of the activities that has been or will become visible in the marketplace includes; the continued rollout of Negro Modelo and Modelo Especial draft which now has a presence in 25 states, the launch of Pacific Draft [ph] throughout California, the continuation of Win a Beach get away summer sweepstakes program that began immediately following the Cinco de Mayo holiday and will run through the end of July. Crown is partnering with Sports Illustrated and World Cup magazine through the duration of the World Cup Soccer event. And Corona is also one of the three major beer sponsors on World Cup TV. Recently Crown launched Modelo's Victoria brand in Chicago as an initial test market, and rapidly sold out of its kit [ph] allocation for this product. Victoria is Mexico's number two volume and oldest beer brand and was introduced at a price point premium to Corona Extra. All aspects of this test market will be tracked and measured with a recommendation for potential expansion in 2011. In closing, we are beginning to reap the rewards of our focused and profitable organic growth as we work diligently to harvest the ultimate benefit from the execution of our U.S. distributor strategy. And our strong free cash flow enables us to create value in the form of an accelerated share buyback while continuing our debt reduction efforts. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder, our CFO for a financial discussion of our business results.
Bob Ryder: Given the continuing challenging economic and competitive market conditions, I'm pleased with our Q1 results which were generally in line with our expectations. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.38 a share versus $0.33 last year. Comparable EBIT came in below prior year, as expected. However, we saw some encouraging trends in the quarter. We remain focused on leveraging our new U.S. business structure, streamlined portfolio and consolidated U.S. distributor network. These efforts are progressing as our U.S. distributor initiative gained traction in the marketplace. This, combined with the increased brand investments and promotional activities outlined by Rob has improved shipment volumes, performance at retail, and attrition trends for our U.S. wine business during the first quarter. However, a higher promotional activity impacted net sales, as promotions are reported as a reduction in the net sales line. This reduced North American wine sales and our operating margin. The promotion spend increase was due in part to timing. In fiscal 2010, promotion spending was lighter in Q1 and Q2 as we shifted more promotion dollars to the second half of fiscal '10 as part of our US distributor consolidation effort. In Q1 fiscal '11, we increased spending to more normal levels due to our Easter holiday volume improvement program. Also, as Rob mentioned, wine industry promotion spending has increased in the premium and above price category, and we are staying competitive with an eye on the bottom-line. Year-over-year promotion spending comparisons should improve in the second half of fiscal '11. The quarter also saw some positive timing related to our comparable basis effective tax rate which should reverse in the balance of the year as our effective tax rate came in at 24% versus our targeted full year rate of 35%. Before we look at our Q1 P&L performance in more detail, I wanted to highlight that we have changed our segment reporting structure. Our Wine business is now structured in two segments. The first segment is North America, and the second segment is Australia and Europe with most of Europe represented by the U.K. This reporting change was driven by our strategy shift in Australia and Europe where we've combined the infrastructures of these businesses given the symbiotic nature of these markets to better align strategy, increase efficiencies, reduced SG&A cost and improve cash generation. We're very different businesses in these two segments with divergent economic models and strategies. We believe segregating the reporting of these businesses should help investors better understand our overall business. The North American business represents the majority of our profitability and has strong financial profile. Results for New Zealand are included in North America's segment, as the vast majority of our wine produced in New Zealand is consumed in the U.S. and Canada, and has always been reflected within North America. New Zealand sales not consumed in North America represent about 2% of the North American segment sales. Prior period results in our press release and our segment history schedule on our website have been restated to conform with the new segment presentation. Now let's look at our fiscal Q1 P&L performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated net sales decreased 1%, primarily due to the divestiture of our U.K. Cider and Value Spirits Businesses, partially offset by the favorable impact of year-over-year currency rate fluctuations. On an organic constant currency basis, which absolutely impacted acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange rate changes, net sales were even with the prior quarter. Our common shares for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Our consolidated wine organic net sales decreased 1%; this included a 2% decrease for North America, slight increase in volume was more than offset by the higher promotion activities in the quarter. Australia and Europe increased 1% as marketplace conditions have generally remained unchanged. Spirits organic net sales increased an impressive 28% for the quarter. Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 34.5% versus 34.9% for the prior year. This reflects higher promotion spending in the U.S. and unfavorable foreign currency impacts related to shipments of Australian products in the U.K. partially offset by favorable Australian grape crops as the lower cost calendar 2009 harvests starts to flow through our fiscal 2011 income statement. Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $18 million and came in at 21.4% of net sales compared with 19.1% a year ago. The percentage of sales increase reflects lower net sales as a result of the increased promotional spend, combined with higher professional service costs for projects aimed at improving our systems and business operations. Much of the increased cost will remain throughout the year. Consolidated operating income decreased 17% to $103 million, and operating margin decreased 2.7 percentage points to 13.1%. I'd now like to turn to our segment operating results to provide highlights of our first quarter operating income change. North American segment operating income decreased $15 million to $133 million. The decrease was primarily due to the higher promotion spending. The Australia and Europe wine segment reported an operating loss of $3 million versus a breakeven result in the prior year quarter. The grape cost benefits in Australia were offset by the strengthening of the Australian dollar, and gross profit margins in the U.K. continue to be challenged. Please note that the first quarter is the seasonally lowest profit quarter for this segment, and we do expect this segment to be profitable on a full year basis. Corporate and other expenses totaled $26 million versus 22 for the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher professional services, including cost related to Project Fusion, our multi-year program designed to strengthen our global business systems and processes. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $54 million versus $63 million in the prior year. For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $622 million, a decrease of 3%, and operating income of $109 million, a decrease of 14%. Sales were impacted primarily by higher promotions and unfavorable mix. Operating income for Crown was impacted by the timing of promotional and marketing investments, a contractual product cost increase and unfavorable mix. Interest expense for the quarter was $49 million, down 29% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower average interest rate during the quarter, and our significant debt reduction actions during fiscal 2010. Let's take a look at debt. At the end of May our debt totaled $4 billion which represents a $182 million increase from our debt level at the end of fiscal '10. The increase primarily reflects funding our $300 million accelerated stock buyback, partially offset by $60 million in note receivable proceeds from the sale of our Value Spirits business and our free cash flow generation. I will talk more about the stock buyback in a few moments. Our average interest rates for the quarter was approximately 5%. Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of May was 4.4 times. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 24%, which reflects the favorable outcome of tax items and compares to a 39% rate for Q1 last year. As mentioned earlier, we are still targeting a full year tax rate of 35%. Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated free cash flow of $34 million versus a use of cash of $102 million in the prior year. The improvement reflects anticipated timing benefits for Crown distributions and interest payments. We also saw lower restructuring payments and an inventory benefit primarily related to the U.S. (inaudible). CapEx came in at $26 million versus $47 million in Q1 last year due to project timing. We continue targeting free cash flow to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million in fiscal 2011. This includes CapEx in the range of $110 million to $130 million. While we expect to pay for debt in fiscal '11, we have redeployed a portion of free cash flow to repurchase stock as we believe our shares represent good value. In April, we entered into a $300 million accelerated stock buyback transaction. We funded this through our low cost revolver. During the first quarter we received 13.8 million shares of Class A common stock, which represented the minimum number of shares that will be received under the transaction. The final number of shares to be received under the transaction will be determined at the close of the transaction period. That provides a good point to move to our full year fiscal 2011 P&L outlook. We're increasing our comparable basis EPS guidance by $0.10 to a range of $1.63 to $1.78 per share to reflect the estimated accretion benefit of the stock buyback. We still expect interest expense to be in the range of $210 to $220 million, as rates remain below those anticipated at the beginning of the year. We're now assuming weighted average diluted shares to approximate $212 million versus our previous guidance of $224 million to reflect the estimated stock buyback benefit. As a reminder, Q2 fiscal 2011 will have a tough comparison versus Q2 fiscal 2010. As previously discussed in Q2 of last year, Constellation and the newly appointed distributors decided to increase distributor inventories and minimize operational disruptions to ensure adequate service levels with retail customers during the transition. We estimated Q2 fiscal '10 benefited from this timing shift by approximately $40 to $50 million in net sales and $0.05 to $0.07 of diluted EPS. As discussed earlier, Q2 fiscal '10 also reflected lower promotion cost. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items which are detailed in our news release. During Q1 we recorded a $0.02 charge for restructuring activity related to our global cost reduction initiative, and a $0.13# tax charge associated with the valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets in the U.K. Before we take your questions, I would like to reiterate that we're on track to meet our financial goals for the year, and we continue to improve our organic business model. We're pleased with the top-line results of our marketplace initiatives. Our increased brand investment in core brands, our new product launches and our progress with our distributor initiative has resulted in improved shipment and depletion volumes and market share gains on our core brands. Although Q1 Crown performance was below prior year, we're also seeing some positive top-line results from Crown's branding and marketing initiatives. Cash flow is starting the year out on a strong note, which in conjunction with continued low interest rates is helping reduce the incremental interest expense of our share buyback. Our U.K./Australia business continues to be challenged, and we continue to look for ways to improve the financial returns of this business. With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Vivien Azer of Citigroup.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup: My first question has to do with the U.S. wine category. I don't think I heard you guys say it, but can you talk about what your outlook is? Is it still kind of flat to plus one? And secondly, can you talk about the category trends in first [ph] quarter? Would you see things improve kind of month to month, both in terms of top-line but also in terms of the level of promotional spending for you guys and the category?
Bob Ryder: In general our estimates have been that the total category in the U.S. should be up very low single digits for the entire year in perhaps the 1% to 2% range. And in general, that's a result of the fact that although we continue to see pretty strong growth in the IRI segment which represents about 30% of the business, the on premise continues to be negatively impacted by the economic downturn, and therefore when we look at the category on an overall basis, we expect it to be as I said up low single digits.
Vivien Azer - Citigroup: And then in terms of the trends intra-quarter has started to look better, kind of the same?
Rob Sands: You're asking about the trends in the first quarter?
Vivien Azer - Citigroup: Yeah, kind of on a month-to-month basis.
Rob Sands: For the industry?
Vivien Azer - Citigroup: And for you guys.
Rob Sands: I would say that for the industry for the first quarter, the trends are probably better than what we believe will be the case for the total year, as best as we could determine it. There is not very perfect data for that up about 3% for the quarter. And our trends are strong; we've taken share in the first quarter in the premium plus category, which is what we really concentrate on, because the bulk of our portfolio we've taken about 1% share, 100 basis points and then overall about 0.5% share. So, I don't want to over hype things, but the first quarter was pretty good in terms of our organic growth strategy, doesn't necessarily make a trend. But as I said we've taken share and outperformed the industry as a general proposition.
Bob Ryder: Yes, the other thing I'd add to what Rob said is in the one category in total you do see premiumisation coming back in in that wine, so above $5 are growing faster than wine below $5. You also see increased promotion spending in wines above $5 and especially in the price point to which Bob referred, like the $8 to $11. So we're having to be competitive in that area. But we kind of look at this as good news in that the consumer is coming back to premiumisation. However, they are demanding more of the discount than they maybe have in the past. But the wine category, as Rob said, especially if you look at all of beverage alcohol, wine is doing quite well. So, we're I guess cautiously optimistic. However, we are keeping our eye on category and then our own promotion spending.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tim Ramey of D.A. Davidson.
Tim Ramey - D.A. Davidson: Just a little follow-up on domestic wine, and by the way the reinstatements are really helpful, thanks much for putting that up. But curious how you would index your own portfolio with that $8 and above or $6 and above or wherever you want to break it? How much of your sales would fall into that category now? I know most, but there are still a few, Arbor Mist and others that…
Rob Sands: The vast majority of our business is in what we would call the premium plus category, which is above $5. And in terms of the category where we have the largest market share, it would be the super-premium category where we have approximately a 30% market share, and then also premium we have more like a 20 some odd percent and then above that about a 20%. So, in terms of how we index versus wine in general, we are skewed significantly towards premium plus and even really super-premium plus than the general industry because we do not have the percentage that the industry has in the $5.00 and below segment, which still represents a pretty significant piece of the wine industry in general. So to the extent that the premium plus and superior-premium categories and above are growing faster than the industry, we are growing faster than the industry as well, not only due to our individual brand performance, but mix as well. Now all that said, as Bob pointed out, although some of these categories like super-premium above eight are now growing in the double digit range and definitely we're back to trading up in premiumisation. All that has to be qualified by the fact that some of this is being driven by some fairly high promotional activity and promotional levels in the marketplace, which is not necessarily a bad thing, because it's stimulating the whole category. Wine is taking share from everything; beer and spirits and is pretty robust. Does that answer your question, Tim?
Tim Ramey - D.A. Davidson: Yes, Rob, just one follow on if I could? The news that we've heard out of the restaurant sector is probably more bullish than what we're hearing out of you on premise. And yet, do you have some brands that really, like a Clos du Bois where there is significant presence there. What's going on with your chemistry here?
Robert Sands: Yes, we think that for the first quarter, the on premise was probably down a couple of percent and our business in the on premise was down just about the same, whereas for the 12 months, the on premise was down probably close to 10%, but we fared considerably better than that. So, over the 12 month period we gained share in the on premise although we were down probably in the mid single digit range for the 12 months. I think we're seeing the on premise begin to flatten out is the answer to how that category or that segment is performing. So, I don't know if that's either more negative than what you believe or not, but if you ask me, I'd say throughout the year we'll see it go from negative to flat. And then hopefully we'll see it upticking sometime before the end of calendar year 2010.
Operator: Your next question comes from Reza Vahabzadeh of Barclays Capital.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital: You talked about the promotional spending. I'm just wondering, will overall promotional and marketing spending for the whole fiscal year be comparable with the prior year or are we going to track materially higher?
Bob Ryder: So, I think you'll see our delta the prior year greater than the first half of this year and then it will smooth out in the back half. So, I think the full year promotion spending will be higher than last year, but not by a big number. But most of the increase will happen in the first half of the year.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital: Okay. And as far as the returns on the higher promotional spending in beer or wine, how do you think about that? Are you getting out quick returns or was I getting deluded by the fact that everyone is promotion as well.
Bob Ryder: Yes, it's a combination of everything, so I'd say on some brands we are getting out quick returns; on others we would probably be happier with higher returns. But we're in a constant balance, maintaining our presence in the market and keeping our eye on market share and making sure that the promotion spending that we do is efficient and that we're getting a positive bottom line. But I think in general, we are having to respond with what's going on in the marketplace and we're all pleased with the turnaround in our top line, because in both wine and spirits, we saw positive depletions in the quarter, which we're taking as a pretty good trend. But we're making sure that the finance and sales guys are kind of holding hands throughout all this promotion spending period to make sure that we're being as efficient as possible.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital: Got it, and then as far as the use of free cash flow, obviously this year a portion of that will go to share repurchases and so de-leveraging will be probably modest. But what about for FY2012 and I know it's early days, but do you anticipate focusing more de-leveraging or being more focused on share buybacks or acquisitions.
Bob Ryder: Yes, we really haven't started talking about FY2012 to the outside world yet. So, we're thinking about it as you speak, but we're not really talking about FY12.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital: Got it.
Bob Ryder: We want to keep our leverage ratio in the three times to four times range. And we did say that we got above that in the first quarter, because we thought it was an opportune time to buy our stock, given the low cost of our revolver, given where the stock price was from an EBITDA ratio and a PE ratio, given the option [ph] that we could gain. So, we'll be looking at those same kind of things next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lauren Torres at HSBC.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: First actually wanted to touch upon guidance; you raised comparable guidance, but reported guidance did come down. I'm not sure, Bob if you touched upon that, why that was so and what that reduction was coming from? Also to last quarter, you gave us some guidelines with respect to sales, profit, Crown Imports, guidance, CapEx guidance. Wondering if there's any changes there also?
Bob Ryder: Sure. So the comparable guidance is moving up a dime a share versus our previous range. That's exclusively driven by the our estimate of what accretion will be on the buyback. And the reported guidance, there is a delta there from comparable all due to the charges, the non-comparable charges we took in the first quarter. And the big piece of that was a charge to eliminate a deferred tax asset in the U.K. And because we are kind of stressed on profitability in the U.K., it's just a probability of ever getting any value out of that asset. And with all the restructuring charges we've taken, we’ve also shown positive GAAP earnings for the past three years. Okay? The accountants get agitated and they tend to say that we won't be able to utilize that deferred tax asset. So, we took that charge in the first quarter, so that's the biggest piece. Regarding the other guidance factors, we really haven't changed anything. And again, you guys do this all the time, but it's the first quarter, so, a trend does not a quarter make, so we are waiting to see how the balance of the year, and of course, beer is a summer season, so the second quarter is very important for us. And in wine it's mostly a third quarter business because of the high level of Christmas sales. But I think we're pretty much on plan where we thought we would be in the first quarter, which is a good place to be.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: And net debt EBITDA call of three to four times, have you started working it down from that 4.4 that you are now, we shouldn't expect to see that in fiscal '11 when you say next year? Okay.
Bob Ryder: Yes, we wouldn't expect that. Again, that was a full year number so we would expect to get back down to that range for the full year.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: Okay. And if I could just lastly ask also a follow-up on the promotional activity, it seems that you're responding to some of your competitor's action. I'm just curious as you think about the market environment, are you just kind of chasing what your competitors are doing or in order to kind of get people into the category in the softer environment, that's what you feel you need to do? And that's something that may continue for the next couple of quarters or have to continue for the next couple of quarters?
Bob Ryder: Well, the good news is here with our new business model in the US and we'll be talking more about this in future quarters, we're really focusing our promotion spending and our marketing spending around our top 15 brands, which comprises about 75% of our EBIT. And that makes it easier to track and that's why we have higher brand equity. So generally, you get better results with that brand spending. So as you know, the wine category is pretty fractious, so we're not going to chase share just because a lot of people are spending money. We have our eye on our key competitors and frankly as we look at the market I don't think there's anything irrational going on. So balance, we're not going to stick our head in this sand and ignore market share, it is important, but we're very much focused on the bottom-line and trying to improve our profit margins and generate cash flow. We're not going to spend a lot of promotion money that doesn't have a good chance of paying off.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lindsay Drucker-Mann of Goldman Sachs.
Lindsay Drucker-Mann - Goldman Sachs: I was just wondering if you could elaborate a bit on the distributor push that you got in the quarter following fourth quarter. Not shipping any product in exchange for a bit more focus from them in the first quarter. So, can you talk a little bit about what -- if that paid dividends and what are that something that would help you as you progress through the year?
Rob Sands: Sure, so what you are referring to is the fact that when we reduced distributor inventories in the fourth quarter last year, there was an agreement with our distributors to put more resources behind the brand this year and I think the simple answer to your question is yes they’ve put more resources behind the brands and I think that you're seeing the impact of that certainly in the IRI data and in the general proposition in our depletions, which have strengthened quite considerably. So, definitely having a positive impact on our business and on our organic growth.
Lindsay Drucker-Mann - Goldman Sachs: Okay. So, I guess just sort of wondering one moment see you guys start to at least maintain dollar share of the wine category especially now with a bit more trade up taking place to higher end, even though your share count did improve the measured channel data that we saw, still loosing against the broader market. So, maybe just think about when you actually see those results really pan out in terms of holding dollar share?
Rob Sands: Yes, we have gained share; definitively in the four week period and against the broad market we haven't gained share in the 12 week period on a dollar basis, but we have on a volume basis and you'll actually see that start turning around now. So, basically we're gaining share as a general proposition against the market. Now interestingly enough, that’s with respect to our total portfolio. Now as I mentioned in my script, our top 15 brands represent the vast majority of our profitability and those are where we really focus and those brands, which is really what matters, have in fact gained share in dollar and volume in every period against the broad market, meaning the 12 and the 4 week period, and those brands represent over 75% of our profitability in the United States. So I would say in general, we're fairly pleased with our organic growth and I would say certainly in the first quarter from a growth perspective we're significantly on the portion of the portfolio that really matters. We've significantly outperformed the market and our competitors.
Lindsay Drucker-Mann - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then the degree of profit erosion that we saw in the period in your North American business, it seemed to be of the step-up in promotional spend, the cost and de-leverage. How should we think about that in terms of, when you kind of annualize when we're out of run rate of the type of investment you put in a quarter?
Rob Sands: Yes, obviously we are sticking to our guidance that we have given for the year. And so that's basically how you should think about it is, we are at the current time believing that we will certainly perform within our guidance range.
Operator: Your next question comes from the Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: I guess a handful of questions here on kind of the costs of improving share, on not only near but longer term. But starting with commentary you made on promotional spending sort of moderating as this fiscal year progresses, what about at the distributor level? I guess the distributors are putting in more for the fiscal year than had originally been indicated, because of how last holiday played out. Should we think that their level of investment behind your brand is roughly kind of on trend with your level of investment behind the brands over the next few quarters?
Rob Sands: Well, that's hard to comment on their level versus our level. Our level of investment is significantly higher than our distributors level of investment on a relative basis, but part of the distributor consolidation program was as a general proposition to get more investments behind our business by our distributors throughout the term of the arrangement, which was a five and a half year term. So, they have as was agreed increased their level of investment and that increased level of investment will continue throughout the period of the arrangement, which was a five and a half year deal basically. And yes, that has been contributing to our growth profile. And basically, working as we wanted it to work and it's basically working as we expected it to work. As Bob said, we are going to closely monitor the trade off between promotional spend and volume and sales increases and make sure that we are striking the right balance. I think that as we have made fairly clear, first quarter's promotional spend was on a relative basis higher than we expect for the year. Primarily due to a number of factors, which is in first quarter last year we had disproportionately low promotion because we had pulled back as went into the distributor consolidation activities. That’s impacting the comparison, number one. And then, there is also some timing matters related to the falling of holidays and how and when we have chosen to promote that will make the first quarter promotional rate higher than we anticipate for the whole year. Although, I would say on a total year basis we would generally expect promotional expense to be higher than last year, because in general, we were not promoting in the first three quarters at normalized levels as we implemented the distributor consolidation efforts. So, that's basically what's going on with promotion, there's really nothing particularly strange going on there.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: And of course you're not in a unique situation, it's pretty tough consumer environment. But as we think about the expense of which you moderate the promotion, as you head into the balance of this calendar year, can you share with us kind of some of the metrics you think are most important for you all to be watching; A, from a kind of an external stand point. Some of the consumer metrics you are looking for at in the broader wine business. And then B, some of the metrics you are looking at inside your business, either metrics at the distributor level, maybe amount of space they get or display activity, obviously there is a lot of things to look at, but when you are trying to rank them and say okay, we can really moderate promotions whatever the number is. 10%, 15%, 5%, whatever it is, we can really moderate it and not expect it to adversely affect the completions. What are some of those metrics that you think are key to determining the appropriate amount of actual moderation versus what’s your level of plan moderation right now?
Rob Sands: Yes, well moderation as I say, promotion won't be at the same level as it will be in first quarter. So I guess your term moderation is correct, but it's general proposition. We hold promotion at times when we think that we'll get the most out of the promotional activity and we come back when we think that we would otherwise get it. So, it'll fluctuate throughout the year, but the asset won't be at the same rate as first quarter as we sit here now, that's our belief and our intention at the moment. As to the metrics that we're looking at, certainly from the consumer point of view, we are keeping a close eye on consumer takeaway from a volume perspective, and we measure that by looking at things like IRI, like other data that we get. And certainly, depletions are representative of consumer takeaway, sales to retail in that we generally now expect key retailers stacking up, or we don’t see big fluctuations in their inventory levels. Certainly, the mix of our business is a very important measure for us to be looking at, ensuring that we have a healthy mix towards our higher profit items and our higher ROIC items. We've had a big focus on driving return on invested capital. We've taken that down to a certain degree to the brand level, and therefore we're cognizant of mix as it relates both to profitability and ROIC. And then internally, needless to say, operating profit continues to be a very important measure of our success. And that goes to what we said earlier about making sure that we're appropriately calibrating our promotional activities against our volume growth to optimize the profit picture for the company and the ROIC picture. So it's not rocket science really, but those are the things that we're looking at.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: And if I could just add one more here, Rob. We've heard a fair bit over the last nine months or so about the distributor consolidation. If you think about it from a Constellation perspective, obviously you're selling to lot fewer customers today then you were a year ago. What remained in your opinion to be done with the incentive structure of your sales force selling into these distributors? How kind of set is that in your mind? Is that where it needs to be, or do you need to make some important changes there, now that the customer base has changed the way it has? Any thoughts there would be helpful.
Rob Sands: We simultaneously reorganized our sales organization as we implemented the distributor consolidation activity, and we actually went through a customer based organization, meaning that our sales organization is now organized around our customers as opposed to just purely geographically. And we have one sales organization as opposed to many sales organizations, et cetera. When we did that we of course adjusted our incentive compensation systems to be aligned with what we were trying to accomplish with our wholesale customers and retail customers. And so the simple answer to your question is, that's all done and now there are no significant changes that need to be made at the current time, which is good because it's all up and running and in place. And I would say it's running pretty well right now, and everything's working well. So we're pretty optimistic. The key task now is to drive it to ultimate success over the mid-term, which I'm fairly optimistic that we will get what we're looking for.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin Dryer of Gabelli & Company.
Kevin Dryer - Gabelli & Company: First, just a couple nitpicking questions. One, on your assumed share comp for the full year, does that reflect just the shares that have already been delivered to you, or an estimate of what the final shares are?
Bob Ryder: It’s more of an estimate Kevin, but it depends on the share price, how many shares you get back and also the number of shares that get delivered [ph]. So this share repurchase program could go through mid-November, which would mean we wouldn't get all that much accretion on the next tranche shares that we received, or it could end in two weeks, we don't know. Well, that's our best guess right now, but your low to high is like a penny, and a penny half of the $0.10 that we gave. So there's not a ton of volatility left.
Kevin Dryer - Gabelli & Company: Then can you help me understand a little bit how your tax rate's going to play out by quarter this year, since it'll obviously be higher than the 35% for the remaining three quarters.
Bob Ryder: Wow! Our phone bill will [ph] get too big for that. So that's a little too detailed. I mean, we don't give quarterly guidance. In the last quarter, the guidance we would give would be tax rate quarterly guidance. So we expect the full year tax rate coming about 35%. There's just some anomalies in Q1 because some tax rate items came to closure in the first quarter, and we’re able to release those tax reserves which is what drove the low tax rate in Q1. To your model, I just assume 35 for the full year.
Kevin Dryer - Gabelli & Company: And then I guess finally, it's been quiet regarding the lawsuit with Modelo regarding Crown. Anything new there? And any potential for any resolution or renegotiation in the Crown contract?
Rob Sands: No resolution there at the current time. We filed a motion to dismiss, we're waiting for a decision on the motion to dismiss. I’d just remind you that we have said in the past that it's basically a dispute over a financially immaterial item that (inaudible) certainly determine; is thus resolved by the courts. And it really has zero impact on the terms of our agreement, which certainly hasn't changed since we entered into the agreement beginning of 2007. And we remain satisfied as a general rule with what we've negotiated, and it seems to be working well. Both parties, Modelo and ourselves continue to work closely together. And our primary focus, despite this lawsuit, meaning ourselves and Modelo, our primary focus is on driving this business and making sure that we're doing the right thing for the brand and for the consumer. And I think that we're both pleased with some of what we're seeing right now. In particular, both Modelo and ourselves are pleased with the turnaround we're seeing in imports. Imports in general are back into growth, imports are taking share. And I'd say our portfolio is now performing the best in the imports category. So imports are taking share and we're taking share. So, I would say both parties, ourselves and Modelo, are pretty pleased with what's going on in the marketplace. And despite this fact, we're working pretty well together and we'll continue to work well together in the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christine Farkas at Merrill Lynch.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Just a brief question, may be just looking for a summary answer, you talked about targeting your wine sales growth in North America to reach the industry average, which was mentioned was about 5% in the first quarter, whereas, you guys are running down about 2%. So, is this coming from slowing promos, improvements at your distributors, or are there some other factor that depressed the first quarter relative to the industry?
Rob Sands: So, the numbers are in the first quarter, the industry we think grew 3% and we grew 5%, Christine. Does that answer question?
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay.
Rob Sands: In IRI.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay. So, do you expect then depletions and shipments to run a little bit more closely in line as we get through the end of the year?
Rob Sands: Well, maybe I misunderstood your question. We outperformed the industry in the first quarter. Is that what you're asking about?
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: I guess I'm looking, given your North American organic wine number or currency neutral number was down 2% unless I misread that?
Rob Sands: Okay, you're talking shipments now?
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Right, so I'm trying to understand how far apart those are going to be or if there is some other factor that's keeping the gap so wide. It can't go on forever, because ultimately the depletion will pull your shipment?
Rob Sands: Yes, but also remember that it is also related to the comparison of shipments last year and there has been some disconnect okay in that regard. But I'm not going to sit here and say, when shipments and depletion growth should start mirroring each other at some point.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then just briefly on beer, you're quite helpful with your on premise comments in general I think, Roger, reflecting wine. Are you seeing similar improvements on premise for beer or have you seen trends and see stores change at all for your brands? How does that look versus the broader category?
Rob Sands: I would say that on premise trends are improving. Similarly, the channels -- not the channels across the category, beer, wine and spirits, so, improving similarly. Our Crown business I think skews a bit higher to on premise than the beer industry in general. So, on the one hand to the extent that the on premise is the most negatively affected trend that negatively affects our business, on the other hand to the extent that that's improving will be disproportionately benefited by the improvement. Does that answer your question? It is improving; I think it is moving toward flat from down double digits last year. I think it will move to up, eventually. We'll take one more question.
Operator: Your last question comes from Carla Casella of JPMorgan.
Carla Casella - JPMorgan: Have you said at what level you’re basing you forecast, what level of euro you're basing your forecast on?
Rob Sands: Are you talking about our earnings forecast?
Carla Casella - JPMorgan: Your guidance.
Rob Sands: I'll let Bob answer that.
Bob Ryder: We haven't come out with specific euro guidance. But in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter tremendously, because we don't make a ton of money overseas. So, I guess at this point, at the end of last year, due to the potential transaction with AVR [ph] we did not have much of our foreign currency transactional exposure hedged. During the first quarter, we actually layered down a reasonable amount of hedges. So, we don't expect a lot of volatility to our bottom line due to forex changes for fiscal '11. And euro exposure is not one of our biggest, it's not our biggest exposure as a general proposition. The euro exposure really is (inaudible) the dollar.
Carla Casella - JPMorgan: Okay. And then when is end of the transaction period for the $300 million share buyback?
Bob Ryder: We're doing an accelerated program. So the end of it is really depending on Goldman Sachs who's doing the transaction for us. But the maximum end is around mid November, but they can call it quits whenever they bought $300 million of our stock.
Carla Casella – JPMorgan:  Okay, great. Okay, thank you.
Rob Sands: All right thank to, everyone, for joining our call today. And as I mentioned, I am pleased with our first quarter results, which were in line with our expectations. And I believe we are well positioned to achieve our EPS and free cash flow goals for the year. I am especially pleased that we are beginning to realize a number of benefits from our newest consolidated U.S. distributor network. Our experience improved in depletion trends in our U.S. wine and beer business and our accelerated share repurchase transaction represents our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. Overall, thanks again for your participation. We hope you have the opportunity to enjoy some of our great beer, wine and spirits products during the upcoming Fourth of July holiday.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call, you may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Constellation Brands fiscal year 2010 earnings call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. 
Patty Yahn-Urlaub:  Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to Constellation’s fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2010 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC.   During the call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com under the Investors section.   Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. Although statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company’s estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings.   Now I would like to turn the call over to Rob.  
Robert Sands:  Thanks Patty. Good morning everyone and welcome to our call. We have several items to review this morning including our fiscal 2010 results and our guidance for fiscal 2011.  In February, we reached the conclusion of a very dynamic year, one in which we executed against our strategic goals despite lingering economic challenges around the world that affected our key markets. We accomplished a great deal through fiscal 2010, continuing the disciplined work of transforming our portfolio, our operations and our financial model. We continued our portfolio transformation efforts as we began the fiscal year with the sale of our value spirits business which resulted in cash proceeds of $276 million and then we successfully integrated the remaining spirits business into our North American wine business and we ended the fiscal year with the sale of our U.K. cider business, the Gaymer Cider Company, to C&C Group for approximately $70 million.  These transactions combined with strong free cash flow generation helped drive a $600 million decrease in our debt levels. We continued our efforts to improve our prospects for our U.K. and Australian businesses by tightening the portfolio focus, increasing efficiencies, reducing costs and improving cash flow generation. We significantly improved our cost structure not only through our global cost reduction initiatives but through supply chain initiatives and tightened control on SG&A spending.  We improved productivity and created efficiencies through global SKU rationalization efforts and consolidation of our global footprint. We progressed in our efforts to create an integrated technology platform which has been designed to improve the accessibility and visibility of global data. This initiative is already creating value by reducing COGS and improving efficiencies and is designed to ultimately enhance performance in key areas such as supply chain, global procurement, customer service and information management and analysis.  We implemented our new go-to-market sales and marketing structure in the U.S. which was successfully integrated into a single organization. This resulted in synergy benefits and improved efficiency and effectives with our trade partners. From a strategic perspective we have undertaken one of our most important initiatives with the launch of our U.S. consolidation efforts.  Presently, this program gives five distributors the right to sell Constellation’s portfolio of wine and spirits exclusively in their respective markets in 22 states and currently represents approximately 60% of our total U.S. wine and spirits volume. Since the initial transition in September 2009, these distributors have allocated more than 1,000 dedicated distributor sales people to focus exclusively on selling Constellation’s product portfolio.  As you know, the initial distributor transition commenced September 1, 2009 with the second quarter of fiscal 2010 benefiting from the implementation of this program. At that time actions were taken to ensure maximum service levels between distributors and their retail customers during the transition period. These actions had the planned effect of moving a portion of third quarter sales into the second quarter and resulted in some inventory build at distributors. During the third quarter, consumer takeaway was softer than expected at the beginning of the quarter but improved as our new selling model and promotional efforts began to take effect. However, at the end of the third quarter, distributor inventories were higher than targeted levels.  In the fourth quarter, we made a proactive, tactical decision to work with our distributors in decreasing their higher than average inventory to more moderate levels. How did we accomplish that? We did not require distributors to purchase products at contracted levels and in return they agreed to invest in additional marketing and promotional programs behind our brand in the marketplace.  As expected, these actions unfavorably impacted our U.S. wine business during the fourth quarter by approximately $60-70 million in net sales and about $0.07 to $0.09 in diluted EPS and created negative leverage on the remainder of the P&L. However, we believe it was an appropriate tradeoff in order to better position the distributors for success in the future as they work with us to drive profitable organic growth.  Going forward, we are refocusing our energies from managing transition activities to improving depletions and consumer takeaway. Our ultimate goal is to grow our U.S. wine business in line with the total industry growth trends and we expect to achieve this goal in 2011. This translates to an estimated volume growth rate of approximately 1% for the U.S. wine industry inclusive of all channels both on and off-premise. As we have discussed the on-premise channel is tempering the overall growth rate for the wine category while the grocery, mass merchant and club channels are growing at faster rates.  For instance, current growth in the Symphony [ph] IRI channel remains healthy at about 5% on a dollar basis according to recent 12-week IRI data that corresponds to the end of our fiscal year. In particular, the premium segment where wine sells for greater than $5 per bottle at retail continues to grow in IRI channels at a rate of mid to high single digits. Within these trade segments, many of our leading well known brands continue to perform well in the marketplace, including for instance, Rex Goliath, Robert Mondavi’s Private Selection, Clos du Bois, Estancia, Toasted Head, Simi, Franciscan and Kim Crawford.  Remember about 40% of our U.S. wine volume is currently sold in several states that are not included in the transition process. It is in these states that our depletion trends are generally better than those undergoing transition. From a marketing perspective, we are currently in the process of launching several new products or line extensions as part of our strategy to fill portfolio gaps and drive profitable organic growth.  For instance, as we focus on gaining share in the rapidly growing Argentinean Malbec segment, we are preparing to rollout the new Black Box Malbec varietal. We will also be re-launching our Diseno brand with a new package and marketing positioning. We will soon begin shipping our new Blue [ph] Riesling Wine. This action will establish a presence for us in the rapidly growing German Riesling segment. Constellation will begin its participation in the emerging organic wine niche with the Mendocino Vineyards brand which is made using organic grapes. And we are in the process of a national rollout of the sparkling wine under the Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi umbrella.  I just returned from the wine spirits wholesaler conference where Constellation was awarded nine Impact 2009 Hot Brand awards for several of our well known brands including SVEDKA, Black Box, Kim Crawford, Rex Goliath, Corona Light and Modelo Especial just to name a few.  Our Canadian wine business posted positive net sales results for the year, primarily driven by the premium wine portfolio including Jackson-Triggs Naked Grape and the Quebec import business. As you know Vincor Canada was the official wine supplier for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. This sponsorship provided unprecedented exposure for our Canadian brands and showcased the Canadian wine industry to the world. Although the full business impact of this sponsorship has yet to be realized I am pleased to report at this time that an incremental 20,000 cases of our Canadian brands were sold at Olympic venues and surrounding areas during the games.  In addition, our participating Canadian brands were showcased through Canadian and International Media including the Today Show, A Taste of Canada with Kathy Lee Gifford and Wine Spectator.  In the spirits segment, SVEDKA Vodka had another great year and generated phenomenal sales growth of almost 40% versus last year which translates to more than 3 million cases sold in fiscal 2010. SVEDKA is the fastest growing major U.S. spirits brand and now has become the fourth largest vodka brand in the entire United States. We just launched SVEDKA’s first national TV advertising campaign which began airing March 1.  Black Velvet is the second largest Canadian whiskey brand in the U.S. and grew to more than 2 million cases in fiscal year 2010. It also posted solid results for the year with sales increasing in the low to mid single digit range.  From an international perspective, earlier this week we announced that we have ended our discussions with Australia Vintage, Ltd. pertaining to a potential combination of our businesses. Despite our mutual best efforts we were unable to accomplish our goals and we have decided to focus individually on our respective businesses. As a result, we will continue to restructure our businesses in Australia and the U.K. in order to align them with the reality of their respective markets. We will be more aggressive in taking out costs, minimizing our networking capital investments, increasing efficiencies and selling assets. Our primary goal is to generate cash and improve gross profit.  Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. During the company’s fiscal year 2010, the Crown Joint Venture generated $2.3 billion in net sales and $444 million of operating income. Crown continues to have the leading market share in the import category in the U.S. with five of the Modelo brands represented in the top 20 import brands. Corona remains the number one import beer and Modelo Especial is currently the third largest import brand in the United States today. Speaking of Modelo Especial, it is one of the few major super premium brands in calendar 2009 that experienced double digit market growth. This is a major accomplishment considering that 2009 was a particularly challenging year for the U.S. beer industry in general with growth trends softening as the year progressed.  Many major domestic brands lost volume and share to craft beers and sub-premiums. As we have previously indicated, volumes for Crown’s businesses have been impacted by the economy, particularly in the convenience and on-premise channels. However, the Crown portfolio outperformed the import category and grew share throughout the year. These results were driven in part in the grocery channel as Crown introduced new packaging, executed targeted promotions and supported the business with enhanced strategic media activity.  For fiscal 2011, Crown is focused on further enhancing integration of sales and marketing efforts by optimizing promotional activity and media support during peak seasonal periods when consumers buy the most. Some of these activities will be visible in the marketplace including the following; a summer consumer sweepstakes program that will begin immediately following the Cinco de Mayo holiday and will run through the 4th of July. This program will be supported with television advertising.  Crown will partner with Sports Illustrated during soccer’s upcoming World Cup event which will begin in June in South Africa. World Cup Magazine issues will be promoting Modelo Especial specifically for the convenience and on-premise channels. Corona will also be one of the three major beer sponsors of World Cup TV. Crown has expanded the rollout of the Modelo Especial with Negro Modelo draft in nearly 50% of the U.S. with positive results and will continue expanding distribution throughout the remainder of the year.  Crown is also seeing success with new SKUs recently introduced into the convenience channel including Corona and Corona Light 24-ounce cans. Going into Cinco de Mayo holiday and the key summer season, we believe that Crown is well positioned to maximize execution at retail.  Before I turn the call over to Bob I want to discuss our guidance for fiscal 2011. As you can see our comparable EPS estimate for fiscal 2011 is projected to be in a range of $1.53 to $1.68 and reflects our belief that challenges from persistent and uncertain economic conditions will continue to impact our results especially with regard to the Crown Imports business.  However, we expect to begin to realize benefits of our U.S. distribution distributor consolidation efforts as the year progresses. Meanwhile our strong free cash flow enables us to create value in the form of an accelerated share buyback while continuing our debt reduction efforts. Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our business results. 
Robert Ryder :  Thanks Rob. Good morning everyone. Fiscal 2010 was a year of dramatic change, operationally, culturally and financially. From an operational perspective, we took positive steps during the year to strengthen our organic business model.  We sold the bottled spirits business and moved our two scale spirits brand into our U.S. wine business and eliminated our spirits SG&A. We then consolidated the majority of our U.S. distributor network while also reducing the infrastructure of our U.S. wine business from three selling units down to one. This also resulted in reduced SG&A.  We now have a single scale U.S. business focused on a streamlined premium wine and spirits portfolio going to a consolidated, focused and aligned distributor network. Culturally we are focused on profitable organic growth of our premium scale brands; primarily wine. This means increased focus on brand building and sales execution especially in North America. This also represents our next logical business phase as we move beyond a previously decentralized organization which had been very focused on acquisitions toward a more centralized organization more focused on profitable, organic sales growth.  In our U.K. and Australia business we have a renewed focus on profits, driving synergies and generating cash flow. Financially, we reduced costs to help offset the negative impact of the current economy and generated strong free cash flow to help drive another year of debt reduction and reduced interest expense. Our full-year fiscal 2010 comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $1.69 versus $1.60 in the previous year.  Our results included the impact of challenging economic conditions especially on Crown’s performance, U.S. wine sales force restructuring, U.S. distributor consolidation and continuing difficult operating environment for our U.K./Australia business. On the more positive side, we reduced costs which helped offset some unfavorable mix impacts driven by the challenging economy, we extended our revolving credit facility and a portion of our term debt, we generated strong free cash flow as we exceeded the upper end of our guidance range. We significantly reduced debt and interest expense and we realized tax benefits for the year.  Now let’s look at our fiscal 2010 P&L performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Let’s go to our net sales line. As you can see from our news release on page 15, our consolidated net sales decreased 8% for the year primarily due to the divestiture of our Value spirits business and the unfavorable impact of our year-over-year currency rate fluctuations. On an organic constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FOREX changes, net sales increased 1%.  My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Our worldwide branded wine organic net sales which appear on page 14 of the release decreased 1%. This included a 3% decrease for North America, partially offset by increases of 7% in Europe and 4% in Australia/New Zealand. North American sales were impacted by continuing economic challenges and U.S. distributor and sales force transitions. In connection with our recently implemented distributor contracts sales to newly contracted distributors for an initial period are based on a predetermined plan.  Our sales force and distributor transitions resulted in a fall off of depletions and consumer takeaway during fiscal 2010. As a result, distributors have generally been taking in more inventory than they have been depleting. While we were proactive during the fourth quarter in working with distributors to help reduce their inventory levels as outlined by Rob, the distributors ended fiscal 2010 with higher inventory levels than they ended fiscal 2009.  For Europe sales benefited from the growth of our value priced product offerings in the U.K. Sales for Australia/New Zealand increased due to New Zealand product growth in the region. Spirits organic net sales increased by an impressive 19% for the year.  Now let’s look at our profit on a comparable basis using information on page 17 of the release. For the year, our consolidated gross margin was 35% versus 37.1% for the prior year. This reflects the higher Australian costs due to the flow through of the more expensive calendar 2008 harvest and growth of the lower margin U.K./Australia business. Although they remain profitable our U.K./Australia business has experienced another year of reduced profits.  Our consolidated SG&A for the year decreased $136 million and came in at 18.3% of net sales compared to 20.6% a year ago. The margin reduction was primarily driven by our global cost reduction efforts, elimination of our spirits SG&A with the sale of the Value spirits business and lower marketing expense. Consolidated operating income decreased 7% to $560 million and operating margin remained essentially flat at 16.6%. From a margin perspective, our storage shift of SG&A spend effectively offset the reduction in our gross profit margin for the year.  I would now like to turn to our segment operating income results on page 13 of the release to provide highlights of our full-year operating income change. Wine segment operating income decreased $37 million to $655 million. The decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of the value spirit business, decreases in U.S. branded wine sales and a decrease in U.K./Australia gross margin due to negative mix and higher grade costs for Australian wine, partially offset by savings from our global cost reduction initiatives.  For the year, corporate and other expenses totaled $95 million versus $87 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher stock based compensation expense and costs related to Project Fusion, our multi-year program designed to strengthen our global business systems and processes.  Consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $239 million versus $270 million last year. Equity earnings include $222 million from Crown. For the year, Crown generated net sales of $2.3 billion, a decrease of 6% and operating income of $444 million, a decrease of 12%. Economic challenges have impacted the entire beer industry driving lower volumes and consumer movement to lower priced beer. Operating income for Crown was impacted by the lower volume, negative mix and a contractual cost increase.  Interest expense for the year was $265 million, down 18% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by our significant debt reduction actions during the past 12 months. Now let’s take a look at our debt position. At the end of February our debt totaled $3.8 billion which represented a $600 million decrease from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2009. The decrease primarily reflects proceeds received from the sale of Value Spirits and Cider businesses combined with our strong free cash flow generation.  Our average interest rate for the year was a little bit above 6%. Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of fiscal 2010 was 4.0 versus a 4.3 ratio at the end of 2009. Our strong free cash flow, reduced leverage and improved credit profile positioned us to take advantage of improved credit markets and complete certain refinancing activity during the fourth quarter.  Let me summarize these actions. These activities included the amendment of our senior credit facility to extend $650 million of our revolver from June 2011 to June 2013. In addition, $192 million of pre-existing revolver remains in place at historical pricing through June 2011. We also extended the maturity of $300 million of our $1.2 billion term loan from June 2013 to June 2015.  The margin applicable to the extended revolver facility and term loan increased by 125 basis points. In addition, we redeemed our $250 million 8.125% subnotes that were due in January 2012 without any penalty. I am quite pleased with the results. We were able to maintain a low cost of capital, extend the term of our facilities, maintain appropriate financial flexibility, improve our covenants and reduce overall interest expense.  Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 30% which reflects the favorable outcome of tax items from various jurisdictions. Favorable tax outcomes during the fourth quarter helped drive a negative 11% tax rate for Q4.  Looking a little closer at Q4 results, favorable tax rate helped offset the financial impact of soft Q4 net sales performance. For the fourth quarter organic constant currency net sales decreased 2%. Branded wine organic constant currency net sales decreased 6% versus the prior year quarter. This included a 12% decrease in North America, a 23% increase in Europe and flat performance in Australia/New Zealand. The increase in Europe was primarily due to volume growth and favorable comparisons versus the disappointing fourth quarter last year. The decrease in North America reflects the impact of working with U.S. distributors to lower their inventory levels in Q4 as discussed by Rob earlier. Lower sales in North America drove a $22 million decrease in wine segment operating income. The lower sales in North America coupled with high growth in the U.K. drove negative mix and a 140 basis point gross margin decrease and reduced operating leverage as SG&A as a percent of net sales increased 220 basis points. During the fourth quarter and in conjunction with our annual impairment testing the company reported $103 million non-cash impairment charges primarily related to trademark assets for the Australian business.  Now let’s turn to cash flow on page 13 of the news release. For purposes of this discussion free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For fiscal 2010 we generated free cash flow of $295 million, exceeding the high end of our most recent guidance range but less than the $378 million produced in the prior year. While there are various year-over-year fluctuations in the cash flow details, the lower FY10 cash generation is due in part to a $65 million tax payment related to the sale of the Value Spirits business.  Working capital benefited from inventory reductions from lower grape harvest costs in Australia and New Zealand and CapEx came in at $108 million versus $129 million in the prior year. As a reminder, free cash flow for fiscal 2009 reflected a benefit of approximately $55 million in after-tax proceeds related to the favorable settlement of certain foreign currency hedges.  For fiscal 2011, we are targeting free cash flow to be in a range of $350-400 million. This includes CapEx in a range of $110-130 million. The targeted improvement in free cash flow versus 2010 is expected to be driven in part by anticipated lower tax payments, lower interest and lower restructuring activity versus the prior year.  In March 2010 we received $60 million from Sazerac as they paid off a note receivable related to the purchase of our Value Spirits business. This cash benefit will be included in the “Investing” section of the FY11 cash statement and therefore it is not included in our free cash flow estimates. Due to our continued strong free cash flow generation and successful de-leveraging and refinancing efforts, we believe we can redeploy a portion of free cash flow to repurchase stock while we continue to reduce debt. In connection with this strategy, the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the company’s stock. Our intent is to implement an accelerated share buyback transaction when appropriate.  Now let’s move to our P&L outlook for the full-year. Given the uncertain global economic conditions, we are forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in a range of $1.53 to $1.68 for fiscal 2011. Our reported sales will be unfavorably impacted by the divestiture of our U.K. Cider business which contributed about $100 million in net sales for fiscal 2010. On an organic constant currency basis, we are targeting flattish net sales for fiscal 2011. On a consolidated basis, we expect operating income to be down slightly due to the impact of divested businesses and continuing profit pressures for Australian and U.K. operations.  Crown volumes are expected to be flat to down low single digits due to continued impacts from the economy. Negative mix and a planned small contractual cost increase are also expected to impact Crown costs. As a result, we are targeting equity earnings for Crown to be down mid single digits from fiscal 2010. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $210-220 million. The healthy improvement is being driven by our significant debt reduction, the prepayment of the 8.125% subnotes with the lower cost revolver fund and the roll off of unfavorable interest rate hedges at the end of fiscal 2010. The comparable basis tax rate is expected to increase to 35%. We are assuming weighted average diluted shares to increase to approximately 224 million. These items will essentially offset the benefit of lower interest expense.  Looking at Q1 fiscal 2011 we expect results to be impacted by higher marketing expense at Crown Imports versus the prior year first quarter as it ramps up on the marketing activities that Rob highlighted in his comments. Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition related integration costs, restructuring charges and unusual items which are detailed on page 19 of the news release. It also excludes any impacts from the share repurchase program.  We expect the share buyback to be accretive to EPS and we will update our full-year guidance when the transaction is completed. For fiscal 2011 we expect to incur diluted EPS charges of about $0.17 for restructuring and other one-time charges related to the previously announced cost reduction initiatives and our continued efforts to increase efficiencies and increase ROIC.  Before we take your questions I would like to reiterate that over the long-term we are focused on working the leverage to benefit of our new U.S. business structure and distributor consolidation initiatives in increasing operational and cost efficiencies to drive improvement in our organic business model and ROIC. In addition, we plan to use free cash flow to further reduce debt and interest expense and at the same time return cash to shareholders in the form of a share repurchase.  With that, we are happy to take your questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Lauren Torres – HSBC. 
Lauren Torres - HSBC: A question on the branded wine performance in the quarter and expectations as we think about this year in North America. With respect to the U.S. distributor inventory level reductions, you said this in your comments but what phase are we? How much more is there to go on that? With trends it seems you are rather optimistic about how the U.S. consumer is behaving and I guess I am referring here to wine once again. I don’t know if other data you have with respect to different price points how things have changed since the last quarter and really how do you see this category developing as we start to think about the year? 
Robert Sands :  As to your first question, the inventory reduction that occurred in the fourth quarter is complete. That was not something we expected to carry over so it was pretty much a one-time activity that we finished up as I said, both started and finished it in the fourth quarter.  As to your second question on the wine industry in the United States, I would say calendar year 2010 we are actually looking for about similar growth rates overall in all channels to calendar year 2009. In 2009 the wine business was probably flat to up slightly and in 2010 we are not projecting anything much different than that. Again, probably flat to maybe up 1% and I would like to emphasize that is in all channels meaning on-premise and off-premise and within off-premise the grocery channel, the mass merchandise channel and the club channel.  In general, as I said, pretty similar trends this year versus last year. 
Lauren Torres - HSBC: I think we are hearing from companies with respect to the consumer getting a bit stronger and certain channels improving be it in beer or wine. You are really not kind of getting there yet with those types of growth rates again? 
Robert Sands :  I would say we are actually fairly cautious on projecting big improvements in calendar year 2010. I would just say until we really start seeing some significant improvement in unemployment we really don’t expect trends to change significantly. I would say the industry is fundamentally healthy given the economic trends I think being flat to up slightly is pretty good. But we do see a continuation of the negative trends in the on-premise channel in particular which is offsetting gains in the off-premise. We see pretty good and healthy trends in the IRI channel of grocery and we probably see the strongest trends in the mass merchandise and club channel which are not reflected in IRI. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.
Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Kind of continuing on the outlook for the categories, a number of restaurants have made comments about sort of return traffic and you just pretty clearly reasserted a negative trend in on –premise. Do you think that is the price points you are occupying on-premise? How would we think about that if in fact there is some reacceleration in traffic? 
Robert Sands :  First of all I was talking about the industry in general, not our on-premise business. Some restaurant chains have been reporting some improved traffic but I think overall we don’t really see huge improvements from an industry perspective in on-premise at the current time. I think to the extent that some restaurant chains are reporting more positive trends it may be they are going to be down a little bit less but there is still a lot of restaurant closures occurring that are offsetting any positive trends.  There is definitely if you look at who is projecting anything that you could call positive it is really sort of the value end of the restaurant chain business. Obviously some restaurant chains may be reporting they are more optimistic going into this year but overall we don’t see a big change in the on-premise as we move into 2010. If the economy improves and unemployment abates that may change but at the moment I would say there are pretty significant trends of people staying at home, eating at home and not going out as much. We don’t see that consumer behavior changing dramatically right now. 
Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Taking it from a macro perspective you are talking about mirroring a flat to slightly up wine industry. You are talking about cost reductions that have come through. We are not factoring in share repurchase, lower interest expense, why are you actually looking at a down EPS forecast for your guidance if in fact those other three factors are true? 
Robert Ryder :  If you just do the rough math I think what we said is we expect Crown to be down mid single digits. We expect some pressures to continue on our international business so we probably expect EBIT to be down there. Although interest expense is coming down pretty dramatically it is pretty much offset by an increase in tax rate and an increase in share count. So kind of rough math, if you looked at the numbers we gave you, EBIT is down a little bit and everything else kind of offsets. That is why we are down $0.09 if you use the midpoint for FY11 of $1.60 versus the $1.69 this year in FY10. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Reza Vahabzadeh – Barclays Capital. 
Reza Vahabzadeh – Barclays Capital : How do you anticipate being able to complete the share buyback on an accelerated basis and still reduce debt or leverage for that matter? 
Robert Sands :  I will answer that one. The board authorized $300 million of share buyback and I think if you look at the midpoint of the free cash flow guidance we gave which was $350-400 million, that midpoint is above the $300 million. So we have used the cash flow above the approved share buyback to pay down debt. 
Reza Vahabzadeh – Barclays Capital : Would you anticipate actual leverage to stay the same or improve as well for FY11? 
Robert Sands :  If you are talking about EBITDA leverage ratio it will essentially be flat. Remember also we received $60 million for our Sazerac note which although it doesn’t hit free cash flow it does reduce debt in FY11 because we received it in our first month of the new fiscal year. Our leverage ratio will essentially be flattish. 
Reza Vahabzadeh – Barclays Capital : So you anticipate basically completing the share buyback in FY11? 
Robert Sands :  Yes. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Lindsey Druckerman – Goldman Sachs. 
Lindsey Druckerman – Goldman Sachs: I was hoping to dig down a little bit on the inventory reduction issue. If I take the sales impact you disclosed it looks like 10% plus of a drag on your North America branded wine sales and considering it was only in 60% of your territories it looks like a pretty sizeable missed forecast I guess in those markets of distributors buying too much in the third quarter. I guess maybe could you talk to first of all is that rationale the right way to think about it and where was the forecasting misstep? What fell short of your expectations to drive that? 
Robert Sands :  First of all, I wouldn’t characterize it quite that way. It is pretty much as we have said all throughout the year. We put inventory in the second quarter in anticipation of our consolidation efforts where we normally put it into the third quarter. Third quarter I would say due to economic conditions consumer takeaway was a bit less than we anticipated and therefore inventory levels ended up a bit higher than we anticipated. Then of course in the fourth quarter we felt that we had the room to adjust and we did take advantage of that and we reduced significantly distributor inventories during that period in a number of markets but primarily in that 60% as you indicated.  I wouldn’t call it a forecasting issue as you suggested. In fact, we decided that as long as we were going to get some benefit out of taking inventory levels down in the fourth quarter then it was in our best interest and we did get some benefit in that we negotiated some additional investment from the distributors behind our brands in exchange for the inventory reduction. In general, I would also point out our inventories at distributors are not particularly high from an industry perspective. They run somewhere even currently in the 60-90 day range which I would say is consistent with distributor inventories as a general proposition across the United States and significantly below many suppliers.  It was really all about the fact that we thought in the fourth quarter we thought there was an opportunity to do something that we thought was best for our distributors in exchange for more investment behind our brands to drive results in the future. That is really what went on. 
Lindsey Druckerman – Goldman Sachs: Could you comment on the large California grape harvest in 2009 and what the implications might be for your business as we go through the year? 
Robert Sands :  Sure. Number one it was a large harvest in 2009. I think it was the second largest harvest in history. That said, the supply situation in California is pretty well balanced at the current time. As we went into this harvest from the previous harvest I would say the industry was tipped on the side of under supply. As we went into this harvest although it was a big harvest it was primarily large in what we call the North Central Valley and that is where most of the… let me put it this way, other than the North Central Valley the crop was pretty average in size and in some cases even smaller.  That said, bulk wine supplies even in North Central Valley type products were pretty low as we went into this harvest. Therefore when all is said and done and given the fact we are probably tipping towards under supply and therefore shortages especially in some of the key varieties like Chardonnay which continues to grow pretty heavily I would say that even though the crop was big we still end up in a fairly balanced state as we go forward. I definitely wouldn’t characterize it as over supply. If anything it was under supply and moved more towards balance. 
Lindsey Druckerman – Goldman Sachs: Lastly, if you could help us out given all the lumpiness and noise in the wine business quarter-to-quarter last year just understanding the timing of your quarterly results as you lap the distributor transition? 
Robert Ryder :  FY10 or FY11? 
Lindsey Druckerman – Goldman Sachs: This year, as we forecast 2011. 
Robert Ryder :  We don’t really talk about quarterly guidance. The one thing we did say as some of you may have noticed as you were watching Major League Baseball you will see some new Corona commercials. The way the accounting works on that you will see some front-loaded expense because the commercial flights happened. So we wanted to give you a bit of a heads up so there wouldn’t be a surprise for Q1 and it is just marketing expense timing. Beyond that we really don’t get involved in giving quarterly guidance. 
Lindsey Druckerman – Goldman Sachs: But just to clarify from the shipment timing, Q2 is a tough comp for wine. Q3 is an easy comp and then Q4 is an easy comp? 
Robert Ryder :  From a shipment perspective, this year we were kind of combined Q2 and Q3 because it was kind of a movement from Q3 to Q2 as you said and Q4 because we kind of hold back a little bit on shipments which we spoke of there should be lower sales than next year. You have it pretty right. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Carla Casella – JP Morgan. 
Carla Casella – JP Morgan : I wonder if you could comment on the spirits. Are you seeing any pickup in competition with Diageo’s launch of the comparably priced vodka (inaudible)? 
Robert Sands :  They are apparently, it hasn’t occurred yet and it remains to be seen whether they do in fact launch it, but they claim they are launching a comparably priced product called (inaudible) and I think that is really sort of indicative of the fact that our product is extremely successful. It is growing very rapidly. There is actually a lot of imitators out there in the market and a lot of vodkas that are priced in that category. One more I would say really doesn’t matter much. It doesn’t really particularly concern us. We have always got our eye on competition and that is why we have initiated the new advertising campaign with regard to SVEDKA. It is on TV this year and we are doing a lot of things to continue to build the strength of what already is a very, very strong brand.  I would say imitation is the strongest form of flattery. That is about as much as I would say about it. One more vodka priced at that price point as I said doesn’t particularly concern us. We see great momentum behind SVEDKA as we have ended our fiscal 2010 and we see great momentum behind it as we enter 2011. We really are seeing no slow down at all in the momentum behind the brand. The consumer is deciding what they want and SVEDKA is clearly meeting all consumer needs in that particular category at the time.  I am sure not only will Diageo have a product but I think there will be other products and if anything it will grow that drink segment in the category overall as people pour more money into this mid priced vodka category. So it could actually be very favorable to us to have more entrants into the category. As I said, there is already a lot and there always has been a lot of vodka priced in that price range. It is not something that concerns us. 
Carla Casella – JP Morgan : On the inventory at the distributors, you mentioned there was a $60 million to $70 million hit on the fourth quarter sales but the inventory at the distributor level remained somewhat high. Could we see a similar hit to first quarter? 
Robert Sands :  No. We anticipate no inventory reduction in the first quarter. In fact we are not anticipating any further actions of this nature at this time. It was exclusively related to the fourth quarter. 
Carla Casella – JP Morgan : So then how long do you think it will take for the excess inventory that is in the trade now to work its way back down to normal levels? 
Robert Sands :  Inventory levels in the trade now are at normalized levels as a general proposition so we don’t anticipate it impacting us at all. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus. 
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: I may have missed this. If you could give us a CapEx number for this fiscal year? 
Robert Ryder :  110-130. 
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: On the share repo, as much as $300 million accelerated, what is a good estimate on borrowing costs on that? 
Robert Ryder :  That is kind of a theoretical question and you have all the data. What we said was our average cost of borrowing last year was around 6%. But our revolver is in two pieces, it’s LIBOR plus 1.25 or LIBOR plus 2.50. As we have said, we are not using all free cash flow to buy back stock. We are also de-leveraging. If you want to use the incremental revolver rate, the overall average interest rate, if you want to take your own shot at the forward curve the cost of debt, so between 3-7%.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Sounds like it is closer to the 3. 
Robert Ryder :  On an incremental basis, you are calculating a free share dilution in the short-term. I think you can assume the average revolver rate. 
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: There was something you just said not following why distributor inventories being higher than fiscal 2009 levels at the end of fiscal 2010 why that is not something you would expect to go down in fiscal 2011. Can you also give us some idea of just how significant that delta is versus end of fiscal 2009? 
Robert Sands :  We don’t expect it to go down simply because we don’t expect to deplete more than we shipped. So we expect inventory levels to be fairly stable in 2010 and to remain in this 60-90 days on an average basis amongst our distributors which as I also said, I would say is equivalent to distributor’s inventory in general for all suppliers. So it isn’t particularly high.  What was the second part of your question? 
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: How much higher end of fiscal 2010 are they versus end of fiscal 2009? 
Robert Sands :  Maybe 5-10 days. 
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Continuing on the line of discussion trends by channel we have heard about, can you give us some more color on price point for your North America wine business? Give us more color on how different levels of price point are performing at the depletion level? 
Robert Sands :  Sure. I think looking at the industry I think we will continue to see continued trading up in the industry with the higher price points growing at a faster rate than the lower price points. Right now we do see some acceleration in the everyday wine up to $5. I would expect that to continue as well. Last year they went from being in decline to some pretty significant growth.  That said, there was also some pretty big pricing taken in the under $5 category and I would expect perhaps that to slow down that growth a bit as we go into this year. Now despite the fact we also see sort of continued positive mix shift and higher priced categories growing at a faster rate, in general the lower price categories are still within category I would say seems to be some tendency to go to the lower end of categories and there is still quite a bit of discounting going on, which is driving the fact that some of the categories like the luxury categories $15-20, why that category is growing and continues to grow nicely. Because you have some of the above $20 discounting into that category which is driving the category growth.  It is kind of a good news/bad news kind of a thing. Good news is consumers are continuing to trade up as a general proposition in wine. The bad news is that is being fueled by some fairly heavy discounting of more expensive wines. So that negatively impacts margin at the higher price points. As I said, it is kind of a good news/bad news kind of story. Overall things are pretty healthy. Overall there will be some growth we anticipate in the industry overall. Overall we do expect some positive mix shift for the industry and then on the negative side is that mix shift could be offset by some continued heavy discounting in the marketplace.  That is kind of where things shake out. 
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: That price increase on the $5 and under it sounds like that actually could benefit a large portion of your portfolio making your $6-10 wines, narrowing that gap. Is that in fact proving to be beneficial or do you expect it to be of significant benefit to some of your wines in that price area? 
Robert Sands :  Maybe. That is a theory. We will see what happens this year. As far as our wines in that price point right about $5 we actually are seeing some pretty good results. We see with Woodbridge some positive trends. That is good. Rex Goliath which is a brand that we have positioned and put some effort behind we are seeing gigantic growth in it. Very high double digits. In general I would say just above the $5 price point range is pretty healthy for us. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Kevin Dryer [ph] - Cavelli & Company. [ph] 
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company: I just wanted to ask similar to previous questions but it seems like there is a little bit of a disconnect. Basically you did $1.69 for the year but the tax benefit if you normalize the tax rate at 35% I get that $1.57. But that’s including $0.07 to $0.09 hit from the reduction in distributor inventories which you say won’t be recurring, so granted I know you said the Modelo or the Crown business would be down a little bit but given modest growth in the wine business and reduction of interest expense why would you be down from that $1.57 with a normalized tax rate? 
Robert Ryder :  You are right. We are kind of double counting some things and not others. So you are correct. If you equalize the tax rate for this year you are at $1.57. But then you wouldn’t touch next year’s tax rate because we are using 35% in both years. So the way I look at it is EBIT is going to be down slightly because we sold [ph] our Crown international line and you remember we sold the Cider business which although it didn’t have very high margins it did have positive EBIT. Then we said year-over-year if you have already done it, if you take taxes, interest and shares into account they all sort of kind of offset each other.  So you can think about EBIT year-over-year is losing about $0.09 per share and that is the $1.69 to the $1.60. 
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company:  Then in terms of the accelerated share repurchase, what would be the trigger for you potentially actually implementing that? You said whenever conditions are right or something like that. 
Robert Ryder :  We have chosen a banker to help us execute this transaction. Between the two of us, we will decide when we want to go into the market. We want to make sure we are not hurting ourselves. Plus the window isn’t open until this call is over. So I would expect it to be towards the early half of the year versus the latter half of the year. 
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company:  What is the reason for not including that, that is going to be incremental in the guidance right? 
Robert Ryder :  What we wanted to do was kind of keep, because as you guys tell me often, we are a bit of a difficult stock to cover because we kind of have a lot of things that we report and talk about. We want to keep it as true and as organic as possible. We didn’t want to seem disingenuous, kind of taking credit for the stock buyback in next year’s guidance because I kind of look at it differently. What we decided to do was do as much apples-to-apples as possible, give you the data on the stock buyback and when we complete the program it will all be very visible to you. So then we will come out and update our guidance. 
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company:  In terms of the share creep that is just from old options or new issuances around the end of the year or something like that? 
Robert Ryder :  The shares goes up. If the stock prices goes up it drives additional dilution and as we ramp new options in the New Year that also drives additional dilution. 
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company:  To be clear, so the $60 million from Sazerac that is in the 350-400 number for free cash flow? 
Robert Ryder :  That is correct. It is below free cash flow. It is a financing activity. I tried to make that clear in the script (inaudible) 350 to 400.
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company:  Any update on the lawsuit with Modelo regarding Crown? 
Robert Sands :  Not really. No update. That is proceeding as one would expect. These things tend to move slow. I would reiterate it is really a generally immaterial thing. We did file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. We are ultimately awaiting the results of that motion to dismiss. Clearly we would be hopeful on that but these things are somewhat unpredictable. 
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company:  Okay, thanks.
Operator: Please carry on with your closing remarks.
Robert Sands: Thank you everyone for joining our call today. As I indicated I am pleased with the progress that we have made throughout the past year particularly with our strong free cash flow generation, our significant debt reduction and our operational improvements. I certainly believe we are well positioned for success in the future and have initiatives underway in fiscal 2011 that will help us to achieve our longer term strategic objectives.  We will be participating in investor conferences and road shows throughout most of May so we will look forward to seeing many of you while we are on the road. Again, thank you for your participation. 
Operator:  This concludes today’s Constellation Brands fiscal year 2010 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands third quarter 2010 earnings call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Patty Yahn-Urlaub:  Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to Constellation’s third quarter 2010 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC.   During the call, we will discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com under the Investors section.   Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. Although statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company’s estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings.   And now I would like to turn the call over to Rob.  
Robert Sands: Thanks Patty. Good morning everybody and Happy New Year. I hope that everybody had a great holiday season. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation’s third quarter fiscal 2010 sales and earnings results. Before we get started I would like to thank those of you who attended our recent New York City Investor Meeting. I hope one of your key take aways from that meeting is that Constellation is evolving as a fundamentally different company that is better positioned than ever to deliver value.  We are focused on executing a strategy into the foreseeable future that delivers this value through organic growth, enhanced profitability, free cash flow and ROIC. The third quarter is evidence of the fact we continue to make progress against our strategic goals of generating cash, paying down debt and reducing costs. During the quarter we advanced our portfolio transformation with the announcement of our agreement to sell our U.K. cider business to C&C Group for approximately $70 million.  The Gaymer Cider Company was originally acquired in 1998 with the Massey Clark business. This transaction is consistent with our strategic focus on premium, higher growth, higher margin wine, beer and spirits brands. The deal is on track to close by mid-January and we expect to use the proceeds to further reduce our borrowings.  During the quarter we also progressed with transition activities associated with our US distributor consolidation effort which now encompasses 22 states representing approximately 60% of our total US wine and spirits volume. As you know, the initial distributor transition commenced September 1st with the second quarter benefiting from the implementation of this program. At that time, actions were taken to ensure maximum levels of customer service between distributor and the retail customers during the transition period.  Now these actions had the planned effect of moving a portion of third quarter sales into the second quarter and resulted in some inventory build at the distributors. During the third quarter consumer take away was softer than expected at the beginning of the quarter but it is improving as our new selling model and promotional efforts take effect. As a result, at the end of the third quarter distributor inventories were higher than historically targeted levels. However, as you can see from the latest IRI data through December our US wine trends have improved from where they were early in the third quarter as our promotional activities have returned to more normal levels.  From an overall marketplace perspective, in the IRI channel growth in the US wine market remains healthy at about 4% on a dollar basis according to recent 12-week data with the greater than $8 price segment growing in the high single digit range. The on-premise channel remains challenging although we believe it is stabilizing and the mass merchandise club channel is outperforming the food and drug channels.  Despite the fact that many of our planned promotional activities were not implemented until late in the quarter many of our leading, well known brands continue to perform well in the marketplace throughout the third quarter including Robert Mondavi’s Private Selection and brands like [Goliath] and Kim Crawford. And we recently received some noteworthy portfolio awards. Two of our wines were selected to be served at President Barack Obama’s prestigious Nobel Prize banquet in Oslo and included the 2003 Inniskillin Gold oak aged Vidal Icewine and the 2005 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.  In addition, Wine.com recently released their top brand list for 2009 showcasing the top wines sold through their website. Five Constellation wines made that list. Five made that list including Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, [Shimi], Hogue and Clos du Bois.  Our third quarter spirits net sales results are not representative of strong underlying performance because SVEDKA Vodka shipments this quarter are being compared against last year’s third quarter which was impacted by some unique circumstances. Glass shortages related to new bottling changes for SVEDKA in last year’s second quarter drove strong shipments in last year’s third quarter creating the difficult comparison.  Despite this issue, SVEDKA posted another strong quarter of double digit depletion growth with our year-to-date net sales increasing more than 40%. We continue to build SVEDKA’s on premise brand awareness by leveraging new distributor roots to market. We are growing our national accounts in on and off-premise channels and are expanding in other core markets outside the US.  Moving to the Canadian wine business, the overall business continues to be impacted by economically driven negative mix trends. However, positive sales results were recorded by Naked Grape during the quarter which is one of the leading premium brands in our wine portfolio. As you know, Vincor is a sponsor of the upcoming Winter Olympic Games scheduled for mid-February in Vancouver. We expect to fully capitalize on the brand building opportunities we have planned in connection with this event.  Now moving to our international businesses. The challenges impacting the operating environment in Australia and the U.K. have not subsided. However, as you know we continue to execute the previously announced restructuring of our businesses in these geographies in order to align them with the reality of their respective markets. This includes continuing to focus on cost reductions, decreasing network and capital investment and consolidating our overall footprint in these markets in order to increase efficiencies.  In the short term, we are optimistic about our marketplace performance especially in the U.K. during the holiday selling season. In early November we announced we were working towards the potential combination of portions of our U.K. and Australian operations with Australian Vintage Limited in an effort improve the prospect of these businesses going forward. I have nothing new to report at this time as we continue working to bring this transaction to a successful conclusion.  Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture, as you know we recently received notice of legal action by Modello pertaining to the funding of the JV partners of an immaterial amount of incremental promotional and marketing dollars for the upcoming calendar year 2010. Previously Modello provided this incremental spending and had agreed to do so once again for the 2010 business plan year. My point in addressing this issue is to remind everyone that the Crown joint venture is not a party to this legal action. Crown’s 2010 business plan has already been agreed upon by Modello and Constellation and the JV will go forward with a focus on growing the business through the entire term of this contract.  We intend to continue working closely with Crown to support the joint venture as it continues to operate its business and deliver products in a manner designed to meet or exceed the expectations of consumers, distributor and retail customers.  Now moving to Crown’s operational results for the third quarter, during the quarter sales and operating income for the Crown joint venture continued to be impacted by economically driven challenges in the on-premise and convenience store channels. Operating income in particular was unfavorably impacted not only by the volume decline but by the timing of national media programming for Major League Baseball and the National Football League that occurred in the third quarter. However, depletion trends outpaced shipments in the quarter due in part to the favorable impact of these media programs and resulted in temporary wholesaler inventory reductions.  Crown is also realizing stabilizing trends and import category share gain in the grocery channel where it is performing in line with the US Beer industry and outperforming the imported beer category. We believe this is a result of targeted marketing efforts and programming against its key channel. Recent IRI data coinciding with the end of our third quarter confirms improved performance across the Crown portfolio.  For fiscal 2010 we continue to estimate a decrease in Crown depletions in the mid single digit range with profits expected to decline in the high single digit range. What gives us confidence we can achieve these goals? Crown continues to execute well at retail with solid promotional activity, marketing programs and the rollout of new products and packaging. Expanded distribution has helped to increase selection, retail impact and price point options for consumers. These efforts have resulted in over 60,000 new points of distribution since August 1st.  We continue to expand the rollout of Modello Especial and Negro Modello Draft in key markets throughout the US. Modello Especial, the number three import in the US, continues to be one of the few super premium brands experiencing double digit market growth.  Before I turn the call over to Bob many of you have seen the press release we issued earlier this week mentioning that Jose Fernandez, who was our CEO for Constellation Wines North America, has passed away after a courageous battle with cancer. He was a great leader who will be missed by everyone across our organization. As you know, Jay Wright, President of our North American Wine Organization who many of you met at our recent New York investor meeting will continue to lead the business as we have cultivated strong management continuity in the face of Jose’s passing.  In closing, despite the impact from the US distributor consolidation activities on this quarter’s results, we feel confident regarding our ability to harvest the ultimate benefits from the execution from the strategic initiative of profitable organic growth. As I have indicated, this transition may not be particularly smooth as you have seen from our performance in both the second and third quarters. However, we believe it is absolutely the right strategy to pursue for the long-term growth and profitability of our business.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Robert Ryder for a financial discussion of our third quarter business results. Bob? 
Robert Ryder :  Thanks Rob. Good morning everyone. Our Q3 comparable EPS came in at $0.54 versus $0.60 in the previous year. The quarter witnessed quite a few unfavorable timing impacts across most product categories.  US wine was impacted by the shift of sales from Q3 to Q2. Spirit sales growth was impacted by a previous year glass shortage for SVEDKA and Crown’s profits were impacted by unfavorable sales timing and marketing expense timing in the quarter. In addition to these quarterly timing-related items, North American wine depletion did not begin to improve until late in the quarter, our international business continued to experience gross margin pressures and Crown’s beer business continued to be impacted by the economy.  We believe the negative timing events will correct themselves this year and we also believe we have strategies in place to improve the more fundamental challenges facing the business. We have continued taking steps to strengthen our organic business model and we are seeing good progress in a number of areas. As we continue to reduce costs which has helped offset the impact of consumer shifts to lower margin products in this challenging economic environment, focus on generating free cash flow as we are targeting to be in the high end of our full-year free cash flow guidance range, reduce debt and interest expense and work with our consolidated distributor base in the US to drive improvement in our organic sales and mix trends.  We saw good promotion and displays for our brands during the holiday season and began to see some improving depletion and marketplace trends in US wine and beer as the quarter progressed. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter was 35%. We also project a full year rate of approximately 35% versus our previous targeted full-year rate of 38%. The Q3 rate drove about $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS favorability in the quarter when looked at in relation to the previous full-year tax rate projection of 38%.  Now let’s look at our Q3 P&L performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Let’s go to the net sales line. As you can see from our news release on page 13, our consolidated reported net sales decreased 4% primarily due to the divestiture of our Value Spirits business partially offset by the positive impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations.  On an organic constant currency basis which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and forex, net sales were even with the prior year. My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Our worldwide branded wine organic net sales which appear on page 12 of the release were even versus last year. This included a 3% decrease for North America offset by an increase of 12% in Europe and 2% in Australia and New Zealand.  North American sales were impacted by continuing economic challenges, higher levels of promotional spending and the shift of sales from the second quarter to the third quarter as part of the US distributor transition activities. We estimate this shift represented approximately $40-50 million in net sales and about $0.05 to $0.07 of EPS.  For Europe sales benefited from increased volumes for our value priced product offerings in the U.K. and an easier comparison versus Q3 last year. Spirits organic net sales decreased 2% for the quarter. Rob has already discussed the difficult comparison item we faced in the quarter.  Now let’s look at our profits on a comparable basis using information on page 14 of the release. For Q3 our consolidated gross margin was 35.4% versus 40% in the prior-year quarter. This reflects lower sales driven by the shift of US sales from Q3 to Q2, higher promotion costs in the US, higher Australian COGS due to the flow through of the more expensive calendar 2008 harvest and negative sales mix in the U.K. and Australia. On a year-to-date basis gross margins are down 2.3 percentage points, much less than the Q3 figure, again reflecting the many unfavorable timing aspects of Q3.  The higher promotion costs in the US represented a proactive effort to shift more promotion dollars into the second half of the year as we transition to our new distributor partners. Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 16.1% of net sales compared to 18.8% a year ago. The reduction was primarily driven by our global initiatives, lower marketing expense and the elimination of our spirit SG&A commensurate with the sale of the Value Spirits business.  Consolidated operating income decreased 13% to $190 million and operating margin decreased 1.9 percentage points to 19.3%. Given some of the shifts between Q2 and Q3 that I have discussed it is important to look at our Q3 year-to-date operating margin of 18.1% which is up 1.1 percentage points versus Q3 year-to-date last year. Our appropriate stewardship of SG&A spend more than offset the reduction in our gross profit margin on a year-to-date basis.  I would like now to turn to our segment operating income results on page 11 of the release to provide highlights of our Q3 operating income change. Wine segment operating income decreased $22 million to $218 million. The decrease was primarily due to the Q2 sales shift, higher promotion costs in the US, divestiture of the value spirits business and the decrease in international business profit margins due to negative mix and higher grade costs for our Australian wine. These items were partially offset by savings from our SG&A reduction initiatives.  For the quarter corporate and other expenses totaled $28 million versus $22 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by costs related to project fusion, our multi-year program designed to strengthen our global business system and processes as well as our efforts to improve our U.K. and Australian businesses including the possibility of combining portions of these businesses with Australian Vintage Limited.  On page 14 you can see consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $60 million versus $76 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $46 million versus $62 million. The remainder of equity earnings in Q3 fiscal 2010 and Q3 fiscal 2009 are primarily generated by Opus One.  For the third quarter Crown generated net sales of $499 million, a decrease of 10% and operating income of $91 million, a decrease of 26%. Economic challenges continued to drive soft performance in the convenience and on-premise channel and consumer movement to lower price beer. Q3 witnessed an unfavorable sales timing which we expect to reverse in Q4 as depletion trends improve and outpace shipments during the quarter.  Crown continues to execute on its targeted promotional marketing support and new package introductions to drive share improvement in the grocery channel import category. Operating income for Crown was impacted by lower net sales, marketing expense timing related to national media for Corona Extra and Corona Light and a contractual cost increase.  Interest expense for the quarter was $64 million, down 18% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by our significant debt reduction actions during the last 12 months.  Let’s take a look at our debt position. At the end of November our debt totaled $4.1 billion which represents a $336 million decrease from our debt level at the end of 2009. The decrease primarily reflects the proceeds received from the sale of the Value Spirits business and positive free cash flow. Our average interest rate for the quarter was around 6.2%. Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of November was 4.2 times versus 4.3 times at the end of fiscal 2009. Proceeds from the pending sale of our U.K. Cider business combined with targeted free cash flow generation in Q4 should reduce this ratio to the high 3 times range by the end of fiscal 2010.  We feel that our strong cash flow, reduced leverage, improved credit profile and much improved credit markets make this quarter and appropriate time to offer to extend our revolving credit facility. We will most likely initiate this process in the very near term.  Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 35% which reflects the favorable outcome of various tax items. The rate for Q3 fiscal 2009 was 39%. As mentioned earlier, we now project our full-year comparable basis tax rate to approximate 35% which is much improved versus the previous guidance of 38%.  Now let’s turn to cash flow on page 10 of the news release. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the nine months of fiscal 2010 we generated free cash flow of $100 million versus $235 million in the prior year. The lower cash generation is due primarily to higher taxes paid including approximately $65 million related to the sale of the Value Spirits business.  In addition, timing of sales in the quarter resulted in higher US receivable balances. This higher receivable balance more than offset by inventory reductions and lower fiscal 2010 grape harvest costs in Australia, New Zealand and the US versus the prior year and less interest paid. As a reminder, free cash flow for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 reflected a benefit of approximately $85 million in pre-tax proceeds related to the favorable settlement of certain foreign currency hedges.  For fiscal 2010 we now expect CapEx to be in a range of $130-150 million versus our previous $150-170 million projection. The reduction in planned CapEx spending is contributing to free cash flow targeted at the upper end of our $230-270 million guidance range.  Moving to our P&L outlook for full year fiscal 2010, we still expect comparable basis EPS to be in a range of $1.60 to $1.70 with reduced full-year expected tax rate of approximately 35%. Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition related integration costs, restructuring charges and unusual items which are detailed on page 17.  During Q3 we recognized approximately $60 million of impairment and other charges related to Rufino, an Italian wine company in which we have a 40% ownership interest. This includes a $25 million non-cash impairment for this equity method investment as the financial performance of this business continues to decline due in part to the strengthening of the Euro versus the US dollar. In addition a $45 million charge was reported as a 10% shareholder of Rufino gave notice of its intent to exercise a put option to Constellation at a contracted option price determined at the 2004 acquisition date. This put essentially represents the deferred purchase price from the 2004 investment that we expect to pay in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.  Before we take your questions I would like to note we are working to leverage the benefits of our distributor consolidation initiative and leverage our P&L through expense management and increased operational efficiency. We plan to use free cash flow to further de-lever and reduce interest expense. All of this activity should drive improvement in our organic business model and ROIC.  With that we will be happy to take your questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Warburg. 
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Warburg: You brought the tax rate down quite a bit but no change to guidance with only eight weeks left or so in this quarter. Can you help give us a read on why the range is as wide as it is? 
Robert Ryder :  We kept the EPS range at $0.10 when normally in the third quarter we might tighten it a little bit by $0.02 or so. I think it was because of the continued vibrations in the economy and perhaps if it follows through the potential cost of the refinancing of the revolver. They are the two big reasons. 
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Warburg: So it is not related to spending or marketing or anything like that. It is just more terms of lack of visibility on what core trends are versus where they would have been six months ago? 
Robert Ryder :  I think that is fair. We just felt we would like to keep the range at the $0.10 given all the uncertainty as our depletions continue to improve in both beer and in wine but we are not sure what is going to happen in the economy and we are still fine tuning our distributor transition. 
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Warburg: At Crown, how do you feel about where the inventory levels are currently at the distributors? There is obviously a big spread between your trends in depletions. What should we expect in the relationship between the two over the next quarter or so? 
Robert Ryder :  Generally in the beer business, shipments and depletions are prealigned. This is actually a good news story in that we feel that we were able to get some pretty good media buys because the prices came down in the advertising market over some peak sporting events and actually the sporting events had pretty high ratings. They were actually some pretty good games if you remember back to that. So we think they were good buys and we do think that drove some increased depletions in the quarter. The level of increased depletion surprised us a little bit so we had a slight de-stocking in the beer channel which I think will be replenished in the fourth quarter. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Lauren Torres – HSBC. 
Lauren Torres - HSBC: In your prepared remarks you mentioned that you are seeing trends improve both in beer and wine in the US particularly late in the quarter. I guess I am just trying to get a better sense of with the holiday season obviously being more promotional maybe there is some discounting in there and is that really just driving that momentum or do you think it is coming from somewhere else? So with on-premise still being weak and convenience stores being weak is it just kind of consumers buying in here at lower prices and your lower price brands doing better or do you feel you are really seeing some difference here versus last quarter? 
Robert Sands :  First of all that comment was relative to our business, not the industry in general. The industry in general although is performing well. I would say it has been fairly consistent as opposed to there being an uptick. In our business on the wine side yes we are seeing some improved performance. I think that is generally as a result of the fact that a lot of our efforts for instance our distributor consolidation and the increase of our promotional activities in the third quarter these things are now kicking in and we really are starting to see some positive impact on that in late third quarter and we have seen some of the positive impact of that into December and the holiday season.  We are pretty optimistic that things are working pretty well at this stage on the wine side. On the beer side, as much as Bob said we had some very good media. The media I think drove some pretty strong sales particularly in grocery. We are seeing some stabilization on the on-premise side. I would say the convenience sector still remains highly challenged.  On beer, I would say that while we are generally pleased and optimistic with the performance we are nevertheless still believing that we will be down from a depletion perspective mid single digits for the year because in general that segment, the import segment although we are way outperforming the competitors. That segment still remains pretty challenged in the beer business. 
Lauren Torres - HSBC: So would you say for beer and wine both on-premise and convenience that generally it has been stable, not getting worse? 
Robert Sands :  Well convenience isn’t a big factor for wine. For beer it is the largest channel. So two completely different things. In terms of, no I don’t think it is getting worse but as I said it remains a pretty challenged segment but let me just reiterate for wine it is not a factor. For beer it is a significant factor. 
Lauren Torres - HSBC: Lastly, from a price sensitivity standpoint I know you talked about trading down and certain price points doing better than others. Any real changes there from your comments last quarter? 
Robert Sands :  Not really. By the way in general I would say trading up has picked up and fundamentally there isn’t trading down in that the higher priced segments are now growing much faster than the lower price segments with the super premium plus category growing high single digits again. That said, I still would say that within category there is some trading down going on. I would say categories mean price segments. So if you look at the $10-15 segment within that there will be some trading down towards the lower end of that segment versus the higher end or if you are looking even the higher end segments there will be some trading down.  Fundamentally there is trading up although within segments there is trading down and therefore there can be some negative mix shift which is the case. There is some negative mix shift in the business even within categories some of the lower price products are selling better than the higher priced products and of course margin tends to go with the price point. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Bill Leach – TIAA-CREF. 
Bill Leach – TIAA-CREF: I wanted to follow-up on the question about the fourth quarter guidance. You only made $0.21 in the fourth quarter last year so you have a $0.10 which is almost a 50% variability and you are basically guiding from anywhere from a 10% decline to a 20% gain which is essentially meaningless. Can’t you flesh that out a little bit? Also if you do expect Crown to be down in earnings high single digits, 12% in nine months, does that mean you actually expect it to be up in the fourth quarter? 
Robert Ryder :  Part of that for the quarter and for the full year we did have the tax rate upside. Offsetting that might be some slightly weaker EBIT throughout the businesses. We are still a bit tentative on what sales are going to do so we thought it was prudent to keep the full $0.10 range. Remember, if we are successful in refinancing our debt there will be costs associated with that as well which would hit the fourth quarter. 
Bill Leach – TIAA-CREF: Wouldn’t that be these nonrecurring charges? 
Robert Ryder :  Pardon? 
Bill Leach – TIAA-CREF: Wouldn’t that be due to a non-recurring charge? 
Robert Ryder :  Some would and some wouldn’t. 
Bill Leach – TIAA-CREF: You have to admit that is an unusually wide range for a quarter.
Robert Ryder :  I guess. $0.08 versus $0.10. I don’t know some may be passionate about it. I don’t know. 
Bill Leach – TIAA-CREF: Do you expect Crown to be up in profits in the fourth quarter? 
Robert Ryder :  I wouldn’t expect that. No. Profits have been negative for Crown. You can back into it our stated guidance for Crown is profits will be down high single digits. It may be high single digits to maybe very low double digits. 
Bill Leach – TIAA-CREF: Can you give us some guidance about the tax rate for next fiscal year? Will it go back up to 38%?
Robert Ryder :  We can try. We will be giving full-year guidance at the year-end call. It is interesting you say that because all of our planning meetings with our business units happen very shortly and after that the tax guys start wrapping up what we think geographies and profits are going to come to. So it is a whole process. We will be talking about that on the April call. 
Bill Leach – TIAA-CREF:  Because we have to make an earnings estimate for next year which starts shortly. What would you suggest we plug in as a normalized tax rate? Your previous guidance was 38% for this year. Would that be a good number going forward? 
Robert Ryder :  That will be your choice. Right now I can’t anticipate any significant changes here. Remember there are some pretty big swingers in the air like if our transaction goes ahead with Australia Vintage Limited that can have an impact on tax rates. So there are a lot of moving parts. I don’t envy you because you are right you have to make a call and you don’t have all the information. Sorry about that. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.
Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Just thinking ahead to try and get a handle on the growth in the branded wine business, it is awfully difficult to march through given pretty good reported numbers on the IRI stuff but we know that is the best performing segment and on-premise declining. What do you think the outlook is for the wine segment for calendar 2010 forgetting your fiscal year? Are we going to have growth in calendar 2010? 
Robert Sands :  I would say somewhere between really we can only talk volumetrically because you don’t have a lot of insight into dollars beyond the IRI channel which is only about 30% but volumetrically I would say that around 1% would be a good guess. It could be a bit higher than that. It could be a bit lower than that depending on the state of the economy. That is for the total wine industry in the US. We will see IRI grow faster than that. We will see mass merchandise grow faster than that. We will see on-premise grow slower than that. There is going to be puts and takes. Volumetrically about 1% and then in dollars will be higher than that because of the general trends towards trading up which continue. 
Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.: I know you are not going to give us guidance today but given your more premium mix is there any reason why you shouldn’t exceed the industry growth in 2010 versus 2009? 
Robert Sands :  Our goal is to equal or exceed industry growth on a weighted basis. So you have to take into account what categories you play in and so on and so forth. That is our goal. So equal or greater. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Lindsey Druckerman – Goldman Sachs. 
Lindsey Druckerman – Goldman Sachs: I was hoping you could clarify the underlying wine trends in the US in the third quarter  Inventory shift that moved into the second quarter and hurt the third quarter. You reported up 3% in the second quarter and down 3% in the third quarter so it sort of implies that underlying the second quarter including the inventory shift you were down low to mid single digits and in this quarter you were up low to mid single digits which is a nice sequential uptick. Is that a fair way to read that? 
Robert Ryder :  It is a little confusing. Probably the easiest way to look at it is the year-to-date numbers. If you look at year-to-date in the press release for North America I think sales were essentially flat. Right? That is pretty much in line with where our more recent depletion data has been. So that is probably the best way to look at it. 
Lindsey Druckerman – Goldman Sachs: Is it fair to say at all you saw a sequential improvement in an underlying basis in the third quarter versus the second quarter? 
Robert Ryder :  From a depletion standpoint maybe a little bit. 
Lindsey Druckerman – Goldman Sachs: From a sales standpoint? We are seeing more promos and discounting. 
Robert Ryder :  I think sales if you iron out the movement in Q2 to Q3 again sales were sort of flat in North America similar to the year-to-date trend. Okay? Depletions have gotten better since just before Thanksgiving I would say versus what they were from the second quarter through the first part of the third quarter. 
Lindsey Druckerman – Goldman Sachs: On the gross margin performance in the third quarter you mentioned promotional spending, the inventory shift in Australia as some of the drivers. You also mentioned that the promo spending didn’t really hit until or at least impact your sales until the end of the quarter. Is this something you booked for the entirety of the third quarter? 
Robert Ryder :  I guess we talked about this a bit at the second quarter. Because of the distributor strategy we sort of held back some promo spending in Q1 and Q2 so we could sort of do it with the new distributors in Q3 and Q4. So that did flow through our income statement in Q3. Now you don’t see that. It is in the net sales number. So Q3 of this year we did spend in the US more promotions money than we did in the previous year. So that did impact the P&L. 
Lindsey Druckerman – Goldman Sachs: Can you quantify how much the distributor pre-sell for holiday hurt your margin in the third quarter? 
Robert Ryder :  Can you repeat that? 
Lindsey Druckerman – Goldman Sachs: You had year-over-year gross margin compression. How much of that was a function of loading or pre-selling for holiday in the second quarter for your distributor transition? The other elements would presumably would continue…Australia cost of goods would flow through in February. You are still promoting for the February quarter so I am just wondering how much of that year-over-year compression is one-off. 
Robert Ryder :  I don’t know if I would call any of it one off. Because of the noise between Q2 and Q3 both in wine and remember the comment we had around SVEDKA it is probably better to look at the year-to-date P&L where you will see a gross margin reduction but that is more than offset by our SG&A initiatives and on a year-to-date operating profits are up about 180 basis points. Gross profit margin was down about 230 basis points or something like that. The SG&A saved it. We think and we took these actions in the fourth quarter of last year. We think we have been relatively diligent about bringing SG&A down to offset the gross margin compression. 
Lindsey Druckerman – Goldman Sachs: Lastly, with respect to the Crown JV, the current lawsuit aside can you comment on whether there is anything in your contract whereby if Constellations director who sits on Crown’s board will be not acting in good faith for the entity it would damage your participation in that JV? 
Robert Sands :  No. There is nothing to that effect. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Marc Greenberg – Deutsche Bank. 
Marc Greenberg – Deutsche Bank: My question relates to Crown. As you know, the litigation surrounds a relatively small dollar amount and I am wondering if this doesn’t suggest that the broader partnership agreement may not be on steady footing. Maybe you could offer some perspective on how we should consider the potential risk to Constellation based on any deterioration here and is there any point in which you might say look it is not working, let’s move on? And how we might think about what that could mean to shareholders? 
Robert Sands :  I think Lindsey asked the question and my answer was a definitive no. The litigation has no impact whatsoever on the contract. There is no impact on the term. It is a dispute over money which was said an immaterial amount. Clearly again in an answer to your question my answer is no. I am not even clear on what you mean by calling it quits. No, we won’t. We can’t do that. As you know the contract’s initial term runs through the end of 2016. We have certainly no reason to believe or expect that anything different will occur other than the business will continue to be operated and generate the kind of results it has historically.  The results of course historically it has been a very strong performer. With the downturn in the economy the import business has been negatively impacted. I would say as the economy improves there is upside in that business in particular being a bit more cyclical than some of our other businesses. There is no impact on the business that is Crown and there is no impact really on the JV agreement or the term related to the lawsuit which as I said is what we stated is an immaterial amount of dollars. 
Marc Greenberg – Deutsche Bank: To follow-up is it fair to characterize the current relationship with Modello and Constellation as maybe not seeing eye to eye on certain things? I guess that is kind of why I asked that question. I know the business risk is the business is being run separate and distinct from this. I wouldn’t contest this at all. But I am trying to think about the value of this asset and in the past you have talked about the fact you don’t feel that at times the value of the Crown JV is reflected in the value of your share price. I guess with this lawsuit maybe it puts a bit of a cloud on that. 
Robert Sands :  First of all nothing about the lawsuit would impact my previous statements with regard to the value of the JV not being appropriately reflected in Constellation’s valuation for all the reasons I have stated in the past because nothing has changed in that regard with respect to what happens at the end of the contract and the issues around recognizing the terminal value. Nothing has changed at all.  Obviously there is a disagreement between us and Modello on the point that is being litigated in the lawsuit. I would say as a general proposition that both partners recognize we have to get along and we have to work together as it relates to the overall operations of Crown to maximize its success. No, we can’t ignore the fact that there is a dispute over something very specific which is being litigated but we are all reasonable people and we all understand that we have to get along and operate with respect to ensuring that the operations of the business are maximized. That is basically where things stand. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company. 
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company: On the increase in accounts receivable I think you said something about that being related to some of the timing issues. Is that related to the change in distributors? 
Robert Ryder :  Essentially the shipment to distributors happened at a point in the quarter where we won’t collect the receivable until the fourth quarter so that is why you have a very high receivables balance and you have an increased use of cash in the accounts receivable line item on the cash flow statement. 
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company: In terms of the tax rate, while I understand you won’t give fiscal 2011 guidance, can you explain again why the rate came down to 35% from 38% for this year? 
Robert Ryder :  Sure. It was essentially some positive outcomes on some tax audits essentially. So the tax audits were cleared. When they are cleared we reflect either the positive or negative in the P&L and this quarter it was a positive. 
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company: So these weren’t like one-time reversals from prior years or something like that? 
Robert Ryder :  Actually yes they were. The auditors are usually about 3-4 years in arrears and when the audits get cleared up and these related to previous years’ tax expense that was taken that can flush through the P&L. So if they get cleared positively that reduces this year’s tax rate. If they don’t get cleared then you should have that actually covered and you won’t see a change in the tax rate. 
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company: Finally, I want to know if you can comment again another question on Crown. With Modello’s lawsuit within that it is not just about money. They seem to allege you are trying to use this marketing budget to renegotiate the terms of the JV. Can you comment on that at all? If you were looking to renegotiate what are you looking to do? Extend the term for instance? 
Robert Sands :  The answer is no I really can’t comment on that. It is a matter that is being litigated. It is really not appropriate for me to comment on that point. I apologize for not being able to give you more information on that but clearly that is not something we discuss at this time. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus. 
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: On CapEx, 130-150 is the guidance for the current fiscal year but the 150 number seems rather large unless you have something large in the way of spending happening in the current quarter. That is part one of my CapEx question and then I have a follow-up. 
Robert Ryder :  I would say we are a pretty big business and in every industry I have been in the wide majority of your capital spend occurs in the fourth quarter because sometimes it is the engineering school training that happens. I have been in a couple of different businesses so that is kind of happening. The other thing going on is the fusion ERP project we have going on that certainly we will be spending around that in the fourth quarter and there was very little if any in last year’s fourth quarter. So that is probably the answer to that. 
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: That is the low visibility item back on the line of questioning Bill had? You would think that in January you would know what you are going to spend on that. Is that the item that has uncertainty to it? 
Robert Ryder :  There is a lot. Again as I said, the way you do a capital forecast there are thousands of projects that sort of roll up and it is very difficult to get…the engineers always want to hold onto that capital forecast so we do the best we can to try to isolate the numbers and give the best guess we can. But you never know. So it could be a lot of projects get spent against and also the fusion project is a new project so there is no history against which we can look. We are relatively comfortable in bringing down that CapEx number and again the range is $20 million in a $250-270 million number. So there is a lot of moving parts in the cash flow forecast. 
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: I think you answered my follow-up. As we think longer term it sounds like last year the number was just shy of 130. There are some unusual items this year regardless of whether it is 130 or 150 for the fiscal year. It sounds like long term you think the number is closer to 130 than 150?
Robert Ryder :  I think that is a pretty narrow range for a long-term forecast. I think if I was you the long term forecast a fair number would be 130-150 and again because of where we are in the wine business we are pretty mature. We have all our facilities so our big use of capital is more around inventory than it is around capital spending. 130-150 I think is probably about 3.5% to 4% of sales which for us isn’t a real big number. 
Operator:  There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Robert Sands for any closing remarks. 
Robert Sands :  Thanks for joining our call today. Let me summarize what I think are the highlights of the third quarter as follows: First, we continued to benefit from our global cost reduction initiatives. Our full year free cash flow is targeted to be at the upper end of our guidance range. We reduced debt by more than $335 million since the beginning of our fiscal year. We continued our portfolio transformation efforts with the proposed sale of our cider business, the proceeds of which we expect to be used to further reduce our debt. We are experiencing improving depletion trends in our US wine, spirits and beer business. Lastly, we continue to progress with our distributor consolidation initiative. Our plan is to continue execution of our strategic initiatives throughout the final quarter of the year.  Finally, we will be providing guidance for our fiscal year 2011 during our next quarterly conference call scheduled for early April. Thank you again everybody for joining our call. 
Operator:  Thank you all for participating in today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator:  Good morning. My name is Brandy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Brandy. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Constellation’s first quarter 2010 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.  By now you should have an opportunity to read our new release which has also been furnished to the SEC. This conference call is intended to complement the release.  During the call, we will discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable organic and constant currency basis. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com under the investors section.  These reconciliations include explanations as to why management uses the non-GAAP financial measures and why management believes they are useful to investors.  Discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results excluding [inaudible] costs, restructuring and related charges and unusual items.  We will also discuss organic net sales information which is defined in the news release and constant currency net sales information, which exclude the impact of year over year currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Please be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. Although statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company’s estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings.  And now I would like to turn the call over to Rob. 
Robert S. Sands: Well, thanks, Patty and good morning, everybody and welcome to our discussion of Constellation’s first quarter sales and earnings results. We are generally pleased with our quarterly results, which were in line with our expectations and demonstrate that we are on track to achieve our goals for fiscal 2010. Despite the ongoing challenges of a difficult operating environment worldwide, we continued to reduce our debt and improve our operating margins.  We completed the sale of our value spirits business, which is consistent with our strategic focus on premium high growth, higher margin brands and utilized the transaction proceeds to reduce debt.  In addition, we began to reap the benefits of our cost reduction initiative, which was implemented with the goal of mitigating the negative impacts from the turbulent global economy and creating efficiencies that will drive performance benefits over the long-term.  This cost focus helped us to offset the unfavorable product mix created by ongoing shifts in consumer buying patterns. However, a continuation of our planned SKU reduction activities worldwide has tempered our top-line growth.  Our focus on driving operational efficiencies, as well as portfolio pruning through divestitures and SKU reductions, is absolutely the right strategy to pursue as one of our top priorities is to manage for improved profitability in this challenging environment. This helps to ensure the long-term health of our business.  And now I’d like to discuss the operational aspects of the quarter, beginning with the North American wine business.  During the quarter, we completed the integration of our remaining spirits business into our North American wine organization and [begin resigning] the structure of our U.S. wine business into a single, integrated organization, especially in the areas of sales and marketing. These actions will simplify our organizational structure, provide synergy benefits, and are intended to improve efficiency and effectiveness with our trade partners.  We are also progressing with our efforts to consolidate our U.S. distributor network in key markets and implement a new go-to-market strategy. This has been made possible through the dramatic transformation of our portfolio which has occurred throughout the last 18 months and has resulted in a much more focused set of premium, consumer preferred brands that also have a desirable margin profile for distributors.  We are currently in the process of negotiating with our distributors. The initial transition will encompass up to 17 states representing approximately 50% of our total U.S. volume for wine and spirits. The goal of our new U.S. organizational structure and distributor consolidation initiative is to gain better alignment of dedicated selling resources working on a focused set of priorities and processes aimed at driving execution and accountability. We will implement an enhanced distributor incentive structure with the objective of driving organic growth.  We expect to begin transitioning by the end of this summer and will provide additional details when we are ready to officially launch the program. This new level of increased importance to our key distributor partners is designed to position us for future growth in a consolidating market.  From a marketplace perspective, growth in the U.S. wine market remains healthy at about 5% on a dollar basis, according to recent 12-week IRI data. The premium plus segment of the market where wine sales for greater than $5 a bottle at retail continues to grow in line with the total category. And as you know, we have a strong portfolio of U.S. wine brands throughout all price segments and we continue to see consumers turning to trusted brands that represent quality for good value.  Many of our well-known premium wine brands performed well in the marketplace during the quarter, including Woodbridge and Rex Goliath, Blackstone, [inaudible], Clos du Bois, [Simi], Wild Horse, and Kim Crawford, just to name a few.  SVEDKA Vodka posted another great quarter and generated sales growth of more than 30% versus last year. According to market data, it has become the fifth largest vodka brand overall in the U.S. and now ranks as the third-largest import. Black Velvet also posted solid sales results for the quarter.  Our Canadian wine business posted positive results for the quarter, primarily driven by the premium wine portfolio, including Jackson Trigg, Sawmill Creek, and Naked Grape, which all contributed to solid sales growth.  Recently, Canada’s Le Clos Jordanne chardonnay captured the top spot for chardonnay in the judgment of Montreal expert’s blind tasting, surpassing wines from France and other parts of the world.  And now moving to our international business, as you know, Australia and the U.K. continue to be challenged by a myriad of issues that have negatively impacted our business in these locations. These challenges do not relate to Constellation alone but to all suppliers who do business in these geographies.  We often discuss these markets in the same vein and we ship approximately 70% of our Australian exports to the U.K. marketplace. Although the U.K. and Australia combined represent a small percent of our total profits, our goal is to minimize operational variability for these businesses and our overall results going forward.  Therefore we are now running the U.K. and Australia business with a focus on cash. We will continue to take out costs, decrease our networking capital investment, and increase efficiencies by consolidating as much production as possible. Our goal is to generate cash, improve gross profit, and variabilize the business model.  As you know, we recently announced changes in our international management structure aimed at better aligning our businesses in the U.K. and Australia to provide opportunities for cost savings and increased efficiencies. We are working on developing the appropriate long-term strategy for these businesses and will move rapidly to implement these plans once finalized.  In the U.K., positive year-over-year sales trends in the first quarter were primarily the result of a year-over-year pre-buy and timing related to the duty increase. The 2009 grape harvest in Australia is now complete. Although final data is not yet available, it appears that the current harvest estimate is approximately 1.7 million tons, versus a harvest of about 1.8 million tons last year. However, overall supply continues to outstrip demand.  The cost of Australian grapes has decreased significantly for the calendar 2009 harvest due to the fact that last year many growers paid for water supply during the growing season due to the drought conditions in the region at the time.  Moving to the Crown imports joint venture, Crown experienced positive momentum during the Cinco de Mayo holiday driving year-over-year improvement in case sales through excellent execution at retail. However, this positive momentum was offset by the economic driven trends, particularly in the on-premise and convenience channels and an overall mix shift away from imports.  In addition, competitive price discounting has become prevalent in the form of mail-in rebates offered at retail as Crown enters the busy summer selling season. More recently, however, Crown is beginning to see some improving trends in the grocery channel from national chain stores as a result of targeted marketing efforts and programming against those key channels.  These efforts include the reprisal of Corona Extra’s iconic television ads from the 1990s following considerable analysis and consumer research. This is a very cost-effective approach to media investment.  Overall, Crown is focusing on optimizing promotional activity and media support into and through the peak seasonal periods when consumers buy the most.  Crown is also seeing some success with a number of new SKU and packaging introductions, expanding distribution to additional states with Modello Especiale, Corona, and Corona Light 18-packs, Corona Light 12-pack cans, and Modello Especiale 24-packs. And the next phase rollout for Modello Draft will begin in late July.  Modello Especiale continues to be one of the few major super premium brands that is experiencing double-digit market growth.  Now in closing, we’ve been impacted by the global slow-down but are taking the necessary actions to fortify the company short-term. The culmination of everything we are doing positions us well to drive sales growth, margin expansion, and improved ROIC once we clear the headwinds from this challenging external environment. Overall, our business strategy remains intact. We are executing and taking the appropriate actions designed to further position our business for success in the future.  And now I’d like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our business results. 
Robert P. Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Given the continuing difficult global economic and market conditions, I am generally pleased with our results, which were in line with our expectations. Our comparable basic diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.33 a share versus $0.34 last year.  The quarter saw quite a bit of change due to foreign exchange rates. The dollar strengthened dramatically versus our key currencies when compared to the prior year. In dollar terms, this reduced our international sales and SG&A expenses.  The state of the global economy also impacted our sales mix as consumers across the beverage alcohol category gravitated towards lower priced products. For us, this generally means a lower gross profit margin.  The profit margin for our international business also continues to disappointing. We began to see the sales mix trend at the end of last year and we took some dramatic offsetting actions. We sold our value spirits and other businesses and eliminated the associated standalone SG&A. We began our global cost reduction initiative, tightened down on marketing and general expense, and continued to focus on debt pay-downs and interest expense reduction.  These tactics were generally successful in Q1 as our SG&A and interest savings offset gross profit reductions resulting in slightly higher pre-tax income versus the prior year.  We also continued to pay down debt and are well on our way to achieving a comparable basis debt-to-EBITDA ratio by the end of fiscal 2010 in the high three times range.  Now let’s look at our Q1 P&L performance, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. First, the net sales line -- as you can see from our news release on page 13, our consolidated reported net sales decreased 15%, primarily due to the impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations and the divestiture of our value spirits business, spirits contract production services, and certain Pacific Northwest wine brands.  On an organic constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and for-ex rate changes, net sales increased 1%.  My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Our worldwide branded wide organic net sales increased 1%. Organic branded wine net sales for North America, which appears on page 12 of the release, decreased 1% while Europe and Australia/New Zealand increased 6% and 7% respectively.  Our global branded wine business continues to be impacted by ongoing SKU reductions in a challenging economic environment which is driving unfavorable sales mix. However, the SG&A reduction efforts are having the expected benefit of offsetting much of the reduced gross profit margins from the negative mix.  We estimate that SKU reduction actions negatively impacted North American sales growth by approximately 2 percentage points.  Sales for Europe benefited from year-over-year timing related to customer buying prior to the U.K. duty increases.  Australia and New Zealand saw some improvement, albeit on a small base, driven by sales in the Asia-Pacific region.  Spirits organic net sales increased 13%, led by 33% growth from SVEDKA Vodka.  Now let’s look at our profits on a comparable basis, using information on page 14 of the release. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 34.9%, down 1.5 percentage points. This reflects the unfavorable sales mix that I discussed earlier, partially offset by the sale of the lower margin value spirits business.  Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 19.3% of net sales compared to 22.3% a year ago. The 3 percentage point decrease was primarily driven by previously mentioned cost reduction actions, lower advertising and marketing expense, and gains on foreign currency hedges.  Consolidated operating income decreased 6% to $123 million but our operating margins increased 1.5 percentage points to 15.6%.  I would now like to turn to our segment operating income results on page 11 of the release to provide highlights of these changes.  With the sale of the value spirits business and the integration of the remaining spirits business into our North American wine organization, our segment reporting has changed accordingly and the spirits business is now included in the wine segment. Prior periods have been classified in our press release and our segment history schedule on our website reflects this change.  Wine segment operating income decreased $8 million to $148 million. The decrease is primarily due to the divestiture of the value spirits business and certain Pacific Northwest brands, negative mix, and a decrease in international profitability, partially offset by our SG&A reduction initiatives and foreign currency gains.  For the quarter, corporate and other expenses totaled $24 million, which was level with the prior year. Higher stock compensation was offset by cost savings.  On page 14, you can see consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $63 million versus $72 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $63 million versus $70 million. For the first quarter, Crown generated net sales of $636 million, a decrease of 5%, and operating income of $126 million, a decrease of 9%.  Similar to the wine category, we have seen consumers gravitate towards lower priced beers. Sales were impacted by soft performance in the convenience and on-premise channels which have seen a more dramatic impact from the economy. In addition to the sales decrease, operating income was primarily impacted by a contractual cost increase and negative sales mix.  Interest expense for the quarter was $67 million, down 23% versus last year. This decrease was driven by our significant debt reduction over the past 15 months and a decrease in our average interest rate for the quarter, versus the prior year as LIBOR decreased for our variable rate debt. Now let’s take a look at our debt position -- at the end of May, our debt totaled $4.3 billion, which represented $112 million decrease from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2009. The decrease reflects proceeds received from the sale of the value spirits business partially offset by the use of free cash flow in the quarter. I’ll talk about free cash flow in a few moments.  Our average interest rate for the quarter was down to about 6%.  Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of May was 4.3 times, consistent with the ratio at the end of fiscal ’09. The benefit of the debt reduction was essentially offset by lower EBITDA, reflecting our softest financial performance over the last two quarters.  Our comparable basis tax rate came in at 39% compared to 37% last year. We are still targeting a full-year tax rate of 38%.  Due to the many factors just mentioned, diluted EPS was $0.33 versus $0.34 last year.  Now let’s turn to cash flow on page 10 of the news release. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx.  Due to seasonal factors, we’re normally a first quarter user of cash and for the first quarter of 2010, we used free cash flow of $102 million versus a use in the prior year of about $55 million.  The higher use of cash was due in part to higher CapEx spending for the quarter due to timing. In the working capital area, inventory benefited from lower grape harvest in Australia and New Zealand versus the prior year.  The majority of the higher cost fiscal year 2009 harvest is rolling through cost of goods sold in this fiscal year, contributing to our reduced international profits.  Receivables were higher due to the timing of sales in the quarter. For fiscal 2010, we are still targeting free cash flow to be in the range of $230 million to $270 million. This includes CapEx in the range of $150 million to $170 million. As a reminder, free cash flow for 2010 was expected to be negatively impacted by higher taxes paid primarily due to the $65 million tax payment related to the sale of the value spirits business, which we expect to make in Q2.  We expect to continue to utilize free cash flow to reduce borrowings.  Moving to our P&L outlook for full year 2010, as reflected in the outlook section of the press release, we continue to forecast comparable basis diluted EPS in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 a share. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $265 million to $285 million and we’re assuming weighted average diluted shares to be about 222 million.  Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition related integration costs, restructuring charges, and unusual items which are detailed on page 16 of the news release.  During Q1, we recorded approximately $0.12 in charges for restructuring and related activity, including our global cost reduction initiative announced in April. We also recorded a $0.17 charge associated with the sale of the value spirits business.  Before we take your questions, I would like to note that in these uncertain times, with difficult economic and market conditions, we remain focused on margins and ROIC, reducing debt and keep leverage at manageable levels. I believe the strength of our portfolio, combined with our SG&A reduction efforts, positions us well to work through the current environment and take advantage of opportunities when conditions improve.  With that, we’ll open up the line for questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.
Analyst for Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Warburg: Good morning. This is [Seth] standing in for Kaumil. [Regarding the distributor] transition that you mentioned would be taking place this summer, should we be concerned about any disruption in 2Q or 3Q because of that?
Robert S. Sands: You know, we don’t expect any disruption at this time as a consequence of our distributor activities. You know, we’ve put a lot of things in place to ensure that things remain intact during the transition period so right now, we feel pretty good about that. 
Analyst for Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Warburg: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Ramey with D.A. Davidson.
Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Good morning. Congratulations, guys. As you get into the latter half of the year, have you -- I know you don’t give quarterly guidance but have you given thoughts to how the currency impacts shake out and what that might mean for you, particularly with regard to your new strategy in Australia and the U.K.?
Robert P. Ryder: You know, we do look at that stuff but if we were real good on anticipating for-ex rates, we’d be working down on Wall Street but what we try to do with all our -- with our hedged activities is we try to offset the volatility, so for instance in this quarter, we actually saw some positive impact from our hedges, whereas in last year’s first quarter, we saw some negative impact from hedges specifically. Now, there are offsetting things helping the other line items. But we don’t -- it’s not really a big number. We expect for-ex volatility to be maybe a positive/negative of about $0.01 in any quarter. 
Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, and then just on some of the mid-tier brands, you know, can you kind of more fully flesh out a little bit on what you are seeing in terms of trade down and -- I mean, you described a couple of the results as solid but I’d rather have numbers than letters. 
Robert S. Sands: In terms of our mid-tier brands, we are seeing some positive results. We see brands like Woodbridge continuing to grow in the high-single-digit range. We see brands like Clos du Bois, for instance, we’re seeing about 8% volume growth on that particular brand. So you know, there’s ups and downs in the portfolio and we do see a trend towards what we would describe as better known and trusted brands that represent good value for money. I think that some of our brands are benefiting from that in general.  We do see volume basis trading up continuing in the industry with total wine in the lower single digit range. Premium plus and super premium in the mid and moving up into the higher single digit range on a volume basis.  On a dollar basis, interestingly enough, in the value business we continue to see a lot of pricing being taken in the marketplace, so while we see value wines growing at a lower percentage on a volume basis than premium and super premium plus wines, on a dollar basis they are actually growing faster because I think the major players in that industry, in that segment, of which we are not one, are taking the opportunity to take pricing in the value segments. 
Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JP Morgan.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan: Hi. One clarification question -- you mentioned the gain on FX hedges that was in SG&A. Did you give the amount that was in this year and last year?
Robert P. Ryder: No, but I’d say you can figure it out -- it was about a penny positive this year and about a penny negative last year, so the -- so again, in any quarter it’s about a penny but this quarter when you look year over year, the delta is a positive to a negative so it sort of makes it look bigger than it is. 
Carla Casella - JP Morgan: Okay, and then in the other segment of sales, I guess it’s wholesale and other, it looks like some of the businesses you sold might have been included in that. Can you just say -- the run-rate is about $43 million this quarter. Is that a good run-rate to use or was that seasonally low or somewhat otherwise affected?
Robert P. Ryder: I think the biggest product in that category is our cider business in the U.K. and the cider business in the U.K. is very much a summer product, so you might see like a higher number in say the second quarter. You also have a lot of translation going on because most of those sales are overseas. 
Carla Casella - JP Morgan: Okay. That’s helpful. And then one question on gross margin -- can you clarify anymore how much of the gross margin change was affected by mix versus any promotional activity versus packaging or other cost increases?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, we sort of look at it all as one big bucket but obviously as we said, negative mix shift had a pretty big impact on us in the quarter because -- and this is a general statement -- as you move down the price ladder, the gross profit margin tends to be less.  The thing we are really happy about is we sort of saw this coming and we took some pretty dramatic cost-out actions and those cost-out actions are offsetting most of the negative mix shift up in gross profit. You can see the SG&A coming down. 
Carla Casella - JP Morgan: Okay, so it sounds like it’s more mix than any promotional activity?
Robert P. Ryder: It’s more mix than promotional activities, yes. 
Carla Casella - JP Morgan: Okay, and then just one last question -- June weather we know has been pretty bad and a lot of retailers have been hit. Have you seen -- has that affected any certain segments of your business that are dependent on outdoor summer activities, et cetera?
Robert S. Sands: I think it’s a little early to tell how June weather will affect the business. Obviously the beer business is heavily skewed towards the summer selling season. This is the big time and we are going to have to see how -- we are going to have to see how the -- you know, our brands in particular fair over the summer selling season. We’ve got a lot in place relative to that.  You know, other than beer, obviously, in the U.S. and Canada in particular -- actually, worldwide wine sales don’t tend to be affected by weather. It’s not a weather related -- 
Robert P. Ryder: It’s not a thirst-quencher. 
Robert S. Sands: -- beverage. Right. 
Carla Casella - JP Morgan: Right. Okay. 
Robert S. Sands: So it’s really the beer business and it’s too early to tell how we’re going to do during the summer selling season. 
Carla Casella - JP Morgan: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christine Farkas with Bank of America.
Christine Farkas - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. Good morning, Rob and Bob. I think, Bob, you might have answered this a little bit but I want to get a little more color on your North American or the overall wine margin, I should say. In the fourth quarter we saw margin contraction of about 180 basis points on the operating profit line. It sounds to me that cost controls are coming in maybe even stronger. Can you tell us if your margin contraction was better or worse than what we saw in wine in the fourth quarter?
Robert P. Ryder: The fourth quarter generally had some anomalies that caused the margins to be lower year over year but I’d say in Q1, we saw slightly better margins than in Q4 so it’s getting a little bit better and I think you got the point, Christine, of the cost-savings initiatives that we began at the end of last year are really starting to kick in in Q1. You know, in Q1 we had to take out quite a few Constellation associates and that will continue through the balance of year and we are also taking some facility actions and we are being really cautious on our marketing spend. On spending that we can hold back on, we are holding back on. 
Christine Farkas - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Can you quantify -- sorry, I was going to ask if you can quantify what your targets were for SG&A or I should say overall cost reductions and how much you have achieved so far?
Robert P. Ryder: Sure. So what we said, and this is just for the global cost initiative that we announced I think in the fourth quarter call last year, we will be taking out savings this year, $25 million, full-year run-rate is $50 million because we will only have about a half-year of savings this year, so again you will see our savings as we go through the year pick up. I mean, again unfortunately just last week we announced 100 people would be leaving the U.S. wine business and that will be happening in Q2 and forward quarters, so it continues to -- 
Christine Farkas - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: And these are all part of your already announced global initiative program as we see these headlines?
Robert P. Ryder: That is correct. 
Christine Farkas - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Okay, and a final question, if I could, on your international wine business -- certainly your comments are clear about a challenging environment and SKU reduction, yet we saw positive sales growth in both Australia and Europe. Can you give us just a little bit of color -- and I know that mix is hurting the profit, but can you give us a little bit of color on the strength of the top line?
Robert P. Ryder: Yeah, so what I’d say is -- and if you compare it to prior quarters, both Europe and Asia-Pacific sales were up a lot. I wouldn’t get too excited about that, I guess. In the U.K., or in Europe the big thing driving that is in the previous year in the fourth quarter when the governments announced the duty increase, which as you’ll recall was pretty sizable. They gave a decent amount of time between the announcement and the implementation of the duty increase, so it gave everybody quite a while to sort of buy in a lot of product ahead of the duty increase, and what that ended up doing was it sort of kept our first quarter sales lower as that inventory sold through. This year when the duty increase was announced, there was no time between announcement and execution, so that duty buy-in didn’t happen. So it’s sort of a technical year-over-year selling activity which should even out over time. Really what happened is inventory got built up, so that’s sort of Europe.  And in Asia-Pacific, it’s more related again to some timing of sales into mostly the Japanese market, which I think will also even out over time. The other thing to keep into account is unfortunately sales in these two regions have a much lower margin than sales in North America, so as sales growth accelerates versus North America in any quarter, that tends to be a negative geographic mix shift for us. 
Christine Farkas - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks a lot. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Rob, I was surprised to hear you comment that you didn’t expect disruption this summer with the plans to consolidate wine and spirit sales into fewer distributors. Could you -- I may have missed it but could you tell us when that was announced for the trade? Is that happening today?  And then talk a little bit about why you don’t expect too much disruption and I take it if you don’t, that you don’t have disruption in your guidance of $1.60 to $1.70?
Robert S. Sands: I think you asked when we’re announcing for the trade, is that was you asked?
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Yeah. 
Robert S. Sands: You know, we expect that we should be announcing for the trade actually fairly shortly, within the next 30, 60 days, something to that effect, and it might not be all at once, so it’s not necessarily a big kind of a thing. And then to your second question, you know, in planning for how we would handle the changes that we are going to be making related to the consolidation, operationally we obviously put in place some mitigation plans and there are some natural things that occur when you make these movements that tend to offset each other, such as when you are moving the brands, you’ve got inventory moving around, shipments to new distributors, et cetera. So when you balance everything out, we really don’t think that it will have a huge impact on retail sales. We think that depletion should be somewhat stable. There might be some loss from distributors who are losing brands, some pick-up from distributors who are gaining brands and actually the same kind of thing on the shipment side. So we expect it at this time to balance out. You know, if there were any timing issues, which is probably the worst-case scenario, you know, we -- well, let me just put it this way; at the current time, we don’t expect any significant timing issues related to the distributor transition between second quarter and third quarter. And as we move into third quarter, it should be largely complete. I think the thing should be stabilized, which was part of the idea, which was to get this done before OND -- October, November, and December, which is one of the key selling seasons.  So a lot of operational planning has gone into this, Mark, to ensure that we mitigate any possible disruption. 
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great, and am I right that today’s comments on this call are the first the trade’s actually hearing of these intentions?
Robert S. Sands: No, no -- the trade is well aware of our intention and is well aware of what we are both doing internally with the sales organization, meaning the consolidation of the operating companies in the sales organization and we’ve been involved in an intensive RFC, request for -- we call it a request for commitment as opposed to a request for proposal. We’ve been involved in a heavy RFC process with the distributors now for several months and are in the process of final negotiations as we sit here right now. So there’s -- everybody knows what’s going on, basically. 
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Great. Thank you, Rob, that’s helpful. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JP Morgan.
John Faucher - JP Morgan: Good morning. I apologize; I seem to be getting confused about something. You started off the conference call by saying I believe that the category was up about 5% and high-end was growing at the same pace, and then you talked about a shift into some of the higher priced wines, at least from a volume standpoint. And it sounded like the category mix was coming down at the -- sort of at the very low end, of if -- I apologize. I’m trying to figure out why the mix is such an issue when what continues to come up, it seems like, is the high-end stuff seems to be holding up and growing at roughly the same pace as the category. And if you could talk about that sort of on a total category basis, as well as just for your portfolio. Thanks. 
Robert S. Sands: What is the case as you look at the total industry, you see the total industry growing at lower -- about 3%. When we said 5%, I was talking dollars, not volume, so 3% on a volume basis, 5% on a dollar basis, which in and of itself, this is total wine, would be indicative of the continuation of the general trade-up trend. So you see super premium plus, which starts at $8, growing at about 6% both in volume and dollars versus the total industry at 3% volume and 5% dollars. I’m quoting IRI figures.  Now, within our -- that doesn’t mean, however, that within the respected categories that there might not be -- and in fact I think that there is to some degree some trading down. So take the super premium category, okay, which might -- which ranges from $8 to $12. The highest end of that category is being more negatively affected or being negatively affected versus the lower end. People are looking for bargains even within the respective categories. So when we talk about trading up in general, it does continue to be a phenomena in the marketplace as measured by either the difference of the total business in volumes and dollar sales or by looking at say the whole super premium plus category versus the value category.  Now, there’s also some trading down going on from the high-end of the segment of the wine business, so wines over $15, over $20, there’s clearly some trading down that’s going on in those categories as well, and our high-end portfolio, which is our highest gross margin portfolio, sold by Icon, which is -- what we used to call Icon; well, it still is Icon, actually. It won’t be much longer but the white table cloth on-premise branded brands are definitely being hurt in the economy. You can call it trading down, you could say that it’s also an impact that the economic downturn is having on the on-premise in particular.  So the highest margin brands in our portfolio, which are more on-premise oriented, are being negatively affected by the economic impact, especially on the restaurant business.  So it’s hard not to confuse sort of general trends with what is very specifically going on; in our case, as I said, the highest end of our portfolio is being negatively affected and some of the -- even within premium, some of the lower premium products, everyday products like Woodbridge, which is premium by definition, are growing at a fairly rapid rate. So this is what’s causing the negative mix shift. 
Robert P. Ryder: So John, just a little bit of background math, when we are talking negative mix, we’re talking to previous year, okay? So what we are seeing is what Rob just said -- the total wine category is growing pretty consistently with prior years, say 4% to 5%. The brands below $5 are going a lot faster than they were last year, okay? The brands above $5 a bottle at retail are growing slower than last year but the brands above $5 a bottle are still growing in line with the total category. They used to grow faster than the total category.  So when we say mix shift, we’re talking year over year and you can see if you look at IRI or Nielsen data that the lower priced brand -- this is across beverage alcohol, right? We see the same thing in our beer portfolio -- the lower priced brands are now growing much faster than they were last year. The higher priced brands are not growing as fast as they did last year. They are all still in growth. 
John Faucher - JP Morgan: Okay, so to be technical, what’s really going on is it’s actually a lack of a mix shift -- you’ve been getting the more positive mix shift in the past. If everything is growing at the same pace, and I realize that’s a generalization, then you are not getting the positive mix shift that you are used to, so I think that’s -- is that -- if everything -- if the low-end and the high-end are both growing 5%, then it’s the lack of a positive mix shift as opposed to a mix shift?
Robert P. Ryder: That is correct. 
John Faucher - JP Morgan: Okay. 
Robert P. Ryder: We’ve had less of a positive mix [shift] -- that’s a fine way to put it. 
John Faucher - JP Morgan: Okay, I got it. Great. Thanks so much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin [Dryer] with [Cavelli] & Company.
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company: I just have a question on your margin -- on your margin changes. What kind of driving -- you’re saying that you’ve got efficiency initiatives offsetting the negative mix shift. Should that accelerate then as the year goes on, since you said you’ve got this $25 million coming in this year, going to $50 million next year?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, I think that’s true because we will have -- of the $25 million in savings, okay, we’ll see much more of that in Q2, Q3, Q4. We would also hope that the gross margin might improve a bit if the economy starts to improve a bit but we’re not really relying on that. 
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company: What drove the increase in the EBIT margin for the wine and spirits division this quarter? What were the costs you took out, or did you pull back on marketing or -- what were the specific items that helped it this quarter?
Robert P. Ryder: Most of it was around SG&A, okay? The two big things were -- the first was our global cost initiative, which we started last year. We saw a reasonable amount of savings of that in Q1. The other piece -- 
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company: -- people?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, primarily people, I’m sorry, yes. And the other thing, the other big ticket item, which again was primarily people, when we sold our value spirits business, which used to be an entire segment with a lot of very capable people in mostly Chicago running the business, we took the two largest, highest gross profit margin brands and we plugged them into our North American wine business to leverage that SG&A and unfortunately again, we had to eliminate the spirits SG&A, which resided in the ex spirits segments. That actually for this quarter provided quite a bit of SG&A savings for us. That’s a permanent savings that the people are no longer within the company. 
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company: Okay, and then in terms of the distributor transition, I guess I’d have to agree with the previous comment, not totally clear to me why there wouldn’t be some disruption but I guess all that being said, what’s the reason for it? Why -- what are you seeing in your business that makes you decide you need to go with fewer distributors now and what’s changed versus how you did things previously?
Robert S. Sands: It’s really very related to the dramatic change in our portfolio. When we had a significant value wine and spirits portfolio with many brands that competed with each other and that were fairly generic and low margin in nature, the only model that really worked for selling that was to put brands that competed against each other in different -- with different distributors. Okay, we had a huge number of brands as well, so it made sense to split the portfolio in a given market between different distributors to get better prioritization against each set of brands that each distributor had and then to also get more effort against competing brands. So you have two vodkas selling at the same price that are basically what we call well products, meaning they don’t go on the back bar, nobody knows what brand it is. Okay, you were better off having two distributors sell the two different brands that one, because you’d get more exposure to different outlets.  With the elimination of our value spirits portfolio and our value wine business, and the really the narrowing down of our portfolio to a relatively small number of brands that are fairly well-differentiated -- I mean, really just about 10, 12 brands that are the key Constellation brands, you know, we are able then to focus -- one distributor can number one, prioritize those brands and we don’t have the issue of selling largely generic inter-competitive product.  At the same time, if we consolidate our portfolio with a single distributor in a market, Constellation today is in the top three largest operating profit providers to the U.S. distribution network in general and in the top two largest gross profit providers to the U.S. distribution network.  Now, if you’ve got your portfolio split in half, half of it with one distributor in a market and half of it with another distributor in a market, you know, you don’t get the full benefit of your size and strength and the contribution that you are making to the distributor, because they only have 50% of the business and thus 50% of the margins, whereas today, many of our -- many of the major spirits producers are consolidated in the marketplace, so it was really two-fold, as I said. It was the change in our portfolio facility facilitated the change with a narrower portfolio of much more highly differentiated brands. And then number two, it gives us -- it increases dramatically our level of importance to each individual distributor that we are consolidated with. 
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company: Great. Thank you. And then maybe just one final one -- on [inaudible] big brand, continues to grow at a very healthy clip. How much of that is new distribution versus just increased consumption, you know, where you are already selling it, share gains versus other brands? And also, how much of that do you think is just benefiting from some trade-down within premium vodkas from the luxury vodkas down to a price point like SVEDKA?
Robert P. Ryder: I’d say yes, yes, and yes. SVEDKA is really hitting on all cylinders, so even in places like New York City where it has heavy penetration, okay, we still see per capita consumption increases. We’re also focusing on increasing penetration on the West Coast where it’s under-represented in the Vodka category. And the marketing and sales guys are spending a lot of time on that and we are seeing some success there.  And also the economy is certainly helping SVEDKA because it is at a price point for a 750-millilitre, save off $10 a bottle, so my guess is is getting some sales from products like the Kettle One and Grey Goose, which are say $20 to $30, so two to three times that price point, because SVEDKA offers the premium positioning. It has all the marketing glitz and it’s a great tasting product like those others. It’s just more affordable.  So I’d say it’s a very good product in general and it’s an even better product in these economic times and we are seeing the results of that. I mean, it will be above 2 million cases at the end of this fiscal year. That is a sizable spirits brand and it’s still growing in the high double-digits. We’re -- it’s pretty amazing. The team there, the commercial team is doing a fantastic job with that product. 
Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Watson with HSBC.
James Watson - HSBC: Good morning, everyone. I had a question about the cost environment in the quarter. You mentioned -- well, we saw the gross margin come down but you also mentioned that value wines in the U.S., the prices were being taken up. I mean, is that -- are they both caused by the same thing, by any underlying increase in grape costs? Or are they just separate from [inaudible]?
Robert P. Ryder: So within cost of goods, we did see some increase in grape costs and we did see some increase in glass costs, okay, across the portfolio. But we also saw generally a mix shift to -- even if those were the same, we saw mix shift towards lower gross profit margin product, so that -- those three things were the big movers in the gross profit mix shift. But again, we offset most of those with our SG&A reduction initiatives. 
James Watson - HSBC: Okay, and this increase in value pricing was in the U.S. -- have you seen it anywhere else? I mean, especially the U.K. or is the environment in the first quarter in the U.K. just as competitive as it was in the fourth quarter? 
Robert P. Ryder: Yeah, when we see the pricing, really we can see this in the spirits, the beer, and the wine category in the value segments. You actually see pricing and I guess positive mix shift in the value segment. We see that in North America across all the beverage alcohol categories. The U.K. is a very different market in that there’s kind of a price ceiling there that’s put in mostly by the retailers who use beverage alcohol to sort of just get people in the stores.  So although -- you know, we do see a general, a mix shift positive in the U.K. In our category and in wine, we’re still seeing a pretty much in total a stabilization of that price point. There’s kind of a ceiling there, which impacts everybody’s margin in beverage alcohol in the U.K. 
James Watson - HSBC: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Brian Hunt with Wachovia.
Brian Hunt - Wachovia: Thank you. I’m glad to make it under the wire. I was wondering if you could just talk about the potential costs associated with your distribution transition. It sounds like there’s a lot of moving parts. And also if you could clarify whether or not -- again, this will be something where you flip a switch and all these states at one time [or are you going] by a state-by-state basis and execute this plan?
Robert S. Sands: Yeah, you know, in terms of costs, there’s a lot of puts and takes and obviously that’s all built into our guidance for the year. Patty or [Bob] can talk to you more about that if you would like but you know, nothing that you should be particularly concerned about. And relative to flipping a switch, as I said it will all be put in place over the next say 60 days-ish, you know, not everything will happen simultaneously but it will be in place prior to the beginning of the key selling season, beginning with October. So 60, 90 days. 
Brian Hunt - Wachovia: Okay, and my last question would be looking at your organic net sales growth on North American wine relative to the IRI data you’re recording, it appears that [the overall losses] of share during the period, could you maybe clarify that -- those statements that you made and where do you feel like, if you did lose share, where were you losing share? In what segment? And maybe why?
Robert S. Sands: Yeah, well, you know, our growth is a bit behind the general growth but in general, we don’t really operate the business, okay, on the basis of maintaining share, especially in the short-term in a largely fragmented category. You know, it’s not the same kind of thing as if you are selling potato chips. Now, we’ve also taken pricing during the period, so if you look at our average pricing versus the same period a year ago, it’s up and that always has an impact on share and also that if you just look in general at our volume growth versus our dollar growth, our dollar growth is ahead of our volume growth. Again, related to pricing, which will have some impact on share. You know, we’re growing generally in line with our respective categories. We could be off a bit here and there but again, we are much more concerned about striking the right balance between profit and volume as opposed to just worrying about share per se.  Also, we have had -- as a -- there’s probably a couple hundred basis points of impact on SKU -- of SKU rationalization that -- we know that that’s flowing through at least on the shipment side and flowing through to depletion. You know, retail sales lag a little bit but you know, there is an impact of SKU rationalization on the retail numbers as well.  So you know, we have large brands, large brands aren’t going to grow as fast as small new brands, so in general we are happy and tend to look at our growth rates for our brands on an absolute basis, meaning are they growing at the rate we think is important. Like a brand like Woodbridge, as opposed to, you know, is it taking share versus all the little brands that are coming and going in the marketplace. 
Robert P. Ryder: The other -- I’ll just add another math comment in that we are under-represented share wise in the below $5 a bottle, and as we said earlier, that is growing much faster than the above $5 a bottle, so if you look at total wine category and our share of wine category, a lot of our share loss would be the fact that we’ve chosen not to participate heavily in the under $5 a bottle at retail and we’ve made that decision because the profit margins at that level are kind of less than we would want.  So that’s kind of one of the math reasons why we are losing share total. In the premium plus category, so $5 a bottle and more, we’re pretty close to growing with that category. It’s much less demonstrative. 
Robert S. Sands: And when Bob talks about the value category growing faster, it’s on a dollar basis, not on a volume basis. It’s growing slower on a volume basis and faster on a dollar basis. 
Robert P. Ryder: Correct. I was talking all dollars, sorry. 
Brian Hunt - Wachovia: Well, thank you for clarifying that and thanks for taking my questions. 
Operator: At this time, I will turn the call back to Rob Sands for closing remarks. 
Robert S. Sands: Well, thank you, everybody, for joining our call today. I would say that we are off to a solid start in fiscal 2010, despite the ongoing challenges from a tough macro environment that everybody is facing.  Now, during the quarter, we did decrease debt, we realized the benefit from our cost reduction efforts and in doing so, we improved our operating margins. I believe we are well-positioned to achieve our free cash flow and EPS goals for the year. I am especially excited about the implementation of our new distributor initiative and go-to-market strategy. We’ll certainly have more to say about this in the next coming weeks and next quarter when we talk to you again.  Now in addition, we are planning on an investor day in New York for the early to mid November timeframe, so stay tuned for the details on that. And thank you again for your participation and we hope you are able to enjoy some of our great products during the upcoming Fourth of July weekend.

Operator: My name is Julianne and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the FY 2009 Q3 Constellation Brands earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Welcome to Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2009 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. By now you should have had an opportunity to read our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. This conference call is intended to complement the release.  During the call we will discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable-, organic- and constant currency-basis. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's at www.cbrands.com under the Investor section. These reconciliations include explanations as to why management uses the non-GAAP financial measures and why management believes they are useful to investors. Discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results excluding acquisition-related costs, restructuring and related charges, and unusual items. We will also discuss organic net sales information, which is defined in the news release, and constant currency net sales information, which excludes the impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Please be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may affect the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. Thanks, and now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert S. Sands: Good morning and Happy New Year to everybody. I hope everybody had a great holiday season and perhaps the opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products. Well, welcome to our discussion of Constellation’s third quarter fiscal 2009 sales and earnings results. I am pleased to report that our third quarter marks the continuation of the momentum we gained in the first half of our fiscal year towards achieving our goals. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2009 we generated strong free cash flow, reduced our debt, significantly improved margins, and enhanced our ROIC. And we are tightening our EPS guidance range now that we have only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year. Although we continue to meet our earnings expectations, the economic environment remains extremely challenging and unpredictable. I would like to take a minute to discuss how are we managing the company in this environment. The following are some of the key strategies and actions we are taking to preserve the long-term health of the business:  First, we have taken a leadership role in taking prices with this key to managing cash, including taking all opportunities to optimize operating cash flow through working capital initiatives that focus on inventories, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. Second, we are improving our capital structure through rapidly deleveraging as we use the combination of strong operating cash flow generation and proceeds from the divestiture of non-core assets to pay down debt and optimize our portfolio. And I am especially pleased that we have been able to prepay a portion of our debt obligation for the next year, the details of which Bob will review in a few minutes. This continued deleveraging of our debt portfolio is our first priority for free cash flow and is a prudent strategy, given this challenging economic environment. Third, we are streamlining our organization through efforts such as the right-sizing of our Australian footprint to bring overhead in line with volume expectations. We have also started to reduce our European overhead structure to better reflect the realities of that market. Last, in addition to optimizing pricing, we are reducing costs in supply chain initiatives and tightening controls on SG&A spending to continue to leverage sales growth and to higher EPS growth. Collectively, these actions are being taken during the time of increasing financial market volatility and ongoing competitive challenges in our key geographies, a situation we are monitoring closely to ensure that we continue taking appropriate and timely actions in response to market place changes. Now I would like to focus on our operational business results for the third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, our consolidated net sales in the quarter were a bit below our expectations, primarily as a result of the adverse economic conditions we are facing around the world.  Despite these challenges, we continue to execute our strategy by pruning our portfolio via SKU reductions and taking selective pricing actions to offset duty and cost increases. These efforts help us to protect profit margins, free cash flow, and ROIC, which ends the appropriate trade off in this environment.  The good news is the consumers tend to purchase well-known trusted brands that represent good value during these challenging economic times. As you know, we offer an extensive selection of these kinds of well-established brands at varying price points that appeal to consumers. Looking at our U.S. wine business, overall we continued to improve the EBIT of the U.S. wine business as a result of the favorable profit mix generated from the acquisition of higher-profit premium brands, the divestiture of lower-margin value brands, and the resulting synergies generated by this ongoing, strategic portfolio transformation. However, as I indicated earlier, our sales are a bit below our expectations for a number of reasons. We continue to experience a slight slowing of the U.S. wine category’s market growth and category trading activity has slowed a bit. As you know, we have increased prices across the majority of our wine portfolio in the U.S. in order to enhance financial returns for the business. However, these pricing actions have unfavorably impacted volumes in the short term. Despite the slowing market growth I’ve just mentioned, according to recent 12-week IRI data the overall U.S. wine market, including the premium segment, remains healthy at mid-single digit growth rates. And many of our premium brands are exceeding this market growth trend, including Woodbridge, Nobilo, Estacsia, Toasted Head, Simi, Kim Crawford, and Wild Horse, just to name a few, all of which posted strong dollar growth during the latest 12-week IRI reporting period. As a reminder, the sales growth trajectory of our U.S. wine portfolio has also been impacted by the ongoing brand and SKU rationalization currently underway for our value wine portfolio, which is expected to negatively impact the growth rate of the portfolio by more than 2% in the fiscal year 2009, as it represents more than 25% of our U.S. wine SKUs. The massive majority of this initiative will be completed as we head into fiscal 2010. However, we may proactively discontinue additional, selected SKUs as we continue our efforts to focus on growing those products that generate ROIC enhancing growth and are incremental to our returns. Overall, we have been able to achieve significant operating leverage from EBIT growth despite a reduction in volume. We expect our sales growth for the U.S. wine business to return to levels that are more consistent with market growth as we lap price increases, which we expect to incur in the next few months. From an international perspective, our Canadian wine business posted strong results for the third quarter, primarily reflecting sales growth from our premium portfolio lead by brands such as Jackson-Triggs, Sawmill Creeks, Inniskillin, and Naked Grape. Our European sales are less than our expectations, driven by extreme market conditions, including the worsening economic climate in the U.K. and mainland Europe, price wars amongst U.K. off-premise retailers, and planned SKU reductions. In addition, unanticipated duty increases were recently implemented by the U.K. government in order to compliment their economic stimulus package. We immediately implemented additional price action to cover this duty increase. We are managing the situation in the U.K. by working to align our costs with our sales expectations, including the recently announced elimination of 50 positions. We intend to continue reducing our investment in the U.K. in the form of capital and operational costs as appropriate. In the short term, we are reviewing our strategy and assessing the alternatives for dealing with the challenging situation which continues to impact this business. We plan to stay the course in the growing U.K. market place and will continue to focus on increasing operating efficiencies and improving product and channel mix. We are currently in the process of bringing our new state-of-the-art distribution and bottling facility online in the United Kingdom. We expect to fully leverage the benefits of this investment, which will reduce the cost of production and distribution and significantly increase capacity and efficiencies and result in an improved environmental footprint. In Australia we have already taken actions to align the business with market place reality. This market place remains healthy and we are continuing our efforts to further premiumize our product portfolio. I would like to reiterate that our U.K. and Australia markets combined currently represent less than 10% of our total company EBIT and should therefore not cause a significant amount of operational volatility. During the third quarter the spirits segment posted a 5% organic sales increase, driven primarily by strong double-digit top-line and market growth for Svedka vodka, which continues to gain momentum in the form of increased distribution, national accounts penetration, and Clayburk SKU expansion within the product portfolio. In addition, Ridgemont Reserve 1792 bourbon, Black Velvet Reserve, Cara Bella, the [Viamari] family of products also delivered solid sales performance. Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture, the Crown portfolio generated 1% net sales growth in the third quarter. Improved sales for Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Negra Modelo, and Pacifico products were offset by weaker results for Corona Extra, which continued to be impacted by the adverse economic conditions in the larger volume Corona markets and unfavorable trends in the on-premise segment where Corona products are more heavily weighted versus the industry. We are beginning to benefit from narrowing price gaps versus competitors as they increase their prices to cover rising interest costs. Crown continues to explore new product introductions and packaging options across the portfolio. Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo Draft continue to be successful in test markets. During the third quarter operating income from the Crown Joint Venture remained unchanged versus last year’s third quarter as they have closely managed marketing and SG&A spend during these challenging economic times. In closing, we are working diligently to manage through an increasingly tough economic environment worldwide. Despite the challenges, beverage alcohol remains a growing, healthy consumer category and I am pleased with our ability to continue to deliver solid results and execute our strategy. And now I would like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our third quarter business results.
Robert P. Ryder: I think the third quarter reflects good performance in relatively challenging times. Despite some softness in our branded wine net sales performance, we were able to expand our profit margin and grow our comparable basis EBIT, EPS, and free cash flow. The higher margins generated by the pricing actions and portfolio transition in our U.S. wine business are evident in our income statement and help offset the challenging environment we face outside North America. Our comparable basis for diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.60 versus $0.50 per share last year and these are targeted former EPS goal to $1.68 through $1.72.  We generated $235.0 million in free cash flow through Q3 and we remain on track to reach our $360.0 million to $390.0 million free cash flow goal for fiscal 2009. The combination of free cash flow generation and asset sales has helped us decrease our total debt level by more than $475.0 million since the end of fiscal 2008 and increase our cash position more than $160.0 million. This has driven a significant reduction to our leverage and provides us with ample liquidity as we enter Q4 and fiscal 2010. Now let’s look at our Q3 fiscal 2009 P&L performance and my comments will focus on comparable basis financial results. Let’s look at net sales. As you can see from our news release on page 13, our consolidated reported net sales decreased 6%, primarily due to the impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuation. If anything, adding Clos du Bois sales was essentially offset by the divestitures of Almaden, Inglenook, and certain Pacific Northwest wine brands and in certain spirit contract production service business. On the organic constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange rate changes, net sales increased 1%.  My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Our worldwide branded wine organic net sales decreased 2%. Organic branded wine net sales for North America, which appears on page 12 of the release, increased 2%. Branded wine organic net sales for Europe and Australia/New Zealand decreased 11% and 2% respectively. As Rob mentioned, our growth has been impacted by a challenging worldwide economic environment, our price increases, and planned SKU reductions. We believe the price increases and SKU reductions were the appropriate actions to take and they are contributing to some pretty dramatic worldwide wine margin and ROIC enhancement. Our North American business remains very healthy and they are a leader in a profitable and growing category which holds up relatively well in most economic conditions.  The international business, primarily in the U.K., continues to be very challenging. We are undergoing various initiatives in the U.K. and Australia to increase our returns in these markets. Turning our attention to spirits, organic net sales increased 5%, led by a 60% growth in Svedka vodka. Now let’s look at our profits on a comparable basis using information on page 14 of the release. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 40%, up an impressive 3.7%. This reflects the benefits of implementing price increases across our markets and favorable product mix shifts from adding higher margin brands, like Clos du Bois and Wild Horse, and divesting the lower margin Almaden Inglenook brand. These actions reflect the benefit of our ongoing premiumization strategy and should drive long-term improvement to Constellation’s profit profile. Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 18.8% of net sales compared to 18% a year ago. Although actual SG&A expense decreased versus last year, due to the translation of foreign expenses, this FX impact was somewhat offset by higher marketing and stock compensation costs. These changes, combined with the negative impact of FX rates on sales drove the increase in SG&A as a percent of sales. Consolidated operating income increased 9% to $219.0 million and our operating margin increased a healthy 2.9% to 21.2%. I would now like to turn to our segment operating income results on page 11 of the release which will provide highlights of this theme. Wine segment operating income increased $20.0 million to $222.0 million. Profits benefited from pricing and targeted mix shift in the U.S. organic brands and the addition of Clos du Bois and Wild Horse, somewhat offset by the U.S. wine divestitures and U.K. performance. For the spirit segment, operating income decreased $3.0 million, primarily due to higher G&A costs. For the quarter, corporate number expenses totaled $22.0 million compared with $23.0 million for the prior year. Equity investment on the Crown Imports totaled $62.0 million which was even with the prior year. For the third quarter, Crown generated net sales of $555.0 million, an increase of 1% and operating income of $124.0 million, or flat with last year. Consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $76.0 million versus $75.0 million last year. Equity earnings for the quarter are comprised of $62.0 million from Crown with the remainder generated primarily from our Opus One Joint Venture. Interest expense for the quarter was $78.0 million, down 5% versus last year. The decrease in interest primarily reflects a decrease in our average interest rate during Q3 versus the prior year quarter, and LIBOR decrease for our variable rate debt. Now let’s take a look at our debt and cash. At the end of November our debt totaled $4.8 billion, which represents a $476.0 million decrease from our debt level at the end of 2008. During the same period our cash position increased $161.0 million to $181.0 million. The changes in debt and cash were primarily driven by strong free cash flow generation and proceeds from asset dispositions. At the end of the quarter we had approximately $2.2 billion in bank debt under our senior credit facility and $2.6 billion of fixed term and other debt. Our average interest rate for the third quarter was around 6.5%. We had $868.0 million of revolving credit available under our senior facility at the end of November.  In December we prepaid $195.0 million in term loans due in calendar 2009 under our senior credit facility. This represented our tranche A term loan payments that would have come due in March, June, and September 2009.  Factoring in this activity, we have only $79.0 million of tranche loans due in December 2009. In addition, $155.0 million of sterling notes are due in November 2009. We currently expect that both of these debt requirements will be met through next year’s free cash flow generation. As you can see, we are deleveraging at a rapid pace as our debt to comparable basis EBIT ratio at the end of November was 4.5 x versus the 5.3 x level at the end of February. This reflects our [inaudible] improvement and debt reduction. If you factor in the $195.0 million in debt prepayment that I just mentioned, the ratio decreased to 4.3 x and gets us to our low 4.0 x target for the year. Our comparable basis tax rate came in at 39% compared to 37% last year, as a higher percentage of our earnings are coming from North America. The higher rate was expected and already factored into our full year tax rate estimate as we continue to project our full year comparable basis tax rate to proximate 37%. Our weighted average diluted shares for the quarter totaled 220.0 million compared to 219.0 million last year. Due to the many factors just mentioned, diluted EPS was $0.60 a share versus $0.55 last year. Now let’s turn to our cash flow on page 10 of news release. For purposes of this discussion free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activity less capital. For the first nine months of fiscal 2009 we generated free cash flow of $235.0 million versus $173.0 million in the prior year. The improvement in net cash from operating activities reflects the benefit of approximately $85.0 million in pre-tax proceeds related to the favorable settlement of certain foreign currency hedges, which we announced in early December.  As we continue to refine certain international businesses we have been reducing our foreign exchange exposure by adjusting corporate parent loans for operating companies around the world. We accelerated these activities by narrowing to take advantage of the in-the-money hedges driven by the sudden strength of the U.S. dollar. The tax payment associated with these transactions are expected to occur in Q4 and we expect to realize approximately $50.0 million in after-tax proceeds for this activity this fiscal year. Operating cash flow has also been impacted by higher inventory, reflecting an increase in our Southern Hemisphere harvest intake. Additional capex for the first three quarters of fiscal 2009 totaled $96.0 million compared to $80.0 million for the same period last year. As mentioned earlier, for fiscal 2009 we are targeting free cash flow to be in the range of $360.0 million to $390.0 million. This includes capex in the range of $150.0 million to $170.0 million. Moving to our P&L outlook for fiscal year 2009, given the challenging economic environment impact in our key markets, we are adjusting our sales expectations for fiscal 2009. We expect to continue mitigating this impact by taking actions to reduce operating and borrowing costs. As a result, we are tightening our comparable basis for diluted EPS range to $1.68 to $1.72 from our previous estimate of $1.68 to $1.76. As reflected in the outlook section of the press release, we now expect reported net sales to decrease in the low- to mid-single digits, versus our previous mid-single digit estimate. For organic net sales we expect an increase of mid-single digits versus our previous mid-to high-single digit estimate. These estimates include the benefit of lapping the distributor inventory reduction initiative completed in the first half of fiscal 2008. Due to some anticipated favorability in average debt balances, interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $315.0 million to $320.0 million versus our previous guidance of $325.0 million to $335.0 million. This improvement, combined with cost containment efforts, helps offset the impact of lower net sales growth. We are now assuming the weighted average diluted shares will proximate 220.0 million. Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on page 17 of the news release. While favorable settlement of certain foreign currency hedges that I discussed earlier did not have an impact on income before taxes, in the quarter we recognized $0.15 of diluted EPS impact associated with income tax expense related to these transactions. This amount has been excluded from comparable earnings. We anticipate an additional $0.03 diluted EPS impact when income tax expense related to this activity to be recognized in Q4. The remaining charges recorded in the third quarter were primarily related to previously announced restructuring and business [inaudible]. Before we take your questions, I would like you to know that given the challenging environment, I am pleased with our results and I believe our actions and results continue to demonstrate our overall focus on improving our sales mix, increasing operating efficiencies, and implementing pricing to enhance overall margins and profitability. Our Q3 operating margin has improved 2.9%. Generally strong free cash flow as we target $360.0 million to $390.0 million for fiscal 2009 and paying down debt will rapidly reduce our debt to comparable basis EBIT ratio to 4.5 x. With that, we are happy to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Just listening to the SKU rationalization, do you feel that you have identified all the SKUs you will be discontinuing or are there more studies ahead of us and potentially a further cut in your brands and packages?
Robert S. Sands: As we discussed before, we are looking at three detailed, sort of gross margins are not alike SKU by SKU. That process continues and actually we will continue to that. So I would think we are going to continue to scale back on SKUs which can’t cover their inventory investment or just don’t make money for us. We want our sales guys focused on our most profitable products.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: As you think about your portfolio long term is there an overall margin you’re aiming for, after you are complete with this process, specific just to the wine business?
Robert S. Sands: No, I don’t think we are that far along in the process to say where we want our overall profit margins to be. I would say that is an ongoing effort.
Operator: Your next question comes from Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: If you can just give us a little bit more color in terms of consumer behavior across different price segments for all of your portfolio.
Robert S. Sands: You know, if you’re really talking about market conditions, I think starting in the United States, market conditions remain pretty healthy as measured by consumer take-away in our mid-single digit value growth for the wine business.  The spirit business has probably been impacted to the greatest extent with growth getting near flattish. But that hasn’t affected us particularly because we’ve got some very hot brands and they’re just on fire. The beer business has actually accelerated in general during the economic downturn, as you are probably aware, but driven I would say by the domestic premiums and the next tier up, which is in that market place.  If you look around the world, you are seeing somewhat similar trends. The U.K. has slowed down, I would say, to the greatest extent in terms of consumer take-away, on wines, which is really all we track in the U.K. and has gotten much closer to flattish in that market place. There is not a lot of data that has been published, just in the last year or so, on the holiday season. It’s probably on the top of everybody’s mind how was the holiday season. I would characterize it as is follows: In the U.S., in particular for beer, it wasn’t necessarily a stellar holiday season, but a lot of the IRI data that has been quoted is through 12/28 and whereas last year it was through 12/30. It does not include the last few days of selling prior to New Years. And one of the things that characterized this holiday season is consumers definitely waited until the last minute to do their shopping. So on beer I think that in the end it will probably wrap up to not be a fantastic holiday season but on the other hand I don’t think that it is going to wrap up to be as bad as the sort of currently published IRI data suggests. On wine, the anecdote right now, and I say anecdote because again we’ve got some IRI data through 12/28 that still lacks the last few days which are critical to understanding the holiday season, but anecdotally from our wholesalers and so forth, it appears that the wine consumer take-away was pretty good over the holiday season. So when everything is reconciled, we are hopeful that it is going to look pretty good. That’s pretty much where things stand as it relates to our principal product categories and markets.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: And then, if we look at your branded wine organic growth in North America in the third quarter of 2%, the way we should think about that number is, if you adjust for the SKU rationalization, you get to about 4% and that compares to about a mid-single digit growth for the category and the difference, maybe, that you’re taking more pricing for that [inaudible] brand a little bit in the near term, is that a fair assessment?
Robert S. Sands: I would say that that is a fair assessment. I wouldn’t say that our sales results were optimal, but clearly at the lower end of our range of expectations, or slightly below. I don’t think that they are bad, given the market place and the economic conditions.  And more importantly, as you pointed out, given our pricing, we have led in pricing in every market that we’re in in the world. And in this economic environment I would be the first to say that our pricing actions have probably impacted volume to a slightly greater degree than we anticipated and that’s why we said that our sales were being affected by the economic environment. That being said, we are 100% positive that the pricing actions that were taken are the right thing to be doing. Worrying about a point of volume growth, or two points of volume growth, in this environment, in certainly our opinion, is not where our focus should be. Our focus is on improving margins, generating free cash flow, paying debt, and improving our ROIC. And we think that that is the key and prudent course of action in managing the business in difficult economic times. So yes, our sales results are being affected by our pricing to a greater degree than we anticipated, whereas the lower end is slightly below, actually, our previous range of expectations on sales growth. We have modified that to low-single digits. We are taking into account, or adding back, the distributor inventory reduction last year. But we don’t see this as being a material issue for the company, given the economic environment.
Operator: Your next question comes from Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital: You talked about the price mix improvement driving your earnings. What was the blended average price mix that you may have realized? Is there such a data point that you could come up with?
Robert S. Sands: I would say there are a couple of things going on. I would say a shift in sales and profits from Europe where the fundamental markets are lower to the U.S. helps increase the total portfolio gross profit margin, but also if you focus on within North America, if you say that our margins went up close to 400 basis points, probably 60% of that is price mix and the other 40% is the Almaden, Inglenook, Clos du Bois impact.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital: You’ve been paying down debt and obviously reducing leverage, creating more financial flexibility the last 6 to 18 months. Is there more to do on that front for the next quarter or are you close to where you want to be from a leverage standpoint?
Robert P. Ryder: We anticipate continuing paying down debt. The fourth quarter is generally our largest cash flow quarter and we anticipate using that free cash flow to pay down additional debt.  We also, as we’ve done this year, we will continue to look at our portfolio to see if there are other assets that we should be monetizing. Just to look at it from a shareholder value perspective, if they can’t cover our weighted average cost of capital, we should be liquidating them and paying down debt. It’s an ongoing strategy but I would say overall we would be much happier with a EBITDA leverage ratio around the 3.0 x to 3.5 x.  On an ongoing basis, if a great acquisition opportunity popped up, of which there are none right now, we want to have powder dry in order to drive after those.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital: And speaking of that, do you see any potential M&A activity occurring in the alcoholic beverage space that would be of interest to you in the foreseeable future?
Robert S. Sands: It’s hard to comment on that because these things come in fits and spurts. Clearly, as I’ve said in the past, right now our focus is on the things that I’ve said that we’re focusing on, i.e. cash flow generation, debt pay down. We have consistently said that we are not categorically saying that we won’t do acquisitions, but the environment hasn’t been particularly conducive to that at the current time and we made some great acquisition, we’ve got a lot to do and continue to do with the company in our portfolio. So we don’t feel compelled to have to go out and do anything.  And as Bob said, relative to dispositions, we’re going to continue to look at the portfolio and keep working, making adjustments to favor our higher growth, higher ROIC businesses, and to eliminate businesses that don’t cover their cost of capital and are a drag on our ROIC growth. Hence, you are seeing very good progress in ROIC growth in the companies. We are fundamentalists into what drives shareholder value. And we believe what, on a fundamental basis, what drives shareholder value is in driving ROIC in excess of the weighted average cost of capital. So that’s what we are going to continue to strive to achieve as a corporation. That is the key in the end and is the most fundamental thing to improve shareholder value.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lauren Torres - HSBC.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: In the quarter there was a notable decline in your cost of goods as a percentage of sales. And I assume much of this is attributable to SKU reductions and your mix changes. But you also talked about supply chain improvement. I was just hoping you could give us a sense of how much of this came from these changes in your portfolio versus your ability to manage costs better going forward?
Robert P. Ryder: I would say that the wide majority of that is coming through pricing and eliminating unprofitable or lower gross profit margin SKUs and the mix shift. Sort of the organic mix shift that is happening generally in the wine category as people trade up to higher priced wines. The higher priced wines generally have the higher gross profit margin. And the relatively big shift from taking on Clos du Bois, which is at the higher end of wine gross profit margins and selling Almaden and Inglenook, which was on the lower end of wine gross profit margins.
Lauren Torres - HSBC:  What we saw in this quarter, as a percentage of sales, that’s kind of low because of the change and that should get higher or something back to where we were before or stay at that level?
Robert P. Ryder: If you look at year-to-date gross profit margins, it is also much improved. I think you will be seeing, certainly the Almaden, Inglenook, Clos du bois transactions, that’s a permanent increase to our gross profit margin as a company.  And that was the purpose of it. Number one, the category that Clos du Bois and Wild Horse participate in, that category of wine in the U.S. is growing faster than the category, the price points, of Almaden and Inglenook. So it helped our sales growth profile and it helped our gross profit profile because the Clos du Bois has a much higher gross profit margin than Almaden. And that is a permanent improvement in the U.S.’s gross profit.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: Rob, on the last call you talked about grape supply coming in and prices going up. I was curious if there was any update there with respect to grape prices going forward.
Robert S. Sands: No. Obviously we are way away from the next U.S. harvest. We are getting closer to the Australian harvest, which is a big piece of our grape costs, which will start occurring early spring. And we expect grape prices in the Australian harvest to go down dramatically. So we would be looking at double-digit declines in grape pricing in the Australian harvest. Again, it hasn’t happened yet. Harvests are very unpredictable. No one can tell you what any harvest is actually going to be much before the harvest has actually happened, but the belief is that the Australian grape harvest will result in significantly reduced grape costs. Now, that being said, remember that the grapes go into making the wine, the wine goes into inventory, and therefore the lower grape costs are delayed in terms of when they flow through the P&L. You get a small benefit in the current year and then you start seeing the benefits in the subsequent years. So, Australian harvest, lower cost. California harvest, no one knows what the California harvest is going to look like in next August, September, October. But I would say most people believe that the California harvest is going to remain in a fairly balanced state to slightly favoring under-supply, which might suggest that there should be some cost inflation in grapes out of California, especially on certain varieties that are tending to be in shorter supply. So if I were going to predict anything on the California harvest, as I said, balance to slight under-supply therefore some cost increases and of course, that’s what we’re sort of planning on. We don’t see it as a problem. On the other hand, the pricing environments align, we’re certainly leading price increases, others are taking price increases, so moving to slight under-supply is not a bad thing.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christine Farkas - Banc of America Securities.
Christine Farkas - Banc of America Securities: Bob, back to costs, but moving to the operating expense line, you talked about higher marketing spend on a dollar-for-dollar basis, yet you talked about lower investments in the U.K. and I imagine Australia. So where is the spend growing and in what form? Is it largely spirits? Is it feet on the street? How should we look at that higher marketing spend by segment?
Robert P. Ryder: Actually the U.K., year-over-year, did have a higher marketing spend in this quarter. The statement that I made that we are looking to reduce costs in the U.K. is more around we recently took 50 heads out of the business. So it’s more me looking at that. But a big piece of the marketing increase for the quarter was in the U.K. Basically in the U.K. and the U.S. and a little bit in the spirits business.
Christine Farkas - Banc of America Securities: And in terms of marketing spend going forward or allocating that, because your pricing is up so we’re not talking about promotions, how should we look at that marketing spend? Again, is it feet on the street or direct sales? Is it increase in advertising on particular brands? How should we look at that, generally?
Robert S. Sands: It’s marketing and therefore it’s not sales and therefore it’s non-price related. So it is various forms of marketing activity, on-premise mostly.
Christine Farkas - Banc of America Securities: And just moving to Corona, you talked about the trends there. Perhaps you can talk about geographic movements. Are there any surprises in terms of what markets may have recovered, may not have recovered by now?
Robert S. Sands: Recovered in terms of what?
Christine Farkas - Banc of America Securities: Just with price gaps potentially narrowing, lapping price increases in prior years. There could have been some recovery in the Corona brand in some geographic pockets. I’m just curious if you have any commentary as to what’s slower than expected or what’s better than expected.
Robert S. Sands: First of all, the data that is flowing in, up to the very most recent period, which I told you is somewhat problematic because there are some comparison issues, have shown in general I would say some constant improvement in the Crown business. You are talking beer, right?
Christine Farkas - Banc of America Securities: That’s right.
Robert S. Sands: There is some improvement in the business. Again, on a general basis, our competitors are all taking pricing. We took our pricing going on a couple of years ago and we really don’t have any need to take any further pricing at the current track. We are seeing the price gap, pretty much all over the country, declining and narrowing.  We have a fairly aggressive program that we are putting in place in the beer business around the country and therefore I would say that as we move into 2009 the competitive environment for the Crown portfolio is going to improve very significantly. So we’re optimistic in terms of seeing some rebound and regains of momentum in that portfolio in 2009. And as I said, the economic conditions aside, the competitive conditions should be very favorable for that. Now the economy, that’s another story and it’s not something that’s in our control so we’re focusing on what is in our control and that’s monitoring the market very closely, monitoring those price gaps, execution in the market place, and executing, as I said, new and aggressive promotional programs that should drive results.
Operator: Your next question comes from Carla Casella - JP Morgan.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan: I missed one comment you made on the revolver availability, and did you also give the outstanding amount under the revolver?
Robert P. Ryder: There’s no outstanding amount under the revolver because we have a net cash position at the end of the quarter. So we paid the entire revolver down.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan: And availability, that is the full $900.0 million less how much you now [inaudible]?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, it’s like $870.0 million available.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan: And then, I’m wondering if you could comment on any potential acquisition opportunities. Is it completely off the table for now or is there anything in the spirit side that you would look at, given Fortune’s comments that they may divest some more brands?
Robert S. Sands: What I said was our focus is not on acquisitions but we are not categorically rejecting it. On the other hand, if acquisitions come up on an opportunistic basis, there is really nothing to comment on relative to acquisitions unless and until something develops to state where we would be, when we would normally comment on it. So not a focus for the company at the current time. On the other hand, we’re not categorically rejecting the idea. But the current environment hasn’t been one that necessarily favors M&A. And in the past we’ve been very aggressive in M&A so we’re focused on integrating the acquisitions that we made a year plus ago and bringing home the bacon on those deals. Clos du Bois, Wild Horse, those are the things that right now we’re focused on.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan: If you look across your different geographies, can you give us a sense of what percentage of the business is on-premise versus off-premise? How much that varies market by market?
Robert S. Sands: It depends on the category and this and that. U.S., talking wine, it’s probably about 70% off premise, 30% on-premise. Beer is a higher percentage than the 30%. If you go to the U.K. I would say it’s still around that 70/30, maybe a little less. Again, talking wine, which is all that matters really. And much beyond that you’re starting to talk about pretty small markets where there’s not much to talk about. And our spirits business is a very small percentage of our business overall, so the spirits business in general is, while we’re in the more popular end, being in the more mid-premium to value end of the business, we would be skewed more off-premise than the normal spirits business would be. So the majority would be off-premise for us.
Carla Casella - JP Morgan: On interest rates, have you locked in on your term loans any of your LIBOR rates?
Robert P. Ryder: We have interest rates locked in place, about $800.0 million of our bank debt is floating and we can lock that in on a 30/60/90 day LIBOR basis. We should be benefiting from that as we go forward. But again, it’s a pretty small piece of our debt portfolio.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co.
Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co.: You made a big push in Walmart and the clubs and just those categories or those channels have been hot. Can you give us an update on how that’s working out for you?
Robert S. Sands: We are definitely seeing those categories perform and grow for our business as well as in the market place in general at a higher rate, but our business it is a significantly higher rate. Those channels are to a much greater extent outperforming pretty much other channels in general. It’s no surprise those channels are growing in the U.S. in general. One of the aspects of the economic downturn is not only venue shift from on-premise to off-premise but then within the off-premise from the more traditional retail channels with chains to the mass merchandisers. So from an alcoholic beverage standpoint they’re benefiting and our business is benefiting there. And we are a leader and we are a leader in that category. We are one of the key one or two players in those channels. We are either category captains or we’re validating. It’s an important channel for us and we’re doing well in it.
Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co.: You have talked a few times about the U.K. is getting small enough so that it doesn’t really wag the dog too much but is there a risk that you could lose money there on a sustainable basis or are you pretty on top of that to make sure that we don’t have losses.
Robert S. Sands: The latter. We’re on top of that to make sure that we don’t have losses.
Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Just in spirits, you mentioned the great performance with Svedka, which I have to take my hat off to you since I criticized that acquisition, but Baron and Black Velvet, any specifics on performance there? I understand Black Velvet has been fairly strong as well.
Robert S. Sands: Yes, Black Velvet is outperforming the market place. I think it’s up about 6% right now, which for a mature brand is huge. Tremendous great margins on that product. If you look at Svedka and you look at Black Velvet, that’s 50% of our spirits business. At least from a profitability basis.  And Svedka, I’ve got to tell you. Before we used to say it’s one of a couple of major premium spirits brands that are growing at these very high rates of 50% to 60%. Today it is the only major premium spirits brand that has continued to grow at that rate. The Gray Goose’s of the world, [other premiums], they have all slowed down tremendously; still growing, still healthy, but slowed down to more normalized growth levels. Svedka, if anything, is accelerating as we sit here speaking. It’s up in the 60% growth range and a multi-million case brand. And Black Velvet, as mid-premium spirits brand, is also clearly benefiting from this economy. As well as I think superlative execution by our people and we are looking at opportunities for that brand, for new packaging and ways to continue to make that brand relative to the consumer and actually take advantage of the current trend towards mid-premium spirits brand.  So we’re pretty excited about, especially, those two brands, Black Velvet and Svedka.
Operator: Your final question comes from Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: On North American wine, it sounds like you’re happy with how that pricing has worked out and what that’s meant on the volume side. It’s kind of a good trade. Can you talk a bit about what you saw over the holidays from the competition in terms of promotional activity in the wine business? And as I ask that, it seems like there’s a bit of an analogy here between where beer was a year or a year and a half ago with having taken price. Thought it was the right thing to do for the brand but in time it proved to create some volume problems that were greater than what you had anticipated. I’m just trying to get my arms around the risk, if you will, that these price, which has been good for you in the wine business, has to come off to an extent simply because of what’s going on with the consumer and because it creates some opportunity for competitors.
Robert S. Sands: I will answer that in a couple of different ways. First of all, promotional activity is fairly intensive in the wine business and the holiday season and it certainly has benefited some of the lower end brands and lower end companies, like the Sutter Homes wine group, Gallo. But not anything that we’re particularly concerned with and often in price categories and price segments that we’re not that interested in, low margin, low return kind of stuff. Now, relative to your analogy to the beer business, number one, what you said about the domestic beer business I would say is true. There is one notable and very important exception to that. I think that the domestic beer business started to rely upon pricing to the exclusion of innovation. And the pricing was probably the right thing to do in the beer business but it should have been coupled with continuous innovation.  Then they woke up one day, duh, we forgot part two, and they started going very heavy on part two and you’ve seen a lot of the benefit of that actually, in the beer business, over the last year or two as they have kind of gotten back on track. So that didn’t render the pricing initiatives that they had taken historically the wrong decision to make, it’s just that they kind of took their foot off the innovation pedal and then they put it back on. The wine business, okay, we’re taking the pricing, but we are continuously also refining the portfolio with new products, new innovative brands that are taking advantage of new consumer trends. Whether it’s the single variety kind of brands that are taking advantage of trends for consumers wanting to drink new varieties, like Argentinean malbec, so we have a new Argentinean malbec brand. Consumers discovering Spanish tampranillo. We’ve got a relatively new Spanish tampranillo brand which is focused purely on the brand, that variety. Without belaboring the point, pricing without innovation, yeah, you’ll eventually, if you don’t do anything, you will start seeing consumer resistance and you will see volumes hurt. So you have to couple that with new product extensions, new packaging. I’m not here to taut any competitors, but as a Coor’s has done, or others, this type of action is when pricing coupled with innovation I think is what really works. So that’s what we’re focused on. Another example is something like our Black Box, which has turned into a multi-million case brand. Premium, 3-liter, bag in the box. It has really taken off in this particular market place. And new packaging.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: As it relates to beer, you commented about new and aggressive promotions planned for the various Modelo brands. Can you give us a better understanding of what you mean by that and within that to what extent is it shifting money around from using more at the consumer level to moving it more to the trade level and to what extent it’s really an absolute increase in the amount of dollars per case that you’re putting behind your brand?
Robert S. Sands: There will be some increases in that regard which we expect to drive additional volume so more plug. It’s not so much a shift because we’re going to maintain our strong consumer marketing program, but there will be additional promotional activity in the market place, which we have found to be very effective in terms of driving volume, and from our profitability perspective as we have tested certain configurations of promotional activity and marketing. Clearly, when we talk about a promotional activity, what we’re talking about are efforts to really drive merchandising activity. Features and displays, coupled with strong consumer offers at retail. This is the key to driving basically volume growth in beer and in the beverage/alcohol business in general. Strong merchandising, which is giving featured displays, coupled with ads, coupled with strong consumer promotional activity.  So this is what we are focusing on and when we talk about strong execution in the market place, what we mean by that is the degree to which we are able to achieve that three-pronged type of activity at retail which drives consumer take-away.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: On restructuring, looking at the whole scope of the organization, BCG has been helping you in some regards. You talked a little bit about SKU rationalization, but did you think about opportunities from where you are right now to take out further structural costs, whether it is here in the U.S. or in another part of your business. I know there are constraints to what you can say here but can you give us some idea about what opportunity remains and any incremental color about what you see going forward?
Robert S. Sands: As you said, and first of all, when it comes to restructuring activities, until we have a restructuring activity to comment on, we’re not going to comment in advance on restructurings that haven’t happened. So, we don’t have any at the current moment in time but that being said, we are looking at the business and we are looking at ways to optimize the business. Our preference is to do it outside the context of restructuring if we can, not that we don’t look for restructuring, at least from a financial perspective, per se. We would rather be able to optimize the business through organic activities.  But if restructuring opportunities come down the line, which represent good investment, and I have told you this before, we look at restructuring opportunities strictly as investments, and we look at it strictly from a return on investment point of view. If a restructuring opportunity comes down the road that represents a very high return project, and we don’t do those things if they are a moderate return or a low return. We look for high double-digit return when we execute restructuring activities. And if those kind of opportunities come down the road, just like any other investment, if you’ve got the opportunity to make an investment that has a high probability of generating a double-digit return, we will take advantage of that. But nothing planned at the current time that we can talk about.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Robert S. Sands: Thank you for joining our call today. Needless to say, I’m pretty pleased, especially in this economic environment, with our results for the quarter. And I summarize the highlights as follows: number one, we’ve led the market in pricing; number two, we have significantly improved gross margins and operating margins, generated some free cash flow, delivered improved profitability of our North American wine business, improved ROIC to targeted levels for the year; and in addition we have increased our free cash flow guidance for the year and prepaid a significant portion of next year’s debt obligation. Our plan is to continue this strong execution throughout the final quarter of the year and finally, we will be providing guidance for our fiscal year 2010 during our next quarterly conference call scheduled for early April.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call.

Operator:  Welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Patty Yahn-Urlaub:  Welcome to Constellation's second quarter fiscal 2009 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.  By now you should have had an opportunity to read our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. This conference call is intended to complement the release.  During the call we will discuss financial information on a GAAP-comparable, organic and constant currency basis. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's at www.cbrands.com under the Investor section. These reconciliations include explanations as to why management uses the non-GAAP financial measures and why management believes they are useful to investors.  Discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results excluding acquisition-related costs, restructuring and related charges, and unusual items. We will also discuss organic net sales information, which is defined in the news release, and constant currency net sales information which excludes the impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Please be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may affect the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. Thanks, and now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.
Robert S. Sands:  Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's second quarter sales and earnings results. We are pleased with our quarterly results, which were in line with our expectations and clearly demonstrate that we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2009 financial goals. In second quarter, we generated strong free cash flow, significantly reduced our debt, improved our comparable basis operating margin and ROIC, and reaffirmed our comparable EPS guidance for the year. We are particularly pleased with our ability to rapidly deleverage using a combination of free cash flow and proceeds from the sale of assets. From an operational perspective, we improved operating margins for both our Wine and Spirits businesses by improving our sales mix and increasing prices to offset rising input costs. Collectively, these actions have been completed during a time of increasing financial market volatility and ongoing competitive challenges in some key markets. During the quarter, we began the process of right-sizing our Australian wine operation, which includes the planned sale of production facilities and vineyard properties, consolidation of bottling operations, and the rationalization of our extensive portfolio with the elimination of more than 30% of our SKUs. This initiative is part of our ongoing effort to enhance operating efficiencies and improve cash flow and return on invested capital.  In the second quarter, we also sold U.S. wine brands and assets that were acquired with the Clos du Bois transaction as well as some of our Pacific Northwest facilities and brands from Washington State and Idaho. We received more than $200 million in proceeds from the sale of these assets, which were used to reduce debt during the quarter. Now looking at our U.S. Wine business, this will be the last period that we will be comparing for the cycling of our fiscal 2008 U.S. distributor wine inventory reduction initiative, which benefited this year's second quarter results by approximately $30 million in sales and $0.04 in EPS. Above and beyond this benefit, we've continued to improve the EBIT of the U.S. wine business as a result of the favorable product mix created from the acquisition of higher-profit premium brands, the divestiture of lower-margin value brands, and the resulting synergies generated by this ongoing portfolio transformation. Nevertheless, sales for our U.S. Wine business for the quarter were a bit below our expectations for the following reasons: First, we've seen a slight slowing of U.S. wine category market growth, although current growth levels remain solid. Second, in an ongoing effort to enhance the profitability of the business, we have taken the lead in increasing prices across the majority of our wine portfolio in the U.S. These pricing actions have resulted in increased profitability in the form of overall margin improvement and enhanced ROIC for our U.S. Wine business, although volumes have been unfavorably impacted in the short term.  Despite the slowing market growth trend I just mentioned, according to the recent 12-week IRI data, the U.S. premium plus wine market remains healthy, at a growth rate of mid single digits. And many of our premium plus brands are exceeding this market growth trend, including Woodbridge, Estancia, Toasted Head, Simi, Kim Crawford, and the recently acquired Wild Horse brand, all of which posted strong growth during the latest 12-week IRI reporting period.  As expected the sales growth trajectory of our U.S. wine portfolio has been impacted by the ongoing brand and SKU rationalization currently under way for our value wine portfolio. Upon completion of this initiative, we will have discontinued more than 25% of the SKUs in our total U.S. wine portfolio. Although this represents a small number of cases, it is expected to negatively impact the growth rate of our portfolio by more than 2% in fiscal 2009.  We expect our sales growth for the U.S. Wine business to return to levels that are more consistent with market growth as we lap price increases and our SKU rationalization initiative and we complete the integration and restructuring activity associated with our recent acquisitions and divestitures.  From a U.S. wine marketing perspective, we will be launching a new Robert Mondavi brand equity campaign to honor the legacy of the iconic California wine pioneer, Robert Mondavi. As you know, the Robert Mondavi brand has become one of the most important, recognized and valuable brand franchises in the world. We are taking this opportunity to leverage the tremendous power of the franchise with new brand positioning and a new print campaign. This initiative will become visible in the market in the coming weeks. As is typical at this point of the year, I'd like to provide an update relating to the U.S. grape progress, which is almost 75% complete at this point. This year's harvest is expected to produce quality output despite a spring frost, extended summer heat, and extreme winds during the bloom period. Although there are divergent estimates from varying sources relative to the expected size of this year's harvest, we are currently estimating that the 2008 U.S. industry harvest may potentially decline as much as mid single digits from last year's harvest. Prices for grapes are expected to increase in the high single-digit range, reflecting tightening supply for key varietals, the Pinot Grigio, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Cabernet. Overall, these trends are expected to keep supply and demand generally in balance, with a bias towards tightening supply. Although we may feel some pressure from a COGS perspective, we expect a more favorable pricing environment to more than offset these COGS increases.  Our Canadian Wine business posted strong results for the second quarter, primarily reflecting sales growth from our premium portfolio, led by brands such as Jackson-Triggs, Inniskillin and Naked Grape.  Although conditions remain challenging in our international Wine business, we are working toward increasing the overall profitability of this business by taking pricing, although doing so has negatively impacted volume. We are well positioned with retailers for the upcoming holiday selling season in our key international market and we are progressing as planned with our business realignment activities in Australia. I'd like to reiterate that the U.K. and Australian-New Zealand market combined currently represent 10% of our total company EBIT and should, therefore, not cause a significant amount of operational volatility.  During the second quarter, the Spirits segment posted increased sales and operating profit, driven primarily by strong double-digit top line and market growth for premium products, including SVEDKA Vodka, Black Velvet Canadian Whisky, and Effen Vodka. In addition, Ridgemont Reserve 1792 Bourbon, 99 Schnapps, Caravella and Meukow Cognac also delivered solid sales performance. The strong momentum surrounding SVEDKA continues to build from increased distribution points and promotional activities as well as continued expansion outside the U.S.  During the quarter, we also closed on the sale of our Valleyfield, Quebec facility, which was primarily a contract production site for other suppliers.  These efforts streamline operations, improve efficiencies and allow us to eliminate excess capacity while reducing costs and enhancing ROIC.  Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. The Crown portfolio generated 1% net sales growth in the second quarter. Strong sales for Corona Light and Modelo Especial, Negra Modelo and Pacifico products were offset by weaker trends for Corona Extra, which continues to be impacted by adverse economic conditions in large Corona markets, including California, Arizona and Florida. As we discussed, there has also been competitive product introductions tied to the Corona brand which may have had some impact during the summer selling season. However, the continued success of these product introductions remain uncertain with the close of the summer.  We are expecting improving results for Crown in the second half of the year as we lap easier comparisons. In addition, most competitors have publicly indicated that they will begin to increase prices in order to offset rising input costs. We expect these activities to better align price gaps versus competition at more normalized levels as the significant price discounting which permeated the summer selling season is expected to dissipate. New product introductions are expected to increase our share of shelf space at retail. They include the Corona 18-pack, the Corona Light tall can and [Coranedo] Light, and we are currently market testing Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo draft in selected U.S. cities.  We'd originally estimated Crown depletion rates for fiscal 2009 in the mid single-digit range. Now that we have reached the halfway point for the year, we are revising our depletion estimate for fiscal 2009 to a rate that is about flat to slightly positive. Despite this revision, I want to reiterate that the Crown portfolio is healthy, execution at retail is strong, with several promotional activities, market programs and new product introductions in place for the remainder of the year. In September, we have begun to see positive growth trends for the entire Crown portfolio, with Corona Extra returning to growth and other brands growing at high single-digit rates.  Now before I turn the call over to Bob, I'd like to address the issue of rising input costs as I'm frequently asked about the magnitude of this impact on our business. As you know, grape purchases represent approximately 40% to 50% of our COGS spend. The cost drivers for this agricultural business are generally unrelated to the current macro factors affecting other COGS components, such as higher energy costs. We currently contract approximately 90% of our grape meat from grape suppliers around the world. Packaging represents the next largest COGS component, including glass, labels and closures, followed by transportation costs, many of which have obviously been impacted by rising energy costs.  Overall, we estimate that rising input costs have negatively impacted our COGS in the single-digit range; however, we have increased at a rate that offsets the unfavorable cost impact.  In closing, I'm pleased with the results in the second quarter. We continue to execute on all fronts, both tactically and strategically, despite challenges from marketplace dynamics. We are entering our strongest seasonal period and believe we are well positioned to achieve our goals for the year. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our second quarter business results. 
Robert P. Ryder:  Our comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $0.45 versus $0.35 last year. This, combined with our Q1 results, puts us on a path to achieving our full year EPS goal of $1.68 to $1.76.  We generated $125 million of free cash flow in the first half of the year and remain on track to reach our $310 to $340 million free cash flow goal for fiscal 2009.  Our deleveraging efforts have driven more than a $400 million decrease in our total debt level since fiscal 2008 year end.  Now let's look at our Q2 fiscal 2009 P&L performance, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results.  First, net sales. As you can see from our news release on Page 13, our consolidated reported net sales increased 7%, primarily reflecting [inaudible] wine sales, including the net benefit of adding brands like [inaudible] and Wild Horse and divesting [inaudible] and certain Pacific Northwest wine brands.  On an organic constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the growth rate was 6%. This growth rate includes the benefit of overlapping our initiatives to reduce distributor wine inventories in the U.S., which negatively impacted net sales in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2008. My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis: Our worldwide branded wine organic net sales increased 4%. Organic branded wine geographic net sales for North America, which appears on Page 12 of the release, increased 7%. This reflects the overlap of reducing U.S. wine distributor level last year and solid growth in Canada. Branded wine organic net sales for Europe and Australia-New Zealand decreased 3% and 1%, respectively. To improve margins and enhance our ROIC for our international businesses, we have been implementing price increases which have impacted volume growth in the near term. In the U.K., we implemented a mid single-digit price increase in January to cover cost increases and followed that up with another increase in March to offset the U.K. duty increase. These actions have been supported with increased marketing investments. In Australia, we also increased prices last March in the mid single-digit range after we had already reduced some of our price promotion activity. Volumes in these geographies were also impacted by skew reductions of certain lower-margin brands related to our business restructuring and realizing activities for our New Zealand operations. We expect to see some negative impact on volumes from the skew reductions for the balance of the fiscal year. The markets remain very challenging and the pricing environment is quite tight.  Turning our attention to Spirits, net sales increased 4%, led by double-digit growth from SVEDKA Vodka, Black Velvet Whisky and Effen Vodka brands. As discussed in our recent conference calls, we estimated the [inaudible] to distributor inventory reduction initiative had a one-time impact of $110 million to net sales and comparable EPS impact of about $0.15. Approximately 25% of that impact - or about $30 million net sales and $0.04 for EPS came in the second quarter of fiscal 2008.  Adjusting for the $30 million net sales impact in Q2 last year, we estimate consolidated organic net sales on a constant currency basis grew in the low single digits. This is a little bit below our mid single-digit target, due in part to the lower U.K. and Australia-New Zealand sale performance for the regions I just discussed.  North American organic branded wine on a constant currency basis grew in the low single digits after adjusting for the distributor inventory impact. And volumes in the U.S. have also been impacted by the near-term skew reductions and price increases.  Now let's look at our profit on a comparable basis using information from Page 14 of the release. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 37.6%, up an impressive 2.4 percentage points. This reflects the benefits of implementing price increases in our North American and international markets and favorable product mix shift from adding the higher margin brands like [inaudible] and divesting the lower-margin [inaudible] brands. The overlap of the distributor inventory initiative also provided a bit of operating leverage versus the second quarter last year. These activities should drive a long-term improvement to Constellation's profit profile and reflect the benefits of our [premiere-ization] strategy. Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 22.4% of net sales compared with 21.2% a year ago. This increase reflects increased marketing investments behind branded wine in the U.K., hedging [inaudible] and higher costs for stock compensation and professional services. This was partially offset by the impact of lapping the distributor inventory initiative.  Consolidated operating income increased to $146 million from $125 million for the prior year, and our operating margin increased 1.3 percentage points to 15.3%.  I'd now like to turn to our segment operating income results on Page 11 of the release and to [inaudible] highlights of these changes.  Wine segment operating income increased $24 million to $149 million. This was primarily due to the contributions of [inaudible] and Wild Horse brands, including related synergies, in higher net sales as we overlap the reduction of U.S. distributor wine inventories. These benefits were partially offset by the divestiture of Almaden, Inglenook, and certain Pacific Northwest wine brands. For the Spirits segment, operating income increased $2 million and operating margin increased 1.5 percentage points. This reflects positive mix shift and reduced SG&A.  For the quarter, Corporate [inaudible] expenses totaled $26 million compared with $21 million for the prior year. The increase primarily includes higher consultant fees associated with [inaudible] Australian business and other prospects of [inaudible] opportunity, stock compensation expense, as well as additional costs to support the growth of the company.  Equity investment earnings of Crown totaled $74 million compared to $79 million in the prior year. For the second quarter, Crown generated net sales of $732 million, an increase of 1%, and operating income of $149 million, a decrease of 5%. The operating income decrease was primarily driven by contractual increases in product costs and year-over-year timing of marketing activity. As a reminder, over the first five years of the initial 10-year term, the joint venture agreement calls for an annual increase in the [cost] of products acquired from [inaudible] Modelo, which we believe are below [inaudible] inflationary levels.  Interest expense for the quarter was $81 million, down 7% over last year. The decrease primarily reflects a decrease in our average interest rate during Q2 versus the prior year quarter.  Now let's take a look at our debt. At the end of August, our debt totaled $4.8 million, which represents a $420 million decrease of our debt level at the end of fiscal 2008. The decrease as primarily driven by $204 million net proceeds received in early June from the sale of certain winery assets and our free cash flow generation. At the end of the quarter we had approximately $2.3 billion of bank debt under our senior credit facility and $2.5 billion fixed term and other debt. Our average interest rate for the second quarter was around 6.3%.  We had $845 million of revolving credit under our senior facility at the end of August. We believe there is no issue accessing this facility, which is in place through June 2011. The next significant funding requirement is the maturity of 155 million of pound sterling notes due in November '09.  We continue to deleverage at a rapid pace, as our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of August was 4.6 times versus the 5.3 times level at the end of February. This reflects our commitment to price improvement and debt reduction. With the strong free cash flow and earnings improvement plan for fiscal 2009 combined with the asset sale proceeds just mentioned, we continue to believe we can reduce this ratio to the low 4 times range by the end of fiscal 2009.  Our comparable basis tax rate came in at 29% compared to 35% last year. The lower rate drove some favorability in the quarter and reflects the settlement of certain tax positions during the second quarter. This benefit was already factored in our full year tax rate projections, as we continue to project our full year comparable base rate to approximate 37%.  Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled $229 million compared to $209 million last year. Due to the many factors just mentioned, diluted EPS was $0.45 a share versus $0.35 last year.  Now let's turn to cash flow on Page 10 of the news release. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less Capex. For the first half of '09, we generated free cash flow of $125 million versus $131 in the prior year. Net cash from operating activities was consistent with last year, and the increase in net income plus non-cash items was offset by a higher net use of working capital.  We have seen higher inventory through an increase in our Southern hemisphere harvest intake and higher accounts receivable as they increase sales versus the prior year.  Additionally, Capex for the first half of '09 totaled $52 million compared to $47 million for the same period last year.  As mentioned earlier, in fiscal '09 we are targeting free cash flows in the range of $310 to $340 million. This includes Capex in the range of $150 to $170 million.  Moving toward P&L outlook for the full year, we are reiterating our comparable basis EPS forecast in the range of $1.68 to $1.76. As reflected in the outlook section of the press release, we expect reported net sales to increase mid single digits and organic net sales to increase mid to high single digits. This includes the benefit of lapping the distributor inventory reduction initiative.  Due to favorability in average debt balances, interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $325 to $335 million versus our previous guidance of $335 to $345. This improvement essentially offsets the impact of the lower growth target for [inaudible] discussed earlier by Rob. Assuming weighted average diluted shares to approximate 222 million, our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on Page 17 of the news release.  During the second quarter, we recorded approximately $129 million or $122 million after tax of charges and write downs. $109 million of the pre-tax charges was associated with the previously announced business realignment activities for our Australian operations. This included $48 million of inventory write downs, $26 million for impairment of intangible assets and an equity method investment, and $35 million of restructuring and other charges. All but a couple million of these charges were non-cash.  In addition, we recorded a non-cash loss of $8 million on the sale of our Valleyfield [inaudible] end of Q2. This was primarily why we revised our FY '09 reported guidance by $0.03. The remaining charges recorded in the quarter were primarily related to other previously announced restructuring and business realignment activities.  Before we take a look at your questions, I would like [you to know that I believe] our actions and results for the first half of the year, combined with our full year goal, continued to demonstrate our overall focus on one, improving our sales mix, increasing operating efficiencies, and implementing prices to offset input cost inflation and enhance overall margin and productivity. Our Q2 and year-to-date operating margin improve 1.3 and 3.1 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating number one. Two, generating strong free cash flow. We are maintaining our guidance of $310 to $340 million after producing strong free cash flow results last year. And three, paying down debt. Debt is down over $400 million this year, and we have reduced debt comparable EBITDA margin 0.7 points to [inaudible] times.  With that, we're happy to take your questions.
Operator:   (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co.
Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co.:  You mentioned hedging losses. Was that currency hedges or what exactly was that and the order of magnitude, please?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, it was mostly transactional currency hedges, Tim, and the total for the quarter was probably around $8 million. So we had some ineffectiveness and some other things going on in the hedging portfolio, so we look at that as a onequarter aberration.
Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co.: And I think your sales guidance implies an acceleration of kind of organic performance in line for the second half, if I'm not mistaken. I mean, seasonal is with us every year. What gives you that confidence that we'll see that?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, your deduction is exactly right. There's a lot of things going on in the portfolio. Probably the most important thing is that, you know, we've taken a lot of pricing. Typically you see the effect pricing on volume occurring to a greater degree the closer to the actual pricing action we've taken and to a lesser degree as you start going out. So as we get farther away from the point in time when we've taken the pricing increase, then the market has adjusted to the pricing and competitors have reacted. We are expecting stronger sales growth in the second half. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Reza Vahabzadeh - Lehman Brothers.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Lehman Brothers:  You talked about the grape cost increase in the U.S. and then also about the packaging cost increase as well for the Wine business. It wasn't clear to me what the total cost inflation is that you expect for next year and the price increase that you need to offset that for the Wine business and then the same thing, if it's possible, for the Beer business. 
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. What we said was that we are experiencing about mid single digit COGS increases and that we are more than offsetting that with price increases. Our price increases have been in the mid single digit range, so mid single digit price increase has more than offset mid single digit COGS increases. [inaudible] percentage on a smaller base versus a larger base. Then in Beer we have contractual cost increases from the supplier Modelo, and those contractual cost increases are very small, less than inflationary rates. And we're really not subject to a lot of other COGS or input cost pressures in the Beer business. We're pretty insulated from that due to the nature of the business.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Lehman Brothers: Would those cost and pricing dynamics, the COGS inflation and pricing dynamics for your Wine and Beer business in the U.S., would those relationships generally hold going forward, though? 
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. The relationship holds about 40%, 50% in the Wine business of our COGS of grapes. The rest is packaging and other components. And, as I said, we're seeing about mid single digit inflation and input costs across the board and pricing has been in the mid single digit range. So we see that kind of thing holding.
Reza Vahabzadeh - Lehman Brothers: And then Bob, obviously the company's deleveraged over the last 12 months to organic cash flow and also asset sales and you talk about more deleveraging going forward, but to the extent that there are attractive wine portfolios for sale in the next six months, how does the company gauge and characterize its interests in terms of acquisitions in U.S. wine assets?
Robert S. Sands: Yes, you know, what our position on that is that our main focus at the current time is improving efficiencies, improving ROIC, paying down debt, deleveraging. What we've said is that we're not going to categorically say that we won't ever do an acquisition or we won't look at acquisitions, but the focus has been on driving efficiencies and generating free cash flow, and I think that you can see some pretty good results in our rapid deleveraging and ROIC improvement, so that's pretty much where we're at there.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS:  Rob, so much of your commentary was around pricing. Could you, given what's going on with the economy, can you talk about if you're seeing any down trading and then also if strategically there's something that you might be doing differently given the economic situation that we're in. And then hopefully some insights by region instead of just an overall view. 
Robert S. Sands: Yes. I mean, the basic answer to your question is there really is almost no evidence of down trading. If you look at IRI data sort of segment by segment in the Wine business, you'd see the exact same pattern that we've seen in the past, which is value products are either flat, declining and then, as you start moving up the price tier, growth is occurring at faster and faster rates, largely. In Spirits, I think you're seeing some moderation in the premium segment, with the premium segment coming more in line with the value segment and the value segment increasing a little bit. So you might say that there's some trading down going on in Spirits even though, as a general proposition, there isn't trading down. In Beer, there isn't really trading down either. There's some shifting around. The imports have been weak, but that's driven largely by our portfolio being the largest in the import category and the factors that have affected our portfolio. Excluding our portfolio, imports are pretty strong. And [crafts] are very strong and, in the domestic front, the premiums and more premium are pretty strong. So we really haven't seen too much trading down as a general proposition. Now, you know, you can look at specific brands and you can see what could be trading down. Our SVEDKA Vodka, for instance, which continues to grow at huge rates, you know, 40%, 50% growth in SVEDKA on a very large base, it could be the beneficiary - it's the beneficiary of, I think, both trading up and trading down. You've got people that are trading up from, say, the domestic vodkas that are slightly below it, and then you might have people trading down from some of the very high-priced vodkas, which definitely have seen some slowdown. But, as I said, as a general proposition, trading up continues to be a pretty strong trend across all beverage alcohol categories. You asked me about regionally, I don't think that we're really seeing any huge regional differences that are worth noting. As it relates to our Beer portfolio, there are some states in the U.S. that have been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn, especially as it's impacted housing. I mentioned California, Florida and Arizona in that regard, some of the border states - Arizona and California, that is. So that's pretty much I'd say a good summary of the state of the industry as it relates to your question about trading down versus trading up.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: And then just any contingency plans or anything you might be doing differently? It sounds like you feel fine about the category, that there's nothing strategically you're changing given the economy, correct?
Robert S. Sands: Yes. No, we're not. The beverage alcohol business, the growth remains pretty healthy in our industry. I would say that if you look at the growth rates across most of the categories, beer is actually growing very well at the current time. Wine, I think we've seen some moderation in growth overall, but I would say it's actually moderated to the more historical growth levels as opposed to the very high levels that you were seeing maybe eight, nine months ago. And, you know, Spirits growth is pretty healthy for Spirits, in mid single range. So it's a pretty healthy industry in general and pretty non-cyclical, so it doesn't really call for any strategic shifts to deal with the economic conditions as might be the case in other industries that are more clearly or directly impacted by what's going on.
Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS: And then quickly for Bob, any contingency plans for the debt coming due in 2009? And given the credit environment, are there any issues with suppliers, grape suppliers, or anything that we need to be thinking about? 
Robert P. Ryder: Well, we're really not worried at all about any of our debt maturities. We have about $210 million coming due this year on Term A, I think 90, it happened, year-to-date. And yes, the sterling notes come up next year and really our discussion is do we put in more sterling notes or do it in U.S. is more the concern. I mean, you know, right now we've got zero drawn against the $900 million revolver, so we feel very comfortable with our liquidity position.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lauren Torres - HSBC.
Lauren Torres - HSBC:  Just first a housekeeping item. Bob, can you just go back and give us the reason why the tax rate was so low in the quarter?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. I mean, essentially, Lauren, it was just a fallout of a tax position that we had taken that has become more clarified. So, you know, under the new FIN 48 rules, you sort of have to sort out your tax rate on a quarterly basis. So we don't see an impact to the total full year tax rate, more just a timing thing.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: So for your tax rate, your comparable tax rate, to still be around 37% for the year, we expect more than that in the second half?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, because year-to-date you're less than that, correct.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: And also I'm not sure if you mentioned this, Rob, when talking about Corona imports, but as you expected better second half performance and you expect your competitors to pass through some pricing, can you talk about, if you can, what your pricing strategy is for the remainder of the year?
Robert S. Sands: Yes. Our pricing strategy is not to take any pricing. We took our pricing last year. We have no plans to take any pricing this year. So, you know, this is going to be, I think, a pretty favorable - this is going to be pretty favorable relative to growth of the portfolio in the second half of the year. Domestics are taking pricing now. In anticipation of that pricing, there's probably been some buy-in at the retail level. That will dissipate. Price gaps are closing. And, you know, look, I mean, I said what I said about anticipated growth for the year, which we're now saying it's flattish to slightly up, but I would say that the second half of the year we're pretty optimistic about the portfolio.  And we're already seeing some signs of growth returning to the portfolio but, given the performance in the first half of the year, you know, the math doesn't get us to the previous guidance of mid single digit growth. It's as simple as that. But the portfolio is healthy and we're seeing growth return and we're pretty optimistic, and I think that the headwinds are diminishing significantly. 
Lauren Torres - HSBC: So looking at the costs that you're facing this year in the Beer segment, you're comfortable with not taking that pricing?
Robert S. Sands: Cost? Yes, we don't have much cost increases; very, very little, as I think Bob pointed out in his talk and as we pointed out to you all before. The only real cost increase we have is contractually dictated cost increases from the brewery, and those are very small cost increases. It's below U.S. inflationary rates. So we don't suffer from the same kind of thing that manufacturers suffer from in the Beer business. When I say we, I mean the Crown joint venture. 
Robert P. Ryder: If you look at the Crown operating margin versus a year ago, it's down a bit, and 60% of that is timing due to just how the marketing flows through the P&L.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: And if I can ask just one more question on your Wine business - I think you mentioned this, Bob, too - if you exclude the inventory reduction a year ago, your North America branded wine sales would have been up what? Did you say low single digits?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Unidentified Analyst - J.P. Morgan.
Unidentified Analyst - J.P. Morgan:  Just to clarify, you beat down $400 million of debt this quarter. Could you break it out between [results] in terms of [inaudible] was? 
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. Most of it came out of the revolver. The only other piece is the Term A loan. We paid off $90 million. The rest came out of the revolver. And as I said, I think, you know, as of right now, we really have nothing drawn down against the revolver.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.:  Rob, I was wondering if you could give us a kind of state of the union on the restructuring exercise, if I can simplify it that much. You've been engaging in restructuring for several years now and, with the exception of Crown, it's kind of covered, I guess, to an extent - with the exception of Spirits - it's kind of covered all your businesses. What inning do you think you're in in this whole restructuring process of the company now that you're more focused on internal performance versus acquisitions? And then, if you're not in the seventh or eighth inning, where do you think there remains significant opportunity and what sort of magnitude are you seeing?
Robert S. Sands: Well, Mark, as you pointed out, we've done a lot in this regard, and it's touched a lot of different parts of the business. Yes, I'd say, you know, seventh, eighth inning is probably as good a characterization as any. Clearly we're way beyond any beginning stages of restructuring activity. And it's not to say that there isn't opportunities as we go forward, but we've been knocking off the opportunities fairly rapidly. I would say that over time we'd really like to get away from having to do restructuring. That's why we've been pretty aggressive in getting as much done as we can upfront. But, you know, we look at restructuring as an investment. We analyze it in terms of return on - we analyze restructurings in terms of return on investment, and we're also pretty conservative in that regard in that our restructuring, we demand very high returns on restructuring activities. So to the extent that we would have more restructuring activities in the future - which I'm not really commenting on other than I did say that I would agree with your characterization of seventh, eighth inning - but to the extent that we have them in the future is going to be a positive thing, not a negative thing, in that our restructurings are high-return investments. So that's, I guess, the state of the union that I would give you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Leach - JWL Capital.
Bill Leach - JWL Capital:  I just wanted to follow up on this tax rate question. [To reach 37%] for the year, pretty much the tax it would be around 41% in the second half. Why would it be so high? 
Robert P. Ryder: Again, it's all around timing, okay? So the second quarter is sort of abnormally low, and the things that are reversed aren't necessarily for this year; some are for prior years, some are for future years. So it's very difficult to deal with quarterly tax rates so I would say for your models and everything just assume a 37% for the full year. 
Bill Leach - JWL Capital: So my [inaudible] correct, I expect over 40% in the second half?
Robert P. Ryder: Yes. You can't really look at it on a quarterly basis. I know you're supposed to but tax rates aren't specific for the quarter. There's a lot of things that hit a quarter that actually belong in other quarters. So I would do whatever you have to with the math, which might make us around 41, to keep your full year at 37.
Operator: Your next question comes from Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.:  I'm just trying to understand better the possibility of [inaudible] U.S. Wine business. I know a large part of that is really driven by [inaudible] impact as you've been sparring and changing your portfolio, but beyond that, if you can talk about how some of the efficiencies that you've indicated before, [inaudible] margin, other than mix, if you look at sort of your - or other than acquisition, if you look at your underlying Wine, are you seeing [inaudible] improvement there and what's the [inaudible]?
Robert S. Sands: Yes. You kind of cut in and out a little bit, but I think your basic question was about mix shift and how is that impacting efficiencies and what's going on beyond the acquisition front.  In general, we've got a pretty significant mix shift occurring. It's occurring both organically as well as through acquisitions and dispositions, you know, the Clos du Bois acquisition and the Almaden, Inglenook disposition. But going back to the point about premium products growing at a faster rate than value prices, this is also driving mix shift in the business. We've been able to take advantage of that and drive efficiencies in our production organization as we've move out brands, as I said, like Almaden or Inglenook, or we have discontinued brands through our SKU reduction initiative. We're making room in our premium portfolio without having to add extra PP&E. That's really the key there. That's what's driving the efficiency. Therefore we're getting a higher and better use out of our assets all the time as the mix shift occurs, both organically and through acquisitions and dispositions. So this is a trend that we're taking advantage of and do something that's driving efficiencies in the business both organically as well as not organically, as I've stated. 
Robert P. Ryder: Just to add on with what Rob said, it's a combination of things. If you just take - this is all sort of delivered if you just take the Clos du Bois, Inglenook transactions, okay, we bought Clos du Bois in the portfolio, which of course, has a much higher margin than Almaden and Inglenook, the combination of those two things improved our gross margin in the U.S. Wine business by 250 to 300 basis points. And remember, you know, net-net we've almost paid off all that incremental debt, okay, because we paid like $880 for Clos du Bois. We brought in about $130 for Almaden and Inglenook. We're generating cash flow and we've paid off $420 million of debt year-to-date. So we're sort of left with a faster growing, more profitable portfolio, and with those higher gross margins, we're able to leverage our SG&A infrastructure better as well. That sort of what we're trying to do.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Okay, and then just quickly, I know - can you give us your ballpark, just [inaudible] the numbers, for U.S. wine and Crown Imports?
Robert S. Sands: Ballpark numbers for what?
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Ballpark depletion - depletion trends.
Robert S. Sands: Well, we're sticking to the guidance that we've given.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: For the third quarter, Rob, third quarter.
Robert S. Sands: Third quarter?
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Yes. 
Robert S. Sands: We don't give - well, obviously we don’t give quarterly guidance in any event, but we're looking for mid single-digit growth in Wine, and Beer, we're looking at flattish to slightly up. 
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: I'm sorry. In the second quarter, was the depletion trend - how does that trend in the second quarter, sorry, for the Wine and the Beer business?
Robert S. Sands: Beer was a little bit on the downside. And, you know, Wine sales have been lower than we expected primarily due to, as we said, the price increases. So, you know, slightly down.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch:  Just a quick one on inventory levels or working capital issues at your distributors. Are you seeing anything going on there with respect to the credit crisis and just a greater desire to manage working capital? Is that hurting shipmenttodepletion ratios?
Robert P. Ryder: No. There's a constant to and fro between us and the distributors on inventory level, but we took our distributor inventory down last year and we're really not seeing anything out of the ordinary. Now maybe our competitors, many of whom have higher inventory balances, are seeing that, but we really are not.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: We're hearing basically high-end products, so those where the cost of carry might be higher. So I know you've taken your inventory levels down. I'm just wondering if perhaps some of your higher-end Spirits are facing some of those issues.
Robert P. Ryder: No, we're not seeing that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities.
Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities:  I guess a follow up on Judy's question on the profitability of the U.S. Wine business. First question, the $8 million hedging loss that you recorded, what segment did you record that in?
Robert P. Ryder: It was mostly in the Wine division.
Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities: Mostly in the Wine business.
Robert P. Ryder: I'm sorry, I didn't catch the last [inaudible], Bryan.
Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities: All right, so you recorded - the $8 million loss was recorded in the hedge - in the Wine business? 
Robert P. Ryder: Yes, most of that is in the Wine segment.
Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities: And that's $8 million pre-tax?
Robert P. Ryder: That's pre-tax, yes. It's $6 to $8 million, in that range.
Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities: Okay. And then in terms of going forward are there other hedges? Do we have to think about other hedges as we're modeling out margins for the back half of the year?
Robert P. Ryder: No, we think that will be much reduced in future quarters.
Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities: And then, so as we're looking at the - because when you look at the margin in the back half of the year, as you've now pretty much lapped the impact from the inventory de-stocking last year, I guess the question's going to be what's your confidence in your ability to grow margin off of sort of a higher margin base? And, if I'm thinking about this right, your margin performance in the second quarter would have been better had you not have recorded the hedge loss, but are there any other factors we should think about in terms of margins in the back half of the year that would sort of give confidence to be able to grow margins off a higher base?
Robert P. Ryder: I mean, it's sort of the back half of the year. I would agree with you. I would expect our margins to get a little bit better in the back half of the year. I think there was some timing stuff in the SG&A for this quarter that we expect to [inaudible] balance of the year. And I do think that distributor inventory reduction is behind us, so that actually helped our margin versus prior year this year. But you sort of have enough of those numbers.  So I would expect the balance of the year margins to get a little bit better.
Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities: Okay. And then just one follow up. In terms of the price increases that you put through on your Wine business generally, has all of that pricing now been put through or are there going to be more price increases between now and the end of the year?
Robert P. Ryder: I think that we're always looking at pricing and its impact on volumes, so I don't know if we've made those decisions. I'd say the majority of them are behind us, but we may be looking at some incremental ones. Probably it won't be an overall increase like we've had. It might be on specific brands.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions and this does conclude today's Q&A session. 
Robert S. Sands: Okay, well, thank you all for joining us for our call today. And I apologize for our little fire alarm here, but I think that we were able to hear the questions and I think that you were able to hear us.  In general, I'm very pleased with our continued execution towards meeting our financial and operational goals for the year, especially given the tough macro environment we're facing. During the quarter I'd point out we generated strong free cash flow and rapidly deleveraged. We improved our comparable gross profit and operating margins, and we enhanced the profitability of our U.S. line of spirits. Our plan clearly is to continue this strong execution throughout the remainder of the year.  We will be participating in investor conferences through the year end, so we look forward to seeing many of you while we're out on the road. Our next quarterly call is scheduled after the New Year, so please be sure to enjoy some of our excellent products during the upcoming holiday season. So thank you again for your participation in the call.

Operator:  Good morning. My name is Ray and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Madam, you may begin your conference. 
Patty Yahn-Urlaub: Thank you, Ray. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Constellation’s first quarter fiscal year 2009 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.  By now, you should have had an opportunity to read our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. This conference call is intended to complement the release.  During the call, we will discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable organic and constant currency basis. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com, under the investor section. These reconciliations include explanations as to why management uses the non-GAAP financial measures and why management believes they are useful to investors.  Discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results, excluding acquisition-related costs, restructuring and related charges, and unusual items. We will also discuss organic net sales information, which is defined in the news release, and constant currency net sales information, which excludes the impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Please be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company’s estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings.  Thank you, and now I would like to turn the call over to Rob. 
Robert S. Sands: Thanks, Patty and good morning, everyone. First I would like to thank all of you who attended our recent New York City investors meeting. I hope that one of your takeaways from that meeting is that Constellation management team is intensely focused on executing a strategy that delivers value by enhancing operating margins and profitability, improving ROIC, and generating free cash flow, which enables debt reduction. I believe our first quarter results and fiscal 2009 financial goals demonstrate that commitment.  Another example of this strategic execution is the recently announced divestiture of certain U.S. wine brands and assets that were acquired with the Clos du Bois and Wild Horse transaction, as well as some of our northwest brands from Washington State and Idaho.  Collectively, these brands represented approximately 1 million cases of wine sold in calendar 2007. Despite the fact that these were premium brands, the rationale for divesting was straightforward. We simplified our portfolio, eliminated product redundancies, and better aligned the cost to produce our products with their corresponding price points at retail. We received $209 million in cash for these brands, which we utilized to reduce debt, and we have an opportunity to receive up to $25 million in an earn-out if certain business objectives are met by the buyer within the next five years.  So now I’d like to discuss our business and financial performance for our first quarter. We’re off to a great start in fiscal 2009. Our results for the first quarter were solid and in line with our expectations. We increased sales and enhanced profitability in our North American and international operations above and beyond the benefit we received from the cycling of our U.S. distributor wine inventory reduction initiative.  From an international perspective, we’ve been taking actions to improve profitability, operating efficiencies, and our competitive position in both the U.K. and Australian markets. These actions have started bearing fruit and we’ve improved our operating margins and profitability during the quarter.  We implemented planned price increases to retailers in the U.K., which has enabled us to realize an increase in our net sales prices. As a result, volumes have suffered somewhat but not as much as expected. Having said that, the wine market in the U.K. remains healthy, growing at a rate of mid-single-digits on a value basis in the multiple grocer channel per recent Nielsen data.  In Australia, the wine market is also healthy, growing mid-single-digits on a value basis. Similar to the U.K., we have recently increased prices in Australia to cover rising input costs and have seen a bit of volume reduction as we strive to improve profitability.  The 2008 Australian grape harvest is now essentially complete. Although final data is not yet available, it appears that the current harvest estimate is approximately 1.7 million tons versus a harvest of about 1.5 million tons last year. This outcome is a bit higher than anticipated due to the late season rainfall but it still appears that supply is in line with demand. Nevertheless, the cost of Australian grapes has increased significantly due to the fact that many growers paid for water supply during the growing season due to the drought conditions in this region. This has created the unusual situation of higher harvest volume in the face of higher prices, which indicates that it is unlikely that we will see an abundance of lower price bulk wine availability.  I would also like to once again remind everyone that the U.K. and Australian markets combined currently represent less than 10% of our total company EBIT. However, it is important to emphasize that despite the volume impact from price increases in our international business, we have increased profitability during the first quarter.  And moving to the U.S. wine business, as you know we completed our U.S. wine distributor inventory reduction initiative during the first two quarters of our fiscal year 2008. We have regained operating leverage as we’ve cycled this initiative, which negatively impacted last year’s first quarter results.  In addition, we also improved the margins of our branded wine business as a result of the favorable product mix generated by the addition of the Clos du Bois and Wild Horse brands and a divestiture of lower margin value brands, including Almaden and Inglenook. Plus the rationalization of more than 60 brands within our value portfolio, representing about 1,600 SKUs.  As a result of these portfolio changes, our value premium mix has changed dramatically in IRI channels. Our U.S. portfolio is now comprised of approximately 30% value wine and 70% premium wine on a volume basis and about 15% value versus 85% premium on a dollar basis.  From a marketplace perspective, growth in the U.S. premium wine market remains very healthy at about 7% on a dollar basis, according to recent 12-week IRI data through mid-May, and in particular the super premium plus segment where wine sells for $8 and above at retail continues to grow in the double-digit range. This segment includes brands in our portfolio such as Estancia and Kim Crawford and Robert Mondavi, all of which posted double-digit market growth during the 12-week IRI period ending May 18th.  Our Canadian wine business posted strong results for the first quarter, primarily reflecting sales growth from premium brands, including Jackson Triggs and Sawmill Creek and Naked Grape.  In the spirits segment, SVEDKA Vodka posted strong double-digit sales and market growth for the first quarter, driven by new distribution points and increased promotional activity. During the past year alone, SVEDKA has gained new distributions in more than 4,500 national on and off premise accounts. We are continuing to aggressively expand SVEDKA’s export sales to countries outside the U.S. SVEDKA is currently sold in over 25 export markets, including Germany, China, Australia, France, Brazil and Canada, for example.  Our spirits business also reflects strong sales growth in the quarter from key brands, including Black Velvet and Ridgemont Reserve Bourbon, Effen Vodka, Meukow Cognac, and the Caravella of liqueurs.  In an effort to streamline operations and improve efficiencies, we recently announced our intent to sell our Valley Field, Quebec facility, which was primarily a contract production facility for third parties. This will allow us to eliminate excess capacity, reduce costs, and enhance ROIC. This transaction is now expected to close during the second quarter as we work through the final details to ensure a smooth transition.  Moving to Crown imports joint venture, Crown generated low-single-digit net sales growth against a tough comparison last year. We saw strong performance in April offset by weaker performance in May due to challenging comparisons to prior year promotional period for Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day, coupled with some impact from new competitive product introductions.  In addition, large markets like California and Florida continue to be challenged due to adverse economic factors in these areas. However, the joint venture continues to target mid-single-digit growth for the business as they head into the key summer selling season. We believe Crown is well-positioned for execution at retail accounts with solid promotional activity and market programs in place. They are maintaining appropriate price spreads versus competitors and have a strong, fully staffed organization.  As a reminder, the Crown joint venture will overlap some easier comparisons in the second half of the year.  Now, before I move on, I want to briefly comment on a recent beer industry speculation regarding InBev, Anheuser-Busch and others and how it might impact Constellation's investment in the Crown imports JV. Regardless of which scenario plays out, Constellation's contract with Modelo for the Crown JV remains intact, as is through the initial term 2016, ending 2016, that is. At that time, there are three potential outcomes as it relates to our contract with Modelo. They are as follows: Modelo can renew the contract, number one; number two, if Modelo decides that they would like to partner with another third party to import and market their portfolio in the U.S., they must pay Constellation our 50% share of eight times EBIT; number three, if Modelo elects to become a self-importer and is not prohibited from doing so by either federal or state regulatory authorities, then they would pay us our 50% share of tangible book value.  At this time, I would also like to reiterate our assessment regarding the impact of the economic downturn on our business and the overall beverage alcohol category, as I’m frequently asked this question. From an economic perspective, there have been some venue shift from on-premise consumption to off-premise consumption. Within the off-premise channel, we are also seeing a shift to discount retailers, including large mass merchants and wholesale club stores. We remain generally insulated from the impact of these venue shifts because we sell directly to the distributors here in the U.S. at the same margin, regardless of the end user consumption.  The total beverage alcohol category grew 4% for the latest 52-week IRI period, which is in line with the average industry growth rate for the past four years, and the growth trends for beer, wine, and spirits category, which comprise the total beverage alcohol segment has not varied significantly during the last 12 months, with the wine segment growing at a rate greater than that of beer and spirits.  Now, to further demonstrate my point, let’s look at the 12 and 52-week IRI industry trends. In the wine segment, 12-week IRI value trends for the period ending May 18th are as follows: total wine up 5%; premium wine, up 7%; and super premium wine, which is greater than $8 at retail, is up 12%. The 52-week IRI trends almost exactly mirror the 12-week trends for the total wine, premium, and super premium wine categories. As you can see, the super premium plus wine segment, where Constellation has the leading market share, has experienced double-digit growth, exceeding the trends of the total U.S. wine segment. We are well-positioned in this category due to our continued premiumization efforts.  The results are similar in the spirits category, with premium spirits growing 4% on a value basis for both the 12- and 52-week IRI periods. And imported beer continued to grow at an industry growth rate of 2% to 3% for both timeframes.  While we are all aware of the economic challenges impacting many industries, beverage alcohol products are not expected to be as significantly impacted as other consumer discretionary goods.  In closing, our momentum continues for many of the strategic actions we have undertaken during the last 12 months. We are off to a great start in fiscal 2009 and we are on track to achieve our goals and objectives for the year.  And now, I’d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Bob Ryder, for a financial discussion of our first quarter business results. Bob. 
Robert P. Ryder: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Overall, I am pleased with our start to the year and our results for the quarter, with comparable basis diluted EPS coming in at $0.34 versus $0.21 last year. This was in line with our expectations and puts us on a path to achieving our full-year goal of $1.68 to $1.76. We used $55 million of free cash flow in Q1 versus a use of $104 million for the prior year, and we are still on track to reach our $310 million to $340 million free cash flow goal for fiscal 2009. As a reminder, historically we are a net user of cash in the first quarter.  We believe our Q1 results demonstrate that the many significant steps we have taken over the past 12 to 15 months have increased our profit generation profile to drive improved financial results in fiscal 2009 and beyond.  Now let’s look at our Q1 fiscal 2009 P&L performance, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Let’s look at net sales. As you can see from our news release on page 13, our consolidated reported net sales increased 3%, primarily reflecting branded wine growth, including the net benefit of adding brands like Clos du Bois and Wild Horse, and divesting Almaden and Inglenook. We also saw favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by the impact of moving the U.K. wholesale business to the Matthew Clarke joint venture.  The growth rate was 16% after excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and joint ventures, and 13% on an organic constant currency basis. This strong growth rate includes the benefits of overlapping our initiative to reduce distributor wine inventories in the U.S., which negatively impacted net sales in the first and second quarters of fiscal ’08.  Commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Worldwide branded wine organic net sales increased 15%. Organic branded wine geographic net sales for North America, which appears on page 12 of the release, increased 28%, reflecting the overlap of reducing U.S. distributor wine inventory levels last year and solid underlying growth in both the U.S. and Canada this year.  Branded wine organic net sales for Europe and Australia/New Zealand decreased 6% and 3% respectively. For our international business, we have implemented price increases that have impacted volume growth in the near-term but have enhanced overall margins and profitability. Volumes in these geographies were also impacted by SKU reductions of certain lower margin brands.  Turning our attention to spirit, net sales increased 9%, driven by strong double-digit growth of the SVEDKA Vodka brand. As discussed in our fiscal ’08 year-end conference call, we estimated that last year’s distributor inventory reduction initiatives had a one-time impact of $110 million to net sales and comparable EPS impact of about $0.15, with approximately 75% of that impact, or $80 million of net sales and $0.11 of EPS coming in the first quarter and the remainder hitting in Q2.  Adjusting for this estimated $80 million net sales impact for the distributor inventory initiative in Q1 last year, we estimate consolidated organic net sales on a constant-currency basis grew in the low single digits. This is a little below our mid-single-digit target due to the lower U.K. and Australia/New Zealand sales performance for the reasons I just discussed. However, North American organic branded wine on a constant currency basis grew in the mid-single-digits, after adjusting for the distributor inventory impacts.  Now let’s look at our profits on a comparable basis using information on page 14 of the release. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 36.4%, up 6.1 percentage points. This reflects the benefits of implementing price increases on our North American and international markets, and product mix shift from adding high margin brands like Clos du Bois and Wild Horse and divesting lower margin Almaden and Inglenook brands. The overlap of the distributor inventory initiative also provided operating leverage versus the first quarter last year. We also experienced favorability from shifting the lower margin U.K. wholesale business to a joint venture structure last April.  Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 22.3% of net sales compared to 21.2% a year ago. This increase reflects moving below our SG&A U.K. wholesale business to a joint venture structure and increase marketing investment behind our premium spirits brands. This was partially offset by the impact of lapping the distributor inventory initiative. Consolidated operating income increased to $131 million from $82 million for the prior year.  I would now like to turn to our segment operating income results on page 11 of the release to provide highlights of this change. Wine segment operating income increased $58 million to $145 million. This was primarily due to higher net sales as we overlapped the reduction of the U.S. distributor wine inventories, contributions from the Clos du Bois and Wild Horse brands, and profitability improvement in the international businesses.  For the spirits segment, operating income decreased $5 million primarily due to the higher investment behind our premium brands discussed earlier and higher raw material costs. For the quarter, corporate and other expenses totaled $24 million, compared to $20 million for the prior year. The increase primarily includes higher consulting service fees associated with our review of our Australian business and other process improvement opportunities, as well as additional costs to support the growth of the company.  Equity investment earnings totaled $72 million versus $76 million last year, with $70 million coming from our Crown import investment, compared to $73 million in the prior year. For the first quarter, Crown generated net sales of $673 million, an increase of 2%, and operating income of $139 million, a decrease of 5%. The operating income decrease was driven by the year-over-year timing of marketing activities and an increase in product costs.  As a reminder, the joint venture agreement calls for a limited annual inflationary increase for the cost of products acquired from the Grupo Modelo company through calendar 2011.  Interest expense for the quarter was $87 million, up 9% over last year. The increase primarily reflects the incremental interest from funding the Beam Wine brand acquisition.  Now let’s take a look at our debt. At the end of May, our debt totaled $5.3 billion, which was fairly consistent with our debt at the end of fiscal ’08. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.6 billion of bank debt under our senior credit facility and $2.7 billion of fixed term and other debt. Our average interest rate for the first quarter was around 6.5%. We had $580 million of revolving credit available under our senior facility at the end of May. Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of May was 5.1 times. This ratio improved from the 5.3 times level at the end of February, reflecting our earnings improvement.  In early June, we received $209 million in proceeds from the sale of certain winery assets, which renew [inaudible] borrowings. If these asset sales had occurred before the end of Q1, our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio would have been around 4.9 times.  With the strong free cash flow and earnings improvement planned for fiscal 2009, combined with the asset sale proceeds just mentioned, we now believe we can reduce this ratio to below four times range by the end of fiscal 2009. Our previous guidance was in the low to mid four times range.  Our comparable basis tax rate came in at 37%, in line with our targeted full year tax rate, and compared to a 38.3% rate last year. Our weighted averaged diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled $219 million, compared to $233 million last year, reflecting the benefit from the share repurchase during the first quarter of last year.  Due to the many factors just mentioned, diluted EPS was $0.34 a share versus $0.21 a share last year.  Now let’s turn to cash flow on page 10. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activity less CapEx. For the first quarter, we used free cash flow of $55 million, versus a use of $104 million in the prior year. The lower use reflects improved earnings and increased distributions from the Crown imports JV versus the prior year first quarter.  We saw higher inventory in the first quarter due to an increase in our Australian harvest intake. Accounts payable was also higher as some of the payments from the harvest will occur in Q2 versus last year when the payments incurred in Q1 as a result of an earlier harvest. Accounts receivable was also higher as we lapped the distributor inventory reduction.  As mentioned earlier, for fiscal 2009 we are targeting free cash flow to be in the range of $310 million to $340 million. This includes CapEx in the range of $150 million to $170 million.  Moving to our P&L outlook for the full year 2009, we are forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS in the range of 168 to 176. As reflected in the outlook section of the press release, we expect reported net sales to increase in mid-single-digits. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $335 million to $345 million, and we are assuming weighted average diluted shares of approximately $222 million.  Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition related integration costs, restructuring charges, and unusual items, which are detailed on page 16 of the news release.  I believe our results for Q1 and our full year goals demonstrate our overall focus on improving our sales mix, increasing operating efficiencies, and implementing pricing to offset input cost inflation and to enhance overall margins and profitability, generating strong free cash flow and paying down debt.  With that, we are happy to take your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Tim Ramey of D. A. Davidson. 
Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. : Good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter. I’m sorry, I think you said this and I missed it, but the comparable line sales excluding the impact to the inventory draw-down was what in the quarter?
Robert P. Ryder: It was around mid-single-digits in North America. 
Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. : Okay, and there’s still some of the impact of the draw-down that will fall into the 2Q. Can you help us for our modeling purposes?
Robert P. Ryder: It will be about $30 million in Q2, because about three quarters of last year’s $110 million occurred in the first quarter, so what’s left is around $30 million of sales and about $0.04 of EPS for Q2. 
Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. : Great. Appreciate it. And you know, there’s -- I was on CNBC this morning getting asked whether you guys would buy pieces of Foster or [Derringer]. I think you made a strong case here and on the road with me that your focus is on hunkering down. Can I get you to repeat that one more time, hunker down and pay down debt? 
Robert S. Sands: Well, Tim, clearly our focus is on hunkering down and paying down debt, so it is as we have said, which is we are focused on generating internal efficiencies, improving free cash flow, improving ROIC and paying down debt. So these are key initiatives for our management team. 
Robert P. Ryder: And I think you saw that in the first quarter. That’s what we did. 
Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. : That’s terrific. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Torres with HSBC.
Lauren Torres - HSBC : Good morning. I was hoping you could be a bit more specific with respect to the price increases that you took in the quarter -- any sense of the magnitude or give us a sense of how much of an increase you took, where you took it, and also just going forward, is there more to come or you pretty much took as much as you can, or as I said, take more going into the second quarter?
Robert P. Ryder: It varied a little bit by geography but I’d say in the U.S. in the wine business, it was probably around 3% kind of pricing, and expected at -- it had a bit of a volume hit and it will take a while to build out of that. I don’t think we’re looking at significant pricing in the balance of the year in North America for wine. Spirits also took pricing in the first quarter and I think they are looking, because they have a little bit more input cost inflation, they are looking to take some additional pricing [down into the year]. And as we talked internationally, the U.K. originally had their pricing increase. It was around again 3% to 4% but then when the duty came in, they actually increased it to match the duty, so I think they are pretty much done with their pricing for the year. And Australia also took some pretty significant pricing in the first quarter, like 5% to 7%, and I think they are looking at maybe taking some additional pricing balance of the year because as Rob had said, they had to pay a bit more for grapes this year because of farmers had to buy a lot of water, which is reflected in our cost of goods sold.  And again, we’re trying to balance improving our margins and using pricing to do that [with] the volume impact of that, because when we price we certainly see some volume reductions, but on a worldwide basis certainly in the wine business, the supply of grapes is pretty much matched up with the demand for them, so we do think there’s -- this is the right time to do what we are doing. 
Lauren Torres - HSBC : And you said there was a volume hit with respect to U.S. wine. How much of a hit was that?
Robert P. Ryder: Well, I think we -- for volumes, we were a little bit light on the prices on the products that we price, and I think the two brands specifically, if you look at IRI, where share probably is keeping pace is a brand called Vendange and Clos du Bois. And Vendange is sort of a lower end brand, so it tends to be more price sensitive, and we’re managing it more for profitability versus share of market. And in the Clos du Bois, and I think we mentioned on previous calls, we took -- actually, the previous owner took about 6% to 7% pricing at the end of the calendar year. That’s a pretty significant price increase for a wine brand, so the volume on that have actually taken a hit commensurate with that. But as we get further past that price increase, and we’re like in month six, we see the volumes beginning to recover there and our market share beginning to recover as well. 
Lauren Torres - HSBC : And are you seeing your competitors take some more pricing?
Robert P. Ryder: We are seeing pricing across the marketplace and pretty much in all of the geographies. Everybody is under the same pressures we are and I think everybody else sees the same supply/demand dynamics that we see. 
Lauren Torres - HSBC : Thank you. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Brian Hunt of Wachovia. 
Brian Hunt - Wachovia : Thank you. In line with your focus to hunker down and generate free cash, looking at your target of 310 to 340, it appears that there’s a significant amount of opportunity in working capital. Could you talk about your working capital targets for the year and how much the 310 to 340 comes from working capital benefit?
Robert P. Ryder: Yeah, I’d say in general we are much more focused on generating cash flow as a company. I’ll say a couple of things around that. Number one, I think the results show that. If you look at fiscal ’08 and fiscal ’09 and sort of average it, we’d be generating about $350 million a year, which I think is much higher than we’ve generated historically. At the New York investors conference, I think I said that as a company we’re trying to increase the EBIT flow-through to free cash flow, which over the last three years has probably been in the mid 30% range. We are trying to get that to sort of the mid-40% range, meaning the amount of EBIT that as a percent of free cash flow. We’ve changed the incentive within the company, so that people -- part of their bonus metric is now based on free cash flow and we are seeing some -- a much increased opportunity, a much increased focus on generating free cash flow because you know, if you look at our balance sheet, we have a sizable investment in net working capital. The big investment is in inventory, of course, and I think we’ve -- you know, you’ve seen some activities to improve that, like reducing less profitable SKUs because when you look at it from a return on capital perspective, it’s difficult for those SKUs, because they are lower margin and they sort of tie up a lot of working capital, generate -- it’s difficult for them to return the cost of capital.  So we’re not giving specific working capital goals but I think you will see it as we proceed and I think you are seeing it in the bottom line as we speak. 
Brian Hunt - Wachovia : Okay. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : A question about Canada, which is doing very well, I think you said up double-digits in the quarter; can you give us a little more detail on what’s going on there? And of course, with an [inaudible] towards sustainability, give us an idea of growth you see in the market going forward. 
Robert S. Sands: Yeah, Mark, you know, Canada is in general a great market for us. People are consuming more wine as the -- the consumers are very loyal to Canadian wines. There’s big trading up going on into the EQA segment, and in general it just remains a strong market. I would say that we don’t see that abating for any particular reason. I think that the trends are pretty firmly intact and I think we should continue to see, continue to enjoy favorable trends.  Our portfolio is really well-positioned in terms of the products that we have to take advantage of those trends, so we are pretty optimistic about the market. 
Robert P. Ryder: Just the other thing on this, we are the market share leader up there. It’s a country which actually some countries in Europe are looking at, it has a minimum net pricing so it tends to help the brand owner and there’s a big opportunity there, big market shift towards imported new [world] lines, so from Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. And we are very well situated to take advantage of that opportunity.  So we see, albeit it’s not a huge market, especially compared to the U.S., but we see some pretty good opportunities for Canada going forward. 
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : And when you say growth not abating, what’s really driving my question is it’s not normally low double-digit kind of growth there, so do you see low double-digit sustained? And is that distribution, is that new products -- I mean, what’s -- obviously it appears you are taking share. I’m just trying to understand what’s up-ticking there. 
Robert P. Ryder: I think in general, Canada, you know, the market probably grows 5% to 7%, so I think you are right; this quarter, I don’t think we’d expect double-digit growth going forward. There’s some timing impacts there but it’s a strong top line in Canada and we expect to take advantage of that. 
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : And can you help us just connect the dots between the market and the growth you saw in the quarter? What besides what you have in the release in terms of the named brands really changed there?
Robert S. Sands: We can get back to Patty or Bob on some specifics on that, Mark. You know, it’s a combination of factors, new SKUs and product introductions, things to that effect. I think as much as Bob told you that we probably would expect growth in Canada to be in excess of U.S. growth, probably mid to high single digits but we’re not going to project sustained double-digit growth, so I’d be -- that’s what you should probably take away from now. 
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus : Great. Thanks, guys. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Banc of America.
Bryan Spillane - Banc of America : Good morning. Just a couple of questions, or a question, I guess, regarding some of your cost saving initiatives and efforts to improve return on capital. First I guess, you had mentioned at the analyst day a program to reduce SKUs, eliminate some lower margin or lower turn brands, so if you could talk a little bit about how that -- if that had any impact on your sales in the quarter.  And then second, if you guys could just talk a bit about where you stand now in terms of your project list -- you know, what’s currently being worked on and then what you have sort of in the pipeline with certain initiatives to continue to boost your turns and grow margin. 
Robert S. Sands: Brian, first of all, as I mentioned in my talk, we discontinued in our value segment about 50 brands, about 1,600 SKUs. That’s only one of the factors that has impacted our sales growth. Even though our sales growth in North America, by the way, in general is well in line with targets, notwithstanding the fact that it’s been impacted by the couple of things Bob mentioned -- Clos du Bois pricing, the way that we are managing the Vendange brand, and the third item is the fact that we now don’t have those 50 brands flowing through as well. But nevertheless, on a purely organic basis, taking into account the distributor inventory reduction, even including these factors we’re growing the business in North America at about a 5% rate, which is exactly consistent with our mid-single-digit growth.  We’ve got lots of initiatives to reduce cost of goods sold. I think a good example of that is our recently announced disposition of our Valley Fields facility, primarily a contract production facility, although maybe about 20% of it in various ways was utilized for our products. We’ve got a brand new modern facility in Lethbridge, Canada in Alberta that we can consolidate production into, so these are the kind of moves that we continue to make to boost margins, to improve ROIC.  The disposition of the brands that we recently announced that we are selling, there again -- you know, we’ve developed what I’ll call a disposition discipline, okay? If we’ve got brands that we don’t see are strategic, that we believe can be sold in excess of the net present value of our forecasted cash flows of those brands at our [inaudible], you know, those are the kinds of ROIC improvement initiatives that we are undertaking.  Bob, do you have anything to add?
Robert P. Ryder: No, I think the other thing we talked about, Brian, is -- and it relates back to the, you know, some of the projects in which we are working, is we are looking pretty intently at our Australian business and looking at sort of the return on capital and profitability by brand and actually by SKU, and that will most likely result in some reductions to the SKU count on brands that can’t return their cost of capital. And that should improve our margins down there and should improve our working capital, as we have just fewer things hanging around the warehouse. And I think that, coupled with the pricing we have already taken and maybe some additional pricing we’ll be looking at balance of year, should improve our profitability in both Australia and the U.K.  So I think, you know, there’s some of the things that we are looking at. 
Bryan Spillane - Banc of America : Great. Thanks, guys. 
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back to Rob Sands for any closing comments. 
Robert S. Sands: Okay, well thank you, everybody, for joining our call today. We’re very pleased with our results for the quarter. As I mentioned, I think that we are off to a great start for fiscal 2009 and I believe we are well-positioned to achieve our free cash flow and EPS goals for the year. Our recent actions demonstrate that we continue to execute our strategies. A few examples include the divestiture of the California northwest assets that I just talked about. Of course, we used those proceeds to pay down debt. We have realized pricing and thus increased profitability in our international markets where we have a strong presence. And overall, we planned continued margin expansion and ROIC enhancement as we drive internal efficiencies and further premiumize our portfolio.  Thanks again, everybody, for your participation and we hope you enjoy some of our excellent products during the Fourth of July holiday. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s Constellation Brands first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Bree and I’ll be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands fiscal 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator instructions). Thank you, it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Patty Yahn-Urlaub, ma’am, you may begin your conference.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub:  Thank you Bree. Good morning everyone and welcome to Constellation’s fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2008 conference call. I’m here this morning with Rob Sands our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bob Ryder our Chief Financial Officer. By now you should have had an opportunity to read our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. This conference call is intended to compliment the release.  During the call we will discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable organic and constant currency basis. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company’s website at www.cbrands.com under the investor section. These reconciliations include explanations as to why management uses the non GAAP financial measures and why management believes they are useful to investors. Discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results excluding acquisition related costs, restructuring and related charges and unusual items. We will also discuss organic net sales information which is defined in the news release and constant currency net sales information which excludes the impact of year over year currency fluctuations, currency exchange rate fluctuations. Please be aware that we may make forward looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company’s estimates please refer to the news release and Constellation’s SEC filings. And now I’d like to turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Sands:  Thanks Patty and good morning everybody and welcome to our call. We have several items to discuss this morning, including our fiscal year 2008 results and our guidance for 2009. As I look back on 2008, I would characterize it as the year of significant accomplishments. We exceeded our key financial goals and achieved our strategic initiatives which most notably include premiumization of our brand portfolio, including the acquisitions of Svedka Vodka and the Fortune Brands US premium wine portfolio.  We formed a joint venture with Punch Taverns in the UK in order to strengthen Matthew Clark’s position as the UK’s largest independent drinks wholesaler serving the entreed industry. Although the Crown joint venture was formed in late fiscal 2007, Crown spent much of 2008 integrating the business and executing a smooth transition with the joint venture growing volume and profits across the Modello product portfolio. We divested the low margin Almaden and Inglenook value wine brands which will enable us to enhance the growth, profitability and ROIC of our US wine portfolio.  It also allows us to focus on the higher growth, higher margin premium wines within our portfolio. As part of our wine acquisition activities, we re-aligned our US sales and marketing force in order to focus on specific consumer segment opportunities which include fine wine, premium wine and specialty value wines. As part of this initiative we continue to rationalize our US wine product portfolio, primarily within the value segment. This includes smaller low margin regional brands at price points generally less than $5.00.  We are in the process of consolidating certain wine marketing operations in Australia in order to insure optimal asset utilization and produce greater efficiency from our global wine production infrastructure. We completed our US wine distributor inventory reduction initiative. Although it impacted sales and earnings for fiscal 2008, it was the right thing to do for the business as we achieved our objectives of creating supply chain efficiencies and enhancing our brand strength in the marketplace. From a financial perspective, we exceeded our comparable earnings per share goal and achieved record free cash flow for the year.  Overall, we are executing on our strategy and taking the appropriate actions to further position our business for success in the future. We expect this momentum to continue throughout 2009. And you’ll see from our guidance that we are on a path to further strengthen the growth and profitability of our business. And now I’d like to discuss our business and financial performance for fiscal 2008. My discussion today will primarily focus on full year results with the exception of the impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter reflecting business challenges experienced in the UK and Australia.  And I’d like to spend a minute providing a little bit more context around the impairment charges which are primarily related to our Hardy’s business in Australia and the UK and then Bob Ryder will provide additional financial details about the charges. Constellation acquired Hardy’s in March 2003. The strategy was to take a leading position in one of the most important appellations for new world wines. Australia was and is considered a great source of quality wines at value prices.  However, at that time, the Australian dollar was much weaker versus most major currencies, the wine industry was experiencing shortages of key varietals and the UK had not had a wine duty increase for three years. Since then the Australian dollar has strengthened. Australia had the three largest harvests in its history which created a surplus of wine and in the UK which is Hardy’s largest market, the government implemented an annual duty increase beginning in April 2003. So where do we stand now? We have taken steps to improve profitability, operating efficiencies and our competitive position in both the UK and Australian markets. In January we implemented a UK price increase to cover cost increases, but immediately implemented an additional price increase to cover the recently announced duty increase.  Because we continue to invest in brand building in the UK, we are in a good position with retailers as we implement our pricing actions and we believe other suppliers are taking similar actions. The UK remains one of the world’s largest import wine markets, growing at a healthy rate of 7% on value in the multiple grocer channel per recent Nielsen data with Constellation’s growth exceeding the market growth rate. Overall, we believe the margin compression in the UK has bottomed, the market remains healthy and there is good momentum going forward.  The Australian wine market is also healthy, growing at mid single digits on a value basis. Australia is one of the largest exporters of new world wines and will continue to provide growth opportunities for Constellation going forward. We believe these are strategically important markets and are beginning to see some positive signs of recovery. I’d also like to note that the UK and Australian markets combined currently represent less than 10% of our total company EBIT and we expect to improve our operating results from this level in 2009 and beyond.  Moving to the US wine business. We have undergone a major transformation in our US wine portfolio with divestiture of Almaden and Inglenook which represented 15-20% of our US wine volumes and the addition of the premium Fortune Brands, namely Clos du Bois, a super premium wine selling in the $8-$11 price category. As you know the total portfolio of acquired products is well positioned among fast growing super premium plus wines, solidifying our position as an undisputed leader in the US premium wine business. As a result of these portfolio changes, our value premium mix has changed dramatically.  Our US portfolio is now comprised of approximately 30% value wines and 70% premium wines on a volume basis and about 15% value versus 85% premium on a dollar basis. In addition, our portfolio rationalization initiative continues as we are discontinuing small regional value wine brands in the US. The culmination of these activities will result in the US wine portfolio we believe will be well positioned to drive sales growth, margin expansion and improved ROIC.  From a marketplace perspective, growth in the US premium wine market remains very healthy at about 9% on a dollar basis according to recent 12 week IRI data. In particular, the super premium plus segment where wines sell for $8.00 and above at retail and where Constellation has a leading market share continues to grow at double digit rates exceeding the trends of the total US wine market.  This segment includes Constellation Brands such as Estancia, Toasted Head, [see me] Robert Mondavi, Franciscan, Kim Crawford, Wild Horse and the newly acquired Clois du Bois brand. We are also seeing evidence that strong trading up activities continue in the marketplace. From an economic perspective, we are seeing some venue shift from on premise consumption to off premise consumption. Within the off premise channel, we are also seeing some shift at discount retailers including large mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs.  I’d like to remind everyone that we remain generally insulated from the impact of these venue shifts because we sell directly to the distributor tier in the US at the same margin regardless of the end user consumption. Our Canadian wine business posted strong results for the year, primarily driven by the premium wine portfolio including Jackson-Triggs, Sawmill Creek, Naked Grape and Inniskillin icewine products which all contributed double digit sales growth.   In the spirits segment, Svedka Vodka had a great year and generated phenomenal growth of greater than 40% versus calendar year 2006. It is not only the fastest growing major imported premium vodka in the US but according to recent impact data, Svedka is the fastest growing major premium spirit in the world with a five year [kagger] of approximately 50%. The base spirits business also contributed strong sales growth for the year driven by premium brands, including Black Velvet, Ridgemont Reserve 1792 Bourbon, the 99 Schnapps Family, recently launched new products and contributions from our production services business. Overall, approximately 30% of our spirits sales are represented by our premium product portfolio. Our premium spirits products are growing at the rate of 24% in the most recent 12 week IRI channels.  Moving to Crown imports joint venture. Calendar year 2007 was a transition year for crown as it completed its first full year of operation. During the company’s fiscal year 2008, the crown joint venture generated $2.4 billion in net sales and more than $500 million in operating income. Crown has the leading market share in the import category in the US with 5 of the Modello brands represented in the top 20 import brands.  Corona is the number one imported beer and Modello Especial is now the number three import. As we’ve previously indicated, volumes for the business have been impacted by price increases implemented at the end of calendar year 2006 and at the beginning of 2007. In addition, the second half of our fiscal year was impacted by challenging year over year Crown comparisons as we prepared for the joint venture transition during the same timeframe the previous year.  We are now beginning to lap this price increase for certain markets, but because of the staged nature of last year’s price rollout, we will not fully lap the increase until we have completed the first quarter of our fiscal year 2009. The good news is that in a number of markets where the pricing cycle has been completed, we are seeing a return to solid growth trends. While we are cautiously optimistic some of our key markets like California have been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn.  These markets will be a key focus for Crown as we move into the critical selling season. On the other hand in markets like Texas and in the East, we have seen double digit volume growth return in 2008. Going into the Cinco de Mayo holiday and the key summer selling season, Crown is well positioned to execute at retail with outstanding new creative and promotional materials and a strong fully staffed organization. As a result, Crown is confident in its ability to achieve mid single digit depletion growth for fiscal 2009.  Now before I turn the call over to our CFO Bob Ryder, I wanted to discuss our EPS guidance for fiscal 2009. As you can see our EPS range of $1.68-$1.76 clearly shows progress from where we ended fiscal 2008 and demonstrates that we are committed to enhancing the growth and profitability of our business. Our cash flow guidance also demonstrates a strong commitment to cash flow generation. I will provide an overview relating to other future business objectives and initiatives when we get together for our May 29th investor meeting in New York. And now I’d like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our business results. Bob.
Bob Ryder:  Thanks Rob, good morning everyone. Overall I’m pleased with our results for the year with comparable basis diluted EPS coming in at $1.44. We effectively hit our operational P&L goals for the year end and experienced some positive tax rate adjustments which contributed to the outperformance on a comparable basis expectations. I’m especially pleased with our record free cash flow generation which exceeded our goals. We are targeting another year of strong free cash flow generation in fiscal 2009.  But from an operational perspective, we believe we have taken many significant steps during the past year to increase our profit generation profile and drive improved financial results in fiscal 09. We believe our efforts throughout fiscal 2008 and our planned initiatives for fiscal 2009 better position our UK and Australian businesses for improved performance going forward. In addition, we added faster growing super premium and luxury brands like Clois du Bois and Wild Horse with average selling prices and margins that are greater than our base portfolio.  While also divesting lower price lower margin value brands like Almaden and Inglenook. Before I review our fiscal 2008 results and our guidance for fiscal 2009, I would like to discuss the $874 million of charges recorded in Q4. This amount is significant, however it is non-cash and has no impact on our debt covenants, our liquidity or our ability to execute our business strategies. These charges primarily relate to goodwill and intangible assets impairments associated with the company’s Australian and UK businesses in connection with the company’s annual fourth quarter impairment testing under SFAS 142.  As previously discussed, profits and cash flows for these businesses have been negatively impacted by competitive pricing pressures driven by the strength of the large grocery retailers, Australian wine oversupply and UK duty increases. As a result of the lower profit trends associated with these businesses, our SFAS 142 test required us to recognize and impairment charge. The charges primarily include goodwill and intangible impairments of around $800 million related to Australia and the UK and a $52 million Australian deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Now, let’s look at our fiscal 2008 P&L performance where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Let’s look at the net sales line. As you can see from our news release on page 15, our consolidated net sales decreased 28% reflecting the move of US imported beers to the Crown imports JV and the UK wholesale business to the Matthew Clark JV. Sales were also impacted by our initiative to reduce distributor wine inventories in the US. The growth rate was 5% after excluding the impact of acquisitions and joint ventures and 1% after adjusting for currency changes. Excluding an estimated $110 million net sale impact for the reduction of the distributor wine inventories, we estimate organic net sales grew in the mid single digits. My remaining comments will be on a constant currency basis. Worldwide branded organic net sales decreased 2%. Please turn to page 14 of the release. Organic branded wine geographic net sales for North America decreased 3% reflecting solid growth in Canada, more than offset by the impact of reducing US wine distributor inventory levels during the first half of the year. As previously discussed, the goal of this initiative was to assure distributors have sufficient inventories to meet consumer demand but to reduce any permanent buffer stock in non peak periods. This [drew] a timing change in our US wine sales pattern.  After we completed the peak holiday selling season in the third quarter, we returned to the lower distributor inventory levels achieved at the end of Q2. This negatively impacted our Q4 rate. Our underlying sales to retailers were well within our range of expectations of low to mid single digits growth, excluding divested brands. For Europe, branded wine organic net sales increased 4% reflecting higher sales of popular priced wine to mainland Europe and a slight increase in net sales in the UK. Our Australian New Zealand branded wine net sales decreased 2%. Turning our attention to spirits, net sales increased 26% due to the Svedka acquisition and 9% increase in organic net sales driven primarily by higher average selling prices, an increase in our production services business and new products.  Now, let’s look at our profit on a comparable basis using information on page 17 of the release. For the year our consolidated gross margin was 34.9%, up 4.9%. This primarily reflects the benefits of shifting the lower margin UK wholesale and imported beer businesses to joint ventures which was somewhat offset by lower margin for the branded wine business in the UK and Australia and the impact of reducing distributor wine inventories in the US. Our consolidated SG&A for the year was 20.4% of net sales compared with 13.8% a year ago.  This increase was also primarily due to moving the imported beer and UK wholesale businesses to joint venture structures. In addition, we saw increased management incentive expense due to low bonus accruals in the prior year and higher stock compensation expense for the transition effects related to SFAS 123R. This year also included higher marketing support for branded wine in the UK. Consolidated operating income decreased to $545 million from $843 million for the prior year.  This change was primarily driven by the factors already mentioned combined with reporting $255 million of equity earnings for the Crown JV compared to last year when we recognized $39 million of equity earnings for Crown and $208 million of earnings for our imported beer business that was included in operating income. Now I’d like to turn to our segment operating income results on page 13 of the release. The year over year increase in beer business profitability reflects increased pricing and economic benefits of having a national platform for the Modello portfolio.  We saw lower total profit growth for the beer business in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. As previously discussed, this was primarily attributable to a high level of sales in the prior year third and fourth quarters as the business was preparing for the Crown transition. Wine segment operating income decreased $72 million to $558 million. This was primarily due to the lower net sales associated with the reduction of US distributor wine inventories and UK and Australia business performance. For the spirits segment, operating income increased $7 million primarily due to the contribution from Svedka and higher sales for the base business, offset somewhat by higher material costs.  For the year, corporate and other expenses totaled $86 million compared to $61 million for the prior year. The increase includes additional management incentive and stock compensation expenses for the reasons I mentioned earlier. And higher outside service and professional fees related to management reporting system enhancements and transactions. Please turn to page 17 of the release. Equity investment earnings totaled $274 million versus $53 million last year.  Equity earnings for the year are comprised of $255 million from Crown and the remainder related substantial to Opus One. Interest expense for the year was $342 million, up 27% over last year. The increase primarily reflects the incremental interest from funding acquisitions and $500 million of share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from the Matthew Clark transaction.  Now let’s take a look at our debt. At the end of February, our total debt totaled $5.3 billion which compares to $4.2 billion of debt at the end of fiscal 2007. The increase reflects $386 million Svedka acquisition, $885 million for the Fortune Wine business acquisition, $500 million in share repurchases, partially offset by $186 million in proceeds from the Matthew Clark JV transaction, $134 million received from the sale of Almaden and Inglenook and our strong free cash flow generation during the year. At the end of the year we had approximately $2.7 billion of bank debt under our senior credit facility. Our interest rates are generally tied to LIBOR plus a margin of about 1.25-1.5%. Approximately $1.2 billion of this debt is effectively fixed with interest rate SWAPs through 2010. The remainder of our borrowings is comprised of $2.6 billion of fixed term and other debt. Our average interest rate for 08 was just under 7%. We have received a lot of questions related to the challenging debt market and whether this will have any impact on our company.  We have $556 million of revolving credit available under our senior facility at the end of February. This provides ample liquidity and flexibility and is in place through June 2011. There is no issue with accessing this facility. Our debt to comparable basis EBIDTA ratio at the end of February was 5.3 times. Although on the high side of our historical range, we’re comfortable with this level. With the strong free cash flow planned for fiscal 2009, we believe we can reduce this ratio to the low to mid 4 times range over the next 12 months.  Our comparable basis tax rate came at 32.6% versus 35.6% last year. The rate decrease was driven by favorable foreign tax rate changes recognized in the fourth quarter. Our comparable weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year totaled $223 million compared to $240 million last year, reflecting the benefit from a share repurchase. The wine brands acquired from Fortune produce $14 million of net sales for the two and a half months we owned them in the fourth quarter.  We estimate the results of the acquired business produced approximately $0.03 to $0.04 of dilution. As previously discussed, this was anticipated and primarily driven by high levels of product inventory in the distributor channel in the fourth quarter which resulted in net sales for the acquired business that were well below normal levels. Distributor inventories for these brands were at Constellation’s target levels at the end of February. Due to the many factors just mentioned, diluted EPS was $1.44 versus $1.68 last year. Now let’s turn to cash flow on page 12. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending. For fiscal 2008, we generated record free cash flow of $376 million versus $121 million in the prior year. The year over year increase reflects lower taxes paid, improvements in working capital and reduced capital spending. We anticipate following this performance with another strong cash flow year in fiscal 2009.  For fiscal 2009, we are targeting free cash flow to be in the range of $310-$340 million. This includes cap ex in the range of $150-$170 million. We expect free cash flow to be down slightly from fiscal 2008 as the benefits of higher earnings will be offset by higher cash taxes paid as some of the timing benefits from 08 reverse and higher working capital investment, primarily related to increased harvest requirements anticipated in 09. Summarizing fiscal 2008, we made a lot of strategic progress. We are pleased with our results. We made progress with our initiatives to drive performance improvement in the UK and Australia. The acquisitions of Svedka and Fortunes Wine business combined with the Almaden and Inglenook divestiture have strengthened the company’s premium position. We also completed the Crown and Matthew Clark joint venture transitions and increased our focus on improving free cash flow. As a result of these efforts, we are enthusiastic about our prospects as we head into fiscal 2009. Moving to our P&L outlook for the full year 09, we’re forecasting on a comparable basis diluted EPS in the range of $1.68 to $1.76. The significant improvement in projected results reflects solid underlying growth for our North American wine business and the Crown imports joint venture. In addition to anticipated performance improvement in our UK and Australian wine business. Earnings will also benefit from the completion of our initiative to reduce US distributor wine inventories.  We effectively completed this by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008 with an estimated one time impact of $110 million to net sales and comparable EPS impact of about $0.15, with approximately 75% of that impact coming in the first quarter and the remainder hitting in the second quarter. We expect reported net sales to increase mid single digits. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, organic net sales are expected to result in an increase of high single digits. Organic net sales growth excluding the onetime benefit of completing the distributor inventory reduction is expect to be mid single digits.  We expect operating margin expansion for the wine segment in excess of 200 basis points for fiscal 2009, reflecting the impact of the various items we discussed earlier. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $340 to $350 million. This is fairly level with fiscal 2008 as the full year impact of funding the share repurchase and the Fortune Wine business acquisition is offset by the $134 million received for the sale of Almaden and Inglenook at the end of fiscal 2008 and the free cash flow generation we are targeting for 09. We anticipate the tax rate to approximate 37%.  As a reminder, a very high percentage of our profits are being generated in the higher tax jurisdictions in North America. We’re seeing a weighted average diluted shares of approximately $222 million. We also expect stock based compensation expense to approximate 46 million versus 32 million in fiscal 2008, as we continue to recognize higher stock compensation expense for the transition effects of SFAS 123R.  Corporate expenses are expected to be in the range of $95-$100 million. The increase versus fiscal 2008 includes the impact of additional stock compensation expense and costs to support the growth of the company. In addition, we are still targeting a penny to two penny accretion in fiscal 09 for the Fortune Wine business acquisition offset by a penny to two penny dilution from the Almaden and Inglenook divestiture. Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition related integration costs, restructuring and related charges and unusual items which are detailed on page 19 of the news release. With that, we’re happy to take your questions.
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator instructions). Thank you, our first question is coming from Tim Ramey of D. A. Davidson.
Tim Ramey – D.A. Davidson & Co.: Good morning. You mentioned the IRI numbers on line growth which are encouraging but can you give us any further detail about what order patterns look like, the economic news is evolving quickly and is that seeming to have any impact on the line business or is it sort of business as usual?
Rob Sands: You know first I would say that I think that in general its business as usual. As I talked about, you know we do tend to see some venue shift and economic downturns. We’ve seen some shift from on premise to off premise. We’ve seen some shift within the off premise to the mass merchandisers away from some of the chain retailers and specialty retail accounts.  But in general I think that the wine business has been pretty strong and I do think that the IRI data for the last 12 weeks shows that, although I will say that that data, you should take into account the fact that Easter was early this year and within this 12 week period but wasn’t in the same 12 week period a year ago, so that did drive some of the positive results. Although I don’t think that that was indicative of anything, I think that the underlying sales trends at retail look to be pretty strong for wine.
Tim Ramey – D.A. Davidson & Co.: Terrific, thanks. 
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kaumil Gajrawala from UBS.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Thank you, hello everybody. Rob thanks for the update on the Crown but I have a couple follow up questions. First, in addition to the price increase from last year there was also some transition and some sales execution issues. Can you maybe talk about what you’ve done internally over the last 12 months and why fiscal 2009 will be different?
Rob Sands:  Sure Kaumil, obviously when we put the Crown joint venture together we were in the process of filling in the organization primarily in the East. We had to hire over 150 people to fill out that organization. And you know although I think that the Crown team did a great job in making sure that we were covered, when you’re involved in transitional activities that big, you know there’s clearly going to be some transition issues.  Now as we move into this year, you know the organization is all up and running, we’ve got all teams and positions filled with people have gotten sufficient experience in their new positions and we think we’ve got great people by the way. So you know we’re pretty confident that any transitional issues that we have had are behind us and that Crown is up and running and should be 100% in terms of execution capabilities.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Okay great and then if I could ask an economic question, it seems like we’re seeing some of the sub-premiums in the beer categories start to do a little bit better. I’m curious if that’s related from the channel shift or if you’re seeing kind of fundamental trading down across beer? And then maybe if you could touch on what’s happening in wine as well.
Rob Sands:  Well you know I think that as it relates to, did you say sub-premiums or premiums?
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: I said sub-premiums.
Rob Sands:  Yeah I think that we have seen an increased performance in the sub-premium category. There’s no doubt about it. At the same time, you know crafts continue to do well and I think that as Corona and the Modello portfolio laps the price increase, we’re beginning to see some strong growth in some of our key markets as well and being such a large percentage of the import and therefore the import category, we should see improved trends there as well. But definitely sub-premiums in the most recent data have also turned up versus their historical performance.  There’s no doubt about that. In wine we continued to see much of the same as what we’ve seen in the past, we see extremely strong growth in the premium plus categories and especially in the super premium plus which is $8.00 and above where we have leading positions. We continue to see very, very strong double digit growth in those categories and we continue to see strong trading up trends in the wine business. You know some of the very highest priced tiers in the wine business may see some slight softness as a result of the economy but basically that’s immaterial to the wine business as a whole. So you know it’s super premium plus, $8.00 and above, $20 and below you know where we have the leading position, as I said, strong double digit growth.
Kaumil Gajrawala – UBS: Okay, perfect, thank you.
Operator:  Thank you, our next question is coming from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Good morning. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on wine and beer. First on the wine side, I guess I’m still trying to reconcile the 5% decline in the sales number, organic sales number in the fourth quarter with seemingly solid underlying depletion numbers. So first question is what was the depletion number in the fourth quarter in North America wine?
Rob Sands:  Right, we don’t give depletion numbers but we had positive depletion growth in the fourth quarter for North American wine and yes there was a 5% decline in sales but as we’ve told you in the past, that was primarily related to the change in shipment patterns as a result of the distributor inventory reduction. Historically we shipped much more product in the fourth quarter than our new shipment patterns than will be our new shipment patterns and consequently, the sales downturn was fully expected and is not in any way reflective of the underlying sales trends which as we said, depletion trends were positive.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Was there any change in the depletion trends from third quarter to the fourth quarter at all?
Rob Sands:  Depletion trends from third quarter to fourth quarter improved.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay because, okay. And then on the beer side, you know I think obviously you know you’ve talked about the price increases and you’ve talked about the transition issues hurting the 08 performance, I’m just wondering I mean obviously there was a lot of competition as well from some of the new product and [takatis] performance was also stronger when you kind of look back in the past 12 months or so.  I’m just wondering if you think that there’s been any impact on the competitive front and then you alluded to the comment about California being pretty weak and that you’ve got some initiatives in place to restore growth in that market, so if you could just talk about what you’re trying to do in California and then whether you expect to see even more impact from competition as Bud rolls out their Bud Light with lime.
Rob Sands:  Right, yeah we specifically said just to be clear that we expect mid single digit growth in our imported beer business this year. And that’s going to be accomplished in a number of ways but I guess specifically to some of your questions, first of all competition from new products, the Modello portfolio and Corona has always had competition from new products every year or two, there’s always products that are introduced that are geared or aimed to compete with Corona. And I think that we’ve been very successful in competing against those products.  You know we have very strong marketing programs, very strong sales and promotional programs with both retail and with our distributors and you know although we take competition seriously, it’s really been a fact of life almost forever. Now a lot of the competition that you see is in the area of flavored malt beverages, thinks like Bud with lime and Miller Chill and things to this effect. And generally our experience has been that customized products generally haven’t been highly serious competition for Corona because the consumer generally as it relates to lime and lemon like to customize the product themselves.  That’s also been some of the experience in the soft drinks industry as well. But you know that said, you know as I said we always take competition seriously. Southern California is a tough market. It has been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn. And all I can say relative to that is that it’s a market we’re going to be working extra hard in and looking at very closely to make sure that we optimize our performance in that market. In general and in a lot of our markets where we’ve lapped the price increase, we’re seeing good positive growth return to the brand and that’s why we’re pretty confident that we can accomplish mid single digit growth rates this year.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay and then just a follow up on beer, if you pro forma last year’s number to include the full three months of Crown, could you tell us what the sales line would have been in the fourth quarter?
Bob Ryder: Judy this is Bob, as you know they’re not comparable because of the weakness in the back half for Crown which was attributable to frankly last year’s high. The sales for the full year will be slightly negative. But it’s all driven by the previous year’s activity because of the formation of the Crown JV. And that’s not a depletion number, that’s a sale number.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Right and can you tell us what the depletion would have been?
Bob Ryder: Depletions would have been positive in the low single digits.
Judy Hong – Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from [Riza Zabazita] from Lehman Brothers.
[Riza Zabazita] – Lehman Brothers: Good morning. Just I’m wondering if share repurchases of any size is something that you would consider, obviously your stock is where it is and this time last year you had some share repurchases conducted when the stock was I guess in this range, how do you think about share repurchases?
Bob Ryder: In general we’re right now we’re focused on debt repayment, we’re not going to rule anything out. But debt repayment is probably where we’re focused right now.
[Riza Zabazita] – Lehman Brothers: Okay so you don’t have an appetite for it and is there any restrictions on that as well?
Bob Ryder: Not really. It would be an internal decision.
[Riza Zabazita] – Lehman Brothers: Okay and then how do you think about acquisitions? Obviously you’ve been opportunistic in the past including the Fortune Wine. Is there a thing that could come out of the recent consolidation activity in the industry or are you still focused on the base business?
Rob Sands:  Yeah I mean I think as Bob pointed out that we’re pretty focused on optimizing our existing business and generating efficiencies within our business, cash flow generation, debt pay down, but you know acquisitions remain a part of our strategy so we wouldn’t categorically rule out acquisitions at this point. But you know we’ve made a lot of acquisitions and we’re very well positioned for the future so you know it remains to be seen if we have any specifics we’ll certainly let you know at the time. But in the meantime the focus is on the organic business and again as Bob said debt reduction and cash flow generation.
[Riza Zabazita] – Lehman Brothers: And then lastly will cash flow from Crown imports roughly approximate the earnings from that business that’s running through your P&L?
Bob Ryder:  Yeah, it will roughly equate to it. There’s a separate line item on the cash flow statement where you can see the difference between the two. I think this year was about $20-$30 million difference and that had actually something to do with just the startup of the JV. But generally we both partners sweep the cash from Modello pretty regularly.
[Riza Zabazita] – Lehman Brothers: Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is coming from Lauren Torres from HSBC.
Lauren Torres – HSBC: Good morning. Just a clarification Bob, you talked about good earnings growth but a decline, year over year decline in free cash flow. Is that all due to just taxes you’re getting hit with or that the change in taxes year over year?
Bob Ryder:  Yeah it’s pretty much attributable to taxes Lauren. And a lot of its timing. We paid again because of timing extremely low cash taxes this year. That cannot be replicated in future years. So we’ll be paying a lot more cash taxes next year than this year. And that’s sort of driving the year over year reduction in cash flow, although the number I still think I’m very happy with, it’s still a very strong number even with those cash tax payments in 09.
Lauren Torres – HSBC: Okay and also if I could just ask a question or two on your wine business? Obviously we saw a number of these wine inventory reductions last fiscal year, if you could just talk about Rob maybe where you are now, are you comfortable at these levels even with the Fortune Brands coming in. Is everything complete, what you expected to have done in the fourth quarter as we look into this year?
Rob Sands:  Yeah, we completed the inventory reduction pretty much in the second half of last year and we’re very comfortable with distributor inventory levels and have no intention at this stage to reduce distributed inventory levels further or to operating on any different basis, so that’s pretty much history.
Bob Ryder:  And Lauren the other one that you referred to is the reduction in the Fortune Brand inventories and that was also completed by the end of our year.
Lauren Torres – HSBC: Okay and just quickly, lastly also on wines, we’ve seen the sale of value brands. Are there more types of sales like that to come and how should we think about that in our numbers for this year?
Rob Sands:  You know we’re always looking at our portfolio. You know obviously we can’t talk about specifics when it comes to dispositions until such time that we have something to announce. But you know I would say that if as we continue to examine our portfolio if it makes sense to dispose of anything and there’s a buyer and the right purchase price can be obtained, that’s always a possibility in the future.
Lauren Torres – HSBC: Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Thank you, our next question is coming from Marc Greenberg from Deutsche Bank.
Marc Greenberg – Deutsche Bank: Good morning. My question relates to the $822 million write down in overseas assets. You noted that that was primarily Hardy’s. That’s a significant portion of the $1.4 odd billion that you paid for the asset in 2003. I know these are non cash in nature, but I really wanted to have a return discussion with you, that was about 14 times LTM EBIDTA in 03, in my mind a write down of this size highlights deal risk.  I was hoping you could talk about how we should think about return that you’re getting on your acquisitions in light of this kind of a write down and should we be concerned about other non cash charges and maybe as an example, since then you’ve both Mondavi, Vincor and Fortune in the US and how should we think about, I know we’re not seeing it, the risk to further write downs were we to see significant weakness in the US wine market and what that might say about returns on acquisitions, thanks.
Bob Ryder:  Sure, logical question Marc. You know as we’ve been talking over the last two years, you know we’ve been subject to some unique things happening between the UK and the Australian market with the excess Australian wine, the retailer pressure, the duties in the UK and frankly what’s happened to foreign exchange rates. So we think that the Hardy acquisition itself, it’s a unique circumstance that we have to take this reduction. The US wine acquisitions we’re very happy with. We’re nowhere near any kind of impairment charge and as you guys know, the calculation for SFAS 142 is different than a calculation you would do like if you were deciding to buy a business or not.  It’s different in a lot of ways but one of the big ways is the discount rates assumed. So you know the SFAS 142 impairment charge had a much higher discount rate than we would assume if we were looking to buy something. That all being said, look the profits that we’re generating from Australia and the UK are a lot less than we assumed when we bought the Hardy business, that’s just a fact and as the SFAS 142 calculation looked at it, the future cash flows, although we expect them to grow, they would not grow enough to support that large of an asset base, which is what drove the SFAS 142. But I would also say that this impairment hit really would have no reflection on the other acquisitions that we have done. This one is unique.
Marc Greenberg – Deutsche Bank: Okay and so you know Rob you talked about the $8.00-$20.00 wine segment continuing to perform well and that really is a sweet spot for you guys. If we began to see market deterioration within those price points and prior wine cycles certainly there’s been some volatility there. And it had a negative impact on profitability, would you then based on this impairment stuff be forced to go back and look at your asset value in that kind of a scenario?
Rob Sands:  Yeah we don’t anticipate having any impairment issue with any other acquisitions period. I don’t agree that that segment is as negatively affected in economic downturns, I actually don’t know what history you’re referring to there. But I can tell you that for instance the luxury segment is growing at over 20% at the current time. And as I said, the other super premium category and super premium plus in general is high single digits. You know this is not, these are not categories that are beyond what I would refer to as affordable luxuries.  You’re not talking about $50.00 bottles of wine. So we don’t anticipate that these categories should show any different momentum than they’ve shown in the past. And you know we’re, our acquisitions in general are performing extremely well, they’ve added a lot of value to the company. And you know I don’t anticipate any issues whatsoever outside of, as Bob pointed out, the pretty unique circumstances that we’ve talked about in great detail as it relates to Australia and the Australian business in the UK. That’s a very specific set of circumstances and I think that the good news there is you now really twofold.  Number one, I think that that’s bottomed out, I think that we’re pretty optimistic that at this stage you know it’s only, there’s only upside as opposed to downside and at this stage we’re talking about 10% of our EBIT. So its importance has greatly diminished. So when you combine those two factors that it looks like its bottomed out, there’s only upside, it’s only 10% or so of our EBIT, I think that you know we’re pretty optimistic as we move forward here.
Marc Greenberg – Deutsche Bank: Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you our next question is coming from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Nicolaus.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks. Good morning everyone. A couple questions, cash flow balance sheet and then a beer question. But on the cash flow side of things, when you talk about your interest expense assumptions for fiscal 09 Bob, what assumption are you making regarding sale of non-core assets, is that number zero, $200 million, $300 million, I mean just I appreciate what you said earlier Rob but could you just give us an idea of what your assumption there is?
Bob Ryder:  Yeah we’re not assuming any sale of core assets in our guidance.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. And then if we shift over to free cash flow and look at how its unfolded in the year that just wrapped, obviously very nice and very healthy number, that $376 number, it was quite a bit higher than what you had guided to when you came out of the third quarter. And a little bit of that’s earnings related but it seems like most of that is more working capital related. Can you talk a little bit more about what is going on, I think receivables is a big variable there.  What’s going on there, was it a big customer, what’s going on there? And then if we think about working capital just as a larger area of opportunity, we’ve heard from you Rob about comping folks more on the basis of really delivering the free cash flow, what’s changed in terms of how persons running his or her respective business to make them really just consistently generate cash flow off a given level of sales?
Bob Ryder:  Yeah, I’ll handle the first half of that. But you know cash flow did come in higher than we had guided on the third quarter call, I think we said it would be $280-$300. And you know Mark as you know, cash flow because it’s just a snapshot at the last minute of the year tends to be a little bit more volatile than earnings and I’d say that we had some positive timing. Some of it around working capital in 08 but also a lot of it around tax cash flows, I think that’s probably the big driver here and you know in our K we actually give cash taxes paid and you’ll see it’s a very low number. So that was probably the biggest positive surprise to us versus the guidance that we gave in the third quarter.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay and practice wise can you just comment on you know all of us are trying to figure out how much of this is kind of one-off in nature and how much of it is just you know a higher level of core free cash flows than most of us thought about before?
Bob Ryder:  So I guess some general things and then some specific things. And general things is we are making cash flow, we have made cash flow a component of management incentive which does in my experience does tend to change focus and mentality of the business. So I do think we will see improvements there, we are talking about I call it manageable cash flow which I’ll sort of separate into a couple buckets. And working capital is a big buckets, capital spending is a big bucket and taxes are a big bucket. They’re sort of manageable. So we are focusing a lot more on that.  I would also say that this year mother nature probably helped us a little bit because of the low harvests, primarily in New Zealand and Australia and somewhat in the US. So and that’s a big driver, you know we have an agro piece of our business that we’re exposed to. But even there we’re trying to get more of that within our control and as we speak we’re launching a project to try to see how much we can reduce our investment in inventories. So we’re focusing on our reducing our net investments in working capital. So that’s about it.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: That’s very helpful. Thanks for that. And then Rob on the beer business the scanner data for March is showing a nice pickup in depletions for Corona, do you think that’s representative of depletion rate that we can all see is more broadly occurring across all channels including those that are not captured by the scanner data in March? And then obviously Easter helped but in your experience is Easter a big mover of a given month’s depletions versus a prior period or latter period depletions?
Rob Sands:  Yeah I think that Easter being early definitely had some impact on that but it is only one month, so we’re talking about 12 week period which is, so that kind of balances it out a bit. And then you know we’re expecting mid single digit growth so I think that the trends that you site are demonstrative that we should be able to achieve our targets. So you know we take also as a positive sign and the brand is continuing to exhibit much of the same patterns as its exhibited in the past which is flattened out sales growth in the 12-15 month period following a price increase with growth returning to the brand thereafter but perhaps at a slightly lower rate or a bit lower rate than the growth where it was before the price increase.  So you know all indications are that brand strength is still strong. You know you’re probably read in the paper today that you know Nielsen was quoted as saying that in the 21 year to 35 year old group that Corona is still sighted as the strongest brand and you know that’s pretty indicative of the strength of the brand for the future. So you know we feel pretty good about where we are right now with Crown and the beer business.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: That’s great and real quick, on California you’re kind of highlighting that as an area that’s kind of more challenging than some other markets but sequentially if you look at March for California how is that doing for you again at depletion level versus what you’ve been seeing prior to that?
Rob Sands:  Yeah, California has not bounced back at this stage. You know we don’t want to look like we’ve got our head buried in the sand but not take into account the fact that California has been particularly hard hit by the economy and that could have some effect on the brand in California. On the other hand, you know balancing that with other parts of the country that are not as hard hit and the cycling through of the price increase we think it’s going to get us to the growth that we’ve indicated in our guidance of mid single digit. If California wasn’t as hard hit as it was we’d probably be talking about higher growth rates than that for 09. So our guidance in that regard or the growth rates that we’re indicating that we expect take into account potential softness in that particular market.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: Great, thanks Bob, thanks Rob.
Operator:  Thank you, our next call is coming from Jonathan Feeney from Wachovia.
Jonathan Feeney – Wachovia Securities: Thank you very much. Rob I wanted to, as far as the economic sensitivity of branded wines I wanted to clarify you know the performance of the Mondavi brands, because I remember back in 01, 02 recession, looking at my old model here, it looks like revenues were down 8, cases were down 6 and operating profit was down 16 in fiscal 02. And I guess I know that’s probably at most one-quarter of your business right now but it seemed like that was pretty sensitive. I know you have broader distribution and some probably better marketing but I mean that was a pretty big impact. I mean what do you think has changed about that portfolio in the past five or six years that it’s going to allow it to hold up in a tough macro environment much better?
Rob Sands:  You know I think that the Mondavi brands are really strong brands and have even gotten stronger since that time. I think that you know our having acquired them and our execution against those brands has really been superlative and strengthened the position of those brands. In fact we’ve seen performance in just about any period that you’re talking about that even exceeds our expectations you know, brands like Woodbridge grew 6% last year. I can tell you right now that you know that, we would not have conservatively estimated that the brand would have grown at that rate. But we’re very pleased with the way that it’s been performing.  In the time period that you’re citing, there’s really a big factor that’s a big difference between now and then, in 2001 and that timeframe, there was a big oversupply of grapes at that particular time you know which created some of the phenomena in the marketplace like Two Buck Chuck and that kind of thing. The world is a lot different today, we’ve moved from an oversupply cycle into a cycle where we’re probably moving into undersupply, so you don’t have the same kind of pressures of marginal players that you had during that particular timeframe. So you know that’s one of the big differences and the other big difference is that you know we’ve got the, I believe the strongest organization in the industry selling marketing the Mondavi brands today and I think that’s also a major difference and we’re seeing the results of it.
Jonathan Feeney – Wachovia Securities: Thanks and just if you wouldn’t mind for Bob just one follow up question on the $310 to $340 09 free cash flow guidance, can you give us a ballpark figure how much cash taxes you plan to pay within the context of that guidance?
Bob Ryder:  No, not really because again there’s a lot of timing year over year. We are going to update at our May meeting, we’re going to spend a little bit more time on taxes because I think if you look historically our cash tax rate is well below our effective tax rate. So I would say that next year our cash take tax rate again will be below our effective tax rate. But I’m not ready to give a number right now.
Jonathan Feeney – Wachovia Securities: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator:  Thank you our final question is coming from Bryan Spillane from Banc of America.
Bryan Spillane – Banc of America: Hey, good morning guys. A couple of things, first a clarification. You said low single, fourth quarter low single digit depletion growth for beer, low to mid single digit for wine, did you give a number for spirits as well?
Rob Sands:  We said positive for wine or low single digits.
Bryan Spillane – Banc of America: Okay and then spirits, did you give a depletion number for spirits as well?
Rob Sands:  No but spirit depletions would be very high. Our spirits growth is both with Svedka and without Svedka is pretty strong Bryan.
Bryan Spillane – Banc of America: Okay and then Bob were there any, was there any influence of hedges in your P&L in the fourth quarter? So any mark to market gains or losses?
Bob Ryder:  Nothing material.
Bryan Spillane – Banc of America: Okay and then as we look into next year could you just talk a little bit about where you stand now in terms of hedges, is there anything that we should be thinking about that might influence results next year in terms of hedges?
Bob Ryder:  No I mean we’re keeping our normal hedging policy and I think you know actually year over year, we’re sort of overlapping when dollar sort of reduction in 08, so 09 over 08 there shouldn’t be as much Forex volatility, if we stay where we are now versus what we saw 08 over 07.
Bryan Spillane – Banc of America: Okay and then finally you know as you, Rob as you look out over you know over 09 and in 2010, how would you weight how you’re incenting your managers, meaning what’s the weighting between how much you want to see volume growth, revenue growth, free cash flow improvement and you know improvement in margins and efficiencies, if you could just kind of talk to what the weightings are for your managers now and maybe what that was like, what that is now relative to what it was a year ago or two years ago.
Rob Sands:  Well as I’ve talked about quite a bit, we’ve added a significant free cash flow component to the weighting of our incentives for our managers. Now they also have a significant weighting in EBIT and so that’s a little bit of a double up you could say alright because EBIT is a large portion or a significant component of free cash flow in addition to the balance sheet elements. And then we also have a good weighting or a significant weighting in depletions and depletion growth for our managers.  Because you know obviously we really want them focused on driving that. So the exact weighting it really differs depending on what level you’re talking about in the company and it’s not the same for everybody because you know we tailor it somewhat to what we’re trying to accomplish in various division and segments and this and that. But those are the three things that in general would be the areas that we focus on for our people when it comes to their incentive plans.
Bryan Spillane – Banc of America: And just relative to what incentives look like previous, it’s you know less volume oriented and more profit and cash flow oriented, is it fair to say that?
Rob Sands:  More cash flow oriented and therefore less of the other two because to include cash flow obviously, something had to be reduced. But in general and historically, our incentive comp has been pretty much focused on EBIT and depletion growth and we added the cash flow component to get more focus in particular on the balance sheet, you know people were focused on EBIT generally in any event and as Bob pointed out they’ve become you know the cash flow component has people more focused on what we call controllable cash flow which in addition to the P&L would basically be the areas of working capital and cap ex and you know it really gets people focused on the nuts and bolts of working capital.  I mean you know there’s no silver bullet to any of it but when people start looking at all of the elements of cash flow and thinking about how they can impact each one of those elements, you know it’s a little bit here and a little bit there and you know before you know it you’re talking about real money and I think that that’s one of the reasons why we feel pretty good about the fact that you know the kind of cash flow we generated last year is going to be sustainable as we move into this year, albeit a little bit less, our guidance was a bit less but still in the $300 plus range, $310-$340 million which you know I think is pretty indicative that you guys can expect more conversion of EBIT to cash flow and is consistent with our focus on generating cash flow and debt pay downs. So that’s where we’re at.
Bryan Spillane – Banc of America: Okay, great, thanks guys.
Rob Sands:  Okay well thank you all for joining our call today. As I indicated I’m really very pleased with the progress that we’ve made during the year on all fronts. Our accomplishments in fiscal 2008 position us well for success in the future and I’m very optimistic about where we’re headed in 2009. We feel that we’re well on the way to meeting our mid to long term goals that I’ve talked about which we’re certainly going to discuss more in detail when we get together at our upcoming investor meeting in New York, scheduled for late May. So we’re looking forward to seeing you all then and thanks again for your participation today.
Operator:  Thank you, that does conclude today’s Constellation Brand’s fiscal 2008 earnings conference call, you may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

Before we get started I want to mention howpleased I amthat we recently finalized theacquisition of Fortune Brands US wine portfolio. This acquisition marks anothermilestone inthe growthand development of our business as itfurther strengthens our leadership position inthe US wineindustry, improving our overall scale and our premium position.  The total portfolioof products we acquired is well positioned among the fastest growing super premium-pluswines, solidifying our position as anundisputed leader inthe US winebusiness. These super premium and above categories are growing at double-digit growth rates of 14% andrepresent approximately 40% of theentire US wine business inIRI channels on avalue basis.  The acquired Closdu Bois brand is theleading super premium wine brand inthe US.According to themost recent IRI data, ithas beengrowing at a rateof 18% on avolume basis during thelast 52-week period. Clos du Bois hasa range ofproduct offerings, including theleading presence insuper premium chardonnay and strong growth across all keyvarietals. This brand is now thebest selling Sonoma County wine and will join other major wine assets we have in that area, including Simi andRavenswood.  ConstellationsUS market share of thesuper premium and above categories is expected to increase by approximatelyfive percentage points on both avolume and value basis with theaddition of theacquired wine brands.  As we mentionedpreviously, we will betaking arestructuring charge associated with theintegration of this acquisition sothat we may fully realize thesynergies that will result inthe combinedwine operations of both entities. Bob will outline the details of the restructuring plan in just a few minutes.  As we integratethis newly-acquired wine business we arealso taking theopportunity to evaluate and rationalize our US wine product portfolio,primarily within thevalue segment. This includes smaller, low-margin, regional brands at price points generally less than $5and includes brands such as Vinicasada (sic), Capri, Vintner’s Choice, just toname a few.  From the sales and marketing perspective ourgoal is to focus on specific consumer segment opportunities to include finewines, premium wines, and specialty value wines. Overall, we are taking the appropriate actions to further strengthenthe growthand profitability of our wine business and will continue to take advantage of the favourable consumer trade-up trendsoccurring inthemarketplace. Now I’d like todiscuss our performance for thethird quarter of fiscal 2008. We continue to execute on our strategy andachieve our financial goals which positions us well for the year. As you can see from our press release, one of the financial highlights of the current quarter is that we achievedexcellent free cash flowperformance. As aresult, we aresignificantly increasing our free cash flowguides for theyear. Bob will have more to sayabout this ina fewmoments. Our US winebusiness returned to targeted sales growth levels during the quarter as theUS distributor inventory reduction initiative was essentially completed in thesecond quarter. Thepositive momentum continues around our wine premiumization efforts with USsales growth during thequarter contributed to by premium wines, including Robert Mondovi brands,Estancia, Blackstone, KimCrawford, Simi, just to name afew.  Moving to the United Kingdom and Australia. Asexpected, theyear-over-year results for thethird quarter were impacted by continuing competitive market conditions in theUK and Australia.  In the UK there is diminishing availabilityof both wines for production of low-cost private label Australian wines due to the lower Australian harvest in 2007 and the projected short harvest in 2008. However, UK market pricing has not changed significantly as the wine market overall remains quitecompetitive, primarily driven by thelarge grocery chains. I’m generallypleased with theprogress of theMatthew Clark joint venture with Punch Taverns, which provides wholesaleservice to theUK on-premise channel.  From a marketplace perspective, according to the most recent Nielsen UK-wide trans-data,Constellation is outperforming themarket in the price points where we have the most significant market share. In addition, we continue to makeprogress inoffsetting challenging UK market conditions by focusing on increasing marketshare for our premium wine offerings, including the recently acquired super premiumbrands; improving our go-to-market model increasing our penetration in non-grocery channels such ason-premise convenience and specialty retailers; and working to improve ouroperating efficiencies to include initiatives such as streamlining our supply chain. We believe these efforts willdrive improvements inour future financial performance inthe UKmarket. In Australia, the continuing drought conditions are expected to impact the output of the 2008 harvest, although at this time we cannot fully predict the magnitude of this impact. Ourpreviously announced restructuring actions inAustralia areprogressing as planned and should position us well for the future. Our Canadianwine business delivered positive revenue growth primarily driven byJackson-Triggs naked grape and our Inniskillin ice wine products. In the spirit segment the strong marketplace momentum ofSVEDKA vodka continues with theposting of 50% shipment growth inthe thirdquarter. Thebase spirits business also contributed strong sales growth in thequarter driven by premium brands, including Black Velvet, Ridgemont Reservebourbon, and the99 Schnapps family, and recently launched new product as we continue to benefitfrom thepremiumization trend occurring inthe market. Additionally, weclosed on thepurchase of theremaining 50% of thePlanet 10 joint venture for Effen vodka. Effen vodka continues to benefit from a strong marketplace performance withvolumes increasing 55% inIRI channels during thelast 52-week period.  Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. During the quarter, Crowns’ performance wasprimarily impacted by price increase, by theprice increase which Corona implemented earlier this year for the entire Modello beer portfolio. It continues to impact volumes, althoughthe trendshave been improving as anticipated and aretracking very closely to thetrends experienced with prior price increases. Year over year,Crown trends for thesecond half of this year areexpected to beimpacted by challenging comparisons as we prepared for the joint venture transition during the same time last year. However, Crownis continuing to focus on approved execution and generating ad features andpromotions that arecommensurate with its leading US market share in theimported beer category. Inaddition, consumer trade-up trends arecontinuing to support thegrowth of theCrown brands.  Now, before Iturn thecall over to Bob I want to address theimpact of theeconomic downturn on our business as ithas recentlybeen top of mindfor many of our shareholders. Although thebeverage alcohol industry is somewhat immune to unfavourable economic trends, the category has experienced varying segment growth rate atretail in the US during calendar year 2007. Forinstance, recent industry retail data shows thegrowth transfer beer and thespirits category have remained relatively constant while the wine segment continues to exhibithealthy growth, albeit ata slowingrate.  For instance, the dollar growth rate of super premium wines and above ismore than twice thedollar growth rateof beer or spirits. Moreover, thesuper premium plus wine segment where Constellation has leading market share is experiencingdouble-digit volume and dollar growth, also exceeding the trends of the US wine segment. And we continue to see afavourable consumer trade up to premium products across all beverage alcohol categories thatshould drive positive mixed impact on our margins going forward. The diversificationof our total portfolio also helps to insulate us from consumption shiftsbetween beverage alcohol categories. While we’re well aware of the economic challenges impacting manyindustries, beverage alcohol products arenot expected to beas significantly impacted as other consumer discretionary goods. In closing,overall I feel good about what we’ve accomplished so far this year. I’m pleased with ourrecent premium wine acquisition and I’m confident in our ability to achieve our goals for the year. Now I’d like toturn thecall over to Bob Ryder for afinancial review of thequarter. Bob?
Robert Ryder: Thanks, Rob.Good morning, everyone. Ingeneral I’m pleased with our results for thequarter as we generated 6% organic net sales growth on a constant currency basis. Comparablebasis diluted EPS was $0.55 versus $0.58 last year as our results continue to be negatively impacted by the UK and Australian businesses. We’vecontinued our efforts to better position these business for improvedperformance as evidenced by our recent Australian winery rationalizationannouncement. I’m especially pleased that for the year to date we have generatedexcellent free cash flowand we expect free cash flowfor fiscal 2008 to besignificantly above last year and our previous estimate.  I’d like tostart with areview of our P&L for thequarter where my comments will focus on comparable basis financial results. Forthe thirdquarter theSVEDKA acquisition and theCrown and Matthew Clark wholesale joint ventures impacted the comparability of results.  Let’s look at our net sales line. As you can see from our news release on page 14, ourconsolidated net sales decreased 27% reflecting the moveof our US imported beers to theCrown Imports joint venture and theUK wholesale business to theMatthew Clark joint venture. As previously discussed, these joint venturesfollow equity accounting and, therefore, areno longer reflected on theconsolidated net sales line. This impact was partially offset by a 1% benefit from the SVEDKA acquisition, 3% benefit fromcurrency, and branded wine growth. Commentary for the following net sales comparisons willbe on a constant currency basis. Weexperienced a6% increase inthe consolidatedorganic net sales for thequarter. Spirits net sales increased 31% due to the acquisition of SVEDKA and a 12% inorganic net sales driven by higher average selling prices and volume gains forbranded spirits portfolio, as well as anincrease inour production services business. We continue to be very pleased with SVEDKA and itsmarketplace momentum as itcontinues to generate high double-digit sales growth. World-wide branded wineorganic net sales increase 4%.  Turning ourattention to branded wine geographic net sales on page 13 of the release you will see branded wine net sales for NorthAmerica increased 5% reflecting solid growth inthe US and a slight increase in Canada. For Europe, branded wineorganic net sales increased 4% reflecting increased sales of popular pricedwines inmainland Europe and aslight increase insales in the UK. Our Australian/New Zealandbranded wine net sales were level with last year. The markets in theUK and Australia remain highly competitive with ongoing pricing pressures. Now we’ll look at our profit for the quarter on a comparable basis using informationpresented on page 15 of thenewsrelease. For thequarter our consolidated gross margin was 36.3%, up 5.3 percentage points. Thisprimarily reflected thebenefits of shifting thelower margin UK wholesale and imported beer businesses to joint venturestructures subject to equity accounting somewhat offset by lower margins for the branded wine businesses in theUK and Australia.  Our consolidatedSG&A for thequarter was 18% of net sales compared with 12.5% a year ago. This increase was primarilydue to moving theimported beer and UK wholesale businesses to joint venture structures. In addition we saw increased managementincentive expense due to alow bonusaccrual in the prior year.  As noted in previous quarters, we have alsorecognized higher stock compensation expense for the transition effects of the new option accounting rules. The quarter also includes highermarketing support for branded wine inthe UK. Consolidatedoperating income decreased to $200 million from $279 million for the prior year’s quarter. This change was primarily driven by the factors already mentioned, combinedwith reporting $62 million of equity earnings for the Crown joint venture compared to the third quarter of last year when $60million of earnings for imported beer business was included in operating income.  The year-over-yearincrease inbeer business profitability reflects increased pricing and the economics of having a national platform for the Modella portfolio. We did see lower profit growth for the beer business versus the first half of the year. This was primarilyattributable to thehigh level of sales and theprior year third quarter as thebusiness was preparing for theCrown transition.  Now I’d like toturn to our segment operating income results which are reflected on page 12 of the release. Wine segment operatingincome decreased $12 million to $202 million. This was primarily due to the UK and Australia businessperformance, partially offset by anincrease inprofits from our North American business. For the spirits segment operating incomeincreased $4 million, primarily due to thecontributions from SVEDKA and higher sales for the base business, offset somewhat byhigher material costs. For the quarter, corporate and otherexpenses totalled $23 million compared with $13 million for the prior year. The increase includes additionalmanagement incentive and stock compensation expenses for the reasons I mentioned earlier and higheroutside service and professional fees. Moving back topage 15, equity investment earnings totalled $75 million versus $12 millionlast year. Equity earnings for thequarter arecomprised of $62 million from Crown and theremainder related substantially to our Opus One joint venture.  Interest expensefor thequarter was $82 million, up 13% over last year. The increase primarily reflects the incremental interests from funding the SVEDKA acquisition in the$500 million share repurchase, net of theproceeds received from theMatthew Clark transaction, allof which occurred inthe firstquarter. Now let’s take a look at our debt. At theend of November our debt totalled $4.7 million, a decrease of nearly $300 million fromour Q1 debt level, reflecting our strong free cash flow generation during the second and third quarters. At theend of thethird quarter we had approximately $2.4 billion of bank debt and $2.3 billionof fixed-term and other debt with approximately $850 million of revolvingcredit available under our senior facility. In mid-December weclosed theacquisition of Fortune Brands US wine business for a purchase price of $885 million. Wefinanced theacquisition using net proceeds from thesale of $500 million of 8.38% senior notes due in 2014, together, with borrowings undertherevolving portion of our senior credit facility. The average interest rate on our revolving borrowings isabout 6.2%.  We’re verypleased to have executed anefficient bond offering ina verychallenging market. This reflects our ability to access capital markets, even in adifficult financing environment, and itshows our experience inexecuting acquisition and financing transactions. As previouslydiscussed, theacquisitions expected to bring our debt to comparable basis EBIDTA ratio to the five to 5.5 times range. Although onthe highside of our historical range, we’re quite comfortable with this level. As wehave done historically, we believe we can reduce this ratio to around the mid four times range over the next 12 months by paying down debtwith free cash flowgenerated by our growing phase and thecash flowfrom our acquired business. Our comparablebasis tax ratefor thequarter came inat 37.1%versus 36.1% last year, and our weighted average diluted shares outstandingtotalled 219 million compared to 239 million last year reflecting the benefit of the share repurchase. Due to the many factors just mentioned, dilutedEPS was $0.55 versus $0.58 inthe thirdquarter last year. Now let’s turnto our cash flowon page 11. For thepurposes of this discussion, free cash flowis defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capex. For the first nine months of fiscal ’08 we generated$173 million of free cash flowversus a $22million usage inthe prioryear. Theyear-over-year increase reflects improved working capital, lower taxes paid,and reduced capital spending.  Beginning in 2008, cash flow is now part of management’sincentive and as acorporation we’re much more focused on generating free cash flow. As a result of the strong performance to date we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for the year to a range of $280 million to $300 million.This is $160 million to $180 million above prior year’s free cash flow. Thisimprovement is primarily attributable to lower taxes paid, reduced capitalspending, and lower working capital investment.  Now let’ssummarize Q3 and discussion our full-year P&L guidance. From an earnings perspective we’re pleasedwith our results. Net sales growth for thequarter and on ayear-to-date basis, excluding theimpact of thereduction of US distributor inventory, hastracked inline with our long-term stated goals.  We continue toclosely monitor theAustralian harvest dynamics and thepotential marketplace impacts. TheUK and Australian markets remain difficult, but we believe we’re makingprogress with theinitiatives we have inplace that aredesigned to improve thefuture performance. Moving to ourP&L expectations for thefull year 2008, we’re revising our comparable basis EPS outlook to $1.33 to$1.38 range from our previous range of $1.34 to $1.42. This includes an anticipated $0.04 dilution impactfrom theacquisition of Fortune Brands’ US wine business and tightening the bottom end of the range.  As previouslydiscussed, thedilution is being primarily driven by thehigh levels of product inventory currently inthedistributor channel, which is expected to result in net sales for the acquired business that will be well below normal levels for Januaryand February. As areminder, we substantially completed our initiative to reduce distributor wineinventories inthe US by the end of the second quarter. The goal of this initiative was toassure distributors have sufficient inventory to meet consumer demand, but toreduce any permanent bumper stock innon-peak periods.  As previouslydiscussed, thecompletion of this program is driving atiming changein our USwine sales pattern. Our new shipment patterns, we expect a lower growth rate inQ4 as we return to thelower distributor inventory level established at theend of thesecond quarter.  The Q4 comparisonfor the beerbusiness will also bedifficult as thefourth quarter last year benefitted from anassimilation of theeast coast Modello brands business into theCrown JV. Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition-relatedintegration costs, restructuring, and related charges, and unusual items which are detailed on page 17 of the release. On pages fourand five of therelease we outline plans for theintegration of Clos du Bois and theother acquired brands. Realignment of thesales and marketing organizations supporting our US wine business and the rationalization of certainlow-margin, low-growth brands. Collectively we believe these actions willfurther strengthen our US wine business and produce enough synergies of about$30 million annually by theend of 2010, with approximately $20 million insynergies being achieved infiscal 2009. We arestill targeting about apenny to two-penny accretion infiscal 2009 for theacquired wine business. This includes thesynergy benefits just outlined. The majority ofsynergies will begenerated inthe salesand marketing area where we expect to add thenewly acquired brand and maintain essentially the same level of sales and marketingcosts as we had prior to theacquisition. To better assure thecommercial focus on our new (inaudible) consumer segments we’re rationalizingcertain low-margin brands from our current portfolio.  We expect toincur $45 million on one-time charges related to these restructuring andintegration activities, themajority of which arerelated to SG&A and brand exit costs. We expect approximately half of thisamount to come inas cash charges for employee termination and acquisition-related integration costsand theother half as non-cash charges for asset write-offs and accelerateddepreciation. Thecash impacts from this activity is contemplated in our fiscal 2008 free cash flow guidance.  In addition, weexpect to incur one-time cash costs of $28 million for employee and contractterminations that will bereported in the allocation of purchase price for the acquired wine business, with most ofthese payments expected to occur infiscal 2009.  Additionalassumptions for our full fiscal 2008 guidance are outlined on page five and six of the release. As you canimagine, we’ve been very busy assimilating our recent acquisition anddeveloping our new US wine organization. We arealso beginning theprocess of developing our 2009 annual plan. This planning process will be finished in March when we intend to provide fullfiscal 2009 guidance as part of our fourth quarter fiscal 2008 reportingactivities, which aretentatively scheduled for April 3rd.  With that, we’rehappy to take your questions. 
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions.(Operator Instructions). Our first question is coming from Bryan Spillane ofBanc of America. Please go ahead.
Bryan Spillane – Banc of America: Hi. Goodmorning.
Robert Sands: Good morning,Bryan.
Bryan Spillane – Banc of America: Just twoquestions related to thewine business. One, just interms of restructuring activity and cost-savings measures for 2009, I knowyou’ve outlined $20 million of incremental savings related to assimilating orintegrating theFortune Brands business. Should we expect that there will be incremental savings above and beyondthat relative to what you’re doing to therest of your business? And then the second question with regards to freecash flow. Very nice to seethe increasein free cashflowguidance for 2008, especially given that there’s some cash costs related tosome of therestructuring activity. Is that amore normal run ratefor free cash flowas we begin to model out 2009 and 2010? Should we start to think about this asbeing a morenormal run ratefor free cash flow? Thanks. 
Robert Ryder: Hi, Bryan. It’sBob. I guess on thefirst question I’d saythe numberswe put in the press release regarding the costs and benefits of the restructuring activities, they’reour best estimates right now. And as you know, these are estimates. We hope to do better, but these are our best estimates right now. Ithink you’ll also look at, thegood thing about therestructuring is we areacting quite fastso we are getting a lot of the restructuring costs behind usquickly. And also, we’re getting savings quite quickly. And if you just look at thecash payback on these activities, it’s inbetween about ayear and two years. Soit’s apretty quick payback on therestructuring activities.  On the cash flow, we’re very happy with the cash flow for this year. We’re not reallygiving guidance for future years cash flow, but as a corporation, as I mentioned, we are much more focused on bringing moreof our EBIDTA down to thefree cash flowline. So Ihope we continue to seebetter cash flowperformance as we go forward. We’re not giving any specifics right now. 
Bryan Spillane – Banc of America: Would it befair to saythat thefactors that drove theincrease in yourfree cash flowguidance aresort of more sustainable-type things, like better working capital management asopposed to one-time things like asset sales or one-time, like, cash taxrefunds?
Robert Ryder: Yeah, I’d say they’re probably more along the more permanent cycle. However, youknow, on working capital we dohave a lotof exposure to agro industry, sowe aresomewhat subject to thetiming of harvests and things like that. And one of the bigdrivers this year for theimproved working capital is we dohave reduced inventories inthe US and in Australia. We think that’s healthyfor thebusiness.  We are focused on keeping our cash tax rate down; we’ve been pretty successfulwith that and hope we can keep replicating that. And the other drivers to improve cash flow is reduced capital spending. We are very focused on capital spending,however, we aregoing to spend what we need to keep thebusiness quite healthy. But I think as we make part of management’scompensation attributable to cash flowit is havingthe desiredimpact. Sonow we have alltheassociates inthe businessreally focused on how we can drive better cash flow from the business. 
Bryan Spillane – Banc of America: Okay. Great.Thank you, guys.
Robert Sands: Thanks, Bryan.
Operator: Thank you. Ournext question is coming from Lauren Torres of HSBC. Please go ahead.
Lauren Torres – HSBC: Good morning.
Robert Sands: Hi, Lauren.
Lauren Torres – HSBC: Hi. I was hopingyou could just bea littlebit, if you can, more specific on performance at Crown Imports in thequarter. You know, obviously we’re still talking about the impact of the price increases on your volumes, butif you could give us any sense of either shipment or consumption data thatwould behelpful.
Robert Sands: Yeah, you know,as we continue to say, Crown is really performing right in accordance with expectations and istracking very closely to what occurred when we previously increased pricing. The business is fundamentally veryhealthy. If you look at, take for instance depletion growth rates, the Crown business, even with the price increase, continues to grow inthe low single-digits, which is, as I said,pretty consistent with what typically occurs during a price increase year. So ingeneral, Crown is meeting our expectations and we’re pleased with its performance.
Lauren Torres – HSBC: And you saidthat you’ve seen some improvement, I guess, over the last couple months beyond November?
Robert Sands: Yes. As we startgetting into theyear following theprice increase in’08 we’re seeing some improvement.
Lauren Torres – HSBC: Okay. And if Icould also just ask aquick question on spirits, organic sales inthe quarterwas up 12%. Can you just give us anidea, you know, obviously that’s not SVEDKA’s, so what’s really driving the growth right now behind your spiritsdivision? I guess we saw that last quarter, also. If you could give us a sense of how sustainable these growthrates are. 
Robert Sands: Yeah, well, youknow, it isattributable inpart to our premium businesses, thetrend towards premiumization trading off those businesses continue to do very well. So ingeneral we’re pleased with our spirits’ performance and our strategy offocusing on themore premium categories and developing internally premium brands is paying off.These arehigh levels of growth. I don’t know that they’re sustainable at those levels on an organic basis forever, but we’re verypleased with thespirits performance and continued good spirits performance.
Lauren Torres – HSBC: But is thisgrowth more volume or price related? I’d assume price related.
Robert Sands: It’s a mix of prices and volume. Volumes are strong on our premium portfolios.And pricing is, there’s some pricing inthere as well. Sopricing, mix and volume. Allthree factors.
Lauren Torres – HSBC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ournext question is coming from Christine Farkas of Merrill Lynch. Please goahead.
Christine Farkas – Merrill Lynch: Thank you verymuch. Good morning, Rob.
Robert Sands: Hello,Christine.
Christine Farkas – Merrill Lynch: A question onyour volumes, if I could, your rationalized volumes on the value wine portfolio. Can you giveus a senseof how much of your volume you’re considering rationalizing here, either in percentage of below $5 or percentageof total portfolio? Just to geta sense ofwhat kind of size we’re talking about.
Robert Sands: Yeah, well,we’re really working on that atthe currenttime so wedon’t have any specific numbers to give you on that other than to say that, you know, as a result of how we will go about doingthis and taking advantage of things like greater focus on our premiumportfolio, theability to substitute either listings or skews, and this kind of thing, wereally don’t expect itfrom anEBIDT perspective to have material impact on us at all. We think it’s a good thing for the business and it’s not somethingthat, you know, as I said, from anearnings perspective we’re particularly concerned about.
Christine Farkas – Merrill Lynch: Okay. What aboutfrom amarket share perspective again? Would that besomething meaningful?
Robert Sands: Well, we’ll see when it allgets done, but atthe moment Idon’t think we really anticipated to have ameaningful impact. But as I said, we’ll seewhen all the plans are complete and the rationalization is finished. 
Christine Farkas – Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. A couple of classifications, if I could.Back to your capex. You did talk about lower capital spending. Were there anyspecific projects that you pushed out into fiscal ’09 or anything that couldreverse interms of your capital spending plans that would be considered not, I guess, ongoing in your new free cash flow step up?
Robert Ryder: This is Bob. No,we don’t, we did reduce our capital budget for this year and we don’t expect tospend that infuture years.
Christine Farkas – Merrill Lynch: Okay. So that’s real. And then finally onspirits, again, back to thestep up inorganic growth, we saw second and third quarter organic growth of 11%, 12%. Youdid mention, Rob, about anincrease inproduction services. Could that have something to do with the fact that the pace of growth in organic spirits really stepped up in thesecond and third quarter and can you comment on the margins of those businesses?
Robert Ryder: Yeah, this isBob. Theproduction services, you know, was areasonably large piece of thegrowth involume. We don’t make much money on it. It’s more of a way to leverage our productionfacility.
Christine Farkas – Merrill Lynch: And is thatsomething that was picked up earlier this year, for example in thesecond quarter? Or hasthis been ongoing for some time?
Robert Sands: It’s sort ofchoppy, depending on when our suppliers want theproduct. But itcertainly was pretty bigin the third quarter and it was in thesecond quarter as well.
Christine Farkas – Merrill Lynch: Okay. And thenjust finally, could you comment on thegrowth of high-end spirits versus low-end spirits? Are you seeing a continuation of what you saw in earlier quarters?
Robert Sands: Yeah, I thinkthat trend continues. Generally thetrend continues over allbeverage alcohol. There is awhole trading up mentality through allthecategories and we’re trying to take advantage of that in thespirits business through our higher-end spirits product offerings likeRidgemont Reserve, Effen, and SVEDKA. Those products are allperforming quite well intheir categories. We’re very happy with them.
Christine Farkas – Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank youvery much.
Operator: Thank you. Ournext question is coming from Bill Leach with Neuberger Berman. Please go ahead.
William Leach – Neuberger Berman: Good morning,everyone.
Robert Sands: Good morning,Bill.
William Leach – Neuberger Berman: I was justwondering if you could elaborate abit more on your implied fourth quarter guidance. If you look at your new full-year guidance you’reimplying afourth quarter EPS of about $0.25 versus $0.35 and if you add that $0.04 for the Fortune wine dilution it’s still$0.29 versus $0.35, soit’s down 17%, you have about 8% to your share. That’s not a real cheery forecast, I don’t think.Could you just, you mentioned afew things inpassing, but why would thequarter bethat weak?
Robert Sands: Yeah, there’s a couple things going on. We’ve got the UK and Australia margins are bringing down the estimates versus prior year. Ofcourse thenew dilution we just announced is bringing itdown. And we still have some SVEDKA dilution, okay? Quarter over quarter isalso contributing to it. 
William Leach – Neuberger Berman: In terms of the Fortune dilution, do you expect that all being in theFebruary fourth quarter or was itlikely to dribble into thefirst quarter of next fiscal year?
Robert Ryder: No, it’s fourthquarter. Theother thing inthe fourthquarter, as Rob and I mentioned, we were overlapping some pretty favourablebeer (inaudible) from last year as we rolled out the Crown joint venture. So you should not expect to see good beer sales or profit numbers in thefourth quarter. Also, the timing, as I mentioned in my script on wine sales, as we bringour distributor inventories down to thelevels we established inthe secondquarter, you shouldn’t expect to seevery good wine sales growth inthe fourthquarter either.  Those two are mostly overlapped timing things. The underlying businesses are still very healthy.
William Leach – Neuberger Berman: And in terms of the UK, is there some point where wejust getaround to comparing against such terrible results that ceases to be ayear-to-year negative? I mean, it’s not ahuge part of your business and itseems like it’s been dragging down your results for two years now.
Robert Sands: Yeah, that’sfair enough. I think we have taken abig downcheck because of theduty increase and some (inaudible) rates, soI think theyear-over-year erosion, this was abig erosion,we’re not talking about next year, but I don’t think we’d expect it to bethe kind oferosion we’ve seen this year. Sohopefully, you know, that’s why we’re keeping our eye on the Australian harvest, because that has abig impacton both theAustralian business and theUK business. We think we’re doing theright thing to make that business as profitable as it can be. 
William Leach – Neuberger Berman: Could it possibly be ayear-to-year positive infiscal ’09?
Robert Sands: We’re not reallytalking about ’09 yet, but we’ll let you know on the fourth quarter call for sure.
William Leach – Neuberger Berman: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Ournext question is coming from Tim Ramey with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Timothy Ramey – D. A. Davidson & Co.: Good morning.First on theSVEDKA business. I think you said itwas up 50% inshipments. Was that sequential or was that year over year?
Robert Sands: Year over year,Tim.
Timothy Ramey – D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. It looked like there’s quite a strong sequential as well, but Iassume there’s aseasonal pattern to this as theholidays.
Robert Sands: Yeah, I would say that that’s probably true. But the brand’s been growing, you know, in that range in general for us. So I don’t think it, if it varies sequentially is really notindicative of anything. Ingeneral it’s been growing inthat sort of high double-digit, you know, 50% range.
Timothy Ramey – D. A. Davidson & Co.: And we had thisdiscussion when you bought it, but if itcontinues inhigh double-digit growth that’s probably above the range that you modelled for yourdilution assumptions. Is thedilution from SVEDKA less onerous that you thought it would be or likely to be less than you thought it would be?
Robert Ryder: Tim, this isBob. We had pretty high expectations for SVEDKA, as we had to. So it’s pretty much performing in line with our acquisition modelassumptions. SoI think thedilution assumptions arestill pretty valid.
Timothy Ramey – D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. And thenI, grape purchases, we didn’t talk about that, but your model in thelast couple years hasbeen sort of theglobal backstop, backstopping any potential short falls with the global supply chain. With Australia sort of drying upis anything changingthere? Areyou extending your contracts with US growers? What’s the status there?
Robert Sands: I’d say that we continue to be pretty much in balance. When you take a look at Australia it’s the same story. Oversupply turning intobalance, potentially turning into undersupply. But those are not trends that we expect to be unfavourable to us. So ingeneral I would sayin terms ofour global position and theway that our portfolios arepositioned to beable to use wines from different appellations I would say that we continue to be inpretty good balance.
Timothy Ramey – D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. And justone on thewine restructuring. Doyou have anumber of SKUs that you’re eliminating there that you can share?
Robert Sands: On the wine restructuring? Well, Imentioned, you’re talking about therationalization I mentioned?
Timothy Ramey – D. A. Davidson & Co.: Yeah, that’sright. Is itthree brands or 20?
Robert Sands: Oh, it’s morethan three brands. I gave you some examples. As I said, brands that you’dactually never heard of, would never have heard of and most people would haveheard of. Small regional brands that arelegacy businesses and relatively lowmargin. You know, there’s awhole slew of brands like that, but again itwouldn’t beanything that you’d be, you’d inalllikelihood would have heard of.
Timothy Ramey – D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you.
Robert Sands: I know you drinkbetter wine than that, Tim.
Timothy Ramey – D. A. Davidson & Co.: ---Laughter Thanks, Rob. 
Operator: Thank you. Ournext question is coming from Risa Vahasetta (sic) with Lehman Brothers. Pleasego ahead.
Risa Vahasetta (sic) – Lehman Brothers: Good morning.
Robert Sands: Hi, Risa.
Risa Vahasetta (sic) – Lehman Brothers: On the wine business EBIDT decline the dynamic of UK, you know, EBIDT in thewine business weakening and US kind of strengthening, is that likely tocontinue in the next quarter or two or are we going to level out at some point?
Robert Sands: We have a number of initiatives ongoing in both Australia and the UK. Australia we just put out a month or so agoon we’re doing some wine re-rationalization down there. In theUK we’re doing apretty significant supply chaininvestment to reduce our costs over there. Sowe’re doing alot to improve thelong-term profitability of this business. I’d say ingeneral, you know, look, you can’t keep seeing these kind of declines or eventuallyyou sort of go out of business. SoI would saythat yes, inthe mediumterm these things are, they gotta turn around. There’s no choice.
Risa Vahasetta (sic) – Lehman Brothers: And when didthis import duty that you mentioned inthe UK startto impact theresults? I can’t recall off hand. 
Robert Sands: It comes in around the March time period.
Risa Vahasetta (sic) – Lehman Brothers: Okay. Now onceyou cycle after March doyou still think UK EBIDT will still beunder dollar pressure or can you start to level out?
Robert Sands: We’reanticipating what theUK duty increase will be, which happens inMarch, and we think we have thebusiness plans to improve profitability inthe UK as wego forward, but we donot know what thegovernment’s going to do. Sowe have anumber of alternatives depending on what theduty increase will be. But we think we’re as prepared as we can be for what’s going to happen in March.
Risa Vahasetta (sic) – Lehman Brothers: Got it. And thenlastly on theMNA environment thepotential consolidation inthe industrywith theSwedish spirits business, I mean, how can that potentially impact you positiveor otherwise if any?
Robert Sands: Well, that’s onetransaction that you’re talking about. TheVNS deal. Theindustry does continue to consolidate, but there also continues to be opportunities across the beverage alcohol segment that I’msure we’ll beable to take advantage of. SoI don’t seeany dramatic changein the environment in that regard at this point in time. 
Risa Vahasetta (sic) – Lehman Brothers: But do you think that potential sale willactually offer you more opportunities or more of the same?
Robert Sands: You know, as Isaid, it’s just one sale. It’s hard to, areyou asking if there’s any specific opportunities coming out of that sale? Ifthat’s thecase, I mean, I think we’ve said that we’re not really going to play in theVNS deal for absolute, you know, we’re not anticipating necessarily, withoutcommenting on any specific transactions, you know, it impacting us from an opportunities standpoint one way oranother.
Risa Vahasetta (sic) – Lehman Brothers: But will there be repercussions from that sale thatother people may have to sell stuff that might be of interest to you?
Robert Sands: You know, that’salways possible. It’s hard to speculate on those kind of things because wedon’t know who’s going to buy it. Yeah, that’s possible. 
Risa Vahasetta (sic) – Lehman Brothers: Okay.
Robert Sands: If that’s whatyou were getting at, yes, that’s possible.
Risa Vahasetta (sic) – Lehman Brothers: I appreciate it.I had to ask thequestion. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ournext question is coming from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus. Please goahead.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks. Goodmorning, everyone. 
Robert Sands: Good morning,Mark.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: I guess onecorporate question and then acouple business questions. On thecorporate side, just interms of theshares outstanding, when you take your full-year guidance it seems like you’re implying about 224million, 225 million shares on average inthe fourthquarter. Is that right?
Robert Sands: Yeah, that’sabout right.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: And is thatbecause of restricted, like, inthe latestquarter it’s more like a219, 220 level. Is that restricted stock options? Why would we see such a material pick up?
Robert Sands: It should be for the fourth quarter, you should assumeabout 220 million shares.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: Oh. So it’s not really a 225 full-year number?
Robert Sands: A little bitlower than that.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. All right. All right. Then that’s helpful. Okay.And then moving on to thebusiness. Starting inNorth America, ina sense. Ifyou look atyour North American wine business, it’s been therelative outperformer, if you will, inthe quarterversus theUK and Australia. Not only ina salessense, but as best we can tell ina marginsense. But we really don’t know what absolutely is happening with the margins here in North America. Can you give us a sense, are your contributions margins in North America up year on year versusthird quarter of fiscal ’07 and also how does the operating margin – and I’m talkingNorth America wine, obviously excluding spirits – but how does the operating margin for North Americanwine look versus last year, as well?
Robert Sands: It’s relativelyeven with last year for thequarter.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: Even. Okay. Andyou’re talking atwhich level? Contribution, operating?
Robert Sands: Operating marginkind of level.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Perfect.And then going to themore challenged business, theUK and Australia wine business, obviously we’ve been talking about thiscollectively for anumber of quarters here, but when you look atthe input cost pressure, if you will, rising and so far not getting the release you’d like at theretail level interms of selling price, them accepting selling price increases, can you talk a little bit more than you have alreadyabout theenvironment for getting theselling price increases accepted by your retail partners, both in theUK and Australia?
Robert Sands: Yeah. Mark, thisis Rob. I would saythat our view is that pricing is going to have to be taken. It’s pretty much as simple asthat if you read any of thetrade press, both inour industry and inother industries for that matter, suppliers areindicating pretty much across, you know, allconsumer goods durable that they’re going to take pricing. I would say that as a consequence of that we’re hopeful thattheenvironment is going to bepositive inthat regard. Is that to saythat theretailers aregoing to like it? No. Theretailers aresaying that they don’t like itin the UK. The retailers I think will, you know,try to dowhatever they can to either avoid itor offset it, but I think it’s going to bea fact oflife across theboard. Sowe’re optimistic.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And, yeah,you always getpushed back. But atthe end of the day you either you get itor you don’t and you getsome degree of realization. When you think about that, I mean, what gives youoptimism that you’ll getthe level ofincreases you’re thinking about and what sort of timing are you thinking about?
Robert Sands: Well, what givesus the optimismis I truly believe it’s going to beacross theboard, not only inbeverage alcohol but ina lot ofother sectors, and therefore it’s sort of, if everybody’s doing it I think it’s going to happen. Andthen, yeah, you getpushed back, but we control our pricing to theretailers, soit’s fundamentally our decision and we’ll dowhat we have to doin thatregard. In the meantime we’re working with ourretailers very closely. We continue to support our brands very well. If youlook at UK, Nielsen’s,as I mentioned inmy talk, we’re outperforming themarket. Themarket actually is very healthy from avolume perspective and consumer demand inthe end isgoing to drive thereaction to thenecessity to increase prices, which, as I said, is pretty much an across the board thing at this point. 
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And thenlast, I know it’s tough, but I think there’s aduty increase coming inMarch in the UK. I don’t believe we know the magnitude. But can you talk a little bit about how you factor thatinto your thinking and what you’re hearing from retailers on that or is it just too soon to say?
Robert Sands: Yeah. Bob talkedabout that alittle bit, but basically repeating what Bob said, first of all, there will be aduty increase inMarch. We donot know exactly what themagnitude of that duty increase will be. We believe that we’ve put in place plans to cover just about anyscenario that can occur inthat regard. And we expect without commenting on the specifics related to ’09 that we’ll be able to act accordingly with the duty increase so that it doesn’t hurt us further.
Mark Swartzberg – Stifel Nicolaus: Great. Thankyou, Rob. Thanks, Bob.
Operator: Thank you. Ournext question is coming from Jonathan Feeney with Wachovia. Please go ahead.
Brian Scudieri – Wachovia Securities: This is actuallyBrian Scudieri infor John Feeney. Good morning.
Robert Sands: Hi, Brian.
Brian Scudieri – Wachovia Securities: How are you? I guess my first question isaddressed to Bob. What was thesingle biggest surprise infree cash flowthis quarter and, I guess, why did theanticipated working capital growth not really materialize?
Robert Ryder: Well, I don’tknow if I’d put theword ‘surprise’ around free cash flow. We wanted to really wait until the third quarter ended to really get areal hard look atwhat’s been happening for thefull year, but we’ve been doing better than prior year in cash flow pretty much all year long. But you know, there wasno negative anything inworking capital. Itwas allpositive. And I mean, mostly if you just dial down the cash flow statement year to date, accountsreceivable was positive mostly due to sales timing and inventory was positive,and this will carry through for thefull year. Theinventory positive is mostly because of theharvest inUK and inAustralia. You had some sort of negative timing on accounts payable, but that’s– Australia and theUS. Sorry. Thenegative timing inaccounts payable for thequarter, that will reverse as we getto the fullyear. I think our cash tax ratetiming, that will bepermanent for thefull year. As will our favourable capital spending versus prior years.
Brian Scudieri – Wachovia Securities: Okay. Great. AndI guess amore broad question for Rob maybe. Have you seen any signs of bottoming in theUK and Australia on acategory level?
Robert Sands: You know, as I’dsaid, when you saybottoming, especially as we talked about theUK, bottoms arevery healthy. Theissues have been more of amarkets issue and I think that as we’ve discussed, although it is somewhat unpredictable, and againwe’re not giving guidance, but you know, I guess it would, I would say that it appears to be bottoming.
Brian Scudieri – Wachovia Securities: And I knowlastly this might bea toughnumber to getto, but maybe could you estimate across thecountry your on premise, off premise and consumption mix? Is that possible?
Robert Sands: No. Not really.Across thewhole company on aworld-wide basis?
Brian Scudieri – Wachovia Securities: M-hm.
Robert Sands: No. But I would say on the higher side of 50% for off premiseand under 50% for on premise. You know, I don’t know, 60/40, 70/30. We reallydon’t track those numbers very specifically. Itfluctuates market by market and brand by brand. It’s not really a relevant number. But more off premisethan on premise. 
Brian Scudieri – Wachovia Securities: Okay. Great.Thanks for your time.
Operator: Thank you. Ourfinal question is coming from Alec Patterson with RCM. Please go ahead.
Alec Patterson – RCM: Yeah, justquickly anupdate on thematerial costs outlook here. Glass inparticular. And then I just wanted to geta read on the ACB on Clos du Bois. Where does it stand? Is it nearly fully distributed or do you guys have a lot of opportunity there still?
Robert Sands: To your firstquestion, you know, glass as we’ve indicated previously, glass costs continueto escalate ingeneral. But that’s been completely taken into account in everything that we’ve told you so it’s just something that we, likeeverybody else, hasto deal with.  As to Clos duBois distribution, Clos du Bois is ahighly distributed brand. Meaning, it’s got very good and high levels ofdistribution. Soyeah, I wouldn’t saythat theopportunity is inthe US, let me put it this way, is in gaining distribution. It is growing, as I said, in the18% range inIRI channels, sotheopportunity is to continue to grow, continue to take advantage and to drivethat growth inthemarketplace. Now, distribution internationally is an opportunity, they would have hadlittle to no distribution outside theUnited States, for allintents and purposes. With our roots to markets around the world we should be able to take advantage of that todrive distribution outside its coremarket of theUnited States.
Alec Patterson – RCM: Okay. That’sclear. And just lastly, Rob. Thepricing trend on theown label product lines inthe UKretailers, what areyou seeing there? Any sort of sense that their starting to reflect what grapecosts may look like down theroad?
Robert Sands: As I said,pricing continues to remain competitive atthe retaillevel driven by themultiple, thechains. We’renot seeing atthis stage significant price movement, but there is no doubt that as it relates to Australian bulk wine that the market has moved dramatically. The retailers are going to have cost of goods sold if not supply issueson Australian bulk. Theretailers aregoing to suffer thesame duty increase inMarch as everybody else. Sothey’re going to have theissue of whether to absorb that or not and typically retailers don’t absorbthose kind of things. Sowe’ll see. Stay tuned. 
Alec Patterson – RCM: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time I’d like to turn the floor over to Rob Sands for anyfinal remarks.
Robert Sands: Well, thank you,everyone, for joining our call today. I’m very pleased about the way the year is shaping up and our progress in implementing our strategy. Just tosummarize, during thethird quarter we completed theacquisition of Fortune Brands’ premium wine business. We are executing the integration plan for our US winebusiness. We’re rationalizing our portfolio of value wines and focusing more onour premium and super premium plus portfolios. We’ve delivered very strong cashflowperformance year to date and increased our free cash flow guidance as a result and we are driving marketplace initiativeswhich will help us generate growth from our portfolio of products. Thanks again foryour participation and during our next quarterly conference call we willprovide guidance for thefiscal year 2009. In addition,we’re planning aninvestor day inNew York for late May, early June, sokeep that inmind asyou’re planning your calendars and of course we’ll give you a specific time frame on that shortly, so stay tuned for those details. Again, thank youvery much, everybody, and have agood rest of your day.
Operator: Thank you. Thatdoes conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Alfa and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin your conference.
Patty Yahn-Urlaub - Vice President of Investor Relations: Thank you, Alfa. Good morning everyone and welcome to Constellation's second quarter fiscal year 2008 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. By now you should have had an opportunity to read our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. This conference call is intended to complement the release. During the call, we will discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic, and constant currency basis. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com under the Investors section. These reconciliations include explanations as to why management uses the non-GAAP financial measures and why management believes they are useful to investors. Discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results, excluding acquisition-related costs, restructuring and related charges, and unusual items. We will also discuss organic net sales information, which is defined in the news release and constant currency net sales information, which excludes the impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuation. Please be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings. Thank you, and now I would like turn the call over to Rob.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: : Thanks Patty and good morning everybody. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's second quarter. Before we get started, I want to officially welcome Mark Zupan to Constellation's Board of Directors. Mark is currently Dean of the Simon Graduate School of Business at the University of Rochester. His previous teaching assignments included Harvard, Dartmouth, USC and the University of Arizona. Mark has a Bachelor's degree from Harvard and a Ph. D. in Economics from MIT and I am really looking forward to working with Mark. And now I would like to discuss our financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2008. We're currently at the halfway mark for the year and are pleased with our progress-to-date which I believe provides the momentum required to achieve our full year goals. As anticipated, results for the quarter were impacted by a continuing competitive marketplace in the U. K. and Australia and our initiative to reduce distributor wine inventories in the U. S. As of the end of the second quarter, we estimate that the total sales impact for the distributor inventory reduction program was approximately $110 million, which was less than our initial estimate. Despite the lower sales impact, the EPS impact was $0.15, which was at the low end of our targeted range of 15% to 20%, as the mix of reduced distributor inventories was of higher margin premium products than we originally anticipated. This program is now substantially complete, as we are within the range of our goal in terms of targeted average number of days in distributor inventories. From a market perspective, the momentum continues around our wine premiumization efforts with solid marketplace sales growth contributed during the quarter by brands such as Woodbridge, Nobilo and Estancia as reported in recent U. S. IRI data. I also want to take this opportunity to provide an update relating to the U. S. grape harvest which is underway as we speak and is expected to continue through the end of October. While we expect this year's harvest to produce high quality output due to a mild dry growing season, we are estimating that the 2007 U. S. industry harvest may potentially decline in the mid-single digit range from last year's harvest. As it appears that overall pricing for grapes is moving up a bit reflecting a decrease in yields and tightening supply for key varietals such as Pinot Noir, Pinot Grigio and Chardonnay with fairly stable prices for generic wine varietals. Overall the U. S. wine market is very healthy and indications are that overall supply and demand should generally remain in balance. Our Canadian wine business posted an excellent quarter. Jackson-Triggs, the number one brand in Canada posted double-digit volume and sales growth, partially as a result of strong sales across Canada of the Jackson-Triggs Esprit wine which is our Olympic co-branded product launched in June. We also released the 2006 vintage for our Inniskillin Icewine which we believe ranks as one of the best ice wine vintages we've have ever seen. Turning to the U. K., the market conditions in the U. K. have not changed significantly during the quarter. As you know the 2007 Australia grape harvest came in approximately 30% lower than the 2006 grape crush. Severe drought conditions continue to affect the area with the key wine producing regions of Australia currently experiencing rainfall levels that have been less than 50% of normal. As I mentioned in the first quarter, these conditions are expected to reduce the output of the 2008 harvest, although we can't be specific on the magnitude of the reduction at this time, as the rainy season in Australia will continue through late October. Due to the lower harvest in 2007, the Australian bulk wine market has begun to dry up. There is currently limited availability of bulk wine for production of low cost private label Australian wines selling in the U. K. However, U.K. market pricing has not changed significantly as the wine market overall remains quite competitive. Despite challenging market conditions in the U. K., we continue to increase marketing support behind our premium wine brands. We are focused on improving our go market model and are working to improve our operating efficiencies. Although we remain cautious, we believe the tightening Australian wine supply and some indication of trading-up activity in the U. K. marketplace are positive trends. The Matthew Clark joint venture with Punch Taverns which provides wholesale services to the U. K. on-premise channel continues to progress and perform within expectations despite the U. K.'s rainiest summer weather conditions in recent memory and the implementation of a smoking ban during the quarter. In the Spirits segment, the strong marketplace momentum from SVEDKA Vodka continues with the posting of strong double-digit growth year-to-date. From an operational transition perspective, SVEDKA integration is essentially complete. We are beginning to build on the strength of the brand with enhanced distribution capabilities through national accounts and the export channel. And we are capitalizing on and channeling our strength with retailers in the wine channels to benefit our spirits business. The base spirits business is continuing to benefit from the premiumization trend occurring in the market and are focused on building our premium investment in priority growth brands including 1792 Ridgemont Reserve bourbon, the 99 Schnapps family, Meukow Cognac and recently launched new products. Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. During the quarter, we were able to bring distributor inventories more into balance after working through challenges resulting from marketplace conditions prior to the formation of Crown. From a market perspective, Crown implemented a price increase for its Modelo beer portfolio earlier this year. As is typical with the price increase, we continue to experience a short-term retraction in imported beer volumes in the IRI channel. One that correlates very closely with the volume trends we experienced when we implemented a similar price increase in 2004. At that time, the negative volume trends reversed gradually over a number of months, and we expect that trend to repeat itself going forward. Crown maintains that this strategic pricing initiative is the right long-term decision for the Modelo portfolio of brands, despite a competitive market in the short term. Lastly, some of you may be aware that there is an ongoing tight supply of glass bottles on an industry wide basis due to various glass industry factors as well as continued strong wine and spirits industry growth resulting in decreased capacity worldwide. Although, we are experiencing some impact from this situation, it has been fully contemplated in our full year EPS guidance. In closing, we continue to execute on our strategy despite headwinds from marketplace dynamics and business initiatives. We are entering our strongest seasonal period and are well positioned to achieve our goals for next year. Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial review of the quarter. Bob?
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Rob. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Similar to our first quarter, in the second quarter we had several items which impacted the comparability of results including the Svedka acquisition, the Crown and Matthew Clark wholesale joint ventures and our new shift to reduce distributor inventories in the U. S. In general, I am pleased with our results for the quarter as we substantially completed our distributor inventory reduction initiatives, continued efforts to better position our U. K. and Australian businesses, improved performance and delivered solid cash flow which helped us reduce our debt by more than $200 million from first quarter levels. I would like start with a review of our P&L for the quarter where my comments will focus on comparable basis financial results. Commentary for net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Let's take a look at our net sales line. As you can see from our new release on page 13, our consolidated net sales decreased 39% reflecting a 1% benefit from the Svedka acquisition which was more than offset by the move of the U. S. imported beers to the Crown Imports joint venture and the U. K. wholesale business, the Matthew Clark joint venture. As previously discussed, these joint ventures follow equity accounting and are not reflected on the consolidated net sales line. We experienced a 1% decrease in consolidated organic net sales for the quarter which was primarily driven by our efforts to reduce distributor wine inventories in the U. S., which is now substantially complete. After excluding an estimated $110 million of net sales impact for this initiative for the first half of the year, we estimate that organic net sales growth would have been in line with our long-term target of mid single digits. We estimate that the EPS impact for this program during the first half of the year was approximately $0.15. Despite the lower than anticipated sales impact, the estimated EPS impact came in at the low end of our previous guided range. As Rob said, this was mostly due to greater destocking of higher margin premium products. Sprits net sales increased 25% due to the acquisition of Svedka and an 11% increase in organic net sales driven by higher average selling prices and volume gains. We are quite happy with Svedka as it continued to perform within our expectations and generated strong growth over the first half of the year. Worldwide branded wine net sales decreased 1%. This reflects the benefit of reporting sales of our wines, the Matthew Clark joint venture which were previously sold through our U. K. wholesale business offset by a 3% decrease in organic net sales. In our presentation of branded wine organic sales growth, we have added back $15 million of U. K. branded wine net sales in Q2 fiscal 2007, previously sold through the 100% owned U. K. wholesale business. We feel this approach provided a better reflection of organic sales performance. The add-back for Q1 fiscal 2007 totaled $7 million and is included in the year-to-date data presented. Turning our attention to branded wine geographic net sales on page 12 of the release, you will see branded wine net sales for North America decreased 4% as strong growth in Canada was more than offset by the impact of our efforts to reduce U. S. distributor wine inventories. For Europe, branded wine organic net sales increased 4%, reflecting increased sales of popular priced wine in mainland Europe and a slight increase in sales in the U. K. Our Australian, New Zealand branded wine organic net sales decreased 7%. Our New Zealand portfolio continues to perform well but the markets in the U. K. and Australia remain highly competitive with ongoing pricing pressures. Now we will look at our profits for the quarter on a comparable basis using information presented on page 14 of the news release. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 35.2%, up 5.4 percentage points. This primarily reflects the benefits of shifting the lower margin U. K. wholesale and imported beer businesses to joint venture structures subject to equity accounting, somewhat offset by a temporary mix shift in the U. S. due to the distributor wine inventory reduction and lower margins for U. K. branded wine. Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 21.2% of net sales compared with 13.1% a year ago. This increase was primarily due to moving the imported beer and U. K. wholesale businesses to joint venture structures, the de-leveraging impact of the distributor inventory reductions in the U. S., higher brand marketing support for branded wine in the U. K. and U. S., and increased stock compensation expense. Consolidated operating income decreased to $125 million from $237 million for the prior year quarter. This change was primarily driven by the factors already mentioned, combined with reporting $79 million of equity earnings for the Crown JV compared to the second quarter last year when $74 million of earnings for imported beer business was included in operating income. This year-over-year increase in beer business profitability reflects increased pricing and the economic benefits of having a national platform for the Modelo portfolio. Now I would like to turn to our segment operating income results which are reflected on page 11 of the release. Wine segment operating income decreased $39 million to $125 million. This was primarily due to the lower net sales associated with the efforts to reduce U. S. distributor inventories and U. K. and Australian business performance, partially offset by an increase in profits from our Canadian business. For the Spirits segment, operating income increased $3 million, primarily due to the contribution from Svedka and higher sales from the base business, offset somewhat by higher material costs. For the quarter, corporate and other expenses totaled $21 million compared with $18 million for the prior year. The increase includes additional stock compensation expense and costs to support the growth of the company. Moving back to page 14, interest expense for the quarter was $87 million, up 20% over last year. The increase primarily reflects the incremental interest from funding the Svedka acquisition and $500 million of share repurchase. At the end of August, our debt totaled $4.7 billion, a decrease of more than $200 million from the Q1 level. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $2.4 billion of bank debt and $2.3 billion of fixed term and other debt. With interest rate swaps that are in place through to the end of fiscal 2010, approximately 70% of our debt is effectively fixed rate. We had approximately $850 million of revolving credit available under our senior facility at the end of Q2. This, combined with our strong capital base and free cash flow generation ability, provides flexibility to fund further growth. Our comparable basis tax rate for the quarter came in at 34.7% versus 36.9% last year. This rate was somewhat lower than our previously anticipated rate for the quarter primarily due to favorable legislative changes in various state and foreign tax jurisdictions. As a result, we now expect our comparable basis tax rate for fiscal 2008 to approximate 37% versus our previous guidance of 38%. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding totaled 219 million compared to 240 million last year reflecting the benefit from our share repurchase during this year. During the second quarter, the company received an additional 933,000 shares under the accelerated share repurchase transaction announced in May. We were not required to make any additional cash payment in connection with receipt of these shares which completed this transaction. For the first half of '08, the company purchased 21.3 million shares of its Class A common stock through a combination of open market repurchases and an accelerated share repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $500 million or an average of $23.44 per share. Due to the main factors just mentioned, diluted EPS decreased to $0.35 versus $0.43 last year. Now let's turn to cash flow on page 10. For purposes of this discussion free cash flow is defined as net cash flow provide by operating activities less CapEx. For the first six months of fiscal '08, we generated $130 million... $131 million of free cash flow versus a $22 million usage in the prior year. The year-over-year increase reflects a lower cash use for net working capital during the first half of fiscal '08 due in part from lower net sales and accounts receivable associated with the U. S. distributor inventory reduction. In addition, CapEx totaled $47 million for the first six months versus $103 million last year which included expenditures for our New Zealand vineyard expansion. Our free cash flow guidance for the year remains unchanged at $160 million to $180 million. As in previous years, in Q3 we fund the North American harvest activities and build working capital to meet seasonal business demand. Q4 is expected to provide strong cash flow generation which has been the case historically. Now let's summarize Q2 and discuss our full year guidance. From an earnings perspective, we are pleased with our results. Excluding the expected positive and negative impacts on our results from our various strategic initiatives, we believe that net sales growth through the first half of the year is in line with our long-term stated goals. We will continue to closely monitor the Australian harvest dynamics and the potential marketplace impacts. The U. K. market remains a difficult environment but what we believe we're making progress with the initiatives we have in place designed to improve future performance. Moving to our P&L expectations for the full year 2008, we're revising our comparable basis diluted EPS outlook to $1.34 to $1.42. This is from our previous range of $1.30 to $1.40. The increase reflects the benefit of the anticipated lower tax rate I mentioned earlier. This guidance excludes the acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring-related charges and unusual items, which are detailed on page 16 of the news release. Additional assumptions for our full year fiscal 2008 guideline are outlined on page 4 of the release. Before we take your questions, I want to make you aware that we have recently filed a preliminary proxy statement relating to special stockholders meeting, and I would like to briefly frame in this activity for you. The meeting has been called in response to a situation created by recent changes in U. S. tax laws. Under these new rules, the dividend rights of our Class A common stock could potentially create additional income tax expense and accelerate the timing of tax expense for stock option recipients in the U. S. These changes would significantly reduce the benefit that actual recipients receive without reducing costs associated with the option program. In response to this situation, we have proposed to create a new class of common stock and amend our long-term stock incentive plan to permit granting of awards with respect the new class of stock to preserve the tax treatment of stock option that was applicable prior to the new rules. These actions require shareholder approval. Finally, I want to emphasize that these proposed actions will not affect the underlying economic of the company's stock option program and will not increase the aggregate number of shares available for granting awards under the stock incentive plan. With that, we are happy to take your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Bonnie Herzog of Citi Investments. Please go ahead.
Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney: Good morning everyone.
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney: I just had a few quick questions. I guess first of all given the Australian grape supply issue that we are all very well aware of and you discussed. I'd be curious to hear how much of your supply has grown by company-owned vineyards versus how much do you actually purchase on the open markets? Hello.
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good question, Bonnie.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Bonnie, the vast majority of what we... of our grape supply in Australia is purchased on the open market.
Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney: It is open. That's what I... okay. Just wanted to verify that.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Open but under contract.
Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney: Okay, and how long are the contracts?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: They vary...
Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney: Vary...
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: In some cases, they are relatively long term.
Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney: Okay. Long term meaning 3 years 5?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Multiple years.
Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney: All right. And then just turning over to your beer business. I was just curious if you could just provide a little bit more color on how you think it performed overall this quarter. And I am curious if the disruptions to the East Coast business have been resolved in your view and also trying to understand the performance in the East Coast versus the West Coast, whichever metric you would like to share with us, let it be volume pricing, income, that will be helpful.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I think that in general, while the beer business has performed in accordance with our expectations, as you know we took a price increase at the beginning of the year, what we've seen as a result of that is very much in line with exactly what we've seen when we take in price increases. So there's really nothing different there than what we would have expected to occur. And as I said in my talk we expect to see that to start to rebound. As we also have mentioned previously, there were some high inventories when we took over the East and therefore during the first half we have now brought those inventories back into line. And then with respect to your question about East versus West...
Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney: Right.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think we are seeing some very positive trends in the short term, the last reporting periods for IRI and things to that effect... in the East in particular. So we are optimistic about how we're performing in that regard.
Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney: Okay, good. And then just a quick final question just in terms of the currency, the translation, helping your earnings this quarter. Can you quantify that in terms of the impact to your EPS?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes we... it's not significant Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney: Okay.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: We actually hedge most of that away.
Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney: All right. But I was under the impression, I am sorry, that impacted your top line by several percentage points?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: It's about two percentage points.
Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney: Okay.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think if you know... if you go through some of the footnotes in the press release...
Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney: Thank you.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think that works out.
Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney: All right, I appreciate your time.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Lauren Torres of HSBC. Please go ahead.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: Good morning. Just a quick clarification, First Rob, you mentioned that you substantially completed the reduction, the inventory reduction in the quarter. By the word substantially, I guess it does assume or allow us to assume there is still more to come. And if you could give us a sense... if there is how much, is more to come?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, the reason we used the word substantially is because there always can be some fluctuations in the short term in distributor inventory. For your purposes, I think you should consider it complete and there... any changes in distributor inventory which as I said really shouldn't be anything significant are fully taken into account in the guidance that we've given you.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: And that's why you are giving us that $0.15 number, kind of stick with that and that's what...
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: The $0.15 is where we've ended up with the distributor inventory reduction, that's what you should stick with, exactly.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: Okay and I guess to a question for Bob. In the quarter, it does look like you had some good free cash flow growth. I am just wondering why maybe... I maybe, you are not getting a bit more optimistic on guidance for the full year?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes it's a good question and basically, we are pretty happy with our free cash generation in the first half. But from the cash flow perspective, we are so early in the year. I mean last year we were negative at this point. And as we entered the back half for the year, especially the third quarter, the inventory distribution program is behind us, and we expect to build up some decent working capital in the back half for the year. So I would say we are cautiously optimistic on cash flow but not optimistic enough to change the guidance right now.
Lauren Torres - HSBC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tim Ramey of D. A Davidson, please go ahead.
Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. : Good morning. A couple of follow ups. One on the hedging expense. Where exactly are you booking that... has that pushed down to segment operating income?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. All the hedging, I think is booked down. It is pushed down to the operating income. So it's sort of invisible to you guys. I mean, if you look at the statements, I might have misstated the number a little bit but I think in the wine segments ForEx helped us about 4% on net sales. Right because that's all in the... in our net sales breakout in the background. So when we hedge translation, we are hedging the EBIT impact of it, not in that net sales impact of.
Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. : Got it. And on the inventory reduction program, why did it end up being less, end up being smaller than originally forecast? Was that due to strong consumer movement or did you just kind of back away from the program a bit, what changed?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Tim, it was really a mix impact. The mix of the reduced inventory was skewed towards the higher margin products and therefore the sales impact was lower than expected. But the earnings impact was within the range that we specified, and we accomplished in general the goal that we were trying to accomplish in terms of what we took out. So it was really the sales and the sales was a function of the mix being towards lower volume, higher margin items.
Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. : Okay. And I think you mentioned that Svedka was running at double digits. Do you have a current case sales run rate that you could share? Or what it's actually done in case sales year-over-year in terms of percent change?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: First half of the year, it's been running very much in accordance with our expectations, very high double digits in the 50 percentage type growth rate. And it's a great brand, and it's performing exactly as we'd like it to be. We're extremely happy with it.
Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. : Okay. And any other wine brands that you would highlight in terms of scan [ph] the data that are either particularly bad or particularly good?
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well there is nothing particularly bad, but...
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Our premium portfolio continues to perform well. We continue to see very strong... I should say strong growth in major brands like Robert Mondavi private selection, Toasted Head, Rex Goliath. We are very pleased with our growth. We have to remember that our premium wine portfolio is a very large portfolio. We are the largest and we look for strong growth in that portfolio, and we are getting it.
Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. : Sounds good. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Hi everyone. At first just in terms of the depletion numbers are you wiling to give us the depletion numbers for U. S. wine and the Crown Imports?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: We don't normally talk depletions. With Crown, we said that we did reduce some distributor inventories throughout the first half. We brought those down. That's really the only relevant news relative to depletions. In general, our depletions and shipments are basically equal, so it's really not important to talk about depletions independently unless there's something to highlight. That's how we have discussed this in the past.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: So, if we go back to your comment about the organic net sales in the first half being up in line with your long-term guidance excluding the impact of distributor inventory situation in the U. S. We take that and thank that its depletions are up in that range as well.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then secondly, I just wanted to sort of broadly look at the global wine supply situation. Obviously we are hearing that the Australian harvest is likely to come in much below last year's harvest. It looks like the U. S. is going to be down this year as well. If you sort of look out... kind of looking at the global wine situation, are we... do you think we are entering a point where the supply is becoming tighter and that really creates a more conducive pricing environment for your wines and sort of what's the implication from a pricing standpoint as you look in the U. S. wine market and the U. K. wine market?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes I think that in answer to your question, we certainly see supplies around the world beginning to tighten, and there has been quite a bit of press about precisely what you are suggesting that we might be turning from global over supply to global under supply. I will say that having been in this industry for many, many years, those exact turning points are extremely difficult to predict, but certainly some of those indications are there. And then to your sort of second point in that regard, if in fact, we're at one of those inflection points, or moving into one of those inflection points, that should be a positive trend, that should be positive as it relates to pricing trends. Again, we are not predicting anything at this stage relative to our business specifically. But the kind of things that you are talking about could very well be the case on a macro basis. So, everything as I said would be a positive trend.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: At what point would you be willing to, sort of think that we are at that inflection point? Is it when the Australian harvest does indeed come in significantly below last year's number and the U. S. is also short? Do you have to see more balanced situation coming out of Chile and other markets around the world, sort of what are kind of the milestones that we should be looking out?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think that as you said that the Southern Hemisphere harvest coming up and then the next Northern Hemisphere harvest at the end of next summer that should give us some better indications of exactly where we are at. Remember as I said this is a very big macro trend, it's not measured in any particular instant and time. You can't make gross overstatements about it based on one harvest or another harvest. It's going to take a few harvests and it should become more evident as I said, after the next two Northern and Southern Hemisphere harvests.
Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you.
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Leach of Neuberger Berman. Please go ahead.
William Leach - Neuberger Berman: Hi good morning. Maybe you said it but can you tell us exactly how much the beer volume was down at Crown and how much you raised prices?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, I don't think that we did... that we did say that.
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes I think if you... you can get that off it right if you look but remember that's just sort of microcosmic in total. You will see sales growth ahead of volume growth.
William Leach - Neuberger Berman: Okay. Can you just tell us the number?
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I don't remember it off the top of my head.
William Leach - Neuberger Berman: I mean was it like mid single digits, I mean?
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think that's close to right, it was around mid-single digit price increase.
William Leach - Neuberger Berman: And the volume was down mid single digit too?
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I don't remember the volume frankly. I think it was lower, it wasn't down that low.
William Leach - Neuberger Berman: So their revenues were actually up?
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's probably down low single digits.
William Leach - Neuberger Berman: Okay.
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And asRob said there is a pattern to this, at least in the beer business as to how the volume growth wanes after you take a price increase and how it gradually comes back over time as retailers and consumers suggest to it.
William Leach - Neuberger Berman: But we can say that volume was down low single digits in the quarter?
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And again, as you know we don't consolidate Crown. So that doesn't flow through our financials.
William Leach - Neuberger Berman: Right. But that obviously impacts your equity income. So, we need to know how it helps the businesses.
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. I just don't remember the volume thing, if you look at the... and again, it's year-over-year, because last year we were just West Coast, we didn't have complete visibility into what the East Coast volumes did last year, East Coast sales did last year. So, unfortunately it's not a real roadmap.
William Leach - Neuberger Berman: Okay. And looks like the stock compensation expenses are about $0.03 a share. Is that right?
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That seems high to me. Bill, as you know, what we did is, we changed the option program and this will be featuring into our P&L over four years. And this is the second of fourth year, second of four years that you will see increased stock compensation expense and I think it was closer to a penny.
William Leach - Neuberger Berman: Are you sure that, from 6 months it's almost $17 million pre-tax versus $7.8 million last year, it's a big increase?
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's year-to-date numbers. Are you talking the quarter or you...
William Leach - Neuberger Berman: Yes, well. I like to know the quarter.
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The quarter is about a penny.
William Leach - Neuberger Berman: A penny, okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jonathan Feeney of Wachovia Securities. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is actually, Brian Skedery [ph] on behalf of Jon Feeney. In regards to distributor inventory reduction, I was wondering if you could give us any color on what types of safeguards and/or kind of consumer data that you have put in place to prevent this problem from like recurring in the future.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, you know there is really not a need for any safeguards. The key is over a longer range period that shipments and depletion should be somewhat equal and that's largely in our control. So we monitor that, and we don't expect to take... as I said the medium term or long term distributor inventory is up, now there are fluctuations from time to time. As we have said in the past, you might see for instance, in the quarter leading up to a holiday season, it's necessary to build some inventories because we have sales growth during those periods and then in periods that are not as fast, you might see some inventories going down but generally depletions and shipments are equal.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And just one more on the joint venture front.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sorry. Sorry I am sorry, what was that?
Unidentified Analyst: That's all right. Just one more on the joint venture front particularly Matthew Clark wholesale sale business you know. How is that working out? I mean essentially you have partnered with a customer. So does that close the door to others or like does that particularly... does that particular JV like change the go to market any way that limits you?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Number one, they were not a big customer. And the direct answer to your question is, no it really doesn't limit us. That marketplace is... let me just put it a little differently. We sell to thousands and thousands... tens of thousands of different outlets. What they buy is largely a function of price and service and they are not particularly concerned with corporate ownership structures. They are concerned as I said with the price and the service they are getting for the products that they are purchasing. So it's really not a factor in dealing with our tens and tens of thousands of customers around the country.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Christine Farkas of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. I would like to start with spirits trends if I could. We've heard some anecdotal evidence that perhaps the low end of the market is getting hurt but the high end of course is trading up. Your organic growth is pretty strong. Can you just give me a little bit of sense of mix and what's growing and what isn't?
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes this is Bob. I would say for the quarter, we experienced some positive mix shift. So what you are saying is pretty correct that the low-end of the market is not going as fast as the upper end of the market and our higher price-per-bottle brands which also carry higher profits with them, are growing faster than the lower price-per-bottle brands, in the wine business.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: But on that given your organic growth up 11%, on how much of your portfolio would you consider low end versus high end now?
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's probably about 50:50.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay. That means pretty strong growth at the high end, I guess with some of the innovation that you've out there?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes this is Rob. It's actually a little bit less than that. It's somewhat less than that, but we do have very strong growth in the high end, and that is causing the mix shift.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay great. Moving to Canada, good growth in that market. I am just wondering, and perhaps this might be looking a little bit over analytical at the market, but with the strong dollar, are there fewer imports going into Canada that might perhaps allow your domestic brands to thrive even more? Is there any of that going on in Canada?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Actually the imports business in Canada is very strong, as well as the domestic business and remember imports into Canada are coming from a lot of different places like Australia, like Chile.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Sure.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: And like the U. S. I don't think that we have really seen the... well in general the import business has been strong, and it has not been hurting the domestic. It hasn't been hurting the domestic business, which has also remained strong.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: In particular the premium end of the market what we call VQA, which are entirely produced in Canada products. They also remain very strong. So really both the ends of the market are good.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay. So well that's good, it's not hurting your business. Well your exports from California to Canada, has that gone up?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Our exports. I am sorry what did you say?
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Your exports from California for example into Canada. Does your business benefit based on your strong base in distribution in Canada?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Our exports have been. Fine but remember we export to Canada from a number of our different wine producing regions, like Australia and I'll also point out that Vincor has a strong import business as well as a strong domestic business. So we're really positioned to take advantage of all the positive trends.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Both imports and the domestic.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on Australia again similarly with Australian supplies potentially drying up here and the Australian segment really dominating that $5 to $9 price point. I am wondering if either your forecast or even existing trend so far, would your own brands in the 5 to 9 segment, like a Woodbridge for example be in a better position? Should those supplies just really flow into North America?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I would say the answer to that is yes. Even now I would also say that Woodbridge is performing exceptionally well given that it's a huge brand, it's the biggest brand in the category and segment though we are seeing some good growth for a brand that size. So even without imports being hurt or Australian imports being particularly hurt we're seeing strong Woodbridge growth as we sit here. But clearly what you suggested could be the case as well.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay, that's helpful. And sorry last quick one on SG&A. You mentioned stock compensation up and marketing up in terms of some brand spend but also SG&A higher based on I guess the transition or destocking. Can you quantify how much of that SG&A increase is considered more one time in nature in the quarter?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think that the SG&A increase is due to the change in equity accounting of our major segments of Crown and Matthew Clark. So I think that's what you are really seeing there. It's why SG&A has become a larger percentage of net sales as we eliminated it from the net sales line, the businesses that we are now accounting for in the equity method.
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So I would say that there is not any one-time absolute dollar cost in there, it's just that as a percentage of sales. As Rob said that the geography has changed because we took so many sales out because of the JV accounting.
Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kaumil Gajrawala [ph] of UBS. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. A couple of things. First thing on the distributor inventory issue. Now that you have gone through it, can you talk a little bit about distributor support and investment behind the brands? I remember when you first announced the program, one of the intentions were to create some working capital for the distributor levels that they can support your brands more. And I just wonder if you can give us an update on that.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think that having the intended result, we're working well with our distributors. We are a very large supplier. The distributor inventory reduction has benefited them, and they are very willing to partner with us to continue to build our brands and our portfolios. And that was really the whole idea behind the whole thing. So I think we are very positive in that regard and our partnership remains very strong in that regard.
Unidentified Analyst: And so I think incrementally is the support higher than it was?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, it's a huge, we have thousands and thousands of distributors and it's hard to make that kind of a judgment because it's something that's constantly in flux. And there's all sorts of mix and so on and so forth. But we had... as I said are getting good distributor support against our growth initiatives. So, I think it's working.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks and then on the Crown side, how much are you relying or do you expect the domestic brewers to begin to take some pricing this fall in order to... ticket volumes to start to pick up again at... in the Modelo portfolio?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: We are not relying on anything. We are not privy to what the domestic brewers are going to do and when they are going to do it. There is already anecdotal evidence that there's pricing being taken in the marketplace, reading all the typical trend price and so on and so forth. So, we think that, that's happening which is fairly consistent with the patterns of the past, when the high end takes a pricing, usually the lower end falls after a certain period of time. So, the anecdotal evidence is that's the case.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, got it and then a last thing. You talked about no changes in the business in the U. K. yet your organic number, Europe branded wine seemed to be fairly strong when you adjust the wholesale. So can you talk a little bit what... where the growth is there and where it's coming from?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, well as of in the first half, particularly in the first quarter we had some very strong growth. Little less on the second quarter and it's been coming from mainland Europe. We've been... we're really not over-emphasizing that because a lot of it has come from... some of the growth has come from... I will say lower margin product that we've sold in mainland Europe. So it's not necessarily flowing through to the bottom-line in a big way. So I think that's basically the answer to your question. Volumes in general and our U. K. and Europe business are not... this is a double negative, are not unhealthy. In other words they are healthy but we do... it is a competitive market. There continues to be pricing and margin issues. We continue to work through that, and we are at best cautiously optimistic about the... our recovery plans there.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks operator. Good morning guys. Rob, on this destocking and then couple of financial questions for you Bob. I want to make sure I am piecing the pieces together properly here. It sounds like you are basically saying that at the distributor level you're simply leaving inventory that are higher level than you originally anticipated because you are not in fact seeing a material pickup in depletion rates out of those distributors which might be a very sound business decision. But I am just trying to understand ultimately what drove this $1.10 versus $1.60 or higher.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: No that is not right, Mark. We met our goals at the distributor level. The reason that the dollar sales number is lower than the range that we gave is because of the mix impact towards lower volume, lower volume higher margin products what we had said originally that we were targeting about a 25% to 30% reduction in days. And as we've looked sort of a market by market, distributor by distributor, product by product, we have accomplished those goals. So, we have accomplished the goal that we have set forth.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, but higher... I guess we can move on, but higher margin?
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Based on lower volume, higher margin products, right.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: But lower right. So that means even less absolute volume was taken out of your distributors. But it is what it is. Just in terms of financial items, Bob, I might have missed it but it's... as it relates to fiscal... looking beyond fiscal '08 in the past, you guys have said that you think fiscal '07 has an earnings base you expect to return over the medium to long term to high single digit to low double digit EPS growth. And I might have missed it in your prepared remarks but is that still your view?
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I think that's true. But why you think our remarks are prepared, this is all... this is all unscripted. Yes, we are not obviously we are not talking about next year yet but nothing we see this year would be changing. What we said historically about long term trends in the business is still an extremely healthy category.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. And then lastly just on fiscal '08 as you look at your share count assumptions, you are saying 225 million for the year you had about... you did 219.3 in the quarter. So that seems to... that 225 implies fairly meaningful pickup in the second half.
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think it's a weighted average thing, the way the EPS is calculated. So I think it's done on a year-to-date basis. So you had a higher share count sort of in the front-end of the year.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Right, but I am saying if you take the 219 and the higher number for the first quarter and then if you just take 219 and hold it constant for the balance of the year, you are more like 223 I think for the full year. So that basically implies, you are expecting to go up then again in the second half.
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I thinkit will be mostly just how the option dilution kicks in to the calculation. Because I mean obviously, we are not... we don't plan to issue or buy back any more shares.
Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus: Excellent. Okay, that's what I thought. Thanks very much.
Operator: : Thank you. Our final question is coming from Bryan Spillane of Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Bryan Spillane - Banc of America: Hey good morning everybody.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Bryan.
Bryan Spillane - Banc of America: Just a few points. One, a point of clarification. Are the... that the distributor inventory correction or drawdown for Crown is all... is completed, right? You are not... the Crown is not in a position where they are still de-stocking wholesaler inventories, is that correct?
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Correct.
Bryan Spillane - Banc of America: Okay, and then second
Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And I am not taking into account short-term fluctuations, but in general that's correct.
Bryan Spillane - Banc of America: Okay and then, the second point is, Rob if you could talk a bit about looking into the holidays in the U. K., are your... is your participation in promotions with retailers, so sort of what's on your holiday merchandising calendar this year. Any different than last year and I guess what I am trying to drive at is, you expect that your shelf space, your display space, and the number of promotion activities this year to be on par with, greater than or less than last year.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Well we don't know that until after the holiday unfortunately but a lot of the process of going into the holidays, and it's all about working out our promotional programs with the major retailers. And based on what I am hearing, we are being very successful in getting our holiday promotions locked away, and I am hoping for a better holiday season in that regard than we had last year, which was not necessarily, particularly negative or otherwise, but our portfolio is a good portfolio. The market is not... it's fairly strong, and what I am hearing is that the retailers are favorable towards what we are doing. And so I am looking forward to a good holiday season in terms of promotional activity. So I don't see anything negative in any respect on the horizon in that regard, Bryan.
Bryan Spillane - Banc of America: Okay, great. Thanks guys.
Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Okay. Well thanks for joining our call today. And I would characterize this quarter as one of continued execution toward our goals. We delivered solid cash performance and paid down debt. We substantially completed our U. S. wine distributor inventory reduction program. We are driving marketplace initiatives around the world which will help us drive growth from our portfolio of products. And from a financial perspective, we believe that we are well positioned to achieve our revised full year EPS goal and free cash flow targets. So thanks again everybody for your participation. Our next call is scheduled after the new years. So I am sure everybody will responsibly enjoy some of our excellent products during the upcoming holiday season. And I will talk to you all after that. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.
